5|$|Beverly died on October 11, 2011. Agnew was {{diagnosed}} of <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and died {{at his home}} in Solana Beach, California, on September 29, 2013, while watching football on television. He was survived by his daughter Nancy and son John. He had arranged to be cremated and his ashes interred with Beverly's at the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} his father due to heart {{problems}} at the age of 49 had a lasting effect on Henderson. He was conscious of his own health, and survived a blockage in his own heart that was discovered in 2004. He was diagnosed with <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> in 2009. The disease prevented him from attending 40th anniversary celebrations of the Summit Series in Moscow, but he was responding well to experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial he participated in into 2013.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 2003, after {{enduring}} a twelve-year sickness with <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> Edward W. Said died, at 67 {{years of}} age, in New York City. He was {{survived by his}} wife, Mariam C. Said, his son, Wadie Said, and his daughter, Najla Said. The eulogists included Alexander Cockburn ("A Mighty and Passionate Heart"); Seamus Deane ("A Late Style of Humanism"); Christopher Hitchens ("A Valediction for Edward Said"); Tony Judt ("The Rootless Cosmopolitan"); Michael Wood ("On Edward Said"); and Tariq Ali ("Remembering Edward Said, 1935â€“2003"). In November 2004, in Palestine, Birzeit University renamed their music school the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.|$|E
5000|$|Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are {{strongly}} implicated in some hematological malignancies. BRCA1 mutations are associated acute myelogenous leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia. [...] Mutations of BRCA2 {{are also found}} in many T-cell lymphomas and <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b>|$|R
50|$|Less than 1% of all lymphomas are splenic {{marginal}} zone lymphomas {{and it is}} {{postulated that}} SMZL may represent a large fraction of unclassifiable CD5- <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> The typical patient is {{over the age of}} 50, and gender preference has been described.|$|R
50|$|CD11c {{is a type}} I {{transmembrane protein}} found at high levels on most human {{dendritic}} cells, but also on monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and some B cells that induces cellular activation and helps trigger neutrophil respiratory burst; expressed in hairy cell leukemias, acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, and some B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Leukemia {{is rarely}} {{associated}} with pregnancy, affecting {{only about one}} in 10,000 pregnant women. [...] Treatment for <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> can often be postponed until {{after the end of}} the pregnancy. If treatment is necessary, then giving chemotherapy during the second or third trimesters is less likely to result in pregnancy loss or birth defects than treatment during the first trimester.|$|R
50|$|CD15 mediates {{phagocytosis}} and chemotaxis, {{found on}} neutrophils; expressed {{in patients with}} Hodgkin disease, some B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> acute lymphoblastic leukemias, and most acute nonlymphocytic leukemias. It is also called Lewis x and SSEA-1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen 1) and represents a marker for murine pluripotent stem cells, in which it {{plays an important role}} in adhesion and migration of the cells in the preimplantation embryo. It is synthezised by FUT4 (fucosyltransferase 4) and FUT9.|$|R
25|$|Lenalidomide is {{approved}} in nearly 70 countries, {{in combination with}} dexamethasone {{for the treatment of}} patients with MM who have received at least one prior therapy. Orphan indications include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> and mantle cell lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|Damage to the Bcl-2 gene {{has been}} {{identified}} as a cause of a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, prostate, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and lung cancer, and a possible cause of schizophrenia and autoimmunity. It is also a cause of resistance to cancer treatments.|$|E
25|$|Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is {{sometimes}} considered {{a subset of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> but does not fit neatly into this category. About 80% of affected people are adult men. No cases in children have been reported. HCL is incurable but easily treatable. Survival is 96% to 100% at ten years.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study of}} {{glioblastoma}} multiforme, increased expression of MIAT was linked to increased survival rates. In addition, the glioma cells were found to how significantly down-regulated MIAT. The role of MIAT in <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> {{is very different from}} that of glioblastoma. In certain aggressive cell lines of <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> MIAT is upregulated and depends on the presence of a transcriptional regulator, OCT4. OCT4 serves a positive regulator of MIAT transcription and as of now is the only known regulator. However, analysis of relative concentrations of MIAT and OCT4 have indicated that other regulatory factors are in play.|$|R
40|$|Leukemic {{cells were}} cytologically {{studied in the}} human bone marrow culture by the {{utilization}} of vital staining of Janus green B and neutral red. The minute cellular morphology of various types of leukemia was studied with special reference to their alterations {{in the course of}} the culture. The cytologic deviation of leukemic cells from the corresponding normal blood cells was clarified on monocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia with the blastic crisis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|Leukemia {{is rarely}} {{associated}} with pregnancy, affecting only about 1 in 10,000 pregnant women. How it is handled depends {{primarily on the}} type of leukemia. Nearly all leukemias appearing in pregnant women are acute leukemias. Acute leukemias normally require prompt, aggressive treatment, despite significant risks of pregnancy loss and birth defects, especially if chemotherapy is given during the developmentally sensitive first trimester. Chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones. Treatment for <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> which are rare in pregnant women, can often be postponed until {{after the end of the}} pregnancy.|$|R
25|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL) {{most often}} affects adults {{over the age}} of 55. It {{sometimes}} occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. Two-thirds of affected people are men. The five-year survival rate is 75%. It is incurable, but there are many effective treatments. One subtype is B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a more aggressive disease.|$|E
25|$|In August two {{of three}} {{subjects}} of a pilot study were confirmed to have been cured from <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL). The therapy used genetically modified T cells to attack cells that expressed the CD19 protein to fight the disease. In 2013, the researchers announced that 26 of 59 patients had achieved complete remission and the original patient had remained tumor-free.|$|E
25|$|Leukemias* are {{progressive}} {{proliferation of}} cancerous {{white blood cells}} within the bone marrow, resulting in destruction of the bone marrow and pancytopenia in many cases. Types of leukemia in dogs include acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute monocytic leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia, acute megakaryocytic leukemia, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia,</b> chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic basophilic leukemia, and chronic eosinophilic leukemia (or hypereosinophilic syndrome).|$|E
50|$|All cancers are {{mutations}} in the genomes that cause abnormal cell growth. Determining {{factors that contribute}} to or regulate this excessive growth can potentially lead to preventative, therapeutic treatments of cancer. For example, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> illustrates a region of miRNAs (mir-15 and mir-16) are missing from the genome in the expression of this cancer. While in other cancers, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, expression of miRNA sequences are amplified. This leads to the suggestion that many miRNA have regulatory sequences involved in cancer. If those were to be better regulated, potentially through AMOs, perhaps the onset and progression of cancer could be regulated.|$|R

40|$|The TCL 1 {{oncogene}} {{on human}} chromosome 14 q 32. 1 {{is involved in}} the development of T cell leukemia in humans. These leukemias are classified either as T prolymphocytic leukemias, which occur very late in life, or as T <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias,</b> which often arise in patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT) at a young age. The TCL 1 oncogene is activated in these leukemias by juxtaposition to the Î± or Î² locus of the T cell receptor, caused by chromosomal translocations t(14 : 14) (q 11 :q 32), t(7 : 14) (q 35 :q 32), or by inversions inv(14) (q 11 :q 32). To show that transcriptional alteration of TCL 1 is causally involved in the generation of T cell neoplasia we have generated transgenic mice that carry the TCL 1 gene under the transcriptional control of the p 56 lck promoter element. The lck-TCL 1 transgenic mice developed mature T cell leukemias after a long latency period. Younger mice presented preleukemic T cell expansions expressing TCL 1, and leukemias developed only at an older age. The phenotype of the murine leukemias is CD 4 âˆ’CD 8 +, in contrast to human leukemias, which are predominantly CD 4 +CD 8 âˆ’. These studies demonstrate that transcriptional activation of the TCL 1 protooncogene can cause malignant transformation of T lymphocytes, indicating the role of TCL 1 in the initiation of malignant transformation in T prolymphocytic <b>leukemias</b> and T <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias...</b>|$|R
25|$|Early {{clinical}} failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it {{was still}} largely an experimental technique. These include treatment of retinal diseases Leber's congenital amaurosis and choroideremia, X-linked SCID, ADA-SCID, adrenoleukodystrophy, <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), multiple myeloma, haemophilia, and Parkinson's disease. Between 2013 and April 2014, US companies invested over $600 million in the field.|$|E
25|$|Due to dose-limiting thrombocytopoenia of navitoclax as {{a result}} of Bcl-xL inhibition, Abbvie {{successfully}} developed the highly selective inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199), which inhibits Bcl-2, but not Bcl-xL or Bcl-w. Clinical trials studied the effects of venetoclax, a BH3-mimetic drug designed to block the function of the Bcl-2 protein, on patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL). Good responses have been reported and thrombocytopoenia was no longer observed. A phase 3 trial started in Dec 2015.|$|E
25|$|Ofatumumab is {{a second}} {{generation}} human IgG1 antibody that binds to CD20. It {{is used in the}} treatment of <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL) because the cancerous cells of CLL are usually CD20-expressing B-cells. Unlike rituximab, which binds to a large loop of the CD20 protein, ofatumumab binds to a separate, small loop. This may explain their different characteristics. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab induces complement-dependent cytotoxicity at a lower dose with less immunogenicity.|$|E
50|$|The protein {{has been}} found to be {{differentially}} expressed in some medical conditions and in response to certain cellular signals. For example, decreased c10orf76 expression is observed in patients with <b>chronic</b> B-cell <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Decreased expression is also observed in cells treated with vascular endothelial growth factor.|$|R
40|$|The proliferative {{responses}} of purified leukemic human B cells from nine B cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> to recombinant interleukin 2 (IL- 2), spontaneously, and after preactivation by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) or anti-mu antibodies were studied. Three patterns of response were observed: (a) no response (three cases); (b) a moderate spontaneous response enhanced by anti-mu (one case); (c) a high proliferative response after preactivation by anti-mu and/or SAC (five cases). IL- 2 could also trigger normal B cells, purified from spleen, to proliferative after preactivation by anti-mu or SAC. These {{results provide evidence}} that IL- 2 is a lymphokine that acts physiologically on both B and T cells...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{ultimate}} targets of many signal transduction pathways are nuclear transcription factors, {{the vast majority}} of known protein kinases are cytosolic. Here, we report on a novel human kinase that is present exclusively in the nucleus. Kinase activity is increased upon cellular proliferation and is markedly elevated in patients with acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias.</b> We have identified a human gene that encodes this nuclear kinase and find that it is closely related to Drosophila female sterile homeotic (fsh), a developmental regulator with no known biochemical activity. Collectively, these results suggest that this nuclear kinase is a component of a signal transduction pathway that plays a role in Drosophila development and human growth control...|$|R
25|$|Alemtuzumab (Campeth-1H) is an anti-CD52 humanized IgG1 {{monoclonal}} antibody indicated {{for the treatment}} of fludarabine-refractory <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. CD52 is found on >95% of peripheral blood lymphocytes (both T-cells and B-cells) and monocytes, but its function in lymphocytes is unknown. It binds to CD52 and initiates its cytotoxic effect by complement fixation and ADCC mechanisms. Due to the antibody target (cells of the immune system) common complications of alemtuzumab therapy are infection, toxicity and myelosuppression.|$|E
25|$|Somatic mosaicism {{occurs in}} {{virtually}} all cancer cells, including trisomy 12 in <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL) and trisomy 8 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these forms of mosaic aneuploidy occur through mechanisms distinct from those typically associated with genetic syndromes involving complete or mosaic aneuploidy, such as chromosomal instability (due to mitotic segregation defects in cancer cells). Therefore, the molecular processes that lead to aneuploidy are targets {{for the development of}} cancer drugs. Both resveratrol and aspirin have been found in vivo (in mice) to selectively destroy tetraploid cells that may be precursors of aneuploid cells, and activate AMPK, which may be involved in the process.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{cause of}} leukemia is unknown. Different kinds of leukemia are {{believed}} to have different causes. Both inherited and environmental (non-inherited) factors {{are believed to}} be involved. Risk factors include smoking, ionizing radiation, some chemicals (such as benzene), prior chemotherapy, and Down syndrome. People with a family history of leukemia are also at higher risk. There are four main types of leukemia â€” acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemia</b> (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) â€” {{as well as a number}} of less common types. Leukemias and lymphomas both belong to a broader group of tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid system, known as tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues.|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntratumoral {{heterogeneity}} plays {{a critical}} role in tumor evolution. To define the contribution of DNA methylation to heterogeneity within tumors, we performed genome-scale bisulfite sequencing of 104 primary <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (CLLs). Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{release of}} platelet-activating factor (PAF) was {{assessed}} {{in a series}} of human acute and chronic lymphoid and myeloid leukemias at presentation or in an active phase of the disease. PAF-like material, showing physicochemical properties similar to those of synthetic PAF and of PAF released from IgE-sensitized rabbit basophils, was found in cultures of cells from 5 of 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) (2 of 2 T-ALL and 3 of 4 common ALL) and from 13 of 24 B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> after stimulation with ionophore A 23187 with or without phytohemagglutinin in the presence of acetyl coenzyme A. On the other hand, PAF was released only from 2 of 10 acute myeloblastic leukemias; both of them were of the more mature monoblastic subtype or M 5 according to the French-American-British classification. Cells from all three cases of chronic myeloid leukemia studied were also capable of producing PAF. In eight cases of acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, the in vivo release of PAF was assessed by testing the plasma levels of this mediator. Only in two cases (one ALL and one acute myeloblastic leukemia) could detectable levels of circulating PAF be demonstrated; it is of interest that both of these cases showed clinical and hematological features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. No PAF was documented in the plasma of the five chronic leukemias tested (four B-cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> and one <b>chronic</b> myeloid leukemia). These findings indicate that lymphoid and myeloid leukemic cells have a different capacity of releasing PAF, possibly related to the level of cell differentiation rather than to an intrinsic property of the neoplastic cells. Furthermore, in some cases, an intravascular release of PAF may occur...|$|R
40|$|Micro-RNAs (miR genes) are a {{large family}} of highly conserved noncoding genes thought to be {{involved}} in temporal and tissue-specific gene regulation. MiRs are transcribed as short hairpin precursors (â‰ˆ 70 nt) and are processed into active 21 - to 22 -nt RNAs by Dicer, a ribonuclease that recognizes target mRNAs via base-pairing interactions. Here we show that miR 15 and miR 16 are located at chromosome 13 q 14, a region deleted in more than half of B cell <b>chronic</b> <b>lymphocytic</b> <b>leukemias</b> (B-CLL). Detailed deletion and expression analysis shows that miR 15 and miR 16 are located within a 30 -kb region of loss in CLL, and that both genes are deleted or down-regulated in the majority (â‰ˆ 68 %) of CLL cases...|$|R
