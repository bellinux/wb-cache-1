30|$|The Maxwell {{resistance}} Ra {{could be}} related to the charge transfer resistance of the direct Co deposition. The decline in the first three minutes could be due to the diffusion limitation of the boric acid that forms complexes with Co 2 + ions for an easier deposition. The following linear rise might be attributed to an increased surface coverage of the growing Co nanowires by adsorbed ions impeding the Co deposition. The <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> in Ra after 16  min coincides with the <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> in Rp suggesting that these adsorbed ions might {{be related to}} boric acid, such as e.g. B(OH) 4 −.

The piecewise <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> set function takes distinct constant values in each subdomain of a whole design domain.
