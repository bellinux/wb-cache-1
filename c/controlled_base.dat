Spread spectrum avoids cochannel interference between adjacent cells, since the probability that users in nearby cells use the same spreading code is insignificant. Thus the frequency channel allocation problem is relaxed in cellular networks based on a combination of spread spectrum and FDMA, for example IS95 and 3G systems. Spread spectrum also facilitate that centrally <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> stations dynamically borrow resources from each other depending on the traffic load, simply by increasing the maximum allowed number of simultaneous users in one cell (the maximum allowed interference level from the users in the cell), and decreasing it in an adjacent cell. Users in the overlap between the base station coverage area can be transferred between the cells (called cell-breathing), or the traffic can be regulated by admission control and traffic-shaping.|$|E

The approach to the support of ATM reduces the mobility load on the wired ATM network and is compat-ible with standard signalling protocols. The system is pico-cellular with a large number of base stations. The base stations are designed to be deployed in large numbers each covering a short range with partially overlapping cover-ages. This increases the aggregate throughput and reduces some of the problems specific to a radio physical layer. The MAC layer is optimised to provide efficient use of band-width and support guarantees for ATM traffic classes. An experimental prototype system based on low-cost fixed ATM switches and software <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> stations has been developed and is outlined. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract only. Environmental {{resource}} {{values are}} often obtainable only through stated preference or hypothetical surveys because other nonmarket valuation methods only account {{for part of}} the resource value or are unsuitable. Despite the recent popularity and many advances in discrete choice techniques for nonmarket valuation, the implications of questionnaire structure, namely framing and task complexity, are rarely considered. Participant preferences may not be accurately reflected in stated preference willingness to pay estimates if the results are affected by cognitive or response issues. This paper compares the effects of task complexity on modeling outcomes and WTP estimates for nonmarket goods. Specifically, I examine the consequences of questionnaire length, number of attributes, and number of alternatives on choice experiment responses to a mail questionnaire regarding recreational fishing management of Northwest Atlantic groundfish. By comparing response rates, response types, model parameter estimates, and willingness-to-pay between a <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> survey and different variations on task complexity, this study will discern whether different choice experiment structures induce respondent behaviors that alter response outcomes, and the type and magnitude of such effects...|$|E
40|$|The passive eastern Indian margin {{is rich in}} gas hydrates, as {{inferred}} from the wide-spread occurrences of bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) and recovery of gas hydrate samples from various sites in the Krishna Godavari (KG) and Mahanadi (MN) basins drilled by the Expedition 01 of the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP). The BSRs are often interpreted to mark the thermally <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> of gas hydrate stability zone (BGHSZ). Most of the BSRs exhibit moderate to typically higher amplitudes than those from other seismic reflectors. We estimate the average geothermal gradient of ∼ 40 °C/km and heat flow varying from 23 to 62 mW/m 2 {{in the study area}} utilizing the BSR’s observed on seismic sections. Further we provide the BGHSZ where the BSR is not continuous or disturbed by local tectonics or hidden by sedimentation patterns parallel to the seafloor with a view {{to understand the nature of}} BSR. Since, gas hydrate bearing sediment has higher electrical resistivities than that of the host sediment, we estimate two levels of gas hydrates saturations up to 25...|$|E

40|$|Semi-active resetable {{actuators}} {{can significantly}} improve seismic structural response and customise structural hysteresis loops using novel devices. However, {{no one has}} yet examined their use as base isolators despite recent results that show the hysteretic (force-displacement) response for optimally <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> isolation stiffness is similar to a novel 1 - 3 resetable device response, particularly if including non-ideal, realistic non-linearities encountered when accounting for non-zero reset times and practical friction. Hence, non-linear semi-active resetable devices should be able to optimally base isolate structures by providing non-linearly increasing resistance to excursions and smooth sliding behaviours with friction back towards equilibrium – matching analytical optimal control results that provide significant isolation and reduce isolated structure acceleration responses. This paper presents the non-linear device models and uses them to analyse semi-active isolated structures over 3 suites of 20 probabilistically scaled ground motions. Results are compared to realistic passive isolation systems and show significant isolation that meets or exceeds passive solutions and closely match optimal isolation results presented in the literature. Overall, this study shows that their may be significant application potential for non-linear semi-active devices in structural isolation. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} 'fair' scheduling the resources {{to one of the}} many mobile stations by a centrally <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> station (BS). The BS is the only entity taking decisions in this framework based on truthful information from the mobiles on their radio channel. We study the well-known family of parametric -fair scheduling problems from a gametheoretic perspective in which some of the mobiles may be noncooperative. We first show that if the BS is unaware of the noncooperative behavior from the mobiles, the noncooperative mobiles become successful in snatching the resources from the other cooperative mobiles, resulting in unfair allocations. If the BS is aware of the noncooperative mobiles, a new game arises with BS as an additional player. It can then do better by neglecting the signals from the noncooperative mobiles. The BS, however, becomes successful in eliciting the truthful signals from the mobiles only when it uses additional information (signal statistics). This new policy along with the truthful signals from mobiles forms a Nash Equilibrium (NE) which we call a Truth Revealing Equilibrium. Finally, we propose new iterative algorithms to implement fair scheduling policies that robustify the otherwise non-robust (in presence of noncooperation) fair scheduling algorithms...|$|E
40|$|A wide-spread bottom {{simulating}} reflector (BSR), {{interpreted to}} mark the thermally <b>controlled</b> <b>base</b> of the gas hydrate stability zone, is observed over a close grid of multichannel seismic profiles in the Krishna Godavari Basin of the eastern continental margin of India. The seismic data reveal that gas hydrate occurs in the Krishna Godavari Basin at places where water depths exceed 850 m. The thickness of the gas hydrate stability zone inferred from the BSR ranges up to 250 m. A conductive model {{was used to determine}} geothermal gradients and heat flow. Ground truth for the assessment and constraints on the model were provided by downhole measurements obtained during the National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 01 of India at various sites in the Krishna Godavari Basin. Measured downhole temperature gradients and seafloor-temperatures, sediment thermal conductivities, and seismic velocity are utilized to generate regression functions for these parameters as function of overall water depth. In the first approach the base of gas hydrate stability is predicted from seafloor bathymetry using these regression functions and heat flow and geothermal gradient are calculated. In a second approach the observed BSR depth from the seismic profiles (measured in two-way travel time) is converted into heat flow and geothermal gradient using the same ground-truth data. The geothermal gradient estimated from the BSR varies from 27 to 67 °C/km. Corresponding heat flow values range from 24 to 60 mW/m 2. The geothermal modeling shows a close match of the predicted base of the gas hydrate stability zone with the observed BSR depths...|$|E
