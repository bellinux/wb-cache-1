2500|$|Nests {{are built}} in April or May more than [...] above ground in trees. This height varies {{according}} to habitat, but while nests have been found almost [...] up, most are 2–16m above ground. Presence of mistletoes or vines like <b>common</b> <b>ivy</b> (Hedera helix) on side branches near the trunk (where nests are preferentially built) will make a tree markedly more attractive. Fieldfares (Turdus pilaris) nesting in the vicinity will also increase the desirability of nest sites to great grey shrikes, which moreover often refuse to prey upon these thrushes' nestlings though the opportunity is there. Apparently, the two species are more efficient in spotting potential nest predators – in particular corvids – early on and mobbing them off cooperatively than either is on its own. Otherwise, {{there is no clear}} preference for particular taxa of nesting trees, provided they are sufficiently dense. Conifers seem to have become more popular with European L. excubitor in recent decades, but a diversity of deciduous trees is used just as well. Far more rarely, large and especially thorny shrubs are used for nesting. The actual nesting site is chosen by the male; the courtship visits of the female are mainly to form and strengthen the pair bond. Also, though the partners build the nest together, the male collects most of the nesting material. The cup nest is quite sizable, measuring [...] in outer diameter. Its body is constructed of coarse vegetable material – mainly large twigs and chunks of moss, though bits of fabric and rubbish may be added. The interior cup is [...] in diameter and [...] deep; it is lined with fine twigs and roots, lichen, hair and feathers. Building a nest from scratch takes a pair one to two weeks, but if nests of the previous year in good locations remain usable, they are repaired rather than discarded.|$|E

[...] "I'd been among you some time before it began to dawn on me that you English didn't regard your own taboos as essentially identical with other people's. To me, from the very first, they seemed absolutely {{the same as the}} similar taboos of Central Africans and South Sea Islanders. All of them spring alike from a common origin, the queer savage belief that various harmless or actually beneficial things may become at times in some mysterious way harmful and dangerous. The essence of them all lies in the erroneous idea that if certain contingencies occur, such as breaking an image or deserting a faith, some terrible evil will follow to one man or to the world, which evil, as a matter of fact, there's no reason at all to dread in any way. Sometimes, as in ancient Rome, Egypt, Central Africa, and England, the whole of life gets enveloped at last in a perfect mist and labyrinth of taboos, a cobweb of conventions. The Flamen Dialis at Rome, you know, mightn't ride or even touch a horse; he mightn't see an army under arms; nor wear a ring that wasn't broken; nor have a knot in any part of his clothing. He mightn't eat wheaten flour or leavened bread; he mightn't look at or even mention by name such unlucky things as a goat, a dog, raw meat, haricot beans, or <b>common</b> <b>ivy.</b> He mightn't walk under a vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair could only be cut by a free man, and with a bronze knife; he was encased and surrounded, as it were, by endless petty restrictions and regulations and taboos--just like those that now surround so many men, and especially so many young women, here in England." ...|$|E

40|$|General Description. —Eastern poison ivy, {{also known}} as {{climbing}} poison <b>ivy,</b> <b>common</b> poison <b>ivy,</b> poison ivy, poison vine, and bemberecua, is a deciduous vine or shrub capable of ascending into tree crowns 20 m or more and along the ground {{for as much as}} 45 m. The stems sometimes reach 15 cm in diameter. The older stems are brown and covered with brown adventitious roots by which they cling to tree trunks and other surfaces and layer (root) whenever they come in contact with the ground. The small stems are lighter colored and covered with dark brown dots. The alternate leaves have long (to 15 cm) petioles and three ovate to lanceolate leaflets 4 to 20 cm long with entire, coarsely toothed, or lobed margins. Small white or greenish white flowers grow in axillary panicles. Clusters of white or greenish-white drupes 3 to 6 mm in diameter develop later and remain on the vine well after the leaves fall. The leaves are dark green during the summer, turning yellow to red in the fall.

40|$|Ethnobotanical: Ground ivy {{was used}} as a {{flavoring}} and clearing agent in brewing beer before it was replaced by hops (Mitich, 1994). Germans began using hops in the 8 th century, but hops were not introduced to England until the 14 th century (Hatfield, 1971). Many people believed hops were dangerous to their health until the 17 th century (Hatfield, 1971). One of ground <b>ivy’s</b> <b>common</b> names, alehoffs, means “ale ivy”. It is derived from the old English brewing term, hofe (Durant, 1976). Another of ground <b>ivy’s</b> <b>common</b> names contains the word gill, which is from the French word guiller, meaning “to ferment ale ” (Hatfield 1971). Ground ivy was also used for treating innumerable medical conditions. Graeco-Roman mythology claimed it cured melancholy (Hatfield, 1971). European herbalists used it to treat disorders of the bladder, kidneys, digestive tract and skin; gout, coughs, colds, and ringing in the ears (Gerard, 1964). They also used it to cure eye disorders in livestock (Gerard, 1964). Early English settlers brought ground ivy to the New World as part of their standard stock of household herbs (Hatfield, 1971). During the 19 th century in the U. S., ground ivy was used for treating lung and kidney diseases, asthma, jaundice, hypochondria, “monomania ” (a condition of “partial insanity”), and it was snuffed to treat persistent headache (Lestrange, 1971 as cited by Mitich, 1994). Ground ivy was also given to painters to treat “lead-colic ” (Durant, 1976). The plant is still used in herbal medicine in modern times, for its astringent, diuretic and stimulan...|$|R

This thesis comprises two introductory chapters (Part 1), followed {{by a series of}} ten research chapters (Parts 2 - 5) aimed at informing management practices that encourage bees and other flower-visiting insects in urban areas, and ends with a concluding chapter (Part 6). The projects are grouped in four parts making contributions to four broad areas of research. Part 2 is concerned with evaluating the attractiveness of ornamental garden plants to insect flower-visitors. Individual projects examine the advice currently available to gardeners via recommended plant lists, and describe surveys of plant varieties grown in a public garden (Southover Grange garden, Lewes), a Plant Heritage national collection of asters (Picton Garden, Malvern), and the experimental gardens planted on campus of the University of Sussex, Brighton, as well as in towns of Plumpton and Magham Down.
