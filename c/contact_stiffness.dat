Mistuning in a blisk due to variations in blade materials and geometry have been studied extensively and {{are known to have}} a significant impact on the forced response of blisks. However, mistuning can also arise due to variations at contact interfaces within a blisk with friction damping mechanisms such as under platform dampers or shrouds. Past literature analyzing the effect of this source of contact mistuning is limited, particularly by the use of lumped or single-node contacts at each sector to shorten analysis times. In this paper, we aim to better understand the specific effects of parameter variations across contact interfaces on an otherwise tuned blisk. A blisk with shroud to shroud contacts is considered. Accurate representation of microslip phenomena are incorporated in the analysis by modeling multiple localized node to node contact models at contact surfaces on each blisk sector. <b>Contact</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> which dictate the friction damping dynamics of the shrouds are chosen as the mistuning parameters. The harmonic balance method is used to solve for forced responses. We analyze cases with random patterns of <b>contact</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> in different microslip regimes in the proximity of different modal regions. Probabilistic analysis of nonlinear contact responses are carried out close to a linear region where comparatively high amplification factors are observed. Statistics are also developed for linear cases and compared with the nonlinear case to qualify the dependence of amplification factors of nonlinear forced responses on the level of microslip and on the variance of contact parameters...|$|R

In tribology, rough surfaces usually wear more quickly and have higher friction coefficients than smooth surfaces. Roughness is often a good predictor of the performance of a mechanical component, since irregularities on the surface may form nucleation sites for cracks or corrosion. On the other hand, roughness may promote adhesion.

Significant insights into vibrational granular dynamics have been obtained with reduced-dimensional systems containing macroscale particles. We study contact-based vibrations of a two-dimensional monolayer of micron-sized spheres on a solid substrate. Measurements of the resonant attenuation of laser-generated surface acoustic waves reveal three collective vibrational modes involving both displacements and rotations of the microspheres. To identify the modes, we tune the interparticle stiffness, which shifts the frequency of the horizontal-rotational resonances while leaving the vertical resonance unaffected. From the measured contact resonance frequencies we determine both particle-substrate and interparticle <b>contact</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and find that the former is an order of magnitude larger than the latter.

40|$|Abstract. This paper models a multibody {{collision}} in {{the impulse}} space {{as a state}} transition diagram, where each state represents a phase during which impacts are “active ” at only {{a subset of the}} contact points. A state transition happens whenever an active impact finishes restitution, or an inactive impact gets reactivated, depending on whether the two involved bodies are instantaneously penetrating into each other or not. The elastic energy due to an impact is not only affected by the impulse at the corresponding contact point, but also by other impulses exerted on the two involved bodies during the impact. Consequently, Poisson’s impulse-based law of restitution could result in negative energy. A new law governing the loss of elastic energy during restitution is introduced. Convergence of the impulse sequence generated by the state transition diagram is established. The collision outcome depends on the ratios of the <b>contact</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> rather than on their individual values. The collision model is then applied in an analysis of billiard shooting in which the cue stick impacts the cue ball, which in turn impacts the pool table. ...|$|R

The <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> variations have been suggested as the origin of the image contrast. Therefore, to analyze the image contrast, the local changes in the <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> due to the presence of subsurface features should be calculated. So far, only static simulations have been conducted to analyze the local changes in the <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> and, consequently, the contrast in US-AFM.

The former fails to quantitatively account for the results with a soft cement relative to the grain, whereas the latter considering the mechanical properties of the cement does apply. Moreover, we monitor the irreversible behavior of the cemented granular packs under moderate uniaxial loading (< 1. 3 MPa) with the correlation method of ultrasound scattering. The damage of the cemented materials is accompanied by a compressional wave velocity decrease up to 60 %, likely due to the fractures induced at the grain-cement interfaces...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with a dense, randomly packed, granular material that consists of identical spheres or disks with elastic, frictional interactions, that is first isotropically compressed and subsequently loaded along an arbitrary stress path. An analytical relationship between the overall stress and strain increments is determined for the pre-failure regime. The purpose of the modelling is to understand how this relation depends upon {{the features of the}} packing and the particle interactions. From the outset it is recognised that the packing and interactive properties for these materials may vary substantially from grain to grain and the heterogeneity introduced in this manner is fully accounted for. Moment equilibrium equations are solved for each particle and force equilibrium equations are solved for each neighbourhood. Then, the heterogeneity of the aggregate is taken into account by introducing means and fluctuations in the description of the local deformations and the measures of the particles and interactions. The general development is illustrated with an example in two dimensions in which the packing and contact interactions are approximated by angular distributions and the heterogeneity is introduced by variations in these. For an isotropic medium with constant <b>contact</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> the theory provides predictions that compare well with results obtained from numerical simulations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Based on the fractal contact theory, {{the model}} about the {{relation}} between normal <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> and material properties as well as fractal parameters is established. Then by making use of {{the relation between}} fractal parameters and surface roughness, a new method for estimating the normal <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> is put forward. The numerical results indicate that the <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> increases as surface roughness decreases or adhesion rate increases. When the adhesion rate is constant, <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> changes a little while Ra ≥ 6. 3 µm, but the change is relatively bigger when Ra ≤ 6. 3 µm.

In this paper, a 3 D stiffness model of a machine tool support is proposed using <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness.</b> The stiffness in each direction {{is assumed to be}} determined by the <b>contact</b> <b>stiffness</b> at the interfaces and the bulk stiffnesses of the supports and the floor.

The model, which considers sagittally polarized waves, includes: horizontal, vertical, and rotational degrees of freedom; normal and shear coupling between the spheres and substrate, {{as well as between}} adjacent spheres; and the effects of wave propagation in the elastic substrate. For a monolayer of interacting spheres, we find three contact resonances, whose frequencies are given by simple closed-form expressions. For a monolayer of isolated spheres, only two resonances are present. The contact resonances couple to surface acoustic waves in the substrate, leading to mode hybridization and "avoided crossing" phenomena. We present dispersion curves for a monolayer of silica microspheres on a silica substrate, assuming adhesive, Hertzian interactions, and compare calculations using an effective medium approximation to a discrete model of a monolayer on a rigid substrate. While the effective medium model does not account for discrete lattice effects at short wavelengths, we find that it is well suited for describing the interaction between the monolayer and substrate in the long wavelength limit. We suggest that a complete picture of the dynamics of a discrete monolayer adhered to an elastic substrate can be found using a combination of the results presented for the discrete and effective medium descriptions.

The amount and location of the clays and fluids can influence the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the granular material. This research investigated the mechanical effects of clay at grain-to-grain contacts {{in the presence of}} different fluids. Laboratory seismic wave propagation tests were conducted at ultrasonic frequencies using spherical glass beads coated with Montmorillonite clay (SWy- 1) onto which different fluids were adsorbed. For all bead samples, seismic velocity increased and attenuation decreased as the <b>contact</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> increased with increasing stress demonstrating that grain contacts control seismic transmission in poorly consolidated and unconsolidated granular material. Coating the beads with clay added stiffness and introduced viscosity to the mechanical contact properties that increased the velocity and attenuation of the propagating seismic wave. Clay-fluid interactions were studied by allowing the clay coating to absorb water, ethyl alcohol, and hexadecane. Increasing water amounts initially increased seismic attenuation due to clay swelling at the contacts. Attenuation decreased for higher water amounts where the clay exceeded the plastic limit and was forced from the contact areas into the surrounding open pore space during sample consolidation. This work investigates how clay located at grain contacts affects the micromechanical, particularly seismic, behavior of granular materials.

40|$|Fractures {{generated}} by internal fluid pressure, for example, dykes, mineral veins, many joints and man-made hydraulic fractures, {{are referred to}} as hydrofractures. Together with shear fractures, they contribute significantly to the permeability of fluid reservoirs such as those of petroleum, geothermal water, and groundwater. Analytical and numerical models show that – in homogeneous host rocks – any significant overpressure in hydrofractures theoretically generates very high crack tip tensile stresses. Consequently, overpressured hydrofractures should propagate and help to form interconnected fracture systems that would then contribute to the permeability of fluid reservoirs. Field observations, however, show that in heterogeneous and anisotropic, e. g., layered, rocks many hydrofractures become arrested or offset at layer contacts and do not form vertically interconnected networks. The most important factors that contribute to hydrofracture arrest are discontinuities (including <b>contacts),</b> <b>stiffness</b> changes between layers, and stress barriers, where the local stress field is unfavourable to hydrofracture propagation. A necessary condition for a hydrofracture to propagate to the surface is that the stress field along its potential path is everywhere favourable to extension-fracture formation so that the probability of hydrofracture arrest is minimised. Mechanical layering and the resulting heterogeneous stress field largely control whether evolving hydrofractures become confined to single layers (strata&# 172;bound frac&# 172;tures) or not (non-stratabound fractures) and, there&# 172;fore, if a vertically intercon&# 172;nec&# 172;ted fracture system forms.

Besides optimization of the mechanical design or various types of passive damping treatments, active structural vibration control concepts are efficient means to reduce unwanted vibrations. In this contribution, two different semiactive control concepts for vibration reduction are proposed that adapt to the normal force of attached friction dampers. Thereby, semiactive control concepts generally possess the advantage over active control in that the closed loop is intrinsically stable and that less energy {{is required for the}} actuation than in active control. In the chosen experimental implementation, a piezoelectric stack actuator is used to apply adjustable normal forces between a structure and an attached friction damper. Simulation and experimental results of a benchmark structure with passive and semiactively controlled friction dampers are compared for stationary narrowband excitation. For simulations of the control performance, transient simulations must be employed to predict the achieved vibration damping.
