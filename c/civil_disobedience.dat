5|$|As {{a result}} of the Gandhi Irwin Pactsigned on 4 March 1931the Congress {{suspended}} the <b>Civil</b> <b>Disobedience</b> Movement and the British, in turn, released all the prisoners. Kamaraj was released on eight days later.|$|E
5|$|During the march, Rajagopalachari and {{the marchers}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Disobedience</b> Movement as well as khadi and social issues like caste discrimination. They socialised with the untouchables and refrained from entering the temples in which the former were denied entry. They also swept {{the streets of the}} villages and spoke up for the unity of Hindus and Muslims.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, there was {{increasing}} {{rebellion against the}} rule of Somali President Siad Barre, a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses. By 1990, what began as <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> evolved into a civil war, with several militias organized to overthrow the central government.|$|E
5|$|Mass <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> spread {{throughout}} India as millions broke the salt laws by making salt or buying illegal salt. Salt was sold illegally {{all over the}} coast of India. A pinch of salt made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 rupees (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E
5|$|The Vedaranyam March (also {{called the}} Vedaranyam Satyagraha) was a {{framework}} of the nonviolent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> movement in British India. Modeled on the lines of Dandi March, which was led by Mahatma Gandhi on the western coast of India the month before, it was organised to protest the salt tax imposed by the British Raj in the colonial India.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{believed}} that the state governed with divine sanction. He {{believed that}} both {{the church and the}} state are placed under the sovereign rule of God. Christians were obliged to obey the government, but <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> was allowed if the authorities acted against the will of God. He described a preference for an aristocracy over monarchic or democratic rule.|$|E
5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr., January 15, 1929– April 4, 1968) was an American Baptist {{minister}} and activist {{who became the}} most visible spokesperson and leader in the Civil Rights Movement. He {{is best known for}} his role in the advancement of civil rights using the tactics of nonviolence and <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> based on his Christian beliefs and inspired by the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Sister Margaret McKenna, M.M.S., (born 1940) is an American Medical Mission Sister and anti-militarist activist. Raised in Hackensack, New Jersey, {{she earned}} her PhD in {{the origins and}} {{religious}} thought of Christianity from the University of Pennsylvania. In the 1970s, McKenna began participating in non-violent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> with the Plowshares Movement, sometimes being arrested or imprisoned for her actions. Her activism has continued through recent years.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), {{was founded}} by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was established to promote civil rights for African Americans through nonviolent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience.</b> Smith believed that White Americans would be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. This method of protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E
5|$|The UMWA used <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> {{to attract}} {{attention}} {{to the needs of}} the miners. The union stressed that all actions of the strike must remain peaceful. However, many miners still used violent methods during the strike. The strike gained the media's attention. People came from all across the country to support the UMWA's cause, and around 50,000 people went to southwest Virginia during the course of the strike.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} spurred {{a protest}} movement by Buddhists against the religious discrimination perpetrated by the Roman Catholic-dominated Diệm regime, {{known as the}} Buddhist crisis, and widespread large-scale <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> among the South Vietnamese. On 1 November 1963, {{after six months of}} tension and growing opposition to the regime, generals from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam conducted a coup, which saw the removal and assassination of Diệm on 2 November 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was worse in Huế, where Diệm had banned demonstrations and ordered his forces to arrest those {{who engaged in}} <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience.</b> At 13:00, some 1,500 protestors attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế for a rally, having gathered at the Bến Ngư Bridge near the Perfume River. A confrontation ensued when the protestors attempted to cross the bridge. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowd.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} {{denied that}} Dershowitz, {{who had been}} criticized for his campaign against Finkelstein's tenure, played any part in this decision. At the same time, the university denied tenure to international studies assistant professor Mehrene Larudee, {{a strong supporter of}} Finkelstein, despite unanimous support from her department, the Personnel Committee and the dean. Finkelstein stated that he would engage in <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> if attempts were made to bar him from teaching his students.|$|E
5|$|At {{its sixth}} annual {{convention}} in Vavuniya on 25 May 1958 ITAK resolved {{to launch a}} non-violent campaign of <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> to achieve its goals. In May and June 1958 Ceylon witnessed anti-Tamil rioting. Bandaranaike blamed ITAK for precipitating the violence and banned the party along with the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front). ITAK's leaders, including Chelvanayakam, were arrested on 4 June 1958 as they left Parliament and imprisoned. The ITAK leaders were placed under house arrest which meant that Chelvanayakam could not communicate with the public until late 1958 when the detention order was lifted.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in a Hindu {{merchant}} caste family in coastal Gujarat, western India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London, Gandhi first employed nonviolent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced this method of <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Payá {{founded the}} Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), {{which called for}} nonviolent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> against {{the rule of the}} Cuban Communist Party. The group advocates for civil liberties and freedom for {{political}} prisoners. He also began a magazine for Catholics titled People of God (Pueblo de Dios), calling for Christians to lead the struggle for human rights. However, the magazine was shut down the following year by Cuba's bishops under government pressure. Payá attempted to run for the National Assembly of People's Power (NAPP) in 1992, but was not allowed to stand.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, Bahraini {{authorities}} summoned the Lebanese ambassador in Bahrain {{to file a}} complaint against a conference held by Bahrain Rebellion Movement in Beirut. In the conference, opposition activists called for <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> and mass protests, the BNA reported. A number of Bahraini opposition politicians and human rights activists have based their activities in Beirut where they enjoy more freedom. The BNA added that the Lebanese ambassador said his government was not supportive of the conference and {{that they did not}} wish to interfere in Bahraini internal affairs. A day earlier, the salafist Al Asalah Islamic Society had criticized Lebanon for hosting the conference.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{was a new}} era for Indian {{women and}} is defined as 'feminism' that was {{responsible}} for the creation of localised women's associations. These associations emphasised women's education issues, developed livelihood strategies for working-class women, and also organised national level women's associations such as the All India Women's Conference. AIWC was closely affiliated with the Indian National Congress. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, it worked within the nationalist and anti-colonialist freedom movements. This made the mass mobilisation of women an integral part of Indian nationalism. Women therefore were {{a very important part of}} various nationalist and anti-colonial efforts, including the <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> movements in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The {{detention}} {{order on the}} ITAK leaders was lifted in October 1961. As a compromise the Bandaranaike government proposed the District Councils Bill to devolve powers to districts but following protests from Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists dropped the bill in June 1964. In 1964, as ITAK started preparing for a second <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> campaign, the government started collapsing. As several SLFP MPs defected to the opposition, the government sough ITAK's support but ITAK chose instead to support the opposition and on 3 December 1964 the government was unable to prove its majority in parliament, precipitating an election.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} act of <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> during the Pittston strike was Moss 3. Since the strike {{had been going}} on for a few months, with no settlement expected in the near future, union members began to lose hope. Thousands of people had already been arrested and a lot of money had been spent on a cause that seemed to be never ending. Union members knew that something had to be done to regain the spirit of the strike and make it clear to Pittston that they would not give up.|$|E
5|$|Thơ {{was part}} of an Interministerial Committee, a group of {{government}} officials that negotiated a Joint Communique with the Buddhists to end the <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience.</b> An agreement was signed, but never implemented. Thơ was later criticised by the Nhus through their English language mouthpiece, the Times of Vietnam, for the deal. Despite the general amnesty granted to arrested Buddhist activists, on 13 August, Thơ gave a press conference during which he vowed to prosecute the Buddhist victims of the Huế Vesak shootings, and revoking the amnesty and vowing to jail Buddhist demonstrators.|$|E
5|$|What {{had begun}} as a Salt Satyagraha quickly {{grew into a}} mass Satyagraha. British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax. The British responded with more laws, {{including}} censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> movement.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> {{campaign}} {{spread to}} other parts of the north-east, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike accused ITAK of trying to establish a separate state. In April 1961 the satyagrahas were removed by the army using brutal force. A state of emergency was declared on 18 April 1961. ITAK was banned, and its MPs and other leading members arrested and imprisoned at Panagoda Cantonment. Chelvanayakam was allowed to leave the camp and return home due to his deteriorating health. Chelvanayakam suffered from Parkinson's disease and his hearing had been gradually failing. After initially refusing, Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike allowed Chelvanayakam to travel to the UK to undergo surgery in Edinburgh at the hands of a neurosurgeon Francis John Gillingham. The operation was successful and after a few months recuperating in London Chelvanayakam returned to Ceylon.|$|E
5|$|Chelvanayakam was re-elected in the July 1960 {{parliamentary}} election {{in which the}} SLFP and its leftist allies achieved a majority in parliament. No longer needing ITAK's support in parliament, the SLFP reneged on its pledges to honour the B-C pact and commenced enacting anti-Tamil policies, announcing the full operation of the Sinhala Only Act from January 1961 and using Sinhala in courts of law throughout the country. ITAK launched a campaign of <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> in January 1961, beginning in Jaffna. Chelvanayakam started distributing leaflets outside Jaffna Kachcheri in Old Park urging Tamil civil servants to boycott government offices and cease using Sinhala. The campaign was hugely successful and large crowds, including ITAK MPs, gathered {{in front of the}} Kachcheri and staged a protest rally.|$|E
5|$|European traders had {{established}} outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established {{themselves as the}} dominant force by the 18th century. Following the First War of Independence of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montague–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed {{the enactment of the}} repressive Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience,</b> led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite {{arrest and detention}} of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
5|$|In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable {{communication}} {{that if the}} British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience.</b> The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even if the other side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons {{and parts of the}} British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.|$|E
5|$|In Petersburg, Virginia, the {{two women}} moved out of broken seats in the black (and back) section of the bus, where state {{segregation}} laws mandated they sit, and into the white section. Inspired by a conversation they had been having about Gandhian <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience,</b> {{the two women}} refused {{to return to the}} rear even after the police were called. They were arrested and jailed. Murray and McBean initially were defended by the NAACP, but when the pair were convicted only of disorderly conduct rather than violating segregation laws, the organization ceased to represent them. The Workers' Defense League (WDL), a socialist labor rights organization that also was beginning to take civil rights cases, paid her fine. A few months later the WDL hired Murray for its administrative committee.|$|E
5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{denial of}} {{governmental}} {{responsibility for the}} incident, and instead blaming members of the Viet Cong insurgency, led to growing discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the religious discrimination of Diệm's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. The dispute {{came to be known}} as the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> throughout South Vietnam, persisting throughout May. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to force the implementation of religious equality. At the time, the United States, the main backer of South Vietnam in the Cold War, had 16,000 military advisers in the country to assist the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in the war against the Vietcong insurgency, which sought to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. Washington wanted the dispute with the Buddhists to be resolved quickly so that it would not dampen public morale and detract from the fight against the Vietcong.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in the public arena. Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{fighting}} at Tobruk, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} front and placed in reserve. When Japan entered the war, the division was transferred to India. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible Japanese landings while it trained in jungle warfare. It {{also served as a}} police force, protecting railways and being used to suppress <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> caused by the Quit India Movement. While it was requested that the division be sent to the front line in Burma, it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the Chindits. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and Lieutenant-General William Slim (who led the British troops in Burma) believed that the division could have had a greater impact against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at <b>civil</b> <b>disobedience</b> in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
