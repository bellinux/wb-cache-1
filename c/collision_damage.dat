5|$|American {{proceeded}} to Halifax, {{where she had}} her <b>collision</b> <b>damage</b> repaired {{over the next six}} weeks. She departed for Gibraltar on 27 November, {{a little more than two}} weeks after the signing of the Armistice with Germany that ended the fighting. After calling at that British port on 9 December, American docked at Marseilles, before leaving for New York in the new year, arriving there on 9 February 1919. American was decommissioned and returned to American-Hawaiian on 4 March, and formally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 May.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, {{fourteen}} standard stock {{motor cars}} were withdrawn from passenger service, and {{were converted to}} ballast motor cars, with the final one completed in early 1955. All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923, four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co. At least {{three of them were}} chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to <b>collision</b> <b>damage.</b> They were numbered L62 to L75, and were painted grey. In 1957, they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon. L72 was the first to be scrapped, after a collision in 1963. At the time, the standard stock was being withdrawn and replaced by 1959/62 Stock, and so rather than repair it, it was replaced by a 1927 motor car. The replacement also carried the number L72. A 1931 motor car was used to replace L73 when it was badly damaged in 1967, but in this case it carried a new number, becoming L77. During the 1970s, the ballast motor cars were gradually withdrawn. The last two to be used were L63 and L68, which performed leaf-clearing duties in late 1977, and all had been scrapped by September 1978.|$|E

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} {{strength is}} the most important issue {{to ensure the safety of}} ship not only in the intact but also in the damage condition. In this case, when the <b>collision</b> <b>damaged</b> is appeared, the hull girder cross section is analyzed as a bi-axial bending problem even when only the vertical or horizontal bending moment is applied to the cross section. Therefore, the bi-axial bending is investigated in this study taking the single hull bulk carrier as the object of the ship into account. The full model of the hull girder cross section is modeled to know the influence of the rotation of the neutral axis. The <b>collision</b> <b>damaged</b> is assumed to be located asymmetrically on the side of the single hull bulk carrier. The incremental approach is applied to solve the bi-axial bending problem including the effect of the rotation of the neutral axis. The result is shown in term of the interaction between vertical and horizontal bending moment relationship. It is found that the <b>collision</b> <b>damaged</b> has significant influence toward bi-axial bending behavior, also the effect of the rotation of the neutral axis...|$|R

25|$|Having been {{withdrawn}} {{due to a}} collision, it {{was brought}} to the UK by the museum in 1989, who intended {{to use it as a}} source of spare parts for other trams. As it was found to be in sound condition, capable of running on arrival, it was instead decided to repair the <b>collision</b> <b>damage</b> and restore it as a complete vehicle. Oporto 176 was instead acquired for their spare part needs.|$|E
25|$|Older table-based pinsetters that pick up {{the pins}} between throws could {{malfunction}} if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism <b>collision</b> <b>damage,</b> pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the misaligned pin.|$|E

25|$|Kartikeyan {{qualified}} {{last for}} the following 5 races (bar in Spain where Lewis Hamilton was excluded from qualifying and in Monaco where Sergio Pérez crashed without setting a time) however Karthikeyan only started 24th and last twice (in Bahrain and Canada) due to other drivers picking up grid penalties. In China Karthikeyan finished 22nd, ahead of Caterham's Heikki Kovalainen. In Bahrain, Karthikeyan finished 21st and was classified ahead of the Williams of Bruno Senna who retired due to brake issues. In Spain Karthikeyan retired for the first race in the same after a wheel nut failure on lap 22 due to a botched pit stop. In Monaco Karthikeyan started 22nd, ahead of Peréz and the penalised Pastor Maldonado and finished the race in 15th, classified ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button who retired after <b>collision</b> <b>damage</b> with Kovalainen (Karthikeyan also had his race quickest lap within 0.3 secs of Button). In Canada Karthikeyan retired {{for the second time}} in the season after suffering a brake failure on lap 22 which made him spin in turn 1 and stop later on in the lap, his teammate Pedro de la Rosa retire with a similar issue two laps later.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} large classes of locomotive, {{there were some}} {{variations}} during the Class 24s' lifetime, some affecting all of the class (nominally), and others just individual locos. One such locomotive was 24133, {{one of the last}} survivors of the class and easily recognised as it had different headcode boxes on each end, the standard one for the class at one end and that at the other end matching those used on the Class 27. This was not unique, as 24145 had a headcode box similar to those fitted to later batches of Class 25s. In each case, this is likely to be due to <b>collision</b> <b>damage</b> repairs. Some Inverness-based locomotives had 'car lights' fitted to each nose. These were after-market car headlamps mounted in the plated-over nose doors, to provide extra visibility to users of level crossings on sharply curved branch lines. D5114-132 had pairs mounted in each nose. These were removed between 1975/6, with small plates welded over the apertures. 12 Class 26s had similar modifications, some having pairs and others having a single lamp. Examples of Class 37s, Class 47s and a solitary Class 86 had single railway spotlights installed at each end but the Class 24s and Class 26s were the only ones fitted with proper car headlamps.|$|E
25|$|K 174: Moorooduc, {{with the}} Mornington Railway. This engine had been plinthed at the Edinburgh Gardens in Fitzroy (near the former Fitzroy Railway Station) until 18 May 1997, {{when it was}} {{acquired}} by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc by road. The engine was in generally terrible condition, with most fittings missing and the remainder of parts damaged, except the engine frames which were in surprisingly good condition by comparison. The tender tank had fittings removed and was scrapped at Moorooduc, being beyond repair, and the tender frame and the brake gear for the locomotive demonstrated significant <b>collision</b> <b>damage.</b> The rest of the parts were placed in a pool {{to be used to}} reassemble a future engine; {{at the end of the}} project, the pool consisted of the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck from 159 and 177; the loco frames, coupled wheels, axle boxes, motion gear and smoke deflectors from 159 and 174; the tender frame and bogies from 174 and 177, and the tender tank from 177 only. In 2000, the coupled wheels and motion gear from 174 was swapped with that from 176 at Seymour as the tyres from 174 required replacement, while 176's tyres were almost new; though both locomotives had poor condition axle boxes and crankpins. A few years later, the tender bogies from 174 were swapped with those from 191. When completed, the locomotive using K 174's frame is to be numbered K 177 and named City of Ararat, as part of the deal for parts acquisition.|$|E
50|$|The second {{light was}} plagued by {{collisions}} with passing ships: it {{was struck by a}} steamer in 1891, by a coal barge in 1898, and finally by the schooner Malcolm Baxter, Jr., which struck the lighthouse on December 27, 1909 while under tow. This last <b>collision</b> <b>damaged</b> the foundation and overturned the stove in the house, which was destroyed by fire.|$|R

2500|$|... 22 July 1980 – Balloon trams 705 and 706 {{collided}} head-on on {{the turning}} loop at the Pleasure Beach. 705 was bound for Starr Gate whilst 706 was stationary on the loop. 705 {{was on the}} wrong line due to the points being incorrectly set and ran into 706, about to depart for Fleetwood. Both trams were severely damaged; 705 was scrapped, the only Balloon to meet this fate until 2009 when 722 was scrapped due to <b>collision</b> <b>damage.</b> 706 was rebuilt as an open-topped Balloon. A County Court judgement in 1982 found that Blackpool Corporation were 80% to blame for the collision.|$|E
