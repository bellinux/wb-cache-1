40|$|The Oostkustpolders in the NW part of Flanders is an {{important}} wintering haunt for Pinkfooted and White-fronted Geese. Their numbers, distribution and behaviour have been studied for nearly 30 years. The numbers of Pinkfeet have been increasing gradually in our study area, whereas the numbers of Whitefronts have mainly increased after the three severe winters 1984 / 85 - 1986 / 87. In severe winters {{there is always a}} large influx of birds of both species. Pinkfeet arrive in early November and {{there is a tendency to}} arrive earlier in recent years. Numbers peak at the end of December. Whitefronts arrive in mid November and peak in the first half of January. By the end of February most geese leave the Oostkustpolders. Over the years the geese dispersed from the core feeding area near Damme to the surrounding polders. This dispersion came about by a shooting ban and the influx of large numbers of birds during severe winters. Within winters, birds disperse over the whole polder area. They seem to follow a pattern of <b>cyclic</b> <b>grazing</b> different parts of the polder. Based on behavioural observations it can be shown that the dispersal occurs when feeding conditions deteriorate due to decreasing grass length. In this way all polders are grazed to a certain extent after which the whole cycle can start again. Although there are clear indications that at some times the maximum number of geese feeding in an area may be reached, the cumulative number of goose-days varies greatly between complexes. No relation is found however with the amount of food but a significant negative correlation is found between the number of goose-days per complex and the time of first arrival in that complex. The density of geese is found to be similar between all the polder complexes studied. The changes in the population of both Pinkfeet and Whitefronts are discussed and the factors influencing the occurrence of geese in the Oostkustpolders and the carrying capacity of the polders are analysed. Finally two contrasting views on goose protection, concentrating versus dispersing the geese, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Analytical {{methods of}} surface/interface {{structure}} and micro-structure in advanced nanocomposite materials {{by using the}} synchrotron radiation are introduced. Recent results obtained by the energy-tunable and highly collimated brilliant X-rays, in-situ wide angle/small angle X-ray diffraction with high accuracy are reviewed. It is shown that small angle X-ray scattering {{is one of the}} best methods to characterize nanoparticle dispersibility, filler aggregate/agglomerate structures and in-situ observation of hierarchical structure deformation in filled rubber under <b>cyclic</b> stretch. <b>Grazing</b> Incidence(small and wide angle) X-ray Scattering are powerful to analyze the sintering process of metal nanoparticle by in-situ observation as well as the orientation of polymer molecules and crystalline orientation at very thin surface layer (ca 7 nm) of polymer film. While the interaction and conformation of adsorbed molecule at interface can be investigated by using high energy X-ray XPS with Enough deep position (ca 9 micron m) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of self-assembled monolayer molecular arrays, which serve as active layers in electronic devices, {{is an important}} step toward understanding molecular-scale electronics. To correlate the properties of self-assembled monolayers with their molecular structures, a series of Ï€-conjugated mono- and dithiols and aromatic dithiols with an oxygen or sulfur atom between two aromatic units have been designed and synthesized. Their optical properties were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy. Their self-assembled monolayer films on gold surfaces were characterized by <b>cyclic</b> voltammetry, <b>grazing</b> incidence Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (GI-FTIR), and contact angle and ellipsometry measurements. Increasing the chain length from two to four phenyl rings showed a more than linear increase of the intensity of the aromatic C=C ring stretch modes in GI-FTIR, indicating that the longer p-phenylene system is oriented toward the surface normal. Similar to oligophenylenes, when the number of repeat units for oligothiophene is increased, a more than linear increase of the intensity of the C=C stretch and C-H bend modes implies that the longest oligothiophenedithiol molecule is oriented close to the surface normal. Ellipsometry showed a smaller deviation from the calculated monolayer thickness with increasing number of thiophene or phenylene rings, corroborating the GI-FTIR data. We conclude that the conjugated phenylene- and thiophene-based dithiols demonstrate a less tilted molecular orientation with respect to the surface normal with increasing chain length. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of nanostructured materials {{is an important}} step in tuning the reactivity and selectivity of modern catalysts and electrodes. Here, electrochemical reduction is used to create a templated structure consisting of a regular array of pores from lyotropic liquid crystalline phases. Surfaces such as these exhibit high surface areas and a regular repeat pattern on the nanoscale show incredible promise for uses in heterogeneous catalysis, battery storage, sensors and molecular and chemical sieves and filters. By depositing structures onto a Pt(111) single crystal substrates we have shown {{that it is possible to}} control the internal structure of the pore as well as that of the interstitial surface. Results from techniques such as <b>cyclic</b> voltammetry (cv), <b>Grazing</b> Incidence Small Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) are presented. By varying specific deposition conditions the diameter, depth and frequency of the templated structures can be controlled and manipulated for a number of different applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{data from}} descriptive and experimental {{studies on the}} possible relationships between plants, nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi in (successional) plant communities in The Netherlands. A key role for pathogenic nematodes in <b>cyclic</b> succession in <b>grazed</b> grassland confirmed similar results in foredune succession. Plants with clonal growth forms appear to be particularly susceptible to pathogenic fungi. A large role for ectomycorrhiza at the species level (functional composition) was observed in determining the effects of acid rain and increased atmospheric CO 2 on nutrient transfer to trees. Field studies showed a correlation between species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi and hyphal-feeding nematodes in one case, but not in another. Population growth of hyphal-feeding nematodes on ectomycorrhizal hyphae {{was found to be}} strongly dependent on plant-mediated palatability of the fungus. We conclude that the limited available evidence suggests the importance of functional composition of species in determining interactions between plants, nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi, but the degree to which functional redundancy exists within the nematodes and within the mycorrhizal fungi warrants further investigation...|$|R
