Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. So, I think he was someone we all came up with together, but his voice <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> head.

2500|$|Moreover, [...] "Fear and Loathing", as a phrase, {{has been}} used by many writers, the first (possibly) being Friedrich Nietzsche in The Antichrist. In a Rolling Stone {{magazine}} interview, Thompson said: [...] "It <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own sense of fear, and [...] a perfect description of that situation to me, however, I have been accused of stealing it from Nietzsche or Kafka or something.

2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'. If a girl {{is walking}} and the guys {{look at her and}} say 'Man, she's streggae' it means she don't dress well, she look raggedy. The girls would say that about the men too. This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name. [...] Before that people had called it blue-beat and all kind of other things. Now it's in the Guinness World of Records.|$|E
2500|$|The prologue {{on earth}} shows the righteous Job blessed with wealth and sons and daughters. The scene shifts to heaven, where God asks Satan (ha-satan, {{literally}} [...] "the accuser") for {{his opinion of}} Job's piety. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job had, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill all of his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: [...] "Naked I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be {{the name of the}} Lord." [...] God allows Satan to afflict his body with boils. Job sits in ashes, and his wife prompts him to [...] "curse God, and die," [...] but Job answers: [...] "Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?" ...|$|E

He later spoke about this period of unconsciousness as surreal: [...] "Well, I had some very weird experiences. My main experience was one of furious activity and tremendous struggle {{in a sort of}} futuristic, space-ship vehicle with insectoid presences. After I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coma, I had this image of myself as these little hunks of protoplasm that were stuck together kind of like stamps with perforations between them that you could snap off." [...] Garcia's coma {{had a profound effect on}} him: it forced him to have to relearn how to play the guitar, as well as other, more basic skills. Within a handful of months, he had recovered, playing with the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead again later that year.|$|E

Gauci explained, [...] "That's where I <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> shell. I didn't have anyone {{telling me what to}} do. Tune in Tokyo is just one part of what I want to do.
