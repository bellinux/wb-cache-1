5|$|The migrations and {{invasions of}} the 4th and 5th centuries {{disrupted}} trade networks around the Mediterranean. African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing {{from the interior}} and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By {{the end of the}} 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other <b>complex</b> <b>products.</b> Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the following question: why did Samsung and LG fail to {{transition from the}} mass-produced goods sector production to <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> system sector production? In general, there are four necessary factors to facilitate successful operation in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> systems: research and development capability, organic networking among various actors, the capability to leverage suitable support from government {{and the establishment of}} a large demand base. Samsung and LG has strong RD capabilities and engaged in useful networking and their failure to succeed in the <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> system sector can be attributed to inappropriate support from government and their failure to establish a large demand base.

In designing environmentally optimal buildings, the objective is to minimize the total environmental impact associated with all life-cycle stages of the building project. However, building as a process is not as streamlined as an industrial process, and varies from one building to the other, never repeating itself identically. In addition, buildings are much more <b>complex</b> <b>products,</b> composed of a multitude of materials and components each constituting various design variables to be decided at the design stage. A variation of every design variable may affect the environment during all the building's relevant life-cycle stages.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to New Product Development-literature by expanding {{the analysis of the}} R&D-manufacturing interface in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development in three areas, i. e. the outsourcing of manufacturing, uncertainty and time-criticality, and field service. The thesis focuses on interface challenges and solutions which concern three questions: How does the level of outsourcing of manufacturing affect the management of the R&Dmanufacturing interface in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development? How does the presence of uncertainty and time-criticality affect the management of the R&Dmanufacturing interface in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development? How does the need to consider field service requirements affect the management of the R&Dmanufacturing interface in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development? The background and point of departure is the realization that there are three areas which influence the management of the important, dynamic interface between R&D and manufacturing. First, the level of outsourcing of manufacturing is increasing in many industries, which makes it even more demanding to manage the R&D-manufacturing interface in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development. Second, <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development may also be characterized by uncertainty and time-criticality, and previous research indicates that these factors need to be handled differently. Third, it is increasingly important to consider not only R&D and manufacturing, but also field service requirements. The research methodology rests on a multiple case study approach where the main case used in this thesis is an extreme case in terms of uncertainty, R&D intensity and volume levels, i. e. Micronic Laser Systems. The main findings of the thesis revolve around the identification of the challenges and solutions involved in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development. Based on five research papers, the thesis identifies challenges associated with each of the three research questions, and all challenges identified revolve around how to identify and understand conflicting requirements, to establish an understanding of changing prerequisites and their implications, and to ensure active involvement and a certain degree of competence overlap between organizational functions (internal as well as external). The solutions identified for handling these challenges have one thing in common, namely a focus on achieving controlled responsiveness and flexibility based on an understanding of tradeoffs, interaction, and informed decision-making. These solutions differ from those prescribed in conventional product development literature which tends to focus on upfront planning techniques and how to follow plans. The findings may be of value to a variety of managers in different environments, in particular for project managers who are involved in <b>complex</b> <b>product</b> development. The main reason is that this kind of product development exhibits challenges and solutions different from those described in conventional literature on new product development, at least in cases where there is some degree of uncertainty...|$|R

The chapter highlights the necessity of shifting {{the focus of attention}} from firms knowledge boundaries to the project knowledge boundaries, so as to gain a more fine–grained analysis of some important phenomena that happen “around” the formal boundary of the firm and cope with knowledge development problems.
