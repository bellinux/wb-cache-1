40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the magnitude of expected income shocks will impact consumption smoothing, because individuals only adjust consumption intertemporally if future income shocks are large enough. We examine how the magnitudes of final mortgage payments (which increase disposable income) impact credit card consumption and debt. Our <b>confidential</b> bank <b>account</b> data allows us to identify the exact date and magnitude of the final mortgage payment, and also to exploit the random timing of final mortgage payments across individuals. As predicted, we find recipients of smaller expected income shocks increase consumption, but recipients of larger expected income shocks reduce debt...|$|R

Data such as <b>accounts,</b> <b>confidential</b> documents, etc. is stored and managed by database in company. Database Reverse Engineering also works on extracting information and structure along with actual records stored in database table. Database Reverse Engineering means reconstructing ER model from existing schema, analysis and transformation. Various methods of Database Reverse Engineering {{are used in}} Digital forensic and tampering in data. Due to advance in technology growth of computer crime is increased. As the business data stored in these database {{is very important to}} investigate company dishonest act is necessary for that purpose fruitful database forensic technique should be used. Discrimination is mainly used to avoid tampering of data. It includes various strategies of discrimination...|$|R
40|$|Short {{message service}} (SMS) {{is a very}} popular {{and one of the}} easy to use {{communication}} technologies for mobile phone devices. Originally, this service was not designed to transmit secured data, so the security was not an important issue during its design. Short Message Service is normally used to transport unclassified data, but with the rise of mobile commerce it has become a fundamental tool for conducting business. However SMS does not guarantee confidentiality and integrity of the message. Now a days, short message service (SMS) is being used in many daily life applications, including mobile banking, mobile commerce, and so on. But when we send an SMS from one mobile device to another, the information contained in the SMS transmit as plain text. Sometimes this information may be <b>confidential</b> like <b>account</b> numbers, passwords, license numbers, and so on, and it is a major drawback to send such information through SMS while the traditional SMS service does not provide encryption to the information before its transmission. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure technique, which provides end-to-end secure communication through SMS between end users. This paper proposes encryption technique {{that can be used to}} secure a SMS communication, when SMS is transmitting form source to destination, it have to be reached up to the destination securely means SMS transmission have to be secure...|$|R
60|$|When {{he reached}} the Mission, he was tenderly cared for, {{and in a few}} weeks was enabled to resume those duties from which, as will be seen, not even the machinations of the Evil One could divert him. The news of his {{physical}} disaster spread over the country; and a letter to the Bishop of Guadalaxara contained a <b>confidential</b> and detailed <b>account</b> of the good Father's spiritual temptation. But in some way the story leaked out; and long after Jose was gathered to his fathers, his mysterious encounter formed the theme of thrilling and whispered narrative. The mountain was generally shunned. It is true that Senor Joaquin Pedrillo afterward located a grant near the base of the mountain; but as Senora Pedrillo was known to be a termagant half-breed, the Senor was not supposed to be over-fastidious.|$|R
40|$|In theory an ADSL router {{is capable}} of {{providing}} immense security capabilities including {{but not limited to}} wireless encryption, denial of service prevention through firewall rule sets, and logging facilities for review or analysis of network events. However, most laymen may be unaware of the intricacies of the security measures available to them. As a result a vast array of information could remain on ADSL routers once the device is sold, including the usersâ€™ approach to security, Internet usage habits, or more importantly <b>confidential</b> user or <b>account</b> information. This paper presents the findings of data acquired from second hand ADSL routers purchased during the first quarter of 2011. The outcomes demonstrate that individuals are not removing their identity adequately and are leaving confidential data which may lead to detrimental outcomes if misused. The paper also demonstrates that the overall security of these devices is alarmingly low, and thus many consumers may fall victim to new and emergent Internet based crimes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The author explores 20 {{criteria}} for a good road pricing system and presents case studies illustrating the costs, revenues, and benefits of alternative congestion charging mechanisms. The author finds that manual tollbooths are not suitable for congestion charging because they are land-, labor-, and time-intensive. Cordon pricing (as in the Bergen toll ring) {{can be an effective}} instrument for charging for congestion if half the toll lanes are reserved for seasonal pass holders traveling through the pricing points at regular highway speed. Enforcement of those driving in reserved lanes can be carried out by periodic videographs of vehicle license plates. Area licensing schemes require that vehicles entering the central business district during peak hours prominently display a monthly or daily license. Enforcement is undertaken at gantry points by traffic wardens who perform visual checks on the nonstop traffic. The enforcement costs of area licensing schemes are prohibitive at motorway speeds but relatively low-cost in a standard congested urban setting with limited gateways. Area licensing schemes, also known as supplementary licensing, carry the lowest cost per transaction. Electronic road pricing with automatic vehicle identification (an off-vehicle recording system) is electronic toll collection by time of day writ large and made obligatory on vehicle owners in a jurisdiction. The cost of the electronic equipment is not trivial, but is outweighed by the benefits. Sensitivity analysis performed on the Hong Kong electronic road pricing scheme in 1983 - 85 shows that even after excluding time savings, the savings in operating costs produce benefit figures that are greater than system costs. The invasion-of-privacy issues that led to the political failure of the Hong Kong electronic road pricing scheme can not be overcome by giving road users access to <b>confidential</b> numbered <b>account</b> arrangements with a prepaid cash deposit. The capital cost of electronic road pricing with smart card technology (an on-vehicle charging system) is higher than the cost for automatic vehicle identification technology alone, but benefits still outweigh costs (as in the Dutch proposal). Together, the benefit-cost ratio and the cost per transaction are acceptable but this technology is still not widely used commercially. The author argues that electronic approaches to direct road use charging are superior to manual approaches for road users, road authorities, and society as a whole. And rapid progress in microelectronics, cryptology, and microwave technologies will continue to yield large-scale economies in the manufacturing of automatic vehicle identification equipment, read-write transponders, smart cards, and the hardware and software that go with them. The author ranks electronic road pricing with automatic vehicle identification alone higher than electronic road pricing with smart card-type AVI based on an unweighted index of all criteria. And generally, the area licensing scheme is superior to cordon pricing. If budgets allow, authorities should investigate the feasibility of electronic road pricing. If the budget is tight, they should look into the area licensing scheme with its low cost and high benefit-cost ratio (the latter being the most important of the 20 criteria the author uses). Both conceptually and practically, the author finds {{that it is important to}} earmark the proceeds of road pricing to implement marginal cost pricing in the road sector.
