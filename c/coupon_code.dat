50|$|The GS1 Databar <b>Coupon</b> <b>code</b> {{has been}} in use in retail {{industry}} since the mid-1980s. At first, it was a UPC with system ID 5. Since UPCs cannot hold more than 12 digits, it required another bar code to hold additional information like offer code, expiration date and household ID numbers. Therefore, the code was often extended with an additional UCC/EAN 128 bar code. EAN 13 was sometimes used instead of UPC, and because it starts with 99, {{it was called the}} EAN 99 coupon barcode, and subsequently GS1 Databar. After more than 20 years in use, there is now a need to encode more data for complex coupons, and to accommodate longer company IDs, so the traditional <b>coupon</b> <b>code</b> has become less efficient and sometimes not usable at all.|$|E

On April 24, 2006, Linspire announced its own project named [...] "Freespire". This followed the model of community-oriented releases by Red Hat and Novell {{in the form of}} Fedora and openSUSE. Freespire was a community-driven and -supported project tied to the commercial Linspire distribution, and included previously proprietary elements from Linspire, such as the CNR Client, while other elements, which Linspire, Inc. licenses but does not own, like the Windows Media Audio compatibility libraries, remain closed-source. Consequently, there are two versions of Freespire, one with the closed source libraries, and one, called Freespire OSS Edition, that includes only open-source components. Freespire 1.0 was released on August 7, 2006, three weeks ahead of schedule. It is now known that Freespire will change its code base from Ubuntu to Debian on any future releases.

50|$|This weekly {{show was}} started in 2010 in Fried's living room. The concept was that viewers could ask her any {{questions}} about engineering while she was assembling electronics kit and Phillip Torrone, her spouse, was preparing shipments. The show is broadcast on YouTube and Ustream and behind-the-scenes content is streamed to Periscope. The company prides themselves by stating {{that this is the}} longest-running electronics live show. Some of the sections of the stream are new products where Fried demonstrates the week's new product that appeared in the shop, Time Travel, where the hosts look back on the world of makers, hackers, artists, and engineers and often highlight a special person or event, 3D Printing, where they showcase a special project or product related to the industry, a Q&A session and a trivia question, where the first viewer with the correct answer wins a product. There also sometimes is a section dedicated to Raspberry Pi and Arduino news and a section where the hosts read a positive email that they have received from a satisfied customer. Every week, a <b>coupon</b> <b>code</b> for a 10% rebate on everything in the store except gift certificates and software is issued and is valid only for the night. The show airs every Wednesday at 8 PM ET on the company's YouTube channel and is still run by Limor Fried and Phillip Torrone, albeit guests are often present. As of February 2016, there have been almost 200 editions of the show, totaling almost 7 million minutes watched, a half million video views and 33 thousand playlist views.|$|E

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on March 23, 2016 Thesis advisor: Yijie HanVitaIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 35) Thesis (M. S.) [...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 A number of trends in e-commerce have become evident in recent years. Online storefronts have proliferated, and advertisements for these storefronts {{in the form}} of click through banners have become popular. Recently, the Internet has also become a distribution medium for conventional coupons. The customer prints out such coupons with his or her printer and redeems them like any other coupon. Although coupons {{are one of the most}} widely used forms of sales promotion, they suffer from a number of disadvantages. First, conventional distribution channels are slow and have long lead-times. Hence, distributing coupons requires much advance planning. Second, coupons were being redeemed multiple times by multiple people—sometimes well after the expiration dates. Coupons could be possibly redeemed by employees. Third, lower cost distribution channels such as newspapers do not lend themselves to precise targeting.. A new approach to redemption, however, offers a simple solution for ensuring that each offer is redeemed according to plan. According to our approach chain store owner can choose to generate coupons for a specific branch or branches. When customer prints the coupons, the customer’s name can be affixed to the coupon such that others cannot use the coupon. This way prevents store employees from redeeming the coupons. Store owner can choose to provision a limited number of coupons or to set the number of coupons to be distributed as unlimited. He or she can terminate the provisional coupon issuing instantly. In this new scenario, each promotional offer is assigned an authenticated <b>coupon</b> <b>code.</b> The code can be assigned specific parameters, such as one-time use, an expiration date and future activation. When a coupon or other promotion is redeemed, the <b>coupon</b> <b>code</b> is moved from active state to used state. Whenever a user tries to redeem the same coupon again, it checks in the database and whether the state of coupon is active or used.
