50|$|At Cogenhoe, the pre-war <b>coach</b> <b>firm</b> of York Brothers (George and Fred York) {{continued}} to {{flourish in the}} 1950s. They operated a stage carriage route between Wollaston and Northampton, via many of the local villages, but, also ran a travel company with coach excursions to {{all parts of the}} country. As their bus fleet grew, they swallowed up several of the smaller concerns and became not just an important local employer but also developed a national reputation for quality. Yorks, as part of a bigger concern, finally closed for business in 2012.|$|E

50|$|In April 1933, {{representatives from}} Henschel and the <b>coach</b> <b>firm</b> of Wegmann & Co. handed a Study Into A High-Speed Steam Train (Studie über einen schnellfahrenden Dampfzug) {{to the general}} manager of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft, Julius Dorpmüller. This report envisaged a light, 4-4-2, superheated, tank {{locomotive}} with a two-coach unit, whose procurement and maintenance costs were low and which also offered passengers greater comfort. In order to minimise air resistance, the whole train would be streamlined and the double-coach rounded off at both ends. The locomotive, its streamlining extending at the back over the coal tank, would be able to push or pull from either end of the double-coach depending on the direction of travel. The link between engine and coaches would be an automatic coupling with brake and air pipes.|$|E

The first owner of the other 42 was Leyland Motors acting as insurer for the loss of the Magdeburg (see later), of those 42, 14 were lost at sea, 9 of the 28 salvaged went to an Australian operator Westbus, two to a British <b>coach</b> <b>firm</b> but the destinations of most of the remaining 17 are unknown. 72% of this the most successful variant went to Cuba, 18% to Argentina and 7% to Uruguay.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the arrival}} of {{deregulation}} came {{the arrival of}} competition. Fife had previously enjoyed being the sole operator {{throughout much of the}} region and its response to the new operators showed the companys intention to remain so. Despite the cities of Edinburgh and Dundee being on the edges of its operating area, Fife concentrated on protecting its home market rather than expanding into the cities to compete against the dominant operators there. Rennies of Dunfermline were the first challengers to Fife in and around that town, but by far the largest and most sustained competition came from local <b>coach</b> <b>firm</b> Moffat & Williamson LTD. Moffat & Williamson built up a substantial network of services throughout much of Fife, mirroring the larger operators network. A [...] "bus war" [...] broke out across the region, and vehicles from both operators could be seen nose to tail on services such as that between Dundee and St Andrews. Fifes passenger base seemed loyal, however, and Rennies would soon withdraw from Dunfermline and Moffat & Williamson would scale back its operations, though retaining pockets of strong competition in the industrialised towns in the south of the region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{beginnings}} of the firm of Kingston Coaches are not documented but {{it is known that}} as early as 1924 a gentleman by the name of Edward Charles H Grant of Middle Winterslow provided a service to Salisbury for his fellow villagers four days a week. A photograph exists of a little 1928 Chevrolet, reg no MW2583, which was with Grant's Kingston Coaches some years before he sold his stage bus operations to Wilts & Dorset in February 1939. It is not known if separate [...] "coaching" [...] contracts were retained but what is known is that a firm called Kingston Coaches was set up shortly after WW2 by Mr and Mrs Alf Tedd in Middle Winterslow. Rumour has it that they purchased their first coach from a firm in the London area, and just started using it in its original livery and markings, including fleetname! However, {{it is more likely that}} the new company was resurrected from Grant's business. Both Tedd sons, Gordon and Phil, were involved in the running of the firm, and Phil went on eventually to buy and operate the nearby Amport & District <b>coach</b> <b>firm.</b> Although over the years Kingston operated vehicles of different makes, they favoured Fords with Duple bodywork. The fleet livery was red and sand. Main contracts were with the military (for movement of troops stationed on nearby Salisbury Plain), schools, and local private hire work, together with a heavy commitment to third-party wholesale tour business. They also provided duplicate coaches for Associated Motorways and later National Express. On retirement, the Tedds sold the company to Thamesdown Transport of Swindon, but in 1997, Kingston was sold on to Wilts & Dorset and the fleet of eight coaches was moved to Wilts & Dorset's Salisbury bus depot.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{expansion}} of <b>coaching</b> in <b>firms</b> reflects its potential {{use as a}} tool to improve the development of human capital and of the firm itself. Nevertheless, research into the effects of coaching is lagging some way behind practice and {{there is a need to}} establish a theoretical framework capable of explaining how the coaching process proceeds and its outcomes. The goal of this research is to analyze the effects of coaching in both, employees development, and organizational performance. Thus, we extend Joo’s (2005) conceptual model by adding social exchange theory and the resource-based view, so as to to develop a model that allow us to investigate coaching. Design/methodology/approach: We test our model on a sample of 498 Spanish firms. The hypotheses were analyzed using structural equations modeling. Findings: Our results confirm that coaching has an influence on both individual performance and organizational performance indicators. Besides, social exchange theory and the resource-based view, are a proper frameworks so as to study the effects of coaching. Practical implications: <b>Coaching</b> also helps <b>firms</b> to improve their competitive position. maximise benefits and minimise costs. We highlight several tips for practitioners in order to develop properly coaching processes. Originality/value: <b>Coaching</b> helps <b>firms</b> improve their competitive position via effects on organisational performance, sales increases and productivity growth. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
