5|$|Eldora Speedway, {{which opened}} in 1954, is {{considered}} to be one of 14 intermediate tracks on the Truck Series schedule, the others being Charlotte, Chicagoland, Dover, Homestead-Miami, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Michigan, Phoenix, Pocono, Rockingham and Texas. The track is a 0.5 mile (0.80km) oval with turns at a 24 degree banking, while the straightaways are 8 degrees. The track's grandstands <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> 17,782 spectators, and the hillside seating <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> an unlimited number of fans.|$|E
5|$|The color {{matching}} required in a tiling by Wang dominoes {{can easily be}} achieved by modifying {{the edges of the}} tiles like jigsaw puzzle pieces so that they <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> together only as prescribed by the edge colorings. Raphael Robinson, in a 1971 paper which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> on the screen, and the main character can move up, down, left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{all have the}} same crystal {{structure}} (body-centred cubic) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table. Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water: in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|When {{deoxyhemoglobin}} {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E

25|$|The term rough fish {{is used by}} U.S. state {{agencies}} and anglers to describe undesirable predator fish. In North America, anglers fish for salmon, trout, bass, pike, catfish, walleye and muskellunge. The smallest fish are called panfish, because they <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> in a standard cooking pan. Some examples are crappies, rock bass, perch, bluegill and sunfish.|$|E

25|$|Since {{crayfish}} {{are accustomed}} to being in ponds or rivers, {{they will have a}} tendency to shift gravel around {{on the bottom of the}} tank, creating mounds or trenches to emulate a burrow. Crayfish will often try to climb out of the tank, especially if an opening exists at the top that they <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> through.|$|E
25|$|Copper used in {{building}} wire has a conductivity rating of 100% IACS or better. Copper building wire requires less insulation {{and can be}} installed in smaller conduits than when lower-conductivity conductors are used. Also, comparatively, more copper wire <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> in a given conduit than conductors with lower conductivities. This greater “wire fill” is a special advantage when a system is rewired or expanded.|$|E

After {{receiving}} an overwhelming {{response from the}} public, the seating arrangement for the concert was revised so that it <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> an additional 1000 people, making the final number is 7000 people. Yonder Music also decided to add two more guest Malaysian artists who will be Siti's supporting acts – Joe Flizzow and SonaOne.

25|$|In {{terms of}} size, Sabina Park is still {{relatively}} small. It <b>can</b> <b>fit</b> a 400 metre running track comfortably on its perimeter, but little else, {{and with its}} refurbishing, the capacity has increased to 20,000. With the commissioning of floodlights in August 2014, Sabina Park became {{the last of the}} international grounds in the Caribbean to have this facility. The ground is now capable of hosting day/night matches and this is especially useful for the Caribbean Premier League where the Jamaica Tallawahs play their home games.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of the South American Inca civilization to Mesoamerican civilizations shows the same lack of wheeled vehicles. Although the Incas used a vast network of paved roads, these roads are so rough, steep, and narrow that {{they appear to be}} unsuitable for wheeled use. Bridges that the Inca people built, and even continue to use and maintain today in some remote areas, are straw-rope bridges so narrow (about 2–3 feet wide) that no wheeled vehicle <b>can</b> <b>fit.</b> Inca roads were used mainly by chaski message runners and llama caravans.|$|E
