40|$|Concrete bridge decks are {{susceptible}} to premature deterioration which {{may be caused by}} cracking of the concrete and corrosion of reinforcement. While engineers strive to design bridge decks to have high performance, it has become evident that mixtures that may lead to high strength and low transport properties (i. e., so called high performance concrete) may also have a potential to exhibit increased cracking. Recently, there has been an interest in developing mixtures that also strive to minimize the potential for cracking while providing a dense microstructure that reduces the potential for chloride ingress. ^ Over the last fifteen years there has been growing interest in exploring the use of internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> since it minimizes early age volume changes and corresponding cracking. While the original intention of using internal curing was to reduce autogenous shrinkage, it has been observed that the internally <b>cured</b> <b>concretes</b> have additional benefits. For example previous research has shown that internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> has lower water absorption than comparable conventional (plain concrete mixtures). ^ This thesis examines chloride transport and shrinkage of plain and internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge decks that were cast in the state of Indiana (Monroe Co. near Bloomington) and in the state of New York (Tonawanda and Lisle) in between August and November 2010. In Bloomington, Indiana, two bridge decks were cast in close proximity by the same concrete producer and the same construction crew using the same materials. The first bridge deck used a conventional bridge deck concrete mixture while the second was cast using an internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> mixture. In the state of New York, in the cities of Lisle and Tonawanda, two different bridge deck mixtures were commercially prepared using high strength internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> mixtures at each location. ^ Volume change properties and chloride transport performances were evaluated using a series of experimental techniques. The results indicate that internally <b>cured</b> <b>concretes</b> demonstrate superior performance to plain concrete. A reduction in volume change is observed for internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete.</b> In addition, a reduced chloride transport rate in internally <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> is observed which can result in structures with improved durability. ...|$|R

40|$|Moist curing {{improves}} {{the properties of}} concrete. However, shrinkages at early ages are found to increase with increased curing. The reason for this phenomenon is studied with four binders and two types of curing. The binders are comprised of Portland cement/slag blends with 0, 35, 50 and 65 % of slag. Initial moist curing times of 1 and 7 days were studied. The samples were then exposed to standard drying conditions (23 &# 0176; and 50 % RH). During drying, the moisture losses in 7 -day <b>cured</b> <b>concretes</b> were about 50 % less than in 1 -day cured concretes; however, the early age shrinkages were significantly higher in 7 -day <b>cured</b> <b>concrete.</b> Pore size distribution tests and analyses showed that the pore radius where meniscus forms during drying is smaller in 7 -day <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> due to finer pores, as compared to 1 -day <b>cured</b> <b>concrete.</b> Further, good correlation can be seen between the meniscus radius and shrinkage, regardless of the binder and curing types. This provides the explanation for the increased early age shrinkage with increased curing. Further, this study demonstrates that the capillary tensile force is the governing mechanism for early age shrinkage...|$|R

The concept of the carbonation suppression ratio of paint was presented for evaluation of the anti-carbonation performance of {{the two types of}} paints (exterior and interior paints) when applied to a reference concrete substrate. The test results showed a good linear relationship between the carbonation depths of the paint coated concrete and the square root of exposure times. Concrete with higher strength grade exhibited greater carbonation resistance. The carbonation depth of the C 35 standard <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> was reduced by 56 % in comparison with that of the C 25 standard <b>cured</b> <b>concrete.</b> It was found that concrete substrate prepared by accelerated curing method displayed lower carbonation resistance than standard <b>cured</b> <b>concrete.</b> Compared with the standard cured specimen, the carbonation depth of the accelerated cured specimen increased by 61 % for the control C 25 concrete and by 56 % for the control C 35 concrete. This phenomenon was attributed to the formation of a higher volume of capillary pores in concrete prepared by accelerated curing. Additionally, the exterior paint had a higher carbonation suppression ratio than the interior paint. The suppression ratios of the exterior and interior paint coatings applied on C 25 standard <b>cured</b> <b>concrete</b> were 71 % and 56 %, respectively.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the heat {{generation}} of <b>curing</b> <b>concrete</b> may be reduced by decreasing the cement paste volume of the concrete. However, as the cement paste must be more than sufficient to fill the voids between aggregate particles, the cement paste volume should not be limitlessly decreased. Herein, it is proposed to add an inert filler, such as limestone fines, to fill into the voids between aggregate particles so that a smaller cement paste volume may be used and the heat generation of the concrete may be further reduced. To study the effectiveness of adding limestone fines in reducing the heat generation of <b>curing</b> <b>concrete,</b> a series of concrete mixes with water/cement ratios ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 60 and different amounts of limestone fines added were tested for their workability, strength and heat generation.

40|$|When {{a bridge}} is widened by {{constructing}} a new deck and casting a concrete stitch between the existing deck {{and the new}} deck, it is often required to maintain traffic without interruption {{and as a result}} the <b>curing</b> <b>concrete</b> stitch would be subjected to traffic induced vibration. A number of experimental investigations had been carried out in the past to study the effects of traffic vibration on <b>curing</b> <b>concrete</b> stitches but widely different results were obtained by different researchers due to the different test methods and equipment used. In fact, in the previous investigations, two important loading conditions have not been properly simulated: (1) the concrete stitch should be subjected to contraflexural loading; and (2) the loading transmitted to the concrete stitch should change as the stiffness of the concrete stitch increases with time. Herein, a new test method that the authors have recently developed for application to several bridge widening projects is presented. In this test method, the above loading conditions are simulated and the applied deflection/loading is real time computer controlled by an impedance dependent control program.

40|$|Durable {{and long}} lasting {{concrete}} is important, especially for bridge decks, which {{are susceptible to}} premature cracking and corrosion of the reinforcing steel. To increase the durability of the concrete and its service life, many transportation agencies use high-strength concretes. However, high-strength concretes often have problems with early age cracking due to shrinkage. These cracks can then open a path for chloride ions (found in road salts) to reach the reinforcing steel.

40|$|Atmospheric {{conditions}} {{for several days}} after concrete is poured influence the exothermic, temperature-dependent, hydration reactions of concrete’s cementitious (binding) components. Because excessively high con-crete temperatures or lack of water eventually can lead to cracking, the initial days are critical to determining the concrete’s long-term durability. Accurate model forecasts of concrete temperatures and moisture would help engineers to determine an optimal time to pour. Such forecasts require adequate environmental predictions. Existing models of <b>curing</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge decks employed by engineers lack realistic boundary conditions and so cannot handle many atmospheric conditions. Atmospheric energy exchange parameterizations typically are intended for use over areas much larger than bridges and so may not be useful as boundary conditions in curing-concrete models. To determine proper boundary {{conditions for}} the curing-concrete model discussed here, energy balances of four <b>curing</b> <b>concrete</b> bridge decks were estimated from observations made in the atmosphere as well as inside the concrete. Common meteorological techniques to estimate energy balance terms were used to bound the estimates. Most (70 %– 85 %) of the concrete heat transfer occurred at the bridge’s top. Sensible, latent, net radiative, and runoff water (sprayed on the top surface) heat fluxes, respectively, contributed 6 %– 24 %, 15 %– 58 %, 10 %– 34 %, and 0 %– 73 % of the top surface heat transfer. Bottom heat transfer was less than 30 % of the top surface transfer. Laboratory calorimetry and the energy balance results agree to within 20 % that the hydration reactions evolved about 190 kJ kg 21 by 24 h after mixing. This agreement validates the exchange coefficients proposed for the heat and moisture balances of these small areas both during periods when the concrete generated heat and later when the concrete was more passive in its environment. 1...|$|E
