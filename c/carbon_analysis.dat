With use of the Pirani principle, which measures the pressure dependent thermal conductivity of air, promising results have been observed. A relative resistance change of 6 % within the pressure range of 1 - 10 Torr has been observed. This is comparable to, and even greater than, previous studies. The device has a good response for the desired pressure range. The device sensitivity was studied with different currents and geometric parameters. The results showed that the sensitivity is highly dependent on current and air volume.

5000|$|There are no {{recorded}} {{references to}} the horn dance prior to Robert Plot's Natural History of Staffordshire, written in 1686. However, there is {{a record of the}} hobby horse being used in Abbots Bromley as early as 1532, and {{it is possible that the}} horn dance component of the custom was also present at that time but not commented upon by the writer. A <b>carbon</b> <b>analysis</b> discovered that the antlers used in the dance date to the 11th century - though these may well have replaced an even older set. According to some, the use of antlers suggests an Anglo-Saxon origin along with other native Anglo-Saxon traditions that have survived into modern times in various forms. It has been speculated, for example, that the dance originated in the pagan period and was connected with the ruling dynasty of Mercia, based some 15 miles away at Tamworth, who owned extensive hunting lands in Needwood Forest and Cannock Chase surrounding Abbots Bromley. On this theory, the royal forester would have organised sympathetic magic rituals to ensure a plentiful catch each year, a tradition that survived into Christian times and gradually came to be seen as affirming the villagers' hunting rights. Even when the lands were granted to Burton Abbey in 1004 a forester would still need to have been employed. By the 16th century, when the abbey was dissolved, this was a hereditary position with the title [...] "Forester of Bentylee" [...] (Bentylee being the wooded area of the parish). From then until the 19th century the dance remained the traditional prerogative of the Bentley family, eventually passing to the Fowell family in 1914. The Fowells continue to run it to this day.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As multi-wall carbon {{nanotubes}} (MWCNTs) {{come to be}} used in a {{wider range}} of products, increasing production is expected to result in greater exposure of workers to MWCNTs. In this research, we present a method for evaluating the concentration of MWCNT aerosols distinctively {{on the basis of the}} elemental carbon (EC) concentration. Respirable dust is sampled using a Sioutas cascade impactor (SCI) for a certain volume of workplace air. The SCI can collect size-segregated particles having aerodynamic diameters of 2. 5 μm, 1. 0 μm, 0. 5 μm, 0. 25 μm and < 0. 25 μm. MWCNTs in sampled particles are determined by <b>carbon</b> <b>analysis.</b> Based on the phenomenon that MWCNTs easily aggregate/agglomerate, the present procedure for distinguishing MWCNTs uses the EC in particles larger than 1 μm as an index of MWCNT; the EC is oxidized at a high temperature, 920 °C, in <b>carbon</b> <b>analysis.</b> We propose a three-step procedure for distinguishing between MWCNT aerosol and atmospheric particulate matter, and for measuring MWCNT concentrations in workplace air on the basis of EC concentration...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The study {{analyzes}} the carbon footprint {{of the waste}} oil management system operating in Portugal to ensure the sustainable operation in the future. The analysis {{was carried out in}} 2011 for the system that is composed of a treatment procedure collecting the treated oil for re-refining, followed by the production of expanded clay and recycling for electricity production. Methodology: <b>Carbon</b> footprint <b>analysis</b> was conducted by using the Umberto software 5. 5 based on the concepts of life cycle assessment with respect to international standards (ISO). Within this context, the substances considered for such <b>carbon</b> footprint <b>analysis</b> are directly relevant to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). Results: The results showed that managing waste oils may contribute to the reduction of carbon footprint due to the avoided emissions of greenhouse gas through the reuse of treated waste oils. The carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from collection and treatment of waste oils would not outweigh such benefit earned from the substitution of virgin lubricant oil even though the use of treated waste oils for producing expanded clay may end up some more carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion: The <b>carbon</b> footprint <b>analysis</b> in this study has shown the potential for improvements in the waste oil management system in Portugal. The most significant improvement that could be made is the increase of using treated waste oils for the expanded clay production. However, such a strategy would not be consistent with the waste hierarchy principle which dominates the current decision making in managing waste nationally...|$|R
