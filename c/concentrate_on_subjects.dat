Pabst's films of the 1920s <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>subjects</b> such as abortion, prostitution, labor disputes, homosexuality, and addiction. His cool and critical 1925 Joyless Street is a landmark of the objective style. [...] Pabst's 1930 pacifist sound film Westfront 1918 views the World War I experience in a bleak, matter-of-fact way. [...] With its clear denunciation of war, it was soon banned as unsuitable for public viewing.|$|E

50|$|The {{management}} programs at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology includes general management, airline management and airport management. Graduates {{of these programs}} are able to secure entry-level to mid-level management positions in small or large corporations and in airports. The field of airport management is a unique discipline with its roots in general business, but driven by the high-tech world of aviation and transportation. Students of the airport management degree program <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>subjects</b> as diverse as wildlife hazards, eco-system management, airfield safety, and emergency planning and control. The Bachelor of Science airport management degree was developed to provide students proficiency {{in all areas of}} airport operations. The location of the College, adjacent to LaGuardia Airport, provides a learning environment unsurpassed with regard to activities, resources and personnel. Students are given the ability to investigate first-hand the areas of airport management, control of ground vehicles, communication systems, airport security, fire and rescue service, terminal planning and management, and airport maintenance.|$|E

Drawing on the author’s fiveyear teaching experience at Yamagata University, including two years in international students’ education, it focuses exclusively on their cultural education, i. e., classes given outside their Japanese language education, with particular reference to those they can participate in without or with little Japanese ability. Such classes {{are becoming more and more}} important with the desire to raise the number of international students in Japan. It is most important that such classes <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>subjects</b> both interesting for short-term students and important for the understanding of the country, and are accessible for Japanese native speakers as well...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{tries to}} answer the question: ‘Which {{mechanisms}} can be identified within China and Western Europe that {{have a positive effect}} on the development of episteme and might even help to put it on a cumulative path of increasing returns, and what mechanisms may have thwarted this?’. By episteme is meant the total pool of available non-prescriptive, scientific knowledge. By researching and comparing the realities of the situations in both Western Europe and China to the newly devised ‘T-shaped model’, which identifies the positive mechanisms leading up to epistemic growth, an attempt is made to illustrate the differences in the paths of epistemic development Western Europe and China had. The two main differences seem to have been ‘Freedom & Finance’, or independence and economic incentives. Firstly, China’s Imperial structure of government allowed little independence. The rise of higher education possessing a certain degree of independence, including all the benefits that could come from it, was thereby thwarted. Secondly, there were little economic incentives in China to pursue epistemic growth. In fact, the Imperial system of examinations and the rewards it potentially offered formed a large incentive to <b>concentrate</b> <b>on</b> <b>subjects</b> of a more philosophical nature. Subjects like mathematics and physics were rarely studied...|$|E
