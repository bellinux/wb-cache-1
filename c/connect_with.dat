5|$|Also in Brooklyn, the BMT Canarsie Line {{would gain}} an eastern branch to Spring Creek, serving Starrett City (now Spring Creek Towers). The {{mainline}} {{would also be}} lengthened from its southern terminus at Rockaway Parkway to a new terminus in Midwood and Flatlands near the existing Flatbush Avenue–Brooklyn College IRT station. The reroute would not use the existing segment between New Lots Avenue and Rockaway Parkway. Later plans suggested extending the line as far west as McDonald Avenue near the Avenue I station of the IND Culver Line or possibly to New Utrecht Avenue to the New Utrecht Avenue/62nd Street station, creating crosstown service through central Brooklyn. It was also proposed to relocate the Canarsie Line west of its current right-of-way south of Broadway Junction, along the parallel LIRR Bay Ridge Branch (currently a freight-only branch) or in the median of the proposed Queens Interboro Expressway and Cross Brooklyn Expressway, {{which would have been}} built along both the LIRR branch and Linden Boulevard. The re-alignment would have facilitated both extensions. The current Bushwick Avenue, Broadway Junction and Atlantic Avenue stations would have been consolidated into one station on the Bay Ridge Line, new Sutter Avenue and Livonia Avenue stations would have been built, and the East 105th Street station would be replaced with a station at Rockaway Avenue on the Bay Ridge Line. Additional stations would have been built at Remsen Avenue, Ralph Avenue, Utica Avenue to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> the Utica Avenue Line, Nostrand Avenue to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> the Nostrand Avenue Line, Avenue H to <b>connect</b> <b>with</b> the Brighton Line, and McDonald Avenue to connect to the Culver Line before terminating at New Utrecht Avenue.|$|E
