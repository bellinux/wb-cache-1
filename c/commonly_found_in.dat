They are more <b>commonly</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> seagrass patches in water less than 1.5m (5ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6m (11–20ft). A South Australian field study on wrack and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae.|$|E
5|$|A single fungal serpin {{has been}} {{characterized}} to date: celpin from Piromyces spp. strain E2. Piromyces is a genus of anaerobic fungi found in the gut of ruminants and is important for digesting plant material. Celpin is predicted to be inhibitory and contains two N-terminal dockerin domains {{in addition to its}} serpin domain. Dockerins are <b>commonly</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> proteins that localise to the fungal cellulosome, a large extracellular multiprotein complex that breaks down cellulose. It is therefore suggested that celpin may protect the cellulosome against plant proteases. Certain bacterial serpins similarly localize to the cellulosome.|$|E
