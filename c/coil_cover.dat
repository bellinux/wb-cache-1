Since water temperature in the range of 45 °C to 50 °C is considered suitable for the domestic use, the presented design can easily reach the temperatures even higher than those acceptable for the domestic use...|$|E

For extending the previous study by Jafarimoghaddam et al., we selected the nanoparticles with the average size of 20 nm and also other conditions of the experiment are based on Jafarimoghaddam et al.

The effects of different parameters such as flow Reynolds number and nanofluid particle concentration on heat transfer coefficient are studied. The acquired experimental data were used to establish a correlation for predicting Nusselt number of nanofluid flow inside the annular tube. This correlation has been presented by using the exponential regression analysis and least square method.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Acceleration of intra-aneurysmal clot {{organization}} and fibrosis {{may be a}} solution to preventing aneurysm recanalization after endovascular treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the short-term efficacy and long-term safety of the new Matrix coil system. Methods—Matrix coils consist of thin platinum <b>coils</b> <b>covered</b> with a bioabsorbable, polymeric material (polyglycolic acid/lactide). Fifty-two experimental aneurysms were created in 26 swine. All of the aneurysms were tightly packed with Matrix or Guglielmi detachable coils (GDC). Comparative angiographic and histopathologic data were analyzed at 2 weeks (n 14), 3 months (n 6), and 6 months (n 6) after embolization. Results—Three aneurysms treated with GDC ruptured despite tight packing. No recanalization or rupturing was observed in the aneurysms embolized with Matrix coils. At 14 days after embolization, the aneurysms treated with Matrix coils exhibited a more extensive area of organized thrombus when compared with the aneurysms treated with GDC (87 % versus 75 %, P 0. 008, n 11). At 3 months, both Matrix and GDC-treated aneurysms demonstrated complete clot organization. Neck tissue thickness was higher in Matrix-treated aneurysms at 14 days and 3 months, but not at 6 months. No untoward parent artery stenosis was observed in aneurysms treated with Matrix during follow-up. The angiographic cross-sectional area of the Matrix-treated aneurysms was smaller than those treated with GDC at the 3 months...|$|R

40|$|The TRW Pulsed Inductive Thruster (PIT) is an {{electromagnetic}} propulsion {{system that can}} provide high thrust efficiency {{over a wide range}} of specific impulse values. In its basic form, the PIT consists of a flat spiral <b>coil</b> <b>covered</b> by a thin dielectric plate. A pulsed gas injection nozzle distributes a thin layer of gas propellant across the plate surface {{at the same time that}} a pulsed high current discharge is sent through the coil. The rising current creates a time varying magnetic field, which in turn induces a strong azimuthal electric field above the coil. The electric field ionizes the gas propellant and generates an azimuthal current flow in the resulting plasma. The current in the plasma and the current in the coil flow in opposite directions, providing a mutual repulsion that rapidly blows the ionized propellant away from the plate to provide thrust. The thrust and specific impulse can be tailored by adjusting the discharge power, pulse repetition rate, and propellant mass flow, and there is minimal if any erosion due to the electrodeless nature of the discharge. Prior single-shot experiment,; performed with a Diameter diameter version of the PIT at TRW demonstrated specific impulse values between 2, 000 seconds and 8, 000 seconds, with thruster efficiencies of about 52 % for ammonia. This paper outlines current and planned activities to transition the single shot device into a multiple repetition rate thruster capable of supporting NASA strategic enterprise missions...|$|R

40|$|Summary: A new, coated {{bioactive}} coil {{has been}} developed to improve the long-term results of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms. The purpose of this preliminary study {{was to assess the}} feasibility and safety of selective embolization of intracranial aneurysms with Matrix coils in 20 consecutive patients. Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms by endosaccular coil placement has become an accepted alternative to surgical clip placement (1); however, the main disadvantage of this technique compared with surgery is aneurysm recurrence (2), especially for large aneurysmal sacs or wide-necked aneurysms. To circumvent this potential limitation, many investiga-tions are currently evaluating new coils, including biologically active coils (3), radioactive coils (4), and coated coils with a swelling hydrogel (5). The aim of these innovations is to promote intra-aneurysmal clot organization and fibrosis (3, 4) or to increase packing density (5), which is associated with a higher long-term occlusion rate (6). The complete Matrix coils (Target Therapeutics, Fremont, CA) product line has recently become available, but no study has yet eval-uated the feasibility of endovascular treatment with these coils. We report our experience of selective embolization with Matrix coils in 20 consecutive pa-tients with an intracranial aneurysm. Technique Matrix detachable coils are platinum <b>coils</b> <b>covered</b> with a bioabsorbable polymer (90 % polyglycolide, 10 % polyactide) and attached to a stainless steel delivery wire. The coil consists of 70 % polymer and 30 % platinum. The details of coil charac-teristics were described elsewhere (7), and the detachment system is the same as that used with Guglielmi detachable coils (GDCs). The product line {{is similar to that of}} bare GDCs and includes 3 D and 2 D coils. Variable degrees of stiffness are available, including standard, soft, and ultrasoft coils...|$|R
30|$|The cell {{biological}} investigations on mixed multilayers further {{reveal that}} the PEM film conformation is not sensed as a property of a homogeneous 3 D-volume phase by the cells, since a difference in cell density was observed on PGA compared to CS terminated films. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} (PLL-PGA)n–(PLL-CS)x multilayers display a bizonal structure with distinct polypeptide conformations. When the number of CS bilayers x increases the superficial, random <b>coiled</b> zones <b>covers</b> the tightly packed underlying (PLL-PGA)n. Consequently, both the content of conformation B in the film volume and the conformation of the surface exposed layers affect the cell response. When the top layers of the mixed multilayers with similar content of conformation B are composed of random coiled chains, their inherent mechanical softness negatively interferes with cell spreading and proliferation.|$|R

50|$|The plasma {{confinement}} {{in the best}} RFP's is only about 1% as good as in the best tokamaks. One {{reason for this is}} that all existing RFP's are relatively small.
