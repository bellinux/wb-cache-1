40|$|M. B. A. The {{debate over}} plant {{biotechnology}} and genetic engineering (GE) is surrounded with controversy. On {{the one side}} of the debate, phrases such as `Frankenfood' and `terminator seed' have been used to describe food and seed resulting from plant biotechnology. On the other hand, Agricultural Scientists see biotechnology and genetic engineering as a solution to keep feeding and clothing the increasing world population with static or reducing world resources. Many farmers in developing countries eke out a living based on the production techniques that are becoming increasingly unaffordable because of increasing inputs cost and are no longer producing enough output to provide adequate access to food. Plant biotechnology holds the potential for increasing the productivity of agriculture in developing countries. New crop varieties are developed which are resistant to insects and are tolerant to certain non-selective herbicides. All these plant biotechnology developments are said to help reduce the cost of inputs, protects yields and reduce environmental contamination with toxic insect sprays. For many commercial farmers, cotton production is the only possibility they have to produce a cash crop but spraying to control insect pests is required several times during the season resulting in high input costs. An alternative to spraying is to introduce a built-in defense into the plant itself to combat insect damage. The introduction of the insecticidal gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into the cotton plant trough biotechnology, has secured a built-in defense against the most common insect family in cotton namely the lepidopteran <b>caterpillar.</b> <b>Cotton</b> engineered with such genes was introduced into commercial production {{for the first time in}} 1996 with over 1. 8 million acres planted with transgenic cotton in the US. Following early trials, Bt-cotton has since the 1998 / 99 growing season been commercialized in South Africa. Since the introduction of genetically engineered (GE) crops, US farmers have rapidly adopted most of them. Analyses by USDA's Economic Research Services (ERS) and others indicate economic benefits to many farmers adopting first-generation GE crops. This research study was carried out to determine to what extend the South African cotton growers embraced this kind of technology through usage thereof and if they benefited as much as other cotton farmers world-wide. The specific research objectives for this study were as follows: An evaluation of the adoption rates and benefits derived from plant biotechnology on a worldwide base through literature. An evaluation of the acceptance and penetration of Bt-cotton amongst the South African commercial cotton growers. To determine the benefits of Bt-cotton to the South African commercial cotton growers. To determine to what extend the South African cotton growers benefited economically through the use of the Bt-cotton trait. To identify segmental differences in the adoption of the Bt-cotton trait amongst commercial cotton growers in South Africa. The main findings of this research indicate that almost three quarters of the cotton hectares surveyed were planted with the Bt-cotton trait and that almost ninety percent of cotton growers surveyed, adopted the Bt-cotton trait in the 2001 / 2002 season. Comparing the benefits derived from Bt-cotton in South Africa to those in other countries, it can be concluded that the South African commercial cotton growers had equal results. Most of the cotton growers in South Africa experienced yield increases with a substantial reduction in the use of insecticides. This resulted in higher gross margins from Bt-cotton compared to the non-Bt cotton or commercial cotton varieties. The South African commercial cotton grower has benefited agronomically, economically and environmentally through the adoption of the Bt-cotton trait. Future introductions of plant biotechnology traits such as herbicide tolerance will further enhance the production potential of cotton...|$|R
40|$|Protecting {{plants and}} killing pests Cue: In recent years, a farming method called Integrated Pest Management has become {{increasingly}} popular with farmers in Africa, particularly those growing vegetable crops. But what does Integrated Pest Management, or IPM, actually mean? As its name implies, IPM involves combining, or integrating, many different farming practices {{in order to find}} a solution to a difficult problem, that of controlling pests. These methods may include the use of chemical pesticides, but in using such chemicals an IPM farmer will firstly make a careful assessment of the type and number of pests attacking the crop, so that pesticides can be applied in an appropriate way. This both reduces the cost for the farmer, since less pesticide is wasted, and also causes less damage to the environment. For example, helpful insects, known as pest predators, {{are less likely to be}} affected. Mr Joseph Mambu is an agricultural researcher who has worked for the Cotton Development Corporation in Cameroon for many years, particularly in the north of the country. Martha Chindong spoke to him about the danger of pests for cotton production, and how his organisation is helping farmers in the north of Cameroon to tackle the problem. IN:		?(Vernac) After beans, in this area ? OUT:		? to destroy the cotton plants. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 16 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Joseph Mambu of the Cotton Development Corporation in Cameroon, with some advice for how farmers can reduce pest attacks on their cotton plants. Transcript Mambu	(Vernac) After beans, in this area cotton is the next crop mostly attacked by pests and if not treated we will loose more than 80 % of the produce. Chindong	What are the main pests of cotton? Mambu	(Vernac) The most dangerous <b>cotton</b> pests are <b>caterpillars</b> as well as some bacterial infection. Chindong	This means that a lot of pesticides are needed in growing cotton. Am I right? Mambu	(Vernac) This entails the use of much pesticide to grow cotton. Chindong	Can the pesticides be used in a sustainable way, so as not to affect the farmer and his environment? Mambu	(Vernac) We advise farmers to always protect themselves before and during the use of these chemicals. That is to put on eyeglasses, nose masks and they should also clean themselves after the use of these chemicals. We used to apply the chemicals quickly, at random, without any tests. To reduce costs and waste of chemicals, as well as the harm done to the environment, we later carried out tests to know the level of pest attack and whether or not to treat the farm. If, for example, we find 20 insects within the population of 100 cotton plants, the farm is declared infested and we treat these farms twice a month. Chindong	Considering that you reduced the treatment from 4 times a month to only 2 times, were the results still encouraging? Mambu	(Vernac) With this approach the results were encouraging. Chindong	Is there a possibility to use Integrated Pest Management in growing cotton? Mambu	(Vernac) Of course Integrated Pest Management can be used in growing cotton. First the use of resistant varieties is recommended, but we do give farmers treated seeds in order to produce quality cotton for the market. This is because the resistant varieties may give good yield but not necessarily quality cotton. We also advise that the farmers respect the planting season, for early planting can avoid certain treatments carried out with chemicals. And also early harvesting will reduce the number of times to treat the farm. Because if harvesting is delayed there is an insect that usually attacks the cotton fibre as soon as the cotton bud opens. And this also will entail that after this harvest we will have to treat the cotton again before use. If this happens the farmer will have to carry out the supplementary treatment that will bring extra costs and waste of chemicals. So farmers should then follow the advice of the agriculture technicians placed at their disposal. Chindong	Is there any other thing that you would have loved us to share on this topic? Mambu	(Vernac) Cotton farmers in the north have succeeded to produce an insecticide from a mixture of soap and kerosene. This effectively killed insects that attack the cotton, but the product is short lived, for should it rain this product would be washed away. Cotton as we know is a mono-cultivated crop, that is it can only be cultivated on its own without associating other plants. However, we can try to associate another plant to the cotton, like the pepper, whose repulsive affects on insects are well known, and this can also help to repel the pest that will come to destroy the cotton plants.
