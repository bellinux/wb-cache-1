25|$|Sing Sing Correctional Facility is {{a maximum}} {{security}} prison {{operated by the}} New York State Department of Corrections and <b>Community</b> <b>Supervision</b> {{in the village of}} Ossining, in the U.S. state of New York. It is located about 30 miles (50km) north of New York City on the east bank of the Hudson River.|$|E
25|$|In 2006-07 nine {{small towns}} (between 5,000 and 25,000 inhabitants) across Peru {{introduced}} a new water and sanitation management model, under which the community is being more empowered, including through deciding themselves about {{a certain level of}} service quality, such as low-cost technologies, and corresponding tariffs. Subsequently the municipality hires a specialized operator who is being regulated by a <b>Community</b> <b>Supervision</b> Board under a Public-Private-Social Partnership. The specialized operator can be a private or a mixed company. The aim of the new approach was to break with the low-level equilibrium of poor service quality and poor cost recovery that prevails throughout small towns in Peru, under which poor quality water services are provided directly by the municipality. The new approach was supported through the Small Town Pilot Project (STPP) of the Ministry of Housing, with technical support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and financial support of US$ 6.6 million from the Canadian International Development Agency for limited infrastructure investments and training for both the operator and members of the <b>Community</b> <b>Supervision</b> Boards. After the municipal elections of 2007, 3 new mayors decided to abandon the new approach and to return to the old model of direct municipal management. In the 6 other cities specialized operators continue to operate.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the items}} {{passed in the}} {{legislative}} session were a bill allowing optometrists to perform eye surgery (a procedure usually reserved for ophthalmologists), {{a ban on the}} sale of a psychoactive drug marketed as [...] "bath salts", and a measure allowing <b>community</b> <b>supervision</b> and addiction treatment as jail alternatives for non-violent drug criminals. Measures that did not pass included tougher measures to curb illegal immigration advocated by Williams and raising the legal age for dropping out of high school from sixteen to eighteen, a proposal supported by Beshear. Also, the Assembly was unable to agree on whether to adopt Beshear's plan to address a shortfall in the state's Medicaid obligations or an alternative plan proposed by Williams. Beshear's plan involved moving $166 million from the second year of the biennial budget to cover the shortfall and cover the costs in the second year through savings achieved by switching to a managed care plan for Medicaid. Williams' plan, passed by the Republican majority in the state senate, called for $101 million in cuts to state government spending to cover the shortfall. Without a plan in place, Beshear estimated that the state would have to cut Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers by 30 percent.|$|E
