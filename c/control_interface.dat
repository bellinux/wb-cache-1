40|$|Adults with DMD {{can benefit}} from active arm {{supports}} that augment their residual functional capabilities. However, intuitively controlled and fully actuated arm supports are currently not commercially available and adults with DMD are limited to use external robotic arms which contribute to the disuse of their arms. To fill this gap {{in the field of}} arm supports, we have developed EMGand force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> that have been implemented in two new active arm supports: the A-Arm and the Active A-Gear. We found that both EMGand force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> are feasible solutions for the control of active arm support for adults with DMD that have lost their arm function a long time ago. The comparative studies between EMG and force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> indicated that, in general, EMG-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> are better suited for adults with DMD than force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> as they are experienced as less fatiguing. Nevertheless, force-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> with active gravity and joint-stiffness compensation can be a better alternative for those cases in which voluntary forces would still be higher than the intrinsic forces of the arms. This conclusion has an indicative value, as it is based on a low number of subjects. In any case, the decision on the most suited interface will have to be taken based on the specificities of each subject. In conclusion, by developing these new <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> and implementing them in new active assistive devices, we made a significant step in improving arm supports for adults with DMD. Hopefully, these novel concepts of arm supports will be the basis for the development of commercially available active arm supports for people with severe muscular weakness. The control and assistive strategies developed in the Flextension A-Gear project may be applicable to other patient groups with muscular weakness...|$|R

40|$|Tangible {{lighting}} controls' {{is used as}} {{an umbrella}} term to describe lighting control systems {{that are easy to}} understand and pleasurable to use by end-users. The crucial question posed is, {{what is the nature of}} interface designs sought by end-users for maximising interaction with lighting control systems? The manner in which this question is posed implies a fundamental assumption that improved usability and end-user experience are the primary goals. The concept of end-user understanding of lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> is proposed as a basis for improving the usability and end-user experience of lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Usability engineering methods involving survey research, experimental mock-ups and prototyping have been used to enable end-users to design and evaluate lighting <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The essential difference is to include end-users' point of view about ease of understanding control functions and pleasure of performing control tasks along with a technical point of view about meeting required standards.

40|$|Background: The {{performance}} {{capabilities and}} limitations of <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> for the operation of active movement-assistive devices remain unclear. Selecting an optimal interface for an application requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the performance of multiple <b>control</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Methods: In this study the performance of EMG-, force- and joystick-based <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> were assessed in healthy volunteers with a screen-based one-dimensional position-tracking task. The participants had to track a target that was moving according to a multisine signal with a bandwidth of 3 Hz. The velocity of the cursor was proportional to the interface signal. The performance of the <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> were evaluated in terms of tracking error, gain margin crossover frequency, information transmission rate and effort. Results: None of the evaluated interfaces was superior in all four performance descriptors. The EMG-based interface was superior in tracking error and gain margin crossover frequency compared to the force- and the joystick-based interfaces. The force-based interface provided higher information transmission rate and lower effort than the EMG-based interface. The joystick-based interface did not present any significant difference with the force-based interface for any of the four performance descriptors. We found that significant differences in terms of tracking error and information transmission rate were present beyond 0. 9 and 1. 4 Hz respectively. Conclusions: Despite the fact that the EMG-based interface is far from the natural way of interacting with the environment, while the force-based interface is closer, the EMG-based interface presented very similar and for some descriptors even a better performance than the force-based interface for frequencies below 1. 4 Hz. The classical joystick presented a similar performance to the force-based interface and holds the advantage of being a well established <b>interface</b> for the <b>control</b> of many assistive devices. From these findings we concluded that all the <b>control</b> <b>interfaces</b> considered in this study can be regarded as a candidate <b>interface</b> for the <b>control</b> of an active arm support.

In addition to this organization, Logic Pro X allows individuals to trigger 'solo,' 'mute,' and 'volume' controls for each group. Further improvements were made to score editing, exporting (now compatible with MusicXML format), and introduces MIDI plug-in compatibility.
