40|$|Lipid-based liquid {{crystalline}} {{materials have}} been proposed as controlled drug delivery systems. Differences in liquid crystal nanostructure have previously been shown to change drug diffusion and hence release, however {{there has been little}} progress towards the use of in situ changes to nanostructure to control drug release. In this study, phytantriol and glyceryl monooleate-based bicontinuous cubic (Q(2)) and inverse hexagonal (H- 2) nanostructures have been designed to allow change to the nanostructure in response to external change in temperature, with a view to controlling drug release rates in vivo. Changes to nanostructure with temperature were confirmed by crossed polarised optical microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. Phytantriol containing 3 % (w/w) vitamin E acetate provided the necessary phase transition behaviour to progress this system to in vitro release and in vivo proof of concept studies. Using glucose as a model hydrophilic drug, drug diffusion was shown to be reversible on switching between the H- 2 and Q(2) nanostructures at temperatures above and below physiological temperature respectively. An in vivo proof of concept study in rats showed that after subcutaneous administration of these materials, the changes in nanostructure induced by application of a heat or <b>cool</b> <b>pack</b> at the injection site stimulated changes in drug release from the matrix anticipated from in vitro release behaviour, thereby demonstrating the potential utility of these systems as 'on demand' drug release delivery vehicles. © 2009, Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Neonatology is {{a branch}} of {{pediatrics}} that deals with the medical care of newborn infants. Neonatal Encephalopathy is a clinical and not an etiologic term that describes an abnormal non-behavioral state consisting of decreased level of consciousness and usually other signs of brain stem and/or motor dysfunction. Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy is a disorder caused due to birth asphyxia. Asphyxia means lack of oxygen. Therapeutic hypothermia {{has been shown to}} decrease the risk of brain injury in newborn. Brain hypothermia, is induced by cooling a baby to around 35 °C for three days after birth. Some of the cooling methods are antipyretics, fans, ice packs, cold fluids, water filled blankets or garments, forced cold air and cool caps. Cool tub is the most prevalent technology. It is a tub designed to cool the brain of neonates with oxygen deprivation during birth in order to prevent brain damage. The cool tub has cooling unit, in which cooling is provided by <b>cool</b> <b>pack</b> placed in it, infant should placed within four hours of birth. The baby was placed in the tub for 72 hours after which the baby’s temperature is slowly raised again over the following four hours. The idea of the cool tub is to cool the brain soon after the injury to stop cell suicide in the brain. The aim of this work is to monitor the temperature of the baby and hence maintain the same by automatically cooling and re-warming the material inside the cap. This process is done using temperature transducer, microcontroller, cooling unit and a warming unit...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft Environmental Control Systems (ECS) are {{designed}} to optimize passenger comfort by providing satisfactory cabin pressurization, and temperature and humidity control whilst minimising the risks to passenger health from airborne toxins and diseases. The paper presents a case study that investigates how the cooling load discharge from an ECS system affects the flow behaviour inside a typical mid-size, wide-body aircraft passenger cabin. The investigation uses commercial off-the-shelf one dimensional (1 D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software to model the <b>cooling</b> <b>pack,</b> cabin air distribution system, and {{three quarters of the}} passenger cabin. The centre section of the cabin is modelled using a commercial off-the-shelf three dimensional (3 D) CFD package, with the co-simulation middleware providing coupling adapters to ensure that two-way, bilateral exchange of boundary parameters between the 1 D and the 3 D CFD models gives continuity of mass and momentum transfer. The 1 D and 3 D CFD applications and Co-simulation middleware are supplied by 3 independent commercial organisations. The results of the case study are discussed including the co-simulated 'velocity field of the air discharge' and the 'temperature gradient inside the cabin' within the 3 D CFD model as well as the flow and temperature fields within the one-dimensional ECS <b>cooling</b> <b>pack</b> model.

40|$|Background: Information {{regarding}} {{the variability of}} metabolite levels over time in an individual is required to estimate the reproducibility of metabolite measurements. In intervention studies, {{it is critical to}} appropriately judge changes that are elicited by any kind of intervention. The pre-analytic phase (collection, transport and sample processing) is a particularly important component of data quality in multi-center studies. Methods: Reliability of metabolites (within-and between-person variance, intraclass correlation coefficient) and stability (shipment simulation at different temperatures, use of gel-barrier collection tubes, freeze-thaw cycles) were analyzed in fasting serum and plasma samples of 22 healthy human subjects using a targeted LC-MS approach. Results: Reliability of metabolite measurements was higher in serum compared to plasma samples and was good in most saturated short-and medium-chain acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and hexose.

40|$|Pre-cooling {{is used by}} {{many athletes}} {{for the purpose of}} {{reducing}} body temperature prior to exercise and, consequently, decreasing heat stress and improving performance. Although there are a considerable number of studies showing beneficial effects of pre-cooling, definite conclusions on the effectiveness of pre-cooling on performance cannot yet be drawn. Moreover, detailed analyses of the specific conditions under which pre-cooling may be most promising are, so far, missing. Therefore, we conducted a literature search and located 27 peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials, which addressed the effects of pre-cooling on performance. These studies were analysed with regard to performance effects and several test circumstances (environmental temperature, test protocol, cooling method, aerobic capacity of the subjects). Eighteen studies were performed in a hot (> 26 °C) environment and eight in a moderate. The cooling protocols were water application (n = 12), <b>cooling</b> <b>packs</b> (n = 3), cold drinks (n = 2), cooling vest (n = 6) and a cooled room (n = 4). The following different performance tests were used: short-term, high-intensity sprints (n = 2), intermittent sprints (n = 6), time trials (n = 10), open-end tests (n = 7) and graded exercise tests (n = 2). If possible, subjects were grouped into different aerobic capacity levels according to their maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) : medium 55 - 65 mL/kg/min (n = 11) and high > 65 mL/kg/min (n = 6). For all studies the relative changes of performance due to pre-cooling compared with a control condition, as well as effect sizes (Hedges' g) were calculated. Mean values were weighted according to the number of subjects in each study. Pre-cooling had a larger effect on performance in hot (+ 6. 6 %, g = 0. 62) than in moderate temperatures (+ 1. 4 %, g = 0. 004). The largest performance enhancements were found for endurance tests like open-end tests (+ 8. 6 %, g = 0. 52), graded exercise tests (+ 6. 0 %, g = 0. 44) and time trials (+ 4. 2 %, g = 0. 44). A similar effect was observed for intermittent sprints (+ 3. 3 %, g = 0. 43), whereas performance changes were smaller during short-term, high-intensity sprints (- 0. 5 %, g = 0. 03). The most promising cooling methods were cold drinks (+ 15. 0 %, g = 1. 68), <b>cooling</b> <b>packs</b> (+ 5. 6 %, g = 0. 70) and a cooled room (+ 10. 7 %, g = 0. 49), whereas a cooling vest (+ 4. 8 %, g = 0. 31) and water application (+ 1. 2 %, g = 0. 21) showed only small effects. With respect to aerobic capacity, the best results were found in the subjects with the highest VO 2 max (high + 7. 7 %, g = 0. 65; medium + 3. 8 %, g = 0. 27). There were four studies analysing endurance-trained athletes under time-trial conditions, which, in a practical sense, seem to be most relevant. Those studies found an average effect on performance of 3. 7 % (g = 0. 48). In summary, pre-cooling can effectively enhance endurance performance, particularly in hot environments, whereas sprint exercise is barely affected. In particular, well trained athletes may benefit in a typical competition setting with practical and relevant effects. With respect to feasibility, cold drinks, <b>cooling</b> <b>packs</b> and <b>cooling</b> vests can be regarded as best-practice methods...|$|R

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact of some poultry slaughtering stages such as bleeding, depluming, evisceration, washing, <b>cooling,</b> <b>packing</b> –on the carcasses germ flora. The experiment took place in a slaughtering house situated in Iasi County, Romania. The evaluation was accomplished by the following microbiological parameters: total number of germs (TNG), Coliformi fecali, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli. The samples were gathered for five months from a total number of 180 “Ross 308 ” poultry carcasses, which were randomly chosen during the slaughtering. The biological material comes from the poultry growing specialized farms. As for the evolutional point of view, the largest germ charge on the carcasses surface was noticed just after the deplumation and evisceration.

Strength of recommendation was assessed by the European League Against Rheumatism visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Nine key recommendations were generated, including topics for general management, treatment of acute attacks, prophylaxis against recurrent acute attacks and management of chronic symptoms. It was recommended that optimal treatment requires both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. For acute CPP crystal arthritis, <b>cool</b> <b>packs,</b> temporary rest and joint aspiration combined with steroid injection are often sufficient. For prophylaxis or chronic inflammatory arthritis with CPPD, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with gastroprotective treatment and/or low-dose colchicine 0. 5 - 1. 0 mg daily may be used. Other recommendations included parenteral or oral corticosteroid for acute CPP arthritis in those unresponsive or unsuited to other measures, and low-dose corticosteroid, methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine for chronic inflammatory arthritis with CPPD. Asymptomatic CPPD requires no treatment. Strength of recommendations varies from 79 % to 95 %.
