50|$|These {{surfactants}} {{prevent the}} nanoparticles from clumping together, {{ensuring that the}} particles do not form aggregates that become too heavy {{to be held in}} suspension by Brownian motion. The magnetic particles in an ideal ferrofluid do not settle out, even when exposed to a strong magnetic, or gravitational field. A surfactant has a polar head and non-polar tail (or vice versa), one of which adsorbs to a nanoparticle, while the non-polar tail (or polar head) sticks out into the <b>carrier</b> <b>medium,</b> forming an inverse or regular micelle, respectively, around the particle.

50|$|Several MTA {{products}} are available as sealer. MTA Plus {{has the highest}} percentage of MTA in its formula. As calcium based materials have washout property in dam, the antiwashout agents are used. The examples are chitosan and gelatin, which has been used with injectable bone grafting paste. MTA Plus is used with gelatin complex as antiwashout agent. MTA Angelus Fillapex sealer contains less than 20% tri/dicalcium silicate powder in a salicylate <b>carrier</b> <b>medium</b> similar to Sealapex. By element analysis, there is no bismuth oxide of MTA. EndoSeal MTA, Tech BioSeal MTA are also MTA root canal sealesr. MTA is used as filler in the resin like MTA Fillapex.

50|$|These {{surfactants}} {{serve to}} decrease the rate of ferroparticle settling, of which a high rate is an unfavorable characteristic of MR fluids. The ideal MR fluid would never settle, but developing this ideal fluid is as highly improbable as developing a perpetual motion machine according to our current understanding {{of the laws of}} physics. Surfactant-aided prolonged settling is typically achieved in one of two ways: by addition of surfactants, and by addition of spherical ferromagnetic nanoparticles. Addition of the nanoparticles results in the larger particles staying suspended longer since to the non-settling nanoparticles interfere with the settling of the larger micrometre-scale particles due to Brownian motion. Addition of a surfactant allows micelles to form around the ferroparticles. A surfactant has a polar head and non-polar tail (or vice versa), one of which adsorbs to a nanoparticle, while the non-polar tail (or polar head) sticks out into the <b>carrier</b> <b>medium,</b> forming an inverse or regular micelle,respectively, around the particle. This increases the effective particle diameter. Steric repulsion then prevents heavy agglomeration of the particles in their settled state, which makes fluid remixing (particle redispersion) occur far faster and with less effort. For example, magnetorheological dampers will remix within one cycle with a surfactant additive, but are nearly impossible to remix without them.|$|E
50|$|The {{acoustic}} separation {{method has}} great potential in many applications. First, {{it can be}} used as blood washing tool in open-heart surgery. In general, blood shed in the chest cavity during surgery, e.g. coronary bypass, is collected and returned to the patient via a filter. This blood is commonly contaminated by triglycerides from adipose tissue undergoing surgery. However, when autotransfusion is performed, millions of small lipid particles (lipid microemboli) pass straight through the filter and are introduced into the patient‚Äôs circulatory system, resulting in microembolisation of the capillary network in the bodily organs and subsequent local ischemic tissue damage. This becomes most obvious with regard to the brain. Elevated levels of cognitive dysfunction have been linked to lipid microembolisation of the brain. No dedicated methods to remove lipid microemboli are currently available. Autotransfusion is clearly preferred in spite of the aspects of microembolisation since returning the patient‚Äôs own blood reduces the strain on the blood banks. In addition, it eliminates transfusion-transmitted disease, immunologic reactions, and the risk of blood group incompatibility. In the case of extensive blood loss, blood wash devices based on centrifuges can be used. Second, the ability to separate suspended particles from the <b>carrier</b> <b>medium</b> also enables the continuous blood washing in situations where the blood plasma may be heavily contaminated by coagulation factors or inflammatory components. Third, the separation of microogranisms from blood flow other medium will facilitate the detection and identification of pathogens. Fourth, an acoustic separator can serve as a continuous flow particle filter to sort out particles based on size. Such a device will be useful in the characterization and production of nanomaterials.|$|E
