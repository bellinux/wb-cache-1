40|$|Abstract: The key {{processing}} unit, the “cold box", {{is fundamentally}} responsible for air extraction and separation. The <b>cold</b> <b>box</b> {{is critical in}} the Sasol Chemical Industries (SCI) environment, due {{to the importance of}} oxygen in several processes. Due to the criticality of the equipment, it became necessary to streamline the maintenance process utilized on the <b>cold</b> <b>box.</b> Irregular and unplanned maintenance can lead to unforeseen events and may have safety and environmental implications. The maintenance philosophy that is followed to maintain the equipment is of utmost importance. Sasol conducts maintenance on their <b>cold</b> <b>box</b> with a black box approach, which makes it difficult for the maintenance team to predict failures, resulting in significant losses. The study investigates the potential benefits of an alternative maintenance strategy. The key focus of the research includes an evaluation on the impact of an alternative maintenance approach has on the reliability and stability of the equipment. The research approach includes a global literature study providing potential options for improvements. The viability of these options was tested via a questionnaire conducted with plant personnel with current plant personnel. The questionnaire consists of 28 questions, which are formulated to determine certain data relating to the research question. The questions are divided into six categories, as it is extracted from the relevant sections. See details in Appendix A The categories are: 1. Challenges in the different air separation processes 2. Maintenance management 3. Maintenance planning 4. Maintenance strategy 5. Reliability management 6. Quality management and the reliability centred maintenance (RCM) process On completion of the data collection, the data was thoroughly validated to verify that the information is relevant to the research topic. Each maintenance management division’s data was tabulated based on the response of the individuals and analyzed thoroughly to extract the conclusions of the collected data (Maxwell, 2002). The results {{of the respondents indicated that}} proactive maintenance and all aspects thereof is the key to success for improving the reliability of the <b>cold</b> <b>box.</b> Reliability engineering management is essential for the stability of the <b>cold</b> <b>box.</b> M.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cryogenic}} {{system for}} the KSTAR superconducting magnets has been commissioned. It consists of a <b>cold</b> <b>box,</b> distribution boxes (DB) and cryogenic transfer lines. The <b>cold</b> <b>box</b> and DB # 1 provide 600 g/s of supercritical helium to cool the superconducting (SC) magnets, their SC bus-lines, and the magnet support structures. It also provides 17. 5 g/s of liquid helium to the current leads and supplies cold helium flow to the thermal shields. The cooling power of the <b>cold</b> <b>box</b> at 4. 5 K equivalent is 9 kW which is extracted by 6 turboexpanders. The DB # 1 includes 49 cryogenic valves, 2 supercritical helium circulators, 1 cold compressor, and 7 heat exchangers immersed in a 6 m 3 liquid helium storage bath. The main duties of the DB # 2 are the relative distribution of the cryogenic helium among the cooling channels of each KSTAR cold component and the emergency release of over-pressurized helium during abnormal events such as quenches of the SC magnets. After individual commissioning, the system was integrated and cooled down with the KSTAR device. In this paper, the construction and commissioning results of the KSTAR cryogenic system will be introduced. In addition, we will present the cool-down results of the KSTAR device. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{medium scale}} {{hydrogen}} liquefaction plant is presented and its efficiency analyzed {{on the basis}} of exergy. In a first step, the operating principal of a medium scale hydrogen liquefier is presented. The liquefaction plant consists of a compressor system and a vacuum insulated <b>cold</b> <b>box</b> where the liquefaction takes place. In the <b>cold</b> <b>box,</b> the refrigeration capacity required to liquefy the hydrogen is provided by a hydrogen refrigerant cycle and a liquid nitrogen pre-cooling step. The cooling capacity is extracted from high pressure hydrogen through oil bearing turbines and cooling takes place in aluminum plate fin heat exchangers. Secondly, an extensive exergy analysis of the liquefaction process considering the exergy losses of each step will be presented. The exergy losses in hydrogen liquefaction are caused within the liquefier itself, for example in the compressor system or the turbines, but also occur during filling procedure of the liquid hydrogen in trailers, or distribution of the liquefied hydrogen. Within this paper the efficiency of the liquefaction process from gaseous hydrogen supply to the delivery of liquid hydrogen into the storage tank will be discussed...|$|R
