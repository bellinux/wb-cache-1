40|$|Abstract. Konjac Glucomannan (KGM) was {{modified}} by maleic anhydride (MA). The influences of processing parameters on the mechanical properties of KGM films were investigated through orthogonal experiments. The {{results showed that}} the effects of pH, temperature and time of KGM swelling on tensile strength and folding endurance of modified KGM membranes were insignificant (FF 0. 01). Folding endurance and tensile strength of KGM membranes could be improved by proper addition of MA. The optimum conditions of KGM modification were that the mixture of KGM and MA was swelling at pH 4. 0 and 60 °C for 2 h, and then <b>cast</b> <b>on</b> a <b>flat</b> and dried at 50 °C to give modified KGM membranes...|$|R
40|$|Two {{processes}} {{are known to}} make panes in West Europe during the Roman period: they may be <b>cast</b> <b>on</b> a <b>flat</b> surface or manufactured by the cylinder-blown process. The aim of our research is to give physico-chemical arguments to distinguish between both methods by using IR and Raman spectroscopies to determine the fictive temperature Tf of the archaeological samples. The position of the 1050 cm- 1 band in the IR reflection spectra of annealed samples versus Tf has been studied, giving a calibration curve to determine the Tf of the archaeological sample. The position of the 1100 cm- 1 Raman band and {{the ratio of the}} Q 2 /Q 3 Raman bands intensities are also studied versus Tf for annealed samples. The Tf of both sides are found to be different, which is an argument in favor of the cast metho...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} novel structural motifs {{known as}} "plum pudding" gels as potential drug-eluting stent coatings. Controlled {{delivery of a}} HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) from the intravascular stent surface represents a potential therapeutic modality for prevention of in-stent restenosis (ISR). In this study, gels were comprised of fluvastatin-loaded thermoresponsive microgel particles containing the relatively hydrophilic N-isopropyl-acrylamide (NiPAAm), mixed with the more hydrophobic N-tert-butylacrylamide (NtBAAm) in different wt/wt ratios: 85 / 15, 65 / 35, and 50 / 50, randomly dispersed in a 65 / 35 or 85 / 15 NiPAAm/NtBAAm copolymer matrix. Fluvastatin release from 5 mu m copolymer films was greatest from the most hydrophilic systems and least from the more hydrophobic systems. Release from hydrophobic matrices appeared to be via Fickian diffusion, enabling use of the Stokes-Einstein equation to determine diffusion coefficients. Release from hydrophilic matrices was nonFickian. Fluted drug retained its bioactivity, assessed as selective inhibition of human coronary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. When stainless steel stent wires were coated (25 mu m thickness) with fluvastatin-loaded 65 / 35 microgels in an 85 / 15 copolymer matrix, drug elution into static and perfused flow environments followed similar elution profiles. In contrast to elution from copolymer films <b>cast</b> <b>on</b> <b>flat</b> surfaces, diffusion from stent wires coated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic systems both followed Fickian patterns, with slightly larger diffusion coefficients for elution from the flow system. We conclude that manipulation of the relative hydrophobicities of both microgel and matrix components of "plum pudding" gels results in tightly regulated release of fluvastatin over an extended time period relevant to initiation and propagation of ISR.

30|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} usually exhibit remarkably high {{specific}} capacities as lithium-ion battery anode materials, {{and they are}} believed to be promising anode materials to replace the commercial graphite anode [1 – 5]. Among various transition metal oxides, cobalt monoxide (CoO) has drawn great attention due to its high theoretical capacity of 716  mA h g− 1 which is nearly twice than that of graphite anode [2, 6]. Nevertheless, this anode material suffers from large volumetric change during discharging/charging cycles, leading to pulverization and capacity fading of bulk electrode. Nanostructural design with specific architectures has been demonstrated as an effective way to alleviate the volumetric change of active materials, such as Si [7], Ge [8], and transition metal oxides [6, 9], because lots of voids or pores’ presence in the nanostructures can accommodate the volumetric expansion of the active materials during lithiation process. Specially, one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures such as nanowires or nanofibers are proved to be an optimized architecture for the electrochemical electrodes due to their well-defined charge transport path, high specific surface area, and high porosity features [6, 10 – 12]. Nevertheless, in traditional battery electrode preparation, these 1 D nanostructures are usually mixed with binders and conductive additives before being tape <b>casted</b> <b>on</b> a <b>flat</b> current collector to enhance mechanical and electrical properties of electrodes [12, 13]. The introduction of binders and additives not only reduces the energy density of the electrode but also generates undesired interfaces between the active materials and the additives, which increases the complexity of charge transfer process [14].|$|R
40|$|Techniques for {{producing}} electronic devices of {{smaller and smaller}} dimensions are currently a major area of electronics research. The ultimate goal of nanoelectronics, however, {{is not just to}} build smaller versions of current electronic devices, but to exploit new phenomena. Nanometer-size metal particles are investigated in the present study as building blocks for novel electronic materials with novel physical properties. ^ Metal nanoparticles are grown as aerosol particles in a unique gas aggregation reactor. The Multiple Expansion Cluster Source (MECS) can produce nanoparticles (or clusters) with mean diameters in the 1 - 10 nm range with a narrow size distribution. Cluster-based thin films are formed either from clusters deposited directly onto a substrate in a vacuum chamber or from clusters stabilized as colloidal particles in an organic solvent and cast onto the substrate. Colloidal stabilization is achieved by the formation of a self-assembled monolayer of alkanethiol surfactant molecules on the surface of each cluster produced in the MECS. ^ Vacuum deposition of bare metal clusters is investigated as an alternative technique {{for producing}} metal interconnect lines. The film growth process and the electrical transport properties of such cluster-based metal interconnects is compared with those of conventional atomically deposited interconnects. The resistance of cluster-based interconnects to electromigration damage at high current densities is also investigated and is found to be superior to that of atomically deposited interconnects. ^ Casting of colloidal metal clusters onto a flat substrate is investigated as a way of producing novel thin films that conduct electricity by single electron tunneling. When <b>cast</b> <b>on</b> a <b>flat</b> substrate (MoS 2, HOPG, SiO 2), the nanometer size clusters group to form close-packed monolayer arrays. The effects of substrate material, colloid concentration, and chemical annealing on the quality of these arrays is studied. Electronically-linked networks of gold clusters are synthesized, and initial measurements of their electrical conductivity are made. ...|$|R
