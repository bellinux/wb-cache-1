It has been shown that the penetration rate was controlled by a diffusion mechanism at 1450 °C, capillaries being the main channels of initial slag penetration into the refractory. In the penetration process, calcium silicate was formed on the surfaces of MgO grains, and around them by reaction between the grain boundary and mayenite, as a main phase of slag with a low melting point. Dissolution of the refractory components in the slag supported the penetration process at 1600 °C.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>crucible</b> scale <b>testing</b> with actual {{radioactive}} Tank 48 H material was {{to duplicate the}} test results that had been previously performed on simulant Tank 48 H material. The earlier <b>crucible</b> scale <b>testing</b> using simulants was successful in demonstrating that bench scale <b>crucible</b> <b>tests</b> produce results that are indicative of actual Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR) pilot scale tests. Thus, comparison of the results using radioactive Tank 48 H feed to those reported earlier with simulants would then provide proof that the radioactive tank waste behaves {{in a similar manner}} to the simulant. Demonstration of similar behavior for the actual radioactive Tank 48 H slurry to the simulant is important as a preliminary or preparation step for the more complex bench-scale steam reformer unit that is planned for radioactive application in the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) Shielded Cells Facility (SCF) later in 2008. The goals of this crucible-scale testing were to show 99 % destruction of tetraphenylborate and to demonstrate that the final solid product produced is sodium carbonate. Testing protocol was repeated using the specifications of earlier simulant <b>crucible</b> scale <b>testing,</b> that is sealed high purity alumina crucibles containing a pre-carbonated and evaporated Tank 48 H material. Sealing of the crucibles was accomplished by using an inorganic 'nepheline' sealant. The sealed crucibles were heat-treated at 650 C under constant argon flow to inert the system. Final product REDOX measurements were performed to establish the REDuction/OXidation (REDOX) state of known amounts of added iron species in the final product. These REDOX measurements confirm the processing conditions (pyrolysis occurring at low oxygen fugacity) of the sealed crucible environment which is the environment actually achieved in the fluidized bed steam reformer process. Solid product dissolution in water was used to measure soluble cations and anions, and to investigate insoluble fractions of the product solids. Radioanalytical measurements were performed on the Tank 48 H feed material and on the dissolved products in order to estimate retention of Cs- 137 in the process. All aspects of prior <b>crucible</b> scale <b>testing</b> with simulant Tank 48 H slurry were demonstrated to be repeatable with the actual radioactive feed. Tetraphenylborate destruction was shown to be > 99 % and the final solid product is sodium carbonate crystalline material. Less than 10 wt% of the final solid products are insoluble components comprised of Fe/Ni/Cr/Mn containing sludge components and Ti from monosodium titanate present in Tank 48 H. REDOX measurements on the radioactive solid products indicate a reducing atmosphere with extremely low oxygen fugacity [...] evidence that the sealed <b>crucible</b> <b>tests</b> performed {{in the presence of a}} reductant (sugar) under constant argon purge were successful in duplicating the pyrolysis reactions occurring with the Tank 48 H feed. Soluble anion measurements confirm that using sugar as reductant at 1 X stoichiometry was successful in destroying nitrate/nitrite in the Tank 48 H feed. Radioanalytical measurements indicate that {approx} 75 % of the starting Cs- 137 is retained in the solid product. No attempts were made to analyze/measure other potential Cs- 137 in the process, i. e., as possible volatile components on the inner surface of the alumina crucible/lid or as offgas escaping the sealed crucible. The collective results from these <b>crucible</b> scale <b>tests</b> on radioactive material are in good agreement with simulant <b>testing.</b> <b>Crucible</b> scale processing has been shown to duplicate the complex reactions of an actual fluidized bed steam reformer.

This {{was performed by}} a refractory <b>crucible</b> <b>test</b> in a vacuum induction furnace at 1520 – 1545 °C under reducing atmosphere. The results indicate that Mn, Si and a minor amount of Fe in the steel were oxidized at steel/refractory interface, combing with refractory components to form a MnO–SiO 2 –Al 2 O 3 –based slag. This slag was liquid at the testing temperature, and infiltrated along the open-pore network and the grain boundaries into the Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 refractories. Both Al 2 O 3 –rich and Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 aggregates in the refractories dissolved into the infiltrating slag. As a result, the refractories were structurally weakened and residual Al 2 O 3 –rich and Al 2 O 3 –SiO 2 aggregates in the hot face of the refractories were washed away into the liquid steel, affecting steel quality. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Corrosion {{measurements}} {{on a set}} of alumina-mullite-zircon refractories have been carried out using a static <b>crucible</b> <b>test</b> consisting of a “hole in a block”. Rates of corrosion of the refractory at 1370 °C for 72 h by a standard soda-lime glass were evaluated by measuring selected dimensions within the hole, flux line loss, and the thickness of refractory penetrated by the molten glass. The extent of corrosion decreased with increasing refractory zircon content, and increased with increasing porosity. Wetting of the refractory by the glass decreased with increasing zircon content. Porosity and wettability are therefore believed to be major factors determining the susceptibility to penetration of the refractory by the glass, and thereby controlling the rate of corrosion. Microstructural features of the interfacial zone were examined by SEM: zirconia derived from the zircon appears to be much less reactive towards the molten glass than alumina. Undissolved zirconia particles may therefore be particularly effective in providing physical and energy barriers to penetration of the refractory pores by molten glass...|$|E

40|$|Over {{a decade}} ago, an in-tank {{precipitation}} process to remove Cs- 137 from radioactive high level waste (HLW) supernates was demonstrated at the Savannah River Site (SRS). The full scale demonstration with actual HLW {{was performed in}} SRS Tank 48 (T 48). Sodium tetraphenylborate (NaTPB) was added to enable Cs- 137 extraction as CsTPB. The CsTPB, an organic, and its decomposition products proved to be problematic for subsequent processing of the Cs- 137 precipitate in the SRS HLW vitrification facility for ultimate disposal in a HLW repository. Fluidized Bed Steam Reforming (FBSR) is being considered as a technology for destroying the organics and nitrates in the T 48 waste to render it compatible with subsequent HLW vitrification. During FBSR processing the T 48 waste is converted into organic-free and nitrate-free carbonate-based minerals which are water soluble. The soluble nature of the carbonate-based minerals allows them to be dissolved and pumped to the vitrification facility or returned to the tank farm for future vitrification. The initial use of the FBSR process for T 48 waste was demonstrated with simulated waste in 2003 at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) using a specially designed sealed <b>crucible</b> <b>test</b> that reproduces the FBSR pyrolysis reactions, i. e. carbonate formation, organic and nitrate destruction.

The static <b>crucible</b> corrosion <b>tests</b> were carried out in laboratory resistive furnace at 850 °C during 2 h air atmosphere. Two standards of alumina-silica shaped refractory bricks were used as a corroding material. Pure sodium chloride and potassium chloride were applied as a corrosive media. The results of tests were evaluated by macroscopic, microscopic, chemical and semiquantitative EDX analysis. Sodium chloride shows more significant penetration and chemical interaction in penetrated area. EDX analysis confirms creation of the reaction layer between chlorides and elements of refractory lining. The products of reactions penetrate more deeply into A lining. K ions penetrate into the grains of the lining more intense than Na ions...|$|R
40|$|A {{glass ceramic}} waste form is being {{developed}} for treatment of secondary waste streams generated by aqueous reprocessing of commercial used nuclear fuel (Crum et al. 2012 b). The waste stream contains a mixture of transition metals, alkali, alkaline earths, and lanthanides, several of which exceed the solubility limits of a single phase borosilicate glass (Crum et al. 2009; Caurant et al. 2007). A multi-phase glass ceramic waste form allows incorporation of insoluble components of the waste by designed crystallization into durable heat tolerant phases. The glass ceramic formulation and processing targets {{the formation of the}} following three stable crystalline phases: (1) powellite (XMoO 4) where X can be (Ca, Sr, Ba, and/or Ln), (2) oxyapatite Yx,Z(10 -x) Si 6 O 26 where Y is alkaline earth, Z is Ln, and (3) lanthanide borosilicate (Ln 5 BSi 2 O 13). These three phases incorporate the waste components that are above the solubility limit of a single-phase borosilicate glass. The glass ceramic is designed to be a single phase melt, just like a borosilicate glass, and then crystallize upon slow cooling to form the targeted phases. The slow cooling schedule is based on the centerline cooling profile of a 2 foot diameter canister such as the Hanford High-Level Waste canister. Up to this point, <b>crucible</b> <b>testing</b> has been used for glass ceramic development, with cold crucible induction melter (CCIM) targeted as the ultimate processing technology for the waste form. Idaho National Laboratory (INL) will conduct a scaled CCIM test in FY 2012 with a glass ceramic to demonstrate the processing behavior. This Data Package documents the laboratory studies of the glass ceramic composition to support the CCIM test. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) measured melt viscosity, electrical conductivity, and crystallization behavior upon cooling to identify a processing window (temperature range) for melter operation and cooling profiles necessary to crystallize the targeted phases in the waste form...|$|R
40|$|Prostitution {{is often}} viewed in feminist theory as {{the sine qua}} non of the female {{condition}} under patriarchy. Frequently cited as 'the absolute embodiment of patriarchal male privilege' (Kesler, 2002 : 19), the highly gendered nature of commercial sex appears to offer a graphic example of male domination, exercised through the medium of sexuality. This construction is, however, as convincing as it is problematic. By reviewing the work of Shelia Jeffries, Judith Walkowitz, Gail Pheterson, Shannon Bell, Jo Doezema, Kamala Kempadoo and Jo Phoenix, I aim to illustrate that feminist writers, by assuming different theoretical lenses, offer diverse interpretations of the subject of prostitution - both in terms of women's subjective positions and as a problem of a particular type. Prostitution therefore rather than having a singular meaning is more usefully viewed as an important <b>crucible</b> for <b>testing</b> the central mainstays of feminist theory...|$|R
40|$|Flexible microwires {{fabricated}} from conducting polymers have a {{wide range}} of po-tential applications, including smart textiles that incorporate sensing, actuation, and data processing. The development of garments that integrate these functionalities over wide areas (i. e. the human body) requires the production of long, highly con-ductive, and mechanically robust fibers or microwires. This thesis describes the de-velopment of a microwire slicing instrument capable of producing conducting polymer wires with widths as small as a few micrometers and lengths ranging from tens of mil-limeters to meters. To ensure high conductivity and robustness, the wires are sliced from thin polypyrrole films electrodeposited onto a glassy carbon <b>crucible.</b> Extensive <b>testing</b> was conducted to determine the optimal cutting parameters for producing long, fine wires with cleanly cut edges. This versatile fabrication process has been used to produce free-standing microwires with cross-sections of 2 pm x 3 pm, 20 p...|$|R

40|$|During the {{smelting}} {{process of}} secondary raw materials, ZnO-containing fayalite (ZFS) slags {{can be generated}} in copper smelters. ZnO changes both the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the slag, which can consequently influence the corrosion behaviour of the refractory lining of the copper smelter. Besides ZnO, the levels of FeO and CaO in such fayalite-based slags need to be adjusted to meet the operation requirements during copper smelting, which consequently influence the properties of the slags. Therefore, the impact of the slag composition variation on the refractory lining of a secondary copper smelter was systematically investigated by lab scale tests in this work. For this, both rotating finger <b>tests</b> and <b>crucible</b> <b>tests</b> were performed using either the direct-bonded magnesia-chromite refractory (as industrially applied) or pure MgO (as this phase in the refractory is more severely attacked by the slag than the chromite). The slag composition was modified by varying ZnO contents from 0, 10 to 20 wt%, the FeO/SiO 2 ratio from 0. 4, 1. 0, 1. 4 to 1. 8 and the CaO/SiO 2 ratio from 0. 04, 0. 07, 0. 12, 0. 24 to 0. 34. From the microstructural and compositional analyses, it is concluded that within the tested range, ZnO has a similar role as FeO and no additional degradation mechanisms are introduced. For high ZnO containing slags (i. e. 20 wt% ZnO), the MgO solubility is minimal at a ratio of FeO/SiO 2 of 1. 7 (for CaO/SiO 2 = 0. 04), whereas it continuously increases with augmenting CaO/SiO 2 ratios (for FeO/SiO 2 = 1. 4). Based on the identified degradation mechanisms, a next series of lab scale tests with a high ZnO content (20 wt% ZnO) slag was designed to evaluate the effect of temperature, refractory type and a prior infiltration by a Cu-CuxO-PbO mixture on the occurrence of the degradation mechanisms and the slag infiltration depth. It is observed that the direct-bonded refractory has a higher resistance against the infiltration of the Cu-CuxO-PbO mixture, whereas the fused grain refractory exhibits a higher resistance to chemical attack by the slag. The infiltration of the slag is more enhanced in the fused grain refractory by the higher infiltration depth of the Cu-CuxO mixture than {{in the case of the}} direct-bonded refractory. The presence of Cu-CuxO phase can cause chemical attack by the slag at higher depths in the refractory. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{recovery}} of cerium (and possibly other rare earth elements) from the spent glass-polishing slurries is rather {{difficult because of}} a high resistance of polishing-grade cerium oxide toward common digestion agents. It was shown that cerium may be extracted from the spent polishing slurries by leaching with strong mineral acids {{in the presence of}} reducing agents; the solution may be used directly for the preparation of a ceria-based reactive sorbent. A mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide was effective in the digestion of partially dewatered glass-polishing slurry. After the removal of undissolved particles, cerous carbonate was precipitated by gaseous NH 3 and CO 2. Cerium oxide was prepared by a thermal decomposition of the carbonate precursor in an open <b>crucible</b> and <b>tested</b> as reactive sorbent for the degradation of highly toxic organophosphate compounds. The samples annealed at the optimal temperature of approximately 400 °C exhibited a good degradation efficiency toward the organophosphate pesticide fenchlorphos and the nerve agents soman and VX. The extraction/precipitation procedure recovers approximately 70 % of cerium oxide from the spent polishing slurry. The presence of minor amounts of lanthanum does not disturb the degradation efficiency...|$|R
