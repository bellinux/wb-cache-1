This is a compromise between the ideal image creation of a room and that of practicality and compatibility with two-channel stereo. Because most surround sound mixes are produced for 5.1 surround (6 channels), larger setups require matrixes or processors to feed the additional speakers.|$|E

40|$|The {{statistical}} analysis of the RMS delay spread is achieved {{based on the results}} obtained from an outdoor time-varying ultra-wideband (UWB) channel measurement. The paper reports on the RMS delay spread values, the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and the probability density functions (PDFs) for the measured <b>channel</b> <b>configurations</b> with their estimated parameters. Findings show how the RMS delay spread values are fluctuating for different <b>channel</b> <b>configurations</b> within the same measurement campaign. For example, 35 ns and 2. 5 ns have been obtained for different channels. The differences in the measured instantaneous RMS delay spread leads to obtaining different PDFs that fit the measured data where Generalized Pareto distribution is dominant. The relation between the RMS delay spread and the channel path loss has been studied. Positive correlation is seen for all measured channels with different amounts. The highest correlation value is 0. 7675 while the lowest is 0. 2951. The coherence bandwidth analysis is also conducted, and the values are fluctuating as the case of the RMS delay spread. The obtained values varies between 325. 3 MHz and 5. 7 MHz...|$|R

50|$|Vacuum MD {{contains}} an air gap <b>channel</b> <b>configuration.</b> Once it has {{passed through the}} membrane, the vapour is sucked out of the permeate channel and condenses outside the module as with SWGMD. VCMD and DWGMD can be applied for the separation of volatile substances from a watery solution or for the generation of pure water from concentrated salt water.One advantage of this method is that undissolved inert gasses blocking the membrane pores are sucked out by the vacuum, leaving a larger effective membrane surface active. Furthermore, a reduction of the boiling point results in a comparable amount of product at lower overall temperatures and lower temperature differences through the membrane.A lower required temperature difference leaves a lower total- and specific thermal energy demand. However, the generation of a vacuum, which must be adjusted to the salt water temperature, requires complex technical equipment and is therefore a disadvantage to this method. The electrical energy demand is a lot higher as with DCMD and AGMD. An additional problem is the increase of the pH value due to the removal of CO2 from the feed water.|$|E
50|$|Sweeping-gas MD, {{also known}} as air stripping, uses a <b>channel</b> <b>configuration</b> with an empty gap on the {{permeate}} side. This configuration {{is the same as}} in AGMD. Condensation of the vapour takes place outside the MD module in an external condenser. As with AGMD, volatile substances with a low surface tension can be distilled with this process. The advantage of SWGMD over AGMD is the significant reduction of the barrier to the mass transport through forced flow. Hereby higher surface-related productwater mass flows can be achieved than with AGMD. A disadvantage of SWGMD caused by the gas component and therefore the higher total mass flow, is the necessity of a higher condenser capacity.When using smaller gas mass flows there is a risk of the gas heating itself at the hot membrane surface, thus reducing the vapour pressure difference and therefore the driving force. One solution of this problem for SWGMD and for AGMD is the use of a cooled walling for the permeate channel, and maintaining temperature by flushing it with gas.|$|E

For large magnetic fields, some of the vortices become pinned outside of the channels, leading to magnetic hysteresis in the critical current.

50|$|The {{complete}} <b>channel</b> <b>configuration</b> {{consists of}} a condenser channel with inlet and outlet and an evaporator channel with inlet and outlet. These two channels are separated by the hydrophobic, micro porous membrane. For cooling, the condenser channel is flooded with fresh water and the evaporator e.g. with salty feed water. The coolant enters the condenser channel at a temperature of 20 Â°C. After passing through the membrane, the vapour condenses in the cooling water, releasing its latent heat and leading to a temperature increase in the coolant. Sensible heat conduction also heats the cooling water through {{the surface of the}} membrane. Due to the mass transport through the membrane the mass flow in the evaporator decreases whilst the condenser channel increases by the same amount. The mass flow of pre-heated coolant leaves the condenser channel at a temperature of about 72 Â°C and enters a heat exchanger, thus pre-heating the feed water. This feed water is then delivered to a further heat source and finally enters the evaporator channel of the MD module at a temperature of 80 Â°C. The evaporation process extracts latent heat from the feed flow, which cools down the feed increasingly in flow direction. Additional heat reduction occurs due to sensible heat passing through the membrane. The cooled feed water leaves the evaporator channel at approximately 28 Â°C. Total temperature differences between condenser inlet and evaporator outlet and condenser inlet and evaporator outlet are about equal. In a PGMD module, the permeate channel is separated from the condenser channel by a condensation surface. This enables the direct use of a salt water feed as coolant, since it does not come into contact with the permeate. Considering this, the cooling-or feed water entering the condenser channel at a temperature T1 can now also be used to cool the permeate. Condensation of vapour takes place inside the liquid permeate. Pre-heated feed water that was used to cool the condenser can be conducted directly to a heat source for final heating, after leaving the condenser at a temperature T2. After it has reached temperature T3 it is guided into the evaporator. Permeate is extracted at temperature T5 and the cooled brine is discharged at temperature T4.|$|E
