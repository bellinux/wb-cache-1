40|$|Latex {{microspheres}} (diameter, 8 μm) were {{coated with}} anti-Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antiserum (anti-F 38 biotype). The coated microspheres, {{when used in}} a latex agglutination test (LAT), detected M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae antigen in the serum of goats with <b>contagious</b> <b>caprine</b> <b>pleuropneumoniae</b> (CCPP). Beads also agglutinated strongly {{in the presence of}} purified M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Preabsorption of CPS-specific antibodies prior to coating of the beads removed agglutinating activity in the presence of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, strongly suggesting that CPS is the likely soluble antigen recognized by the test. In addition, the specificity of the LAT exactly mirrored that of an M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae CPS-specific monoclonal antibody (WM 25) : of the 8 other mycoplasma species tested, agglutination was observed only with bovine serogroup 7. The LAT detected all 11 strains of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae examined in this study, with a sensitivity level of 2 ng of CPS, or the equivalent of 1. 7 × 104 CFU, in a reaction volume of 0. 03 ml of serum. With field sera from goats with CCPP, the results of the LAT exhibited a 67 % correlation with the results of the currently used complement fixation test (CFT), with the main discrepancy in diagnosis resulting from the increased sensitivity of the LAT compared to that of CFT. This antigen-detection LAT should prove particularly useful in identifying animals in the earliest stages of CCPP and combines sensitivity and low cost with ease of application in the field, without the need for any specialist training or equipment...|$|R

40|$|Sheep {{and goats}} {{are a major}} source of income (cash) and food protein for rural farmers in most part of the tropics. In spite of the {{numerical}} importance of small ruminants in Ethiopia, their productivity is still low due to poor management, diseases and indaequate nutrition. Direct and indirect losses occur through mortalities, reduced weight gain, poor reproductive performance and condemnation of diseased organs at the abattoir. This paper describes the main production systems (pastoral, mixed farming and smallholder farming systems) and the major constraints to small ruminant production in Ethiopia. It is suggested that effective control strategies of infectious diseases e. g.

The study involved goats from the field, livestock markets and abattoirs.

A total of 96 lungs samples, 96 lymph node and 59 pleural fluids were collected for microbiological and molecular evaluation. Media used were Hayflick’s medium (H 25 P) and commercial freeze-dried diagnostic medium for mycoplasma isolation, blood and MacConkey agar for bacteria other than mycoplasma.

40|$|International audienceContagious <b>caprine</b> <b>pleuropneumonia</b> (CCPP), {{caused by}} Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (Mccp), is a devastating disease of {{domestic}} goats and of some wild ungulate species. The disease is currently spreading in Africa and Asia and poses {{a serious threat}} to disease-free areas. A comprehensive view of the evolutionary history and dynamics of Mccp is essential to understand the epidemiology of CCPP. Yet, analysing the diversity of genetically monomorphic pathogens, such as Mccp, is complicated due to their low variability. In this study, the molecular epidemiology and evolution of CCPP was investigated using a large-scale genomic approach based on next-generation sequencing technologies, applied to a sample of strains representing the global distribution of this disease. A highly discriminatory multigene typing system was developed, allowing the differentiation of 24 haplotypes among 25 Mccp strains distributed in six genotyping groups, which showed some correlation with geographic origin. A Bayesian approach was used to infer the first robust phylogeny of the species and to date the principal events of its evolutionary history. The emergence of Mccp was estimated only at about 270  years ago, which explains the low genetic diversity of this species despite its high mutation rate, evaluated at 1. 3 [*]×[*] 10 − 6 substitutions per site per year. Finally, plausible scenarios were proposed to elucidate the evolution and dynamics of CCPP in Asia and Africa, though limited by the paucity of Mccp strains, particularly in Asia. This study shows how combining large-scale genomic data with spatial and temporal data makes it possible to obtain a comprehensive view of the epidemiology of CCPP, a precondition for the development of improved disease surveillance and control measures...|$|R

A logistic regression model was developed to assess the association between the risk factors and CCPP sero-positivity. Of the 54 flocks, 49 (90. 7 %) presented at least one sero-positive animal. Two hundred and four of the 432 goats tested sero-positive at monoclonal antibody based competitive Enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (c-ELISA), hence a sero-prevalence of 47. 2 % (95 % CI = 42. 5 –[*] 51. 9). Previous exposure of flocks to CCPP (p < 0. 001, OR = 52. 8; CI = 6. 45, 432), distant sources of veterinary drugs (p < 0. 001, OR = 6. 17; CI = 3. 41, 11. 1), movement of goats to dry season feeding areas (p < 0. 001, OR = 4. 31; CI = 2. 39, 7. 75) and markets {{as a source of}} new introductions to the flock (p = 0. 033, OR = 1. 86; CI = 1. 05, 3. 27) were identified as risk factors significantly associated with CCPP sero-prevalence.
