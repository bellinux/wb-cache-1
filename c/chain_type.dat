Eleven sera from women with long past history of rubella, two hyperimmune and five non-hyperimmune immunoglobulin preparations were tested. Light <b>chain</b> <b>types</b> of the antibodies {{were tested in}} ELISA with polyclonal specific {{antibodies to}} kappa and lambda chains.

40|$|We present {{examples}} of the both types of bursts and show their similarities and differences. Then for <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts a similar model as for drifting pulsation structures (DPSs) is proposed. We show that similarly as in the DPS, the <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts can be generated by the fragmented magnetic reconnection associated with plasmoids interactions. To support this new model of <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts, we present an effect of merging of two plasmoids to one larger plasmoid on the radio spectrum of DPS. This process can also explain the "wavy" appearance of some <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts. Then we show that the <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts with the "wavy" appearance {{can be used for}} estimation of the magnetic field strength in their sources. We think that differences of <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts and DPSs are mainly owing to different regimes of the magnetic field reconnection. While in the case of <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> I bursts the magnetic reconnection and plasmoid interactions are in the quasi-separatrix layer of the active region in more or less quasi-saturated regime, in the case of DPSs, observed in the impulsive phase of eruptive flares, the magnetic reconnection and plasmoids interactions are in the current sheet formed under the flare magnetic rope, which moves upwards and forces this magnetic reconnection.

40|$|Covalent {{attachment}} of {{the small}} modifier ubiquitin to Lys ε-amino groups of proteins is surprisingly diverse. Once attached to a substrate, ubiquitin is itself frequently modified by ubiquitin, to form chains. All seven Lys residues of ubiquitin, {{as well as its}} N-terminal Met, can be ubiquitylated, implying cellular occurrence of different ubiquitin <b>chain</b> <b>types.</b> The available data suggest that the synthesis, recognition and hydrolysis of different <b>chain</b> <b>types</b> are precisely regulated. This remarkable extent of control underlies a versatile cellular response to substrate ubiquitylation. In this review, we focus on roles of Lys 63 -linked ubiquitin chains in plants. Despite limited available knowledge, several recent findings illustrate the importance of these chains as signaling components in plants...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} a typological {{overview}} of tail-head linkage (THL) in Papuan languages is presented. There are two <b>types</b> of THL, <b>chained</b> THL and thematized THL. The <b>chained</b> <b>type</b> is the default type and its morphosyntactic form {{follows from the}} basic clause linkage type in a given Papuan language, for example when switch reference constructions are the basic type of clause linkage, then the default type of THL {{takes the form of}} switch reference constructions. Chained THL carries referential coherence mechanisms (e. g. gender agreements, switch reference) and event sequencing mechanisms (e. g. sequence-simultaneity morphology) across chain boundaries. The second, marked, type of THL is with nominalized clauses that discontinue the event and participant lines. The head clause in this type of THL is a thematic NP that is syntactically separate from the chain and this reflects thematic discontinuity: the thematic head clause is off-sequence. In languages like Wambon and Usan the two types of THL select different verb types: medial verbs that express switch reference (same versus different subject) and/or sequence-simultaneity distinctions occur in the <b>chained</b> <b>type</b> and independent verbs that cannot express these distinctions occur in the second, thematic type. THL has four functions, referential coherence, processing ease, thematic continuity (<b>chained</b> <b>type)</b> and thematic discontinuity (thematized type). The phonological form of THL (slowly pronounced, rising intonation, pause phenomena) reflects its processing function to give speakers and addressees a break between two chains...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, a [...] "claw" [...] type of wrench, {{manufactured}} by Sykes-Pickavant and others, has three geared metal prongs and accommodates a (typically) 3/8" [...] ratchet driver. As {{the driver is}} turned anticlockwise the gears make the prongs clench the filter body harder. This type is very effective on tight filters {{and can be used}} in more confined spaces than a strap or <b>chain</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The strap or chain {{can have}} various forms. Some straps {{are made of}} polymers, and are smooth, highly flexible, non-marring, high-friction straps. (Before the era of {{commercial}} polymers, the straps were of leather or rubber.) Other straps are bands of spring steel, moderately flexible, slightly firmer {{and more likely to}} mar than the polymer variants. The chains tend to be of the roller <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> (like a bicycle chain).|$|E

The chassis changed from wood to steel, with the <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> transmission now with three speeds and reverse. At the peak, 500 staff were employed, making 55 cars a month. A licence to make the cars was agreed with the French maker Salmson who made about 1600 cars.|$|E
40|$|Antigen {{specific}} and cross reacting antibodies to native and denatured types II and XI collagen were {{detected in the}} sera of rats immunised with either of these antigens. The antibodies from rats immunised with type XI collagen initially showed the strongest binding to the alpha 2 (XI) <b>chain</b> of <b>type</b> XI collagen but later binding to the alpha 3 (XI) chain was seen. Sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis had antibodies that bound to both type II and XI collagens. Immunoblotting studies showed that most patients had antibodies which bound to the alpha 1 (II) <b>chain</b> of <b>type</b> II collagen and to the alpha 3 (XI) <b>chain</b> of <b>type</b> XI collagen. Some patients also had antibodies which bound to the alpha 1 (XI) and to the alpha 2 (XI) <b>chains</b> of <b>type</b> XI collagen.

50|$|The COL11A2 gene {{produces}} {{one component}} {{of this type of}} collagen, called the pro-alpha2(XI) <b>chain.</b> <b>Type</b> XI collagen adds structure and strength to the tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs and skin (the connective tissue). Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage as well as the fluid that fills the eyeball, the inner ear, and the center portion of the discs between the vertebrae in the spine (nucleus pulposus). Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and diameter of type II collagen fibrils. Type II collagen is {{an important component of the}} eye and mature cartilage tissue.

5000|$|CARM1 (coactivator-associated {{arginine}} methyltransferase 1), {{also known}} as PRMT4 (protein arginine N-methyltransferase 4), is an enzyme (...) encoded by the [...] gene found in human beings, {{as well as many}} other mammals. It has a polypeptide (L) <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> that is 348 residues long, and is made up of alpha helices and beta sheets. Its main function includes catalyzing the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the side chain nitrogens of arginine residues within proteins to form methylated arginine derivatives and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine. CARM1 is a secondary coactivator through its association with p160 family (SRC-1, GRIP1, AIB) of coactivators. It is responsible for moving cells toward the inner cell mass in developing blastocysts.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main types of {{contemporary}} metal handcuffs: chain (cuffs are {{held together by}} a short chain), hinged (since hinged handcuffs permit less movement than a chain cuff, they are {{generally considered to be}} more secure), and rigid solid bar handcuffs. While bulkier to carry, rigid handcuffs permit several variations in cuffing. Hiatts Speedcuffs are rigid handcuffs used by most police forces in the United Kingdom. Both rigid and hinged cuffs can be used one-handed to apply pain-compliance/control techniques that are not workable with the <b>chain</b> <b>type</b> of cuff.

50|$|A typical {{antibody}} {{is composed}} of two immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains and two Ig light <b>chains.</b> Several different <b>types</b> of heavy <b>chain</b> exist that define the class or isotype of an antibody.

Production of the a viable heavy chain is a key step in B cell maturation. If the heavy chain is able to bind to a surrogate light chain {{and move to the}} plasma membrane, then the developing B cell can begin producing its light chain.|$|R
