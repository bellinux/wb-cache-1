5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but}} to agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

Greene underwent two bilateral cranioplasties, with the second one successfully repairing his skull. He was also subject to physiotherapy sessions, which lacked results, at first. Greene was then {{released from the hospital}} and was transferred to a private-care rehabilitation center in Langley, BC. On April 30, 2007 Trevor Greene started speech therapy sessions.|$|E
25|$|After Lord Shiva had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> meditation,he {{wanted to}} go and see Parvati but found himself being stopped by this strange boy. Shiva tried to reason with the boy saying that he was Parvati's husband but the boy did not listen and was {{determined}} to not let Shiva enter till his mother Goddess Parvati finished her bath. The boy's behaviour surprised Shiva. Sensing that this was no ordinary boy, the usually peaceful Shiva decided he would have to fight the boy and in his divine fury severed the boy's head with his Trishul thereby killing him instantly.|$|E

25|$|Reprieve, a London-based {{human rights}} group, {{said it had}} talked to two sources from the raided village, {{who said that the}} raid went wrong from the start as the Seals opened fire on a 70-year-old {{partially}} blind man, named Nasser Al-Adhal, who had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house {{to see what was going}} on, possibly to greet the US soldiers after mistaking them for visitors. On hearing al-Adhal being shot, other men then emerged from their homes, and four of them were shot dead by the Seals, according to the Reprieve account. According to Reprive investigators, they were “still trying to get a really full picture of exactly what happened, but what we do know is that Seals landed in the village, and they appear to have been trying to target a group of possible militants but in the course of the ground raid something went wrong, and they ended up killing a number of the people from the village, including a man of about 70, Nasser al-Adhal, who suffered from very bad eyesight. The four other villagers were killed when they started to argue with the Navy Seals after the shooting of Nasser al-Adhal. Six villagers were seriously injured, including another elderly man who was around 69 years old. After that, Al-Qaida fighters gathered nearby, after were alerted by the gunshots in the village and firefight ensued in which at least two of them were killed. The Navy Seals then left with the help of air support from a helicopter.” A US central command spokesman, Maj. Josh Jacques, said that the Reprieve report would be investigated.|$|E

500|$|On how {{he views}} the character, David-Lloyd says that [...] "outwardly, he's straight-laced, but there's a darker side {{to him and}} a very playful side too." [...] Initially, in series one, Ianto is a quiet and more {{reserved}} character. Throughout the first series, Ianto's secrets {{are exposed to the}} team, particularly in [...] "Cyberwoman" [...] when his motives for joining Torchwood Three are exposed. David-Lloyd was [...] "bowled over" [...] by the Ianto-centric script for [...] "Cyberwoman" [...] and the [...] "wide range of emotions" [...] it allowed him to play. From this point, Ianto's focus changes and he begins more and more to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shell.|$|E

500|$|Salmaan next {{starred in}} Anwar Rasheed's Ustad Hotel (2012). The film, which {{received}} the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment, {{was also a}} major success at the box office. He also won praise for his portrayal of Faizy. Anil R Nair, writing for The New Indian Express, stated, [...] "The youthful and glamorous Dulquer has <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father’s shadow {{in the role of}} Faisi." [...] For his performance, Salmaan received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. His third film was Theevram, a crime thriller directed by Roopesh Peethambaran. The film, which released on November 2012, received mixed reviews and was a box office failure.|$|E
500|$|Under Fellini's {{agreement}} with his producers, any budget overruns {{would have had}} to <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own pocket, cutting into any profit potential there might be. When it became clear that there would not be enough funding to finish the picture, Fellini stated that Ponti and De Laurentiis took him to lunch and assured him that they would not hold him to it: [...] "Let's pretend they were a joke. Buy us a coffee and we'll forget about them." [...] According to Quinn, however, Fellini was able to obtain this indulgence only by agreeing to film some pickup shots for Attila that Francisci, the director of record, had neglected to complete.|$|E
500|$|Weapon XI is {{a genetically}} altered mutant killer. He has powers taken from other mutants killed or kidnapped in the film, {{as well as}} {{retractable}} blades in his arms. He is referred to by Stryker as [...] "the pool, the mutant killer: Deadpool" [...] because the compatible powers of the other mutants have been 'pooled' together into one being. This interpretation of Deadpool is lacking his traditional red suit and mask, and also includes a mouth sewn shut and the abilities of Cyclops' optic blasts, Wraith's teleportation, and samurai swords that <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fists from within his arms, similarly to Wolverine's claws. [...] Ryan Reynolds portrays Weapon XI for close-ups, standing shots, and simple stunts while Scott Adkins {{is used for the}} more complicated and dangerous stunt work.|$|E

500|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] " [...] hand transforms into {{a gun and}} {{you can actually see}} it <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm. We {{wanted to make sure that}} the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock-paper-scissors. The project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered [...] "deep gameplay". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as [...] "Tom Pon") began work on the Mega Mans scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.|$|E
500|$|A {{month and}} a half into the 2011–12 season, Lucic {{received}} considerable attention for a hit against opposing goaltender Ryan Miller during a game against the Buffalo Sabres. Miller had <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> net to play a puck that Lucic last touched midway between the centre line and the Sabres' blue line. As Miller shot the puck towards the end-boards, Lucic collided with him heavily, knocking him to the ice. Miller was diagnosed with a concussion and was sidelined for several games; he also heavily criticized Lucic for his actions and called him a [...] "gutless piece of shit" [...] in post-game comments. The day after the hit, the NHL held a hearing with Lucic and later announced {{that he would not be}} suspended for the play, citing that the minor penalty for charging that was assessed during the game was sufficient. A few weeks after this incident, he received a one-game suspension for an illegal hit on Philadelphia forward Zac Rinaldo. Lucic hit Rinaldo from behind during a battle for the puck along the boards, although he was not seriously injured on the play. A short time into the 2013–14 season, Lucic scored his first-ever NHL overtime goal to break a 2–2 tie game at home against the visiting Columbus Blue Jackets.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his fight}} with De La Hoya, Mayweather decided to {{relinquish}} his WBC light-middleweight championship, retaining his welterweight title.
