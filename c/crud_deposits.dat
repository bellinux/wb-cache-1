This framework includes the coupling among three essential physics, thermal-hydraulics, CRUD and neutronics.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>crud</b> <b>deposits</b> on a number of adjacent fuel rods might reduce coolant flow rates in associated sub-channels. Such reduced flow rates could then worsen thermal-hydraulic conditions, such as margin to saturated boiling, fuel surface temperature, and the DNB ratio. We report the results of a detailed computational fluid dynamics study of the flow pattern in a partially-crudded rod bundle. Values obviously depend on, for example, the thickness of crud assumed, but sub-channel flow rate reductions of ~ 10 % were predicted by this analysis. However, this mass flow rate reduction was found to be more than offset by improved heat transfer induced by the relatively rough surface of the crud. Cladding temperatures were predicted to be essentially unchanged, and the DNBR was similarly little altered.

40|$|Axial offset anomaly (AOA) in {{pressurized}} water reactors (PWR) refers to deviation of the measured neutron flux {{in the top}} half of the core from the predicted values. Among other difficulties, AOA reduces the shutdown margin, and may force the plant to reduce power output. AOA is believed to be caused by three related phenomena occurring in the core while operating at full power: sub-cooled nucleate boiling concentrated mainly in the upper half of the core, corrosion product deposition on the cladding surface (crud), and the deposition of boron within the porous crud layer in regions of vigorous sub-cooled boiling. This study replicates the conditions within the PWR primary coolant; specifically, the temperature, pressure, peak surface heat flux, coolant velocity and water chemistry are simulated in order to produce prototypical crud on an electrically heated Zircaloy- 4 test element. At the conclusion of each test run, the heated Zircaloy- 4 test element is rapidly isolated from the coolant in order to trap any soluble boron species that may be present in the crud layer. The results of this investigation indicate that prototypical crud with significant boron deposition can be produced. The deposited boron compound has been determined to be lithium tetraborate (Li 2 B 4 O 7). Comparative experiments have been run to determine the effect of coolant pH, concentration and type of additives, and duration of exposure on the thickness of the <b>crud</b> <b>deposit.</b> The data obtained in this investigation can be used to validate mechanistic models for crud deposition and AOA in {{pressurized water}} reactors.

However, experimentally it is observed that there is spatio-temporal variation in the porosity and structure of crud layer deposits.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of corrosive and radioactive wastes {{in the primary}} system, including nuclear fuel assembly, significantly increases workers’ exposure to radiation. Zinc injection from 5 to 40 ppb into the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) of Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) has been known as an effective method to decrease the radiation fields and Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC). Zinc injection affects both corrosion product concentrations and characteristics of the <b>deposited</b> <b>crud</b> on oxide layers, because zinc is incorporated into the oxide films by displacing nickel, cobalt, and iron in primary systems. Radiation fields and corrosion might be mitigated as radioactive products, such as Co, which are removed by zinc injection. However, the zinc injection effects on fuel assembly in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) have not been much reported yet, even though some lab tests were carried out in USA and France. In this paper, we studied effects of zinc injection on the fuel assemblies in the Ulchin 1 NPP. The chemical and radiation analysis of radioactive corrosion products was performed to evaluate zinc injection effects on the fuel assembly in the Ulchin 1 NPP. Gamma spectroscopy was used to analyze crud samples for radioisotope contents. The Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used to analyze crud samples for elemental contents. The concentration of radioisotope Co - 58 was decreased after zinc injection to 1 / 22 times that before the zinc injection. 1 % - 2 % wt% of zinc was incorporated through the substitution of Ni in the crud oxide layer. The Ni/Fe ratio was decreased to 0. 69 from 1. 12 after the injection, due to the Ni substitution by zinc. It was found that NiO and NiFe 2 O 4 were converted to ZnO and ZnFe 2 O 4, respectively.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{iron oxide}} crud was studied at 25 ºC {{and over the}} range 240 to 270 ºC in a high pressure water loop. Crud deposition and removal was measured in two parallel, heated Zircaloy- 2 tubes using iron- 59 as a radioactive tracer. This {{proved to be a}} powerful technique capable of detecting <b>crud</b> <b>deposits</b> less than 3 run thick. Rapid deposition of crud was observed following injection into the loop of an iron oxide suspension or a ferric nitrate solution. Crud deposited preferentially on heated surfaces when they were present but not to the exclusion of deposition elsewhere; hot spots on heated surfaces attracted additional deposits. Subcooled boiling appeared to be a more important factor than bulk boiling in the enhancement of crud deposition. The initial rapid deposition of the bulk of the crud throughout the loop was usually followed by a slower transfer of crud from other surfaces to any heated surface present. Unsteady operating conditions, e. g. a change in power, temperature or pH, frequently caused crud bursts, but once steady conditions were re-established the entrained crud was quickly redeposited. The bulk of deposited crud was not readily re-entrained, particularly from heated surfaces, so that crud bursts involved {{only a fraction of the}} total crud deposited. Ferric nitrate solutions injected into the loop formed haematite which deposited more slowly and formed more mobile deposits than magnetite which was injected directly into the loop as a slurry.

40|$|In {{a nuclear}} power plant, chalk river {{unidentified}} deposit (CRUD) {{is known as a}} deposit that is composed of corrosion and oxidation materials. It has a porous structure, which combines with boron that is injected into the coolant for controlling power levels. The buildup of corrosion products on the fuel cladding surface has proven to be particularly significant for both BWRs and PWRs. The high temperature of the cladding surface attracts impurities and chemical additives in the reactor coolant that deposit on the fuel rod surface in a process. The deposits on a fuel rod, known as CRUD, can be tenacious, insulative compounds capable of increasing the local clad temperature and accelerating clad corrosion&# 8212;sometimes to the point of fuel failure. The deposition of CRUD on fuel cladding surfaces causes uneven heating of the reactor core. The situation is exacerbated by boron, which is added to the coolant to control power levels. However, boron becomes concentrated and is deposited within thick <b>CRUD</b> <b>deposits.</b> Ultrasonic mechanisms were developed but they have limitations for decontamination. In this experiment, a decontamination test was conducted using a sample sheet that was composed of SiC/water nanofluids.

As a pressure film is wetted easily in water, it was injected into a holder. In the experiment, the maximum shock pressure was obtained during swirl flow at a low cavitation number. This indicates that pressure was concentrated on the pressure film. Consequently, cavitation can get rid of CRUD layers partially. clos...|$|E

40|$|Our work {{involved}} the continued {{development of the}} theory of passivity and passivity breakdown, {{in the form of the}} Point Defect Model, with emphasis on zirconium and zirconium alloys in reactor coolant environments, the measurement of critically-important parameters, and the development of a code that can be used by reactor operators to actively manage the accumulation of corrosion damage to the fuel cladding and other components in the heat transport circuits in both BWRs and PWRs. In addition, the modified boiling crevice model has been further developed to describe the accumulation of solutes in porous <b>deposits</b> (<b>CRUD)</b> on fuel under boiling (BWRs) and nucleate boiling (PWRs) conditions, in order to accurately describe the environment that is contact with the Zircaloy cladding. In the current report, we have derived expressions for the total steady-state current density and the partial anodic and cathodic current densities to establish a deterministic basis for describing Zircaloy oxidation. The models are “deterministic” because the relevant natural laws are satisfied explicitly, most importantly the conversation of mass and charge and the equivalence of mass and charge (Faraday’s law). Cathodic reactions (oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution) are also included in the models, because there is evidence that they control the rate of the overall passive film formation process. Under open circuit conditions, the cathodic reactions, which must occur at the same rate as the zirconium oxidation reaction, are instrumental in determining the corrosion potential and hence the thickness of the barrier and outer layers of the passive film. Controlled hydrodynamic methods have been used to measure important parameters in the modified Point Defect Model (PDM), which is now being used to describe the growth and breakdown of the passive film on zirconium and on Zircaloy fuel sheathing in BWRs and PWRs coolant environments. The modified PDMs recognize the existence of a thick oxide outer layer over a thin barrier layer. From thermodynamic analysis, it is postulated that a hydride barrier layer forms under PWR coolant conditions whereas an oxide barrier layer forms under BWR primary coolant conditions. Thus, the introduction of hydrogen into the solution lowers the corrosion potential of zirconium to the extent that the formation of ZrH 2 is predicted to be spontaneous rather than the ZrO 2. Mott-Schottky analysis shows that the passive film formed on zirconium is n-type, which is consistent with the PDM, corresponding to a preponderance of oxygen/hydrogen vacancies and/or zirconium interstitials in the barrier layer. The model parameter values were extracted from electrochemical impedance spectroscopic data for zirconium in high temperature, de-aerated and hydrogenated environments by optimization. The results indicate that the corrosion resistance of zirconium is dominated by the porosity and thickness of the outer layer for both cases. The impedance model based on the PDM provides a good account of the growth of the bi-layer passive films described above, and the extracted model parameter values might be used, for example, for predicting the accumulation of general corrosion damage to Zircaloy fuel sheath in BWR and PWR operating environments. Transients in current density and film thickness for passive film formation on zirconium in dearated and hydrogenated coolant conditions have confirmed that the rate law afforded by the Point Defect Model (PDM) adequately describes the growth and thinning of the passive film. The experimental results demonstrate that the kinetics of oxygen or hydrogen vacancy generation at the metal/film interface control the rate of film growth, when the potential is displaced in the positive direction, whereas the kinetics of dissolution of the barrier layer at the barrier layer/solution interface control the rate of passive film thinning when the potential is stepped in the negative direction. In addition, the effects of second phase particles (SPPs) on the electrochemistry of passive zirconium in the hydrogenated, high temperature aqueous solutions were examined by using different heat-treated Zircaloy- 4 samples; i. e., as-received, -quenched, and -annealed. The average size of the second phase particles in the Zircaloy- 4 samples was in the sequence of -quenched < -annealed < as-received, with the reverse sequence being observed in the areal density. Electrochemical studies show that the size and density of the second phase particles are the determining factors of the electrochemical properties of the passive films. The second phase particles may cause short circuits in the electrical path across the passive film, which would explain the effect of the size and the density of the SPPs, and hence heat treatment, on the corrosion properties of passive Zircaloy- 4...|$|R
40|$|In {{water-cooled}} nuclear reactors, {{various species}} {{are present in}} the coolant, either in ionic solution, or entrained as very fine particles. Most arise from corrosion of primary circuit surfaces, or from chemicals, such as boric acid, lithium hydroxide, zinc and hydrogen, deliberately added to the coolant. These materials deposit on the surfaces of fuel pins, typically in the upper regions of the core, forming what is generally termed “crud”. This thesis reports a study of the thermal-hydraulic consequences of this deposit. These <b>crud</b> <b>deposits</b> are generally found to contain a large population of through-thickness chimneys, and it is believed that this gives rise to a wick-boiling mechanism of heat transfer. A coupled two-dimensional model of the processes of heat conduction, advection and species diffusion in the crud has been developed. An iterative scheme has been employed to solve the set of coupled equations of each process. The wick boiling process {{has been found to be}} an efficient heat transfer mode, taking away about 80 % of the heat generated. It has also been found that consideration of heat transfer in the clad can increase the predicted solute concentration in the crud. The effects of some important parameters, such as chimney density, chimney radius, porosity of the crud, crud thickness, clad heat flux and boron concentration in the coolant have been investigated. The fuel thermal performance has been characterized in terms of an effective crud thermal conductivity, and the non-linear dependence this has on parameters such as crud thickness and chimney density had been determined. Lastly, it is observed that plausible pore sizes of the crud, coupled with higher temperatures in the crud, may be such that a film of vapour is generated at the base of the crud. Initial estimates are presented of the cladding temperatures and solute concentration that may be generated as a consequence of this vapour layer.

The experimental data collected includes the effect of coolant concentration, subcooling, system pressure and heat flux on pool the boiling heat transfer coefficient. The analysis of particulate deposits formed on the fuel cladding surface during subcooled nucleate boiling was also performed. The results indicate that the pool boiling heat transfer coefficient degrades in the presence of boric acid and lithium metaborate compared to pure deionized water due to lesser nucleation.

Boiling tests also revealed the formation of fine deposits of boron and lithium on the cladding surface which degraded the heat transfer rates.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effect of radiolysis species (H 2, O 2, and H 2 O 2) upon crud deposition and growth and also {{the effect of}} their concentration within the crud. A 3 -D transient diffusion model has been developed to simulate solute transport of these radiolysis products in porous crud layer. It attempts to explain {{the behavior of the}} porous crud growth on PWR fuel pins. This model employs a system of coupled mass transport and chemical interactions as the source term, which make the problem non-linear. A Monte Carlo technique is adopted to simulate the behavior of the different species. The direct application of this study to nuclear engineering research is to aid in the design of reactors with higher performance. With the deregulation of the U. S. power market, there is an incentive to extend the life and to enhance the performance and efficiency throughout the power generation industry. This requires higher power levels for existing nuclear reactors, which can cause the occurrence of an Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA). Approximately 20 U. S. PWRs have experienced significant Crud-Induced axial Power Shift or CIPS (also referred to as AOA), an unexpected measured shift in axial power distribution from predicted values. Such abnormal performance has driven the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to impose lower reactor power levels at the aging reactor fleet for safety reasons. While much effort has been focused on finding the causes of AOA, a detailed understanding has not yet been developed, which predicts its growth rate over the fuel lifetime, because of the complexity of its causes. Porous <b>crud</b> <b>deposits</b> {{in the form of the}} non-stoichiometric nickel-ferrite (FexNi 3 -xO 4) have been observed on the Zircaloy cladding surface exposed to the subcooled boiling length of the fuel rods. The thermal processes in this layer, which result in the holdup of boron (10 B and 11 B), cause a larger than predicted decrease in the neutron flux. Research suggests that the buildup rate of metallic corrosion products from the reactor vessel and primary coolant loop can be accelerated. Boron holdup in the crud under the presence of radiation is likely higher, especially through radiolysis and irradiation damage on the cladding. For the modeling of solute transport of radiolysis products, the present analysis considered two competing solute transport mechanisms within the porous crud deposits: molecular diffusion with a source term from the radiolysis and mass convection. Initially, the analytical model for the equilibrium state using the Laplace equation is summarized from the author’s earlier work. Later, a transient diffusion equation was introduced using a random walk Monte Carlo technique coupled with a constant source term from radiolysis. This procedure by Ragheb was modified from a cartesian to a cylindrical geometry random walk. The molecular radiolysis species of hydrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide are the most stable radiolysis products that directly affect: (1) the oxidation-reduction reactions at the interface of crud/cladding and (2) the formation of nickel ferrite within the crud deposit. In a post-AOA crud, Bonaccordite (Ni 2 FeBO 5) is also observed in the nickel-ferrite. It is recommended that further investigations be performed incorporating the electrochemical interactions of these electroactive species. More detailed consideration of convective transport should be coupled with diffusion with a source term of radiolysis...|$|E
