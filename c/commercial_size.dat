25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} is {{an important}} species to both commercial fisheries and anglers, with {{the popularity of the}} fish leading to extensive aquaculture trials. The catch statistics for the bluefin trevally are poorly reported in most of its range, with only parts of the western Indian Ocean supplying information to the FAO. In this region, catch levels have fluctuated between 2 and 50 tonnes in the past decade. Hawaii also keeps catch records, with these showing the species is taken in far less numbers than the giant trevally, with only 704 pounds taken compared to 10 149lbs of giant trevally in 1998. In Hawaii, the nearshore stocks of the species have been in decline since the early 1900s, with commercial landings dropping over 300% from 1990 to 1991, and have not recovered. Most bluefin trevally sold in Hawaii are now imported from other Indo-Pacific nations. The species is taken by a variety of netting and trapping methods, as well and by hook and line in commercial fisheries. It is usually sold fresh, as well as frozen or salted. The rapid decline in the population has seen a focus on breeding the bluefin trevally in captivity. The species' aquaculture potential was first investigated in a 1975 experiment in French Polynesia, where juveniles of the species were caught in the wild and transported back to a laboratory. The study found the fish grew to a <b>commercial</b> <b>size</b> of 300 g in 6 to 8 months and only suffered a 5% mortality rate. It was concluded that such a technique carried out on a larger scale in lagoons would be promising due to the growth rate and relatively high price commanded by the species at market. Further investigations into the potential for offshore aquaculture were conducted in Hawaii, where the species successfully spawned in captivity. The only barrier in these studies to successful production was problems with commercial food items. An in vitro cell culture has recently been established for the species, which will allow long term management of potential viral diseases that may arise during aquaculture of the fish.|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} set by {{the greenhouse}} gas emissions of the blast furnace is being addressed in an ongoing European Program called ULCOS (Ultra Low CO2 Steelmaking). Several new process routes have been proposed and investigated in depth to cut specific emissions ( [...] per ton of steel) by at least 50%. Some rely on the capture and further storage (CCS) of , while others choose decarbonizing iron and steel production, by turning to hydrogen, electricity and biomass. In the nearer term, a technology that incorporates CCS into the blast furnace process itself and is called the Top-Gas Recycling Blast Furnace is under development, with a scale-up to a <b>commercial</b> <b>size</b> blast furnace under way.

40|$|In the Upper Rio Negro Valley, {{northern}} Patagonia (Argentina), {{there is}} a large variability of soils and the success of a fruit plantation depends mostly on soil characteristics. The main objective of this work was to determine the relationships between yield and fruit internal maturity at harvest of pear trees (Pyrus communis L.) grown in soils with different properties. The soil around each of 30 trees was morphologically characterized by measuring physical, physic-chemical, and chemical variables. At harvest time, total and commercial yields were measured, and maturity was determined by measuring flesh firmness, soluble solids, and titratable acidity. According to edaphic variables, soils were classified into five groups. Yields presented significant differences among such groups and growing seasons. The distribution of <b>commercial</b> <b>sizes</b> was similar in soils with fine texture, and high K content (897 and 663 mg kg- 1) and cation-exchange capacity. Smaller fruits predominated in soil groups with high salinity (6. 1 dS m- 1 in surface and 10. 8 dS m- 1 in subsurface horizons) and shallow depth. The soil group with the highest salinity presented fruits with 11 % more titratable acidity compared to all other groups. The soil group with the smallest depth presented fruits with high levels of flesh firmness (11. 18 kg cm- 2) and soluble solids (14. 8 %). The selected set of edaphic variables allowed us to differentiate groups of soils and analyze its influence in pear tree yield, <b>commercial</b> <b>sizes,</b> and fruit internal maturity...|$|R
50|$|For large, <b>commercial</b> <b>size</b> horizontal-axis wind turbines, the {{electrical}} generator is mounted in a nacelle {{at the top}} of a tower, behind the hub of the turbine rotor. Typically wind turbines generate electricity through asynchronous machines that are directly connected with the electricity grid. Usually the rotational speed of the wind turbine is slower than the equivalent rotation speed of {{the electrical}} network: typical rotation speeds for wind generators are 5-20 rpm while a directly connected machine will have an electrical speed between 750 and 3600 rpm. Therefore, a gearbox is inserted between the rotor hub and the generator. This also reduces the generator cost and weight. <b>Commercial</b> <b>size</b> generators have a rotor carrying a field winding so that a rotating magnetic field is produced inside a set of windings called the stator. While the rotating field winding consumes a fraction of a percent of the generator output, adjustment of the field current allows good control over the generator output voltage.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} to a shift towards directed targeting of whiting, Sillago spp. by some penaeid trawlers in coastal waters off New South Wales, Australia, 3 experiments were done {{to examine the effects}} on the size and species selectivity of trawls associated with (i) a 40 % increase in mesh size used in the body, (ii) altering the configuration of mesh in the codend, and (iii) a separating grid in the extension section. Each experiment involved paired comparisons between conventional and modified gears during normal commercial fishing operations. The results showed that increasing mesh size in the trawl body from 45 to 63 mm had no effect on any catches and, while the grid has the potential to improve species selection by excluding macrofauna, further refinement and testing are required to minimize the escape of <b>commercial</b> <b>sized</b> whiting. Changing the orientation of mesh in the codend from diamond- (40 mm mesh opening) to square-shaped (41 mm mesh, hung on the bar) had a highly significant effect on the size selection of red spot whiting, Sillago flindersi: reducing the catches of small, unwanted individuals (< 17 cm total length) by up to 99 %, with minimal impact on the retention of larger, <b>commercial</b> <b>sized</b> individuals. We conclude that the use of square-mesh codends (with a bar length approaching 20 mm) by trawlers targeting whiting is an appropriate management tool for minimizing the fishing mortality of juvenile and maturing conspecifics...|$|R
