40|$|Background: The {{decline of}} habitat for {{elephants}} due to expanding human activity {{is a serious}} conservation problem. This has continuously escalated the human–elephant conflict in Africa and Asia. Elephants make extensive use of powerful infrasonic calls (rumbles) that travel distances of up to several kilometers. This makes elephants well-suited for acoustic monitoring because it enables detecting elephants {{even if they are}} out of sight. In sight, their distinct visual appearance makes them a good candidate for visual monitoring. We provide an integrated overview of our interdisciplinary project that established the scientific fundamentals for a future early <b>warning</b> and <b>monitoring</b> system for humans who regularly experience serious conflict with elephants. We first draw the big picture of an early <b>warning</b> and <b>monitoring</b> system, then review the developed solutions for automatic acoustic and visual detection, discuss specific challenges and present open future work necessary to build a robust and reliable early <b>warning</b> and <b>monitoring</b> system that is able to operate in situ. Findings: We present a method for the automated detection of elephant rumbles that is robust to the diverse noise sources present in situ. We evaluated the method on an extensive set of audio data recorded under natural field conditions. Results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and accurately detects elephant rumbles. Our visual detection method shows that tracking elephants in wildlife videos (of different sizes and postures) is feasible and particularly robust at near distances. Discussion: From our project results we draw a number of conclusions that are discussed and summarized. We clearly identified the most critical challenges and necessary improvements of the proposed detection methods and conclude that our findings have the potential to form the basis for a future automated early warning system for elephants. We discuss challenges that need to be solved and summarize open topics {{in the context of a}} future early <b>warning</b> and <b>monitoring</b> system. We conclude that a long-term evaluation of the presented methods in situ using real-time prototypes is the most important next step to transfer the developed methods into practical implementation...|$|R

40|$|The first {{application}} of ground-based interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (GBInSAR) for slope monitoring dates back 13 years. Today, GBInSAR is used internationally as a leading-edge tool for near-real-time monitoring of surface slope movements in landslides and open pit mines.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{satisfactory}} results {{have yet to}} be obtained in earthquake prediction, {{one of the most common}} indicators of an anomalous precursor is a change in groundwater level in existing wells. Further wells should thus be drilled in unconfined aquifers since these are more susceptible to seismic waves. The Eskisehir region lies in the transition zone between the Aegean extensional domain and the compressible northern Anatolian block. Limnigraphs, installed in 19 exploration wells in the Eskisehir region, recorded pre-seismic, co-seismic and post-seismic level changes during the earthquakes of 17 August Izmit (Mw= 7. 4) and 12 November Duzce (Mw= 7. 2) 1999 that occurred along the North Anatolian Fault Zone. The Izmit and Duzce earthquakes affected groundwater levels, especially in confined aquifers. The aquifer characteristics before and after the earthquakes were unchanged so the aquifer is elastic in its behaviour. Further detailed geo-mechanical investigation of the confined aquifer in the Eskisehir region may improve understanding of earthquake prediction.

Meanwhile, microbiological quality evaluations are based mainly on the occurrence of pathogens and faecal contaminants, which are indirectly retrieved by standard cultivation methods. In this study, the structural dynamics of a riverine bacterioplankton community were investigated through a quantitative single-cell approach with the use of flow cytometry for the quantification of total, viable and active cells. Furthermore, catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) -FISH was used for the evaluation of Proteobacteria and Cytophaga–Flavobacteria bacterial classes. The aim was to identify the major cytometric and phylogenetic cell groups that most representatively reflect the physical and chemical changes occurring in an upland-to-lowland transect along a human-impacted river (the Foglia River, Italy). The use of CARD-FISH to obtain cell abundance measurements of specific taxonomic clusters enabled different microbial propagation dynamics along the river transects to be identified.
