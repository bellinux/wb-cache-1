30|$|Soil <b>crusts</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in land surface, especially prevalent in arid and semiarid regions [1], and are mainly divided into physical <b>crusts</b> and biological <b>crusts</b> [2]. As we know, physical soil <b>crusts</b> are a thin compacted layers formed at {{the soil surface}} by the combined action of raindrop impacting, splashing and physicochemical dispersion of the finer particulate matter blocking the soil porosities, or by the sedimentation action of finer particles carried by water current or still water on the soil surfaces [3]. Biological soil <b>crusts</b> commonly result from the development of communities of micro-organisms on soil surface [4 – 6]. Soil salt <b>crusts</b> are special layers at the soil surface which are mainly formed by soluble salt crystallizing soil particles. Soil salt <b>crusts</b> are different from physical <b>crusts</b> or biological crusts; some scholar thought {{that it should be}} classified as chemical <b>crusts</b> individually in the soil <b>crusts</b> classification system [7]. Salt <b>crusts</b> have high salt content, higher hardness and strong resistance to wind erosion [8, 9]. Under natural conditions at the shallow groundwater level regions, water and soluble salt move upwards to soil surface because of soil capillarity action, water evaporates and loses, but the salt accumulates and crystals at the soil surface and forms soil salt <b>crusts.</b> Some scholars made related research on soil salt <b>crusts</b> formed under natural conditions [8, 9], but little studies on soil salt <b>crusts</b> formed under salinity water irrigation were reported [7, 10], and only confined to the relationship between soil salt <b>crusts</b> distribution and irrigation schedule.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Soil surface <b>crusting</b> is {{a common}} but {{unfavorable}} process in Mediterranean environments. Soil surface <b>crusts</b> hamper infiltration of water into the soil and stimulate surface runoff, erosion and flooding downstream. Furthermore, <b>crusts</b> hinder germination of seeds and settlement of plants. Surface <b>crusts</b> develop within minutes during high intensity rainfall typical for arid and semi-arid environments. The raindrops destroy the soil aggregates and the aggregates disintegrate into the basic particles clay, silt and sand. <b>Crusts</b> are formed at the surface by compaction or by infilling of the inter-aggregate pore space. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the spectral and physical properties of surface <b>crusts</b> in the field and to investigate the possibilities of hyperspectral airborne imagery to map soil <b>crusts</b> and to identify <b>crusts</b> types. Results show that the differences in some physical properties between crusted and non-crusted surfaces are significant while others show only marginal variation. Infiltration capacity is largely reduced by <b>crusting.</b> Spectral differences are small. <b>Crusted</b> versus non-crusted spectra differ mainly in albedo values (8 to 40 %). No consistent changes are found in absorption features in the spectra of <b>crusts</b> and non-crusted surfaces. Some of the <b>crusts</b> show stronger absorption features in the clay mineral absorption bands at 2200 nm. Spectral feature fitting and linear spectral unmixing algorithms were applied to HyMap images to evaluate the mapping of surface <b>crusts.</b> The presence of <b>crusts</b> could be mapped for fallow, agricultural lots but in case of natural badland areas the spectral response of the fragmented landscape was too complex to map the presence of <b>crusts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Biological soil <b>crusts</b> (cyanobacteria, {{mosses and lichens}} collectively) perform {{essential}} ecosystem services, including carbon (C) {{and nitrogen}} (N) fixation.

Furthermore, biological soil <b>crusts</b> affect the germination, growth and establishment of vascular plants. The interaction between <b>crusts</b> and vascular plants is controversial, {{and the importance of}} biological <b>crusts</b> has not been well analyzed in the Gurbantunggut Desert of western China. Our objective was to examine effects of biological <b>crusts</b> on growth and nutrient uptake in vascular plants of the Gurbantunggut Desert. Methods We conducted manipulation experiments {{to examine the effects of}} biological <b>crusts</b> on growth and nutrient uptake in five typical, widely distributed species (Haloxylon persicum, Ephedra distachya, Ceratocarpus arenaarius, Malcolmia africana and Lappula semiglabra).

Important findings Biological soil <b>crusts</b> significantly accelerated the growth rate of seedlings in all five species, but increased biomass accumulation only in herbaceous species, not in shrub species. <b>Crusts</b> also promoted early flowering and fruiting in herbaceous species, which could be beneficial to rapid establishment of herb communities before environmental resources become more available in other seasons. <b>Crusts</b> also influenced nutrient uptake by plants, especially N; the influence on uptake of other nutrients was species-specific.

5|$|New oceanic <b>crust,</b> {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic <b>crust</b> will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic <b>crust</b> was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic <b>crust,</b> along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Oceanic <b>crust,</b> {{which forms}} {{the bedrock of}} abyssal plains, is {{continuously}} being created at mid-ocean ridges (a type of divergent boundary) by {{a process known as}} decompression melting. Plume-related decompression melting of solid mantle is responsible for creating ocean islands like the Hawaiian islands, as well as the ocean <b>crust</b> at mid-ocean ridges. This phenomenon is also the most common explanation for flood basalts and oceanic plateaus (two types of large igneous provinces). Decompression melting occurs when the upper mantle is partially melted into magma as it moves upwards under mid-ocean ridges. This upwelling magma then cools and solidifies by conduction and convection of heat to form new oceanic <b>crust.</b> Accretion occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a tectonic plate, usually associated with seafloor spreading. The age of oceanic <b>crust</b> is therefore a function of distance from the mid-ocean ridge. The youngest oceanic <b>crust</b> is at the mid-ocean ridges, and it becomes progressively older, cooler and denser as it migrates outwards from the mid-ocean ridges as part of the process called mantle convection.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, gold is a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and <b>crust),</b> rather the <b>crust.</b> These metals otherwise occur in the <b>crust,</b> in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
