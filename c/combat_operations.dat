5|$|By then a {{national}} hero, Graf was withdrawn from <b>combat</b> <b>operations</b> and posted to a fighter pilot training school in France before being tasked with the setting up {{of a new}} special unit: Jagdgeschwader 50 (JG50—Fighter Wing 50). Its mission was as a high-altitude unit to intercept the de Havilland Mosquito intruders. In November 1943 Graf returned to <b>combat</b> <b>operations.</b> He was appointed Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) of Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG11—11th Fighter Wing) and claimed his last and 212th aerial victory on 29 March 1944. He was severely injured during that encounter and, {{after a period of}} convalescence, became Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG52—52nd Fighter Wing). He and the remainder of JG52 surrendered to units of the United States Army on 8 May 1945, but were turned over to the Red Army. Graf was held in Soviet captivity until 1949. After the war he worked as an electronic sales manager and died after a long illness in his home town of Engen on 4 November 1988.|$|E

Few claims were made by pilots of the Me 163 and He 162, and none achieved ace status on either of these types.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in the {{northern}} sector continued during this time also, and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards Buin continued into August, <b>combat</b> <b>operations</b> on the island ceased as the war {{came to an end}} before these were completed. As a result, the final Australian operations on Bougainville took place on the Ratsua front in {{the northern}} sector, where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at Porton Plantation had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the Bonis Peninsula. By mid-August, however, following the dropping of two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan's subsequent unconditional surrender, a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this, it spelt an end to major <b>combat</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 1944 Soviet Military Encyclopedia defines {{military}} deception as {{the means}} of securing <b>combat</b> <b>operations</b> and the daily activities of forces; misleading the enemy about the presence and disposition of forces, objectives, combat readiness and plans.

5|$|As <b>combat</b> <b>operations</b> quickly revealed, the {{two sides}} were badly mismatched. FANK, whose ranks had been {{increased}} by thousands of young urban Cambodians who had flocked to join it {{in the months following}} the removal of Sihanouk, had expanded well beyond its capacity to absorb the new men. Later, given the press of tactical operations and the need to replace combat casualties, there was insufficient time to impart needed skills to individuals or to units, and lack of training remained the bane of FANK's existence until its collapse.|$|E
5|$|As many as 15 German Tornados {{undertook}} <b>combat</b> <b>operations</b> {{as a part}} of NATO's campaign {{during the}} Bosnian War; this was the first combat operation for the Luftwaffe since World War II. The Tornados, operating from Piacenza, Italy, flew reconnaissance missions to survey damage inflicted by previous strikes and to scout targets for other aircraft to strike. These reconnaissance missions were reportedly responsible for a significant improvement in target selection throughout the campaign.|$|E

This planned withdrawal implied restrictions on any offensive U.S. action in Cambodia. By the spring of 1970, MACV still maintained 330,648 U.S. Army and 55,039 Marine Corps troops in South Vietnam, {{most of whom were}} concentrated in 81 infantry and tank battalions. Many of them, however, were preparing to leave the country or expected to leave in the near future and would not be available for immediate <b>combat</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E
