50|$|The Heart-Shaped Tub: Framing - Each episode {{will have}} one portion {{dedicated}} to installing a heart-shaped tub in their room. The first tub challenge {{is to build a}} frame for the tub to support on. Dan makes short work of framing the tub despite a few minor snags over the size of the tub, and the speed of his pass even surprises him. Ajay makes the mistake of cutting the tub to its outside perimeter and making a one-inch strip from the <b>cut-out</b> <b>portion</b> as the bathtub's lip instead of cutting the heart shape itself one inch smaller. Matt builds a frame too large for his plywood, but he fails as he takes too long to adjust the frame down to size (having not been completed four hours into a challenge originally scheduled in 3 hours). Rob and Ajay also take too long to install a frame {{due to a lack of}} internal supports. Charlene also takes too long, and fails.|$|E
5000|$|The EP was {{recorded}} by {{friend of the}} band Gar Wood in his garage. It has unusual packaging; the dye-cast cardboard sleeve has a large flower-shaped sticker placed over the center hole, making it necessary to cut the sticker around the center hole in order to remove the record from the sleeve. This causes the <b>cut-out</b> <b>portion</b> of the sticker to then become the center label of the record. The warning [...] "cut carefully and play loud" [...] is printed {{along the edge of}} the area to be cut, since cutting the sticker poses the risk of scratching the record. This warning became the de facto title of the EP. Because of the unusual packaging the records all had to be hand-assembled by the band and friends. The EP was released in 12" [...] vinyl format limited to 3,000 copies, with the first 100 copies pressed on translucent blue vinyl. The original EP is out of print, however all the songs were re-released on CD format on the compilation album Hot Charity/Cut Carefully and Play Loud in 2002.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} a device and method for providing a lateralization effect such as in a medical procedure. The lateralization device can have a supporting member, which {{can be adapted to}} be supported in a fixed position. A lateralization member can be provided to at least partially wrap around the supporting member and be mounted thereto to provide a lateralization effect. The lateralization member can be formed and/or adjusted to provide a variable lateralization. For example, the lateralization member can comprise a cylindrical member with an eccentric <b>cut-out</b> <b>portion</b> adapted to fit over the supporting member. The inter wall of the <b>cut-out</b> <b>portion</b> and the outer wall of the supporting member can be formed with interference fittings so that the lateralization member can rotate in relation to the supporting member to provide a variable lateralization. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

5000|$|When FieldTurf was {{installed}} {{prior to the}} 2005 season, the dirt sliding pits at the three bases were eliminated. The only <b>cut-out</b> <b>portions</b> that remained dirt are the home plate area and the pitcher's mound. The basepaths and infield [...] "skin" [...] portion, normally dirt on a natural grass field, was gold-colored FieldTurf, and the warning track around the perimeter was purple. The outfield of Husky Ballpark was natural grass from 1998 through 2013; with excellent drainage, the bluegrass, rye, and fescue mix allowed play in all weather. With the renovation, the outfield was converted to FieldTurf for the 2014 season. During the summer months, the ballpark is used extensively by youth, semi-pro, and recreational teams.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} factors influencing the market production of bulls and pigs. For bulls, I focused {{on the influence of}} breed, carcass weight and influence of age. In pigs, I watched the effect of carcass weight (HJUT). I started from the measured data that have been gathered under demolition leaves carcasses of bulls and pigs. From these data, I analyzed the impact on bulls breed Holstein cattle, Czech Pied cattle and Holstein crossbreds and Czech Pied cattle. Then I dealt with a market value of pigs and bulls, which I set as the sum of the prices of individual cut-out parts of their carcasses. I assessed the relationship of cutting prices of individual parts of the total sales of carcasses of bulls and pigs. Likewise, I also evaluate the weight of each <b>cut-out</b> <b>portion</b> to the total weight of carcasses of bulls and pigs. Regarding the relationship between výsekovými parts of carcasses of pigs and bulls and total prices for slaughtered uprané body, the highest value of the correlation coefficient in pigs (r = 0. 9958) was found in the leg, with the bulls u perk (r = 0. 9073) ...|$|E

50|$|Day 6 {{begins with}} Geoff getting Tom and Merv {{competing}} {{against each other}} to see who would finish restructuring their half of the container first. The general consensus is that while Tom may be faster, Merv {{is more likely to}} finish with better quality, and indeed this is the case when both finish - so much so that Geoff is concerned with the quality of his work. Geoff, however, is more concerned with Paul's project, as he believes Paul is working too slowly. Geoff also begins work on 4 crib walls needed on the first floor, but they lack the structural steel. Andy suggests that they make the crib walls out of wood (also in short supply) despite Geoff's reservations that the clients would insist on metal. Gordie and Katrina are off in search for wood, but find much more than that, including plywood, steel pipe, scrap metal, and chain-link fencing, all of which are desperately needed. Meanwhile, John's windmill is finished, with the larger fan blades taken from the <b>cut-out</b> <b>portions</b> of the shipping container.|$|R
