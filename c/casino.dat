5|$|Although casinos are {{not under}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the ABC, many of the regulations for casinos and <b>casino</b> vendors are similar to those for ABC class C retailer licensees. Casinos may generally only purchase alcoholic beverages from licensed wholesalers (i.e. ABC Class B licensees). A <b>casino</b> may have a brewpub on site, but production is limited to 3,000 barrels of beer per year, and the beer may only be distributed in open containers on <b>casino</b> floor and in hotel areas of the <b>casino.</b> Casinos may obtain a permit to have tastings, and tasting dinners. Non-profit organizations may obtain a permit to have a social event at a <b>casino</b> where they charge for alcoholic beverages. Organizations are limited to 12 <b>casino</b> social event permits per year, and a given <b>casino</b> may only host 25 such events per year.|$|E

5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} <b>casino</b> gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all <b>casino</b> employees and contractors, and a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the <b>Casino</b> Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating <b>casino</b> license applications, monitoring <b>casino</b> operations, and enforcing New Jersey's <b>casino</b> laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The <b>Casino</b> Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating <b>casino</b> regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on <b>casino</b> licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of <b>casino</b> gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E

25|$|Because Indian <b>casinos</b> pose {{a threat}} to the Non-Indian <b>casinos,</b> a {{gambling}} competition has developed between the two kinds of <b>casinos.</b> Such high-stakes gambling in tribal areas and tax-exempt policy give Indian <b>casinos</b> great advantages in this competition.

It was found that Dutch and French <b>casinos</b> outperformed U. S. <b>casinos</b> in both revenue efficiency and profitability.

5|$|Since {{the tournament}} is {{restricted}} to <b>casino</b> employees, {{most of the big}} name poker professionals and previous bracelet winners are not allowed to participate.

5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a <b>casino,</b> where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The <b>casino</b> is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the <b>casino,</b> she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' <b>Casino,</b> he starts his own <b>casino</b> for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in jars, and wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E

50|$|Because <b>casinos</b> tend {{to allow}} smoking on the {{gambling}} floor, American croupiers {{are exposed to}} secondhand smoke. A health hazard evaluation of several Las Vegas <b>casinos</b> showed that nonsmoker croupiers suffered from more respiratory ailments than their administrative counterparts at the <b>casinos</b> and had cotinine and NNAL (both components of secondhand smoke) in their urine samples.

Lynd rescues Tremble, only to subsequently kill him. Meanwhile, SMERSH agents raid Le Chiffre's base and kill him.|$|E

5|$|Alongside {{changes to}} the stadium itself, Rangers have also sought to develop land around Ibrox. In {{partnership}} with the Las Vegas Sands corporation, the club received outline planning permission from Glasgow City Council {{for the development of}} land adjoining Ibrox as the home of a super <b>casino.</b> The <b>casino</b> was planned to be accompanied by a Rangers-themed leisure complex. Britain's <b>Casino</b> Advisory Panel reviewed bids from eight short-listed cities, including Glasgow, and in 2007 awarded the first licence to Manchester. There is no immediate prospect of the Ibrox proposal being resurrected, as Gordon Brown dropped the plans for super casinos soon after becoming Prime Minister. Rangers were given approval by Glasgow City Council in October 2008 to purchase land around Ibrox and redevelop the area with hotel and retail outlets. This scheme stalled, however, as regulations constrained what could be built in the area.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} attract {{residents}} to gamble, locals <b>casinos</b> try to differentiate themselves from tourist-oriented <b>casinos</b> to benefit gamblers.
