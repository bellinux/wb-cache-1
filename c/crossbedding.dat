40|$|The 200 – 300 m thick, volcano-sedimentary {{sequence}} at Kangerluluk {{is part of}} the psammite zone, one of {{four major}} zones, which constitute the 1. 8 Ga Ketilidian orogen in south Greenland. Three lithofacies are emphasized in the study: (1) the conglomerate-sandstone; (2) the volcanic; and (3) the pyroclastic lithofacies. The 2 – 40 m thick conglomerate-sandstone lithofacies represents a subaerial to subaqueous fan-delta deposit. Matrix- and clast-sup-ported conglomerates are interpreted as debris flow and longitudinal gravel bar deposits. Erosive-based conglomerate channel fills attest to stream incision. Trough <b>crossbedded</b> sandstone, interpreted as lunate megaripples, planar-bed-ded sandstone indicative of upper flow regime bar-top sands, and small-scale trough <b>crossbeds</b> reflecting ripples follow up-section, form collectively with the conglomerate, 0. 40 – 2. 50 m thick fining-upward sequences. The sandstone-dom-inated unit, up-section from the conglomerates and composed of planar and low-angle <b>crossbeds,</b> minor ripples and graded beds as well as mudstone is indicative of a lower shoreface deposit below normal wave base. The clastic sedimentary rocks are suggestive of a fan-delta setting. The 100 – 200 m thick volcanic lithofacies, composed of pillowed and pillow brecciated lava flows, is consistent with shallow-water deposition. Interstratification of lava flows with both conglomerate-sandstone and pyroclastic lithofacies, intrusion of dykes into volcaniclastic rocks, and peperite formation accentuate contemporaneity between volcanism and sedimentation and is a common feature o...|$|R

50|$|The Hoback Formation {{was likely}} formed in a forested {{floodplain}} environment {{during a period}} of humid climate, as indicated by plentiful coal, carbonaceous shale, and fossilized plant remains. Many of the beds observed are dull in color, indicating that they formed in a reducing environment - another sign of a floodplain depositional environment, as standing water and waterlogged soil would be present for {{a substantial portion of the}} year. A prominent sandstone facies (with <b>crossbedding,</b> overbank deposits, and large pebbly deposits), thought to represent a large stream, is also present through much of the formation.|$|E

5000|$|Kurkar is the {{regional}} name for an aeolian quartz sandstone with carbonate cement, {{in other words}} an eolianite or a calcarenite (calcareous sandstone or grainstone), found on the Levantine coast of the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Gaza Strip and northern Sinai Peninsula. The kurkar ridges are prevalent on Israel's coast from the area of Tel Aviv northwards. South of Mount Carmel they form parallel alignments, the result of transgressive coastlines. Kurkar {{is the product of}} windblown quartzitic sands which created dunes during the Pleistocene, whose sand became cemented by carbonates which transformed it into sandstone (lithification process), giving birth to successive ridges along the shore. Kurkar occurs on the shore as well as under the current sea level, on the continental shelf. There are three underwater sandstone ridges off the coast of Israel and two on land. The younger kurkar formations also build small islands or islets along the coast of Israel, Lebanon (at Sidon and near Tripoli), and Syria (Arwad). In the Gaza Strip, coastal plain kurkar deposits of medium to coarse-grained calcareous sandstone are characterized by <b>crossbedding.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Ellisdale site occurs {{within the}} basal {{portion of the}} Marshalltown Formation, of the Late Cretaceous Matawan Group of New Jersey. The {{exposures}} of the Marshalltown Formation at Ellisdale have basal lenticular bedded estuarine clays underlain by <b>crossbedded</b> coastal sands of the Englishtown Formation. The estuarine clays are overlain by well-sorted, <b>crossbedded</b> sand and offshore glauconites, respectively. The entire sequence is interpreted as preserving the landward migration of a barrier beach/backbay/estuarine/deltaic complex during the Marshalltown transgression. Vertebrate fossils are concentrated with rip-up clasts near {{the base of the}} estuarine clay sequence in a lag deposit consisting of siderite pebbles, poorly graded sand, and lignite. The fossil layer is considered a single-event storm deposit based on sedimentology and stratigraphy. The upper (marine) member of the Marshalltown was formerly considered latest Campanian in age, due to the presence of the foraminifer Globotruncana calcarata; however the G. calcarata zone has since been redated as Middle Campanian in age (75-76 ma). A recent study of fossil pollen from the estuarine strata enclosing the fossil layer has determined an Early to Mid-Campanian age for the stratum (76 - 80 ma) and a fresh or brackish water tidal marsh environment of deposition.|$|R

40|$|In the Southern Bight of the North Sea 21 boxcores {{have been}} taken. In {{the central part}} of the Southern Bight, {{directional}} bimodal, mainly small-scale <b>crossbedding,</b> with some troughshaped sets are found. In 2 boxcores, large scale <b>crossbedding</b> is found. The grainsize, the sedimentary structures, and the calculated current velocities at one meter above the bed during spring tide, point to (recent) sedimentation by migration of small scale ripple trains under the normal flow regime in the Southern Bight. Boxcores from the sand wave field show no signs of a different sedimentation regime. Nor the sedimentary structures in boxcores from the depression west of the Brown Bank do. A slight dominance in the northern direction of the orientation of the cross bedding supports the calculated net sand transport to the north (McCAVE, 1971 a). Off the coast of Holland, sedimentary structures and their orientation point to wave influence in sedimentation at 18 m depth. Sand, gravel and mud has been found close together off Lowestoft (East Anglia). The gravel consists for over more than 80 % of flint, and shows no signs sedimentary structures. The gravel has recently been replaced. The mud consists of layers of sand, alternating with horizontally laminated clay. The recent deposition of clay is probably the result of a high concentration of suspended sediment during considerable time, coupled with negligible wave activity (McCAVE, 1971 b) ...|$|E
40|$|ABStRACt: Many of the straighter, less rocky {{parts of}} the {{southern}} Oregon coast are characterized by nearshore bars that extend obliquely out from shore and migrate alongshore. A typical oblique bar {{is attached to the}} foreshore at its upcurrent end, nearly parallel to shore through most of its length, and bowed seaward into a tip-channel-mouth bar at its downcurrent end. The main part of an obhque bar is separated from the foreshore by a longshore trough that curves seaward into a rip channel. The net wave-induced currents flow obliquely shoreward over the bar, parallel to shore through the longshore trough, and seaward through the tip channel and over the tip-channel-mouth bar. Medium-scale <b>crossbedding</b> formed by the migration of megaripples in the direction of net water flow is the dominant internal structure in most of the nearshore. Small-scale <b>crossbedding</b> formed by wave-tipple migration is dominant in the inner offshore, and planar bedding is dominant on the foreshore. Most or all of the bar deposits would be destroyed if the coast prograded slowly but continuously. The vertical sequence produced during progradation should be characterized, in ascending order, by inner offshore deposits, possibly deposits of the lower seaward slope of the bar, a subhotizontal erosion surface corresponding to the deepest part of the rip channel, rip channel deposits, longshore trough deposits, deposits of the foreshore-trough transition, and foreshore deposits. Subhotizontal erosion surfaces probably occur in deposits formed by the slow progradation of most kinds of barred nearshore systems, but they should not occur in deposits formed by the progradation of a non-barred nearshore system. The nature of the deposits produced by the progradation of a barred nearshore system should vary with orientation of the bars relative to the shoreline, number of bars, wave energy, and available grain sizes...|$|E

40|$|The Hawkesbury Sandstone {{has long}} been assumed to {{represent}} the deposits of a large braided river system, comparable in style and magnitude with the modern Brahmaputra River of Bangladesh. Such an interpretation is based mainly on the common occurrence of very large-scale <b>crossbedding,</b> but no architectural studies of the unit have hitherto been carried out. This paper represents a first attempt to estimate the magnitude of Hawkesbury channels and bars {{on the basis of}} the preserved architectural evidence. Photomosaics were constructed of two cliff sections south of Sydney, one 5. 6 km in length. On the basis of these profiles we estimate that characteristic channel-scale architectural elements are at least 2. 7 km wide, and individual macroforms are 5 - 10 m high, indicating the constructional depth of typical channels. Hollow elements (scoop-shaped units interpreted to have formed at channel confluences) are up to 20 m deep. These magnitudes are large, but measurably smaller that those of channels and bars in the modern Brahmaputra River of Bangladesh...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{lower and}} middle Cambrian {{succession}} (Ram Group) in Jordan {{is described in}} lexicon-style format to document an important phase of Earth history following the uplift and erosion of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (Aqaba Complex) during the late Neoproterozoic, and younger, but more localised, intrusive and volcanic! volcaniclastic activity that formed the Araba Complex.

Rapid uplift and erosion of the granitoid basement (Arabian-Nubian Shield or ANS) resulted in a peneplanation of the Aqaba Complex over millions of years duration (latest Neoproterozoic to Cambrian) in the Southern Desert of Jordan. Early Cambrian pebbly sandstones and locally derived conglomerates (Salib Formation) were deposited on an alluvial plain by high velocity-high discharge, northward flowing (NNE to NNW) braided rivers, characterised by trough <b>crossbedding</b> and erosive tabular sets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Along {{the south}} shore of Bainbridge Island and north shore of the Kitsap Peninsula, Wash., the Blakeley Formation of Weaver (1912), {{consists}} of approximately 2, 400 m of volcaniclastic sandstone, conglomerate, mudstone, and shale that is interpreted {{to be part of}} an ancient submarine fan complex. Three lithofacies units of Oligocene age are recognized within the sequence. The oldest unit consists of poorly-sorted uhgraded isorganized conglomerate, subordinate graded organized conglomerate, and interbedded mudstone and turbidite sandstone beds assigned to the Refugian and Zemorrian Stages. Asecond conglomeratic unit consisting ofZemorrian strata is interpreted to be a channel facies eroded into and emplaced within the underlying Refugian sequence. The two conglomerate-bearing lithofacies grade upward into a fine-grained sandstone and siltstone succession approximately 1, 100 m thick that is interpreted to be an outer-fan (distal) turbidite sequence. Sedimentary structures (flute casts, <b>crossbedding,</b> and imbricated clasts) indicate westward trans-port of sediment, probably from a Cascade Range source terrane. Deep water turbidite sedimentation suggests hat he Blakeley Formation was deposited ina deep marginal basin similar to modern basins in the southern California borderland...|$|E
