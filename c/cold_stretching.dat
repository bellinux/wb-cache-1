40|$|AbstractAustenitic {{stainless}} steel {{is widely used}} in pressure vessels for storage of liquid gas, such as LN 2, LO 2, LH 2. To make wall thin and weight light, <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> technology is applied in cryogenic pressure vessel manufacture. <b>Cold</b> <b>stretching</b> is performed by pressurizing a vessel to a specific pressure and maintaining the pressure {{for a moment to}} produce a certain amount of plastic deformation, so that the yield strength of the vessel material could be strengthened after releasing the pressure. Cryogenic stretching is similar in principle to <b>cold</b> <b>stretching,</b> but the medium is liquid nitrogen instead of water in <b>cold</b> <b>stretching.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>stretching</b> has been recorded in standards such as Cold-Stretching Directions 1991, AS 1210 -Supp 2 - 1999, EN 13458 - 2 : 2002, EN 13530 - 2 : 2002, ASME BPVC VIII-I Code Case 2596, ISO 20421 - 1 : 2006, ISO 21009 - 1 : 2008. Nevertheless, cryogenic stretching is not applied in pressure vessels manufacture due to lack for detailed investigation. To investigate mechanical behaviors of cold stretched and cryogenic stretched austenitic {{stainless steel}} pressure vessels, a series of tests for S 30403 were performed at 20 °C (temperature in which <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> proceeds) and - 196 °C (temperature in which cryogenic stretching proceeds), the difference of martensite transformation, strength and plasticity in which were compared. Finite element analysis method based on MISO model was used to simulate <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> process of pressure vessel, including the process of loading to strengthening pressure, unloading to no-load state and reloading to design pressure. Considering material properties difference, different types of strengthening pressure methods for cryogenic stretching were performed to confirm a rational strengthening pressure value. Mises equivalent stress, tresca equivalent stress, circumferential stress, axial stress and deformation were taken into consideration. The investigation has shown that compared with <b>cold</b> <b>stretching,</b> cryogenic stretching could improve material properties more significantly. In other words, pressure vessels could have thinner wall and lighter weight after cryogenic stretching...|$|E
40|$|Austenitic {{stainless}} steels (ASS) have good {{ductility and toughness}} but low yield strength. In order to save material and realize lightweight of pressure vessels, the <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> technology {{can be used to}} enhance ASS’s yield strength. Based on the control of different strain, the material parameters of strength, ductility and volume fraction of strain-induced martensite (SIM) were obtained. The results show that <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> can significantly improve ASS’s yield strength and have minor effect on material’s plasticity and content of SIM. The ASS still maintain enough plastic margin after <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> and thus can substantially reduce the wall thickness of vessel. In the quasi-static conditions, the mechanical parameters are not sensitive to strain rate. However, too small strain rate will lead to occurrence of serrated yielding, which is called Portevin-Le Chatelier (PLC) effect.

40|$|AbstractCold {{stretching}} of {{austenitic stainless}} steel is used to increase its relatively low yield strength by tensile straining at room temperature. Very few studies {{on the influence of}} <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> for {{austenitic stainless steel}}s properties are available. This paper focuses on the fatigue behaviors of solution annealed (SA) and cold stretched (CS) S 31603 austenitic stainless steel under stress control at 550 °C. The results show that the strain amplitude of both SA and CS materials gradually decreases with the development of cyclic deformation until it increases rapidly due to the formation of macrocracks. In all cases, the strain amplitude is smaller in CS conditions compared to that in SA conditions. The longer life cycle of the CS steel is attributed to the smaller strain amplitude, the higher strength, and no α′-martensite formed during <b>cold</b> <b>stretching.</b> The life cycle of CS steel increases with the raised <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> level and is roughly characterized by their exponential relationship...|$|E

50|$|The {{dry process}} {{involves}} extruding, annealing and stretching steps. The final porosity {{depends on the}} morphology of the precursor film and the specifics of each step. The extruding step is generally carried out at a temperature higher than the melting point of the polymer resin. This is because the resins are melted to shape them into a uniaxially-oriented tubular film, called a precursor film. The structure and orientation of the precursor film depends on the processing conditions and the resin's characteristics. In the annealing process, the precursor is annealed at a temperature slightly lower than the polymer's melting point. The purpose of this step {{is to improve the}} crystalline structure. During stretching, the annealed film is deformed along the machine direction by a <b>cold</b> <b>stretch</b> followed by a hot stretch followed by relaxation. The <b>cold</b> <b>stretch</b> creates the pore structure by stretching the film at a lower temperature with a faster strain rate. The hot stretch increases pore sizes using a higher temperature and a slower strain rate. The relaxation step reduces internal stress within the film.|$|R

40|$|Cold {{stretched}} {{pressure vessels}} from {{austenitic stainless steel}} (ASS), which are sometimes subjected to alternative loads during operation, {{have been widely used}} for storage and transportation of liquefied gases. Understanding how the fatigue properties respond to <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> is the basis for establishing fatigue design method of such vessels. This paper involves in the fatigue properties of ASS with 9 % plastic deformation by pre-stretching parallel to the rolling direction at room temperature. For this purpose, low-cycle fatigue tests at total strain amplitudes ranging from ± 0. 4 to 0. 8 % of cold stretched ASS EN 1. 4301 (equivalents include UNS S 30400, AISI 304) are performed, while the martensite contents are measured during the fatigue cycles. A comparison study of cyclic stress-strain behavior and fatigue lives is carried out for both cold stretched and solution annealed specimens. Based on the testing results, a S-N curve of cold stretched ASS is obtained, which is compared with the design curves given by the standards such as ASME BPVC VIII- 2.

40|$|Abstract: Ultrahigh {{molecular}} weight polyethylene/SiO 2 hybrid hollow fiber membranes were prepared by thermally induced phase separation (TIPS), using mineral oil as the diluent and SiO 2 as the additive. The influences of heat-treatment, drawing ratio and drawing temperature on melting behavior, crystalliza-tion, multi-pore-structure (MPS) and porosity were investigated. The {{results of this}} study demonstrated that the original crystal grains became more perfect and that new micro crystallites were produced through heat treatment. Defects were more easily formed by the micro crystallites in <b>cold</b> <b>stretching.</b> Heat treat-ment also made the pores contract. The MPS including TIPS pore, stretching pore and interfacial mi-crovoid was constructed after stretching. A model of interfacial microvoid was built. The model indicated that the area of interfacial microvoid increased as the drawing ratio became larger, reaching a maximum at a certain drawing ratio. Values above this maximum drawing ratio made no contribution to further in-crease the triangular area of interfacial microvoid but made many TIPS pores close. As the drawing ratio increased, the pore diameter (PD) and total pore fraction (TPF) of the stretched pores increased whereas the TPF of the TIPS pores decreased. The pore diameter distribution (PDD) and the porosity resulted from the joint effect of multiple pores. Without stretching, the porosity was slight due to the pores con-tracting, and it increased as the drawing ratio became larger, reaching a maximum at a drawing ratio of 5 times.

40|$|Improving {{structural}} efficiency while reducing manufacturing costs are key objectives when making future heavy-lift launchers more performing and cost efficient. The main enabling technologies are {{the application of}} advanced high performance materials as well as cost effective manufacture processes. This paper presents the status and main results of a joint industrial research & development effort to demonstrate TRL 6 of a novel manufacturing process for large liquid propellant tanks for launcher applications. Using high strength aluminium-lithium alloy combined with the spin forming manufacturing technique, this development aims at thinner wall thickness and weight savings up to 25 % {{as well as a}} significant reduction in manufacturing effort. In this program, the concave spin forming process is used to manufacture tank domes from a single flat plate. Applied to aluminium alloy, this process allows reaching the highest possible material strength status T 8, eliminating numerous welding steps which are typically necessary to assemble tank domes from 3 D-curved panels. To minimize raw material costs for large diameter tank domes for launchers, the dome blank has been composed from standard plates welded together prior to spin forming by friction stir welding. After welding, the dome blank is contoured {{in order to meet the}} required wall thickness distribution. For achieving a material state of T 8, also in the welding seams, the applied spin forming process allows the required <b>cold</b> <b>stretching</b> of the 3 D-curved dome, with a subsequent ageing in a furnace. This combined manufacturing process has been demonstrated up to TRL 6 for tank domes with a 5. 4 m diameter. In this paper, the manufacturing process as well as test results are presented.

6000|$|But on the morrow morning all Paris is out; such a {{crowd as}} no man had seen. The Death-carts, Valaze's <b>cold</b> corpse <b>stretched</b> among the yet living Twenty-one, roll along. Bareheaded, hands bound; in their shirt-sleeves, coat flung loosely round the neck: so fare the eloquent of France; bemurmured, beshouted. To the shouts of Vive la Republique, {{some of them}} keep {{answering}} with counter-shouts of Vive la Republique. Others, as Brissot, sit sunk in silence. At {{the foot of the}} scaffold they again strike up, with appropriate variations, the Hymn of the Marseillese. Such an act of music; conceive it well! The yet Living chant there; the chorus so rapidly wearing weak! Samson's axe is rapid; one head per minute, or little less. The chorus is worn out; farewell for evermore ye Girondins. Te-Deum Fauchet has become silent; Valaze's dead head is lopped: the sickle of the Guillotine has reaped the Girondins all away. 'The eloquent, the young, the beautiful and brave!' exclaims Riouffe. O Death, what feast is toward in thy ghastly Halls? ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} procedure envisages {{the welding}} of an aluminum component by cold pressing on the cogged {{surface of a}} more rigid component. Special {{attention is paid to}} the deformation of the plastic component. Welded joints between aluminum and copper, brass, carbon steel, stainless steel has been obtained. The maximum mechanical resistance may be obtained with a deformation rate of minimum 20 % for the welding of aluminum with copper and brass, and of 30 % for the welding of aluminum with steels respectively. The values are much lower than those used for the classic <b>cold</b> welding. The <b>stretch</b> resistance of the joint is reduced up to 10 % of the aluminum stretch resistance, the shearing resistance being better...|$|R
