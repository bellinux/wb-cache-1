A 10 % <b>copolymer</b> composite was prepared and casted as film {{to be used}} as a biomaterial and the <b>copolymer</b> films without the compound acted as control. TGA, DSC, AFM, SEM and EDAX analysis were performed for the above samples. Surface roughness (R(a)) of the <b>copolymer</b> composite film was less when compared to the <b>copolymer</b> film which indicated the proper distribution of chalcone in the composite film. <b>copolymer</b> composite film was hydrophilic compared to <b>copolymer</b> film.

Polymers {{with two or}} three blocks of two distinct chemical species (e.g., A and B) are called diblock <b>copolymers</b> and triblock <b>copolymers,</b> respectively.

25|$|It is {{also used}} to stain <b>copolymers</b> preferentially, the best known example being block <b>copolymers</b> where one phase can be stained so as to show the {{microstructure}} of the material. For example, styrene-butadiene block <b>copolymers</b> have a central polybutadiene chain with polystyrene end caps. When treated with OsO4, the butadiene matrix reacts preferentially and so absorbs the oxide. The presence of a heavy metal is sufficient to block the electron beam, so the polystyrene domains are seen clearly in thin films in TEM.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{micelles}} {{was introduced to}} describe the core-corona aggregates of small surfactant molecules, however it has also extended to describe aggregates of amphiphilic block <b>copolymers</b> in selective solvents.

Surfactant molecules have a molecular weight which is generally of a few hundreds of grams per mole while block <b>copolymers</b> are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, thanks to the larger hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, block <b>copolymers</b> can have a much more pronounced amphiphilic nature when compared to surfactant molecules.|$|E

The chain conformation of the block <b>copolymer</b> and alternating <b>copolymer</b> were investigated with changes of the segregation strength. Our simulations revealed that the segment distribution along the <b>copolymer</b> chain and the segregation strength between coarse-grained beads are two important parameters controlling phase separation and chain conformation in thin films of a <b>copolymer</b> blend.

Visualization of drop deformation using a counter-rotating apparatus showed enhanced drop deformation for a drop with block <b>copolymer</b> resulting in larger area generation. Drops with block <b>copolymer</b> showed widening even for shear strains exceeding 10, in contrast to bare drops, which first widened and then shrank.
