25|$|To {{strengthen}} behavior, Skinner used operant conditioning, and {{he considered}} the rate of response {{to be the most}} effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning he invented the operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chamber,</b> also known as the Skinner Box, and to measure rate he invented the cumulative recorder.

25|$|The typical {{laboratory}} {{environment to}} study labor supply in pigeons {{is set up}} as follows. Pigeons are first deprived of food. Since the animals become hungry, food becomes highly desired. The pigeons are then placed in an operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chamber</b> and through orienting and exploring {{the environment of the}} chamber they discover that by pecking a small disk located {{on one side of the}} chamber, food is delivered to them. In effect, pecking behavior becomes reinforced, as it is associated with food. Before long, the pigeon pecks at the disk (or stimulus) regularly.|$|E

50|$|Despite such {{a simple}} configuration, one operandum and one feeder, it is {{possible}} to investigate many psychological phenomena. Modern operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers</b> typically have many operanda, like many response levers, two or more feeders, and a variety of devices capable of generating many stimuli, including lights, sounds, music, figures, and drawings. Some configurations use an LCD panel for the computer generation of a variety of visual stimuli.|$|R
25|$|Researchers {{have studied}} demand in rats {{in a manner}} {{distinct}} from studying labor supply in pigeons. Specifically, in an operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chamber</b> containing rats as experimental subjects, we require them to press a bar, instead of pecking a small disk, to receive a reward. The reward can be food (reward pellets), water, or a commodity drink such as cherry cola. Unlike in previous pigeon studies, where the work analog was pecking and the monetary analog was reward, the work analog in this experiment is bar-pressing. Under these circumstances, the researchers claim that changing the number of bar presses required to obtain a commodity item is analogous to changing {{the price of a}} commodity item in human economics.|$|E
25|$|A {{handful of}} {{comparative}} psychologists {{have attempted to}} demonstrate quasi-economic reasoning in non-human animals. Early attempts along these lines focus {{on the behavior of}} rats and pigeons. These studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology, where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentally-tractable non-human animals. They are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner. Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminology. Although such studies are set up primarily in an operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chamber</b> using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar-pressing not in terms of reinforcement and stimulus-response relationships but instead in terms of work, demand, budget, and labor. Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more evolutionary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of non-human primate, the capuchin monkey.|$|E

40|$|Rationale and {{objectives}} Previous research with an animal model of relapse {{has shown that}} acute food deprivation will reinstate extinguished drug seeking. Recent evidence with humans, however, suggests that chronic food restriction rather than acute food deprivation is related to increases in drug taking and relapse, emphasizing a need for an animal model to elucidate the neural mechanisms mediating the effects of chronic food restriction on drug seeking. Here we studied the effects of chronic food restriction {{during a period of}} abstinence on heroin seeking in rats. Methods Rats were trained to self-administer heroin over 10 days (0. 1 mg/kg/infusion; i. v.).

40|$|An {{important}} empirical {{and theoretical}} {{issue in the}} study of learning is the manner in which one’s learning about one cue affects learning about another cue. In most cases, one’s learning about one cue competes with learning about other cues (i. e., overshadowing or blocking), and these cue competition effects have inspired and guided some of the most influential ideas about the mechanisms of learning (see, e. g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). In other cases, the presence of one cue can facilitate learning about a second cue. For example, taste cues have been found to facilitate learning about odor cues in food aversion learning (e. g., Rusiniak, Palmerino, Rice, Forthman, & Garcia, 1982). Most studies of interactions among cues (i. e., cue com-petition or cue facilitation) have been done with the use of stimuli available in <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers.</b> Recently, how...|$|R

By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response ("memory"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chamber</b> has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the water maze.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the anti-relapse {{compound}} acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate) on the conditioned rewarding effects of ethanol, cocaine and morphine were studied using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. During 3 days of drug conditioning, mice were pretreated with saline or acamprosate (30, 100 or 300 mg kg− 1 i. p.) 10 min prior to the administration of ethanol (2 g kg− 1 i. p.), cocaine (15 mg kg− 1 i. p.) or morphine (10 mg kg− 1 i. p.), and subsequently confined {{to one of two}} distinct <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers.</b> On the following day, mice were tested for the expression of CPP. Acamprosate dose-dependently reduced the development of CPP to ethanol and cocaine but not morphine.

40|$|On {{avoidance}} procedures, {{rats and}} pigeons typically show warmup effects, characterized by improving performance within sessions {{and loss of}} the improvement (“warmup decrement”) between sessions. Between-session losses were examined by varying the time between periods of avoidance training. In one experiment, rats lived fulltime in <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers</b> while intermission intervals were varied. In a second experiment, the animals lived in home cages between sessions; timeout intervals were introduced at midession, producing recurrence of warmup in the second half-session. In both experiments, the warmup decrements increased substantially as the timeout or intersession intervals were increased from zero to 30 minutes. With intervals of 60 or 120 minutes, the decrements approached or exceeded those obtained with intervals of a day or more. When avoidance was interposed between appetitive sessions, the appetitive responding was disrupted, but this seemed unrelated to the warmup or to the proficiency of avoidance. The warmup in avoidance shares characteristics with transient punishment effects, with the Kamin effect, and with habituation phenomena, but it is premature to assume that they reflect common processes...|$|R
2500|$|To {{implement}} his empirical approach, Skinner {{invented the}} operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chamber,</b> or [...] "Skinner Box", in which {{subjects such as}} pigeons and rats were isolated and could be exposed to carefully controlled stimuli.

[...] Another invention, the cumulative recorder, produced a graphical record from which these response rates could be estimated. These records were the primary data that Skinner and his colleagues used to explore the effects on response rate of various reinforcement schedules. A reinforcement schedule may be defined as [...] "any procedure that delivers reinforcement to an organism according to some well-defined rule". The effects of schedules became, in turn, the basic findings from which Skinner developed his account of operant conditioning. He also drew on many less formal observations of human and animal behavior.|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{who fall}} under the {{spectrum}} of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome have a higher prevalence of several cognitive disturbances, including a greater probability of being diagnosed with attention-defcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Some of these effects, such as hyperactivity and attentional impairments, are already well established in the literature. The assessment of impulsive choice, however, has received little attention in human and animal studies. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on two tasks related to impulsive choice {{that have never been}} studied in this condition: delay and probability discounting. Method: Rats prenatally exposed to ethanol (liquid diets with 0 %, 10 %, or 35 % ethanol-derived calories [EDC] or laboratory chow) were trained to respond for food in either delay (n = 21) or probability (n = 48) discounting tasks performed in computer-controlled operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers.</b> Results: Prenatal treatment failed to differentiate the rates at which the rats chose the larger reinforcer associated with delay - in a task in which 35 % EDC was not tested - or risk, although the results suggest that further tests are warranted...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between the rate of a response (B) {{and the rate of}} its reinforcement (R) is well known to be approximately hyperbolic: B  =  kR/(R + Ro), where k represents the maximum response rate, and Ro indicates the rate of reinforcers that will engender a response rate equal to half its maximum value. A review of data reported in 17 published papers revealed that, under variable-interval schedules of reinforcement, Ro was usually lower when pigeons were the subjects than when rats were the subjects. The value of k, in contrast, did not differ consistently between pigeons and rats. Some accounts interpret Ro as the rate of alternative, unscheduled reinforcers in the situation, expressed in units of the scheduled reinforcer. So interpreted, the difference in Ro implies that less alternative reinforcement (relative to the scheduled reinforcement) typically is available to pigeons in their operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers</b> than it is to rats in theirs. Whether or not that interpretation of Ro is valid, the pigeon–rat difference in Ro ensures that for reinforcer rates above about 10 per hour, response rate will be noticeably less sensitive to changes in reinforcer rate (and presumably to changes in other incentive and motivational operations) with pigeons than with rats as subjects, at least with the experimental conditions typically employed...|$|R

The catheter is secured to the animal by a harness or back plate and is tethered to a protective leash that extends upward {{through a hole in}} the top of a chamber, where it attaches to a rotating swivel on a mechanical arm that allows the subject to move around freely. The chamber houses two levers: one whose depression results in the delivery of a drug, the other whose depression does nothing. Activity on these levers can be used to measure drug administration (via activity at the drug-inducing lever) as well as changes in nonspecific behavior that reflect short- and long-term effects of the drug (via activity at the non-inducing lever). The sterile intravenous catheter used to deliver the drug into the bloodstream of the subject is typically composed of a flexible plastic, silastic tubing and nylon mesh placed subcutaneously. [...] It is attached to a mechanical pump that can be calibrated to deliver a specific amount of drug upon depression of one of the levers in the chamber.Other chamber modifications are required if the drug is to be delivered orally or via inhalation, such as liquid containers or an aerosol distribution mechanism.|$|R

We have developed a procedure to study the behavioral and neural processes that mediate the impact of context on alcohol-seeking behavior in rats. Following acclimation to the taste and pharmacological effects of 15 % ethanol in the home cage, male Long-Evans rats receive Pavlovian discrimination training (PDT) in <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers.</b> In each daily (Mon-Fri) PDT session, 16 trials each of two different 10 sec auditory conditioned stimuli occur.

Across sessions, entries into the fluid port during the CS+ increase, whereas entries during the CS- stabilize at a lower level, indicating that a predictive association between the CS+ and ethanol is acquired. During PDT each chamber {{is equipped with a}} specific configuration of visual, olfactory and tactile contextual stimuli. Following PDT, extinction training is conducted in the same chamber that is now equipped with a different configuration of contextual stimuli.

40|$|A main {{challenge}} in the therapy of drug dependent individuals is to help them reactivate interest in non-drug-associated activities. We previously developed a rat experimental model based on the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in which only four 15 -min episodes of social interaction with a gender- and weight-matched male Sprague Dawley rat (1) reversed CPP from cocaine to social interaction despite continuing cocaine training and (2) prevented the reinstatement of cocaine CPP. In the present study, we investigated which of the sensory modalities of the composite stimulus “social interaction” contributes most to the rats' preference for it. If touch was limited by steel bars spaced {{at a distance of}} 2 cm and running across the whole length of a partitioning, CPP was still acquired, albeit to a lesser degree. If both rats were placed {{on the same side of}} a partitioning, rats did not develop CPP for social interaction. Thus, decreasing the available area for social interaction from 750 to 375 cm 2 prevented the acquisition of CPP to social interaction despite the fact that animals could touch each other more intensely than through the bars of the partitioning. When touch was fully restricted by a glass screen dividing the <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers,</b> and the only sensory modalities left were visual and olfactory cues, place preference shifted to place aversion. Overall, our findings indicate that the major rewarding sensory component of the composite stimulus “social interaction” is touch (taction) ...|$|R

The purpose of this experiment was to use neurohistochemical analysis of rapidly developing c-Fos protein to elucidate neurobiological loci involved in the processing of nicotine as an interoceptive conditioned stimulus (CS). Rats were injected (SC) in an intermixed fashion with saline or nicotine (16 sessions of each) and placed in <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers</b> where they were given one of the three conditions depending on group assignment: (a) nicotine paired 100 % of the time with intermittent access to sucrose (nicotine-CS condition), (b) nicotine and saline each paired 50 % of the time with sucrose (chamber-CS condition), or (c) no sucrose US control (CS-alone condition). Rats in the nicotine-CS condition acquired the discrimination as evidenced by goal-tracking (ie, increased dipper entries before initial sucrose delivery) only on nicotine sessions. The chamber-CS condition showed goal-tracking on all sessions; no goal-tracking was seen in the CS-alone condition. On the test day, rats in each condition were challenged with saline or nicotine and later assessed for c-Fos immunoreactivity. In concordance with previous reports, nicotine induced c-Fos expression in the majority of areas tested; however, learning-dependent expression was specific to dorsomedial and ventromedial regions of caudate-putamen (dmCPu, vmCPu). Only rats in the nicotine-CS condition, when challenged with nicotine, had higher c-Fos expression in the dmCPu and vmCPu.

40|$|Conditioned {{behavioral}} {{responses to}} discrete drug-associated cues can be modulated {{by the environmental}} context in which those cues are experienced, a process that may facilitate relapse in humans. Rodent models of drug self-administration have been adapted to reveal the capacity of contexts to trigger drug seeking, thereby enabling neurobiological investigations of this effect. We tested the hypothesis that dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, a neural structure that mediates reinforcement, is necessary for context-induced reinstatement of responding for ethanol-associated cues. Rats pressed one lever (active) for oral ethanol (0. 1  ml; 10 % v/v) in operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers</b> distinguished by specific visual, olfactory, and tactile contextual stimuli. Ethanol delivery was paired with a discrete (4  s) light-noise stimulus. Responses on a second lever (inactive) were not reinforced. Behavior was then extinguished by withholding ethanol but not the discrete stimulus in a different context. Reinstatement, expressed as elevated responding for the discrete stimulus without ethanol delivery, was tested by placing rats into the prior self-administration context after administration of saline or the dopamine D 1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 (0. 006, 0. 06, and 0. 6  μg/side), into the nucleus accumbens core or shell. Compared with extinction responding, active lever pressing in saline-pretreated rats was enhanced by placement into the prior ethanol self-administration context.

These findings suggest a critical role for dopamine acting via D 1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens in the reinstatement of responding for ethanol cues triggered by placement into an ethanol-associated context...|$|R
40|$|Working {{memory is}} a form of {{short-term}} memory involved in the storage (maintenance) of information over time and reorganization (manipulation) of a memory set necessary for complex cognition. The human frontal cortex and striatum are involved with working memory; however, the mechanisms through which these structures contribute to working memory are incompletely understood. Given the similarities between cortical and striatal areas in the human and rodent brain, I used rats to elucidate the contrbutions of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsomedial striatum (dmSTR) using two working memory tasks. The trial unique non-match to location (TUNL) task is a delayed-non-match-to-sample visual working memory task performed in touchscreen equipped operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers.</b> TUNL enables the concurrent assessment of delay-dependent and “pattern separation” effects that were not possible with previous delayed-non-match-to-sample-tasks. The odour span task (OST) measures working memory capacity using an incremental delayed-non-match-to-sample paradigm that involves the addition of stimuli (scented bowls) after each correct response. Results obtained following systemic treatment of rats with a broad spectrum NMDA receptor antagonist showed that NMDA receptors contribute to performance of both tasks. Given the contribution of cortical GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptors to working memory in primates, we tested the role of these receptors in the TUNL task and OST. Systemic injections of the GluN 2 B-containing NMDA receptor antagonist Ro 25 - 6981 impaired OST but not TUNL accuracy. Additional experiments with intracranial infusions showed NMDA receptors in mPFC or dmSTR contribute to TUNL task accuracy. Ro 25 - 6981 infusions into dmSTR, but not mPFC impaired OST.

Training occurred in operant <b>conditioning</b> <b>chambers</b> distinguished by contextual stimuli, and resulted in increased entries into the ethanol delivery port during the CS+ {{when compared with the}} CS−. In experiment 1, port entries were then extinguished in a second context by withholding ethanol, after which context-induced renewal of ethanol-seeking was tested by presenting both stimuli without ethanol in the previous training context. This manipulation stimulated strong responding to the CS+ in rats pretreated with saline in the core (n= 9) or shell (n= 10), which was attenuated by pharmacologically inactivating (muscimol/baclofen; 0. 1 / 1. 0 [*]mM; 0. 3 [*]μl/side) either subregion pretest. In experiment 2, after discrimination, training rats were habituated to a different context in which ethanol and both stimuli were withheld. Cue-induced ethanol-seeking was then elicited by presenting the CS+ and CS− without ethanol in the different context. Saline-pretreated rats responded more to the CS+ than the CS− (core n= 8; shell n= 9), and inactivating the core but not shell attenuated this effect. These data highlight an important role for the core in cue-induced ethanol-seeking, and suggest that the shell is required to mediate the influence of contexts on conditioned ethanol-seeking...|$|R
