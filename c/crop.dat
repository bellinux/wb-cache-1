5|$|<b>Crop</b> diversityis the {{variance}} ingeneticandphenotypiccharacteristics of plants used inagriculture. Over the past 50 years, {{there has been}} a major decline in two components of <b>crop</b> diversity; genetic diversity within each <b>crop</b> and the number of species commonly grown.|$|E
5|$|In the Bahamas, {{insurers}} and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300million (2004 dollars). All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana <b>crop,</b> were lost during Frances. The pineapple <b>crop</b> was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire fruit <b>crop</b> was lost for similar reasons. The corn <b>crop</b> in Long Island and Cat Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide <b>crop</b> milk. Contemporary depictions show a large <b>crop,</b> which was {{probably}} used to add space for food storage and to produce <b>crop</b> milk. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of <b>crop</b> milk they could produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
50|$|Important non-food <b>crops</b> include horticulture, {{floriculture}} {{and industrial}} <b>crops.</b> Horticulture <b>crops</b> include plants {{used for other}} <b>crops</b> (e.g. fruit trees). Floriculture <b>crops</b> include bedding plants, houseplants, flowering garden and pot plants, cut cultivated greens, and cut flowers. Industrial <b>crops</b> are produced for clothing (fiber <b>crops),</b> biofuel (energy <b>crops,</b> algae fuel), or medicine (medicinal plants).|$|R
50|$|Agriculture {{produced}} in the commune is highly diversified and focuses on three types of <b>crops,</b> namely cereal <b>crops,</b> cash <b>crops</b> and other food <b>crops.</b> Vegetable <b>crops</b> are also grown.|$|R
50|$|For {{teaching}} purpose, {{plant breeding}} {{is presented as}} four categories: Line breeding (autogamous <b>crops),</b> population breeding (allogamous <b>crops),</b> hybrid breeding (mostly allogamous <b>crops,</b> some autogamous <b>crops),</b> clone breeding (vegetatively propagated <b>crops).</b>|$|R
5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide <b>crop</b> milk. The risings on the <b>crop</b> of the female may have covered glands that produced the <b>crop</b> milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young <b>crop</b> milk, while the male collected food in the <b>crop</b> and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of <b>crop</b> milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|Modern plant breeders {{develop new}} <b>crop</b> {{varieties}} to meet specific conditions. A new variety might, for example, be higher yielding, more disease resistant {{or have a}} longer shelf life than the varieties from which it was bred. The practical use of <b>crop</b> diversity goes back to early agricultural methods of <b>crop</b> rotation and fallow fields, where planting and harvesting one type of <b>crop</b> on a plot of land one year, and planting a different <b>crop</b> on that same plot the next year. This takes advantage of differences in a plant's nutrient needs, but more importantly reduces the buildup of pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} <b>crop</b> {{can result from}} various growing conditions, for example a <b>crop</b> growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} stunted growth than a <b>crop</b> growing in more fertile soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence <b>crop</b> growth.|$|E
5000|$|Different <b>crops</b> require {{different}} {{amounts of}} energy input. For example, glasshouse <b>crops,</b> irrigated <b>crops,</b> and orchards {{require a lot}} of energy to maintain, while row <b>crops</b> and field <b>crops</b> do not need as much maintenance.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the benefits of maize, pinto bean and naked pumpkin triple <b>cropping,</b> an experiment was carried out as a randomized complete block design with three replications at Faculty of Agricultural Science, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran in 2012. The treatments consisted of maize, pinto bean and naked pumpkin sole <b>cropping</b> (100, 75 and 50 % of conventional densities), maize – pinto bean and maize – pumpkin double <b>cropping</b> (100 - 100 %, 75 - 75 % and 50 - 50 %), and maize-pinto bean-pumpkin triple <b>cropping</b> (100 - 100 - 100 %, 75 - 75 - 75 % and 50 - 50 - 50 %). The highest and lowest forage fresh weights were obtained in triple <b>cropping</b> system with high density and sole <b>cropping</b> systems with low density, respectively. In double <b>cropping</b> systems, the maize-pumpkin out-yielded the maize-pinto bean in terms of fresh weight. The relative crowding coefficient, competitive ratio and aggressivity of maize in double <b>cropping</b> of maize-pinto bean and naked pumpkin in double <b>cropping</b> of maize-naked pumpkin were dominant. In triple <b>cropping</b> systems, while maize and naked pumpkin were comparable, but both of the latter <b>crops</b> were dominant over pinto bean. Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) for double and triple <b>cropping</b> was greater than one, revealing the profitability of double and triple <b>cropping</b> systems on sole <b>cropping.</b> According to the LER, the <b>cropping</b> systems can be ranked as follows: triple <b>cropping</b> > double <b>cropping</b> maize/pinto bean > double <b>cropping</b> maize/pumpki...|$|R
5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which winnowing machinery identifies as belonging to the <b>crop.</b> Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and <b>crop</b> are not enemies.|$|E
5|$|A trap <b>crop</b> is a <b>crop</b> of a {{plant that}} attracts pests, {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap <b>crop</b> can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro <b>crop</b> devastated and more than 75% of the food <b>crop</b> was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut <b>crop</b> to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E
50|$|Farmers in the {{municipality}} practice two (2) <b>cropping</b> systems. These are the coconut-based and rice based <b>cropping</b> systems. The coconut-based <b>cropping</b> systems cover {{an area of}} 5,793.53 ha. These were 4,161.03 ha mono-cropped coconut, 259 ha of coconut-pasture/livestock multi-storey system, and 1,373.53 ha of multiple <b>cropping.</b> On the other hand, rice-based <b>cropping</b> systems followed an irrigated mono-cropping system and multiple <b>cropping</b> systems.|$|R
40|$|Biomass from {{dedicated}} <b>crops</b> {{is expected}} to significantly contribute to the replacement of fossil resources. However, {{the development of these}} <b>crops</b> must not occur to the expense of neither food production nor environment.

5|$|Adults are {{extremely}} mobile during the day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young leaves {{at night and}} early morning. They migrate from <b>crop</b> to <b>crop</b> following flower availability. Field density can vary. In France, numbers are around 20 adults/100 plants {{at the beginning of}} the colonization and 150 adults/100 plants at population peak when pressure is high.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{damage was}} widespread. Across the country 40% of the {{sugarcane}} <b>crop,</b> 80–100% of the banana <b>crop,</b> 75% {{of the coffee}} trees under three years old, and 20% of {{the top layer of}} the cocoa <b>crop</b> were lost to the storm.

40|$|The {{importance}} of traditional intercropping {{in the tropics}} is analyzed, mentioning statistics that emphasize the worldwide {{importance of}} this <b>cropping</b> system. Terms that describe multiple <b>cropping</b> systems are defined: sequential <b>cropping</b> (double, triple, and quadruple <b>cropping,</b> and ratooning), associated <b>cropping</b> (mixed, intercropping, strip, and relay <b>cropping),</b> sole <b>cropping</b> (monoculture), rotation, <b>cropping</b> pattern, and <b>cropping</b> system. Examples are given of associations with beans in Latin America and basic physiological, agronomic, genetic, pathological, entomological, economic, nutritive, and cultural factors are briefly analyzed.

5|$|<b>Crop</b> {{diversity}} loss threatens global food security, as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of <b>crop</b> species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or {{as in the case}} of the 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety. With the help of seed banks, international organizations are working to preserve <b>crop</b> diversity.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{losses to}} {{agriculture}} also took place, with major <b>crop</b> losses reported and 900cattle killed. According to government officials, the entire banana, rice, and sugar cane <b>crop</b> was destroyed and harvests {{could not be}} made until the following spring. Offshore, nearly 500vessels sank or were destroyed by the storm and the 1,000ton Union Pacific ran aground.|$|E
5|$|From there, the pharynx passes {{food to the}} esophagus, {{which could}} be just a simple tube passing {{it on to the}} <b>crop</b> and proventriculus, and then onward to the midgut, as in most insects.

5000|$|The {{range of}} <b>crops</b> with non-food uses is broad, but {{includes}} traditional arable <b>crops</b> like wheat, {{as well as}} less conventional <b>crops</b> like hemp and Miscanthus. Products made from non-food <b>crops</b> can be categorised by function: ...|$|R
30|$|The {{overreliance}} of HR <b>cropping</b> {{systems on}} {{chemical weed control}} discourages the use and retention of existing alternative weed management skills. In addition, HR <b>cropping</b> systems are not compatible with mixed <b>cropping</b> systems [137]. Diversification practices, however, such as cover <b>crops,</b> mixed <b>cropping,</b> intercropping, and agroforestry, help retain soil and soil moisture better than intensive <b>cropping</b> and improve resiliency to climate disasters and thus support the structures of the agroecosystem which provide ecosystem services.|$|R
30|$|Environmental risks {{posed by}} GM <b>crops</b> include {{the effects of}} insecticidal Bt (a {{bacterial}} toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis engineered into <b>crops)</b> <b>crops</b> on non-target organisms {{and the effects of}} the herbicides used in tandem with herbicide-tolerant GM <b>crops.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} <b>crop</b> pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where <b>crop</b> diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire <b>crop,</b> as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured <b>crop</b> of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana <b>crop</b> was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, the {{combination}} of strong winds and rains left heavy <b>crop</b> damage, destroying 3million bushels of corn and another million bushels of soybeans; losses to the corn <b>crop</b> were mitigated due to {{about half of the}} <b>crop</b> having been harvested before the storm's arrival. Heavy damage was also reported to the peanut <b>crop</b> as well as to various fruits and vegetables. In some locations, up to 15% of the cotton <b>crop</b> was lost, particularly in the northeastern portion of the state. In 45 counties in the eastern portion of the state, farmers affected by the hurricane were eligible for loans from the Farmers Home Administration, following federal approval from United States President Richard Nixon. Governor Robert W. Scott requested federal disaster aid for 24counties, which was denied. Damage in North Carolina was estimated at $10million (1971USD, $ USD), of which about $1million (1971USD, $ USD) was from coastal flooding. One death occurred in Washington when a vehicle accident was possibly caused by a wind gust; however, it was not conclusively linked to Ginger.|$|E

There, the banana <b>crop</b> was completely destroyed, and {{combined with other}} losses, <b>crop</b> damage amounted to $100 million ($280 million in 2005 USD). David caused no deaths, a few injuries, and left several hundred homeless. Nearby, Marie-Galante and Les Saintes reported some extreme damage while Grande-Terre had some moderate damages.|$|E
40|$|Herbaceous {{lignocellulose}} <b>crops</b> are {{a potential}} renewable feedstock for biochemical conversion systems second {{in size to}} wood products. Several herbaceous <b>crops</b> are utilized as forage <b>crops</b> in the northern Great Plains, but forage quality considerations usually dictates a early harvest. Biomass <b>cropping</b> does not have this constraint; therefore, little information was available on herbaceous <b>crops</b> utilized as energy <b>crops</b> prior to this project. Our primary objectives were to evaluate the biomass yield and select chemical components of several herbaceous <b>crops</b> for energy <b>crops</b> in the northern Great Plains, compare the economic feasibility of energy <b>crops</b> with common competing <b>crops,</b> and evaluate biomass <b>cropping</b> on summer fallow lands. Three good, two marginal, and one irrigated sites were used during 1988 to 1992 for the first component. At least six perennial and four annual biomass species were included at all sites. Three to four nitrogen (N) levels and a crop-recrop comparison (annuals only) were management intensities included.
