5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit of trained leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{contemplated}} {{standing for}} Parliament. In 1916 the Conservative Party chairman Arthur Steel-Maitland {{had offered to}} get him a seat. Esher and Duncannon proposed forming a new “National” party of 20–30 MPs, which would include David Davies {{who had been on}} the mission to Russia. The new party’s policies would include more vigorous prosecution of the war – Wilson urged Irish conscription – and the detachment of Turkey and Bulgaria. Wilson was worried that it {{would be the end of}} his army career (he was also short of money – he had a private income of £300 a year, and half pay of £600 (£450 after tax) – but his house at Eaton Place was costing him £1,500 a year). His brother Jemmy proposed getting him an Ulster seat, and thought that the prospect of Wilson as an MP would annoy Robertson (who told Wilson that there was no army job for him in Britain), but the Irish Unionist leader Carson thought an English seat more sensible. Bonar Law was dismissive of Wilson’s hopes that, like J.C.Smuts, he might be invited to join the War Policy Committee, and also poured <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the idea of Wilson becoming an MP. Wilson did not agree with Milner’s suggestion that he succeed Sarrail as Commander-in-Chief at Salonika. Éamon de Valera of Sinn Féin had recently won the East Clare by-election (caused by the death of Willie Redmond) and on a visit to Currygrane (his first in eight years) everyone Wilson spoke to – judges, landowners, police officers, a Redmondite local politician and “some natives” agreed on the need for conscription. Brock Millman argued that the threat to stand for Parliament was blackmail to get a military job out of Lloyd George, but Keith Jeffery rejects this, arguing that Wilson would have been no threat as a new MP but as a military adviser was a useful rival to Robertson, whom by July 1917 French was telling Wilson Lloyd George wanted to remove.|$|E

He arrives in time to hold them up on their way back, but is captured by his weeping sister. He does not wish to leave his command, but his friend, fireman Jack Allen, finally induces him to go on the promise that he, Jack, will call later. Perhaps one reason Jack is so accommodating is because he likes [...] sister. Jack pays ardent court to her, and the flame of their affection resists all of young Willie's efforts to put it out.

500|$|Alexander Charles Wood (an {{undergraduate}} whose tutor was Peacock) wrote from Cambridge to {{his cousin}} FitzRoy to recommend Darwin. Around midday on Sunday 4 September Wood received FitzRoy's response, [...] "straightforward and gentlemanlike" [...] but strongly against Darwin joining the expedition; both Darwin and Henslow then [...] "gave up the scheme". Darwin went to London anyway, and next morning met FitzRoy who {{explained that he}} had promised the place to his friend Mr. Chester, (possibly the novelist Harry Chester) but Chester had turned it down in a letter received not five minutes before Darwin arrived. FitzRoy emphasised the difficulties including cramped conditions and plain food. Darwin {{would be on the}} Admiralty's books to get provisions (worth £40 a year) and, like the ship's officers and captain, would pay £30 a year towards the mess bill. Including outfitting, the cost to him was unlikely to reach £500. The ship would sail on 10 October, and would probably be away for three years. They talked and dined together, and soon found each other agreeable. The Tory FitzRoy had been cautious at the prospect of companionship with this unknown young gentleman of Whig background, and later admitted that his letter to Wood was [...] "to throw <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>on</b> the scheme" [...] in [...] "a sudden horror of the chances of having somebody he should not like on board". He half-seriously told Darwin later that, as [...] "an ardent disciple of Lavater", he had nearly rejected Darwin on the phrenological basis that the shape (or physiognomy) of Darwin's nose indicated a lack of determination.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1840s, {{there was}} a strong revival of {{interest}} in cold water cures, or hydropathy, following the promotion of Vincent Priessnitz's methods by Captain R. T. Claridge and others. Yet while acknowledging the contributions of Currie's predecessors, such as John Floyer, Claridge noted that [...] "After all, the merit of settling the use of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>on</b> just a principle, belongs incontestably to our own countryman, Currie, whose work, published in 1797, upon the efficacy of water, may be considered the scientific base of Hydropathy".|$|E

In the village of Stá7mes, a young man named Xwechtáal had recently become married and was enjoying the days after the big feast, when his father told him, [...] "You must go kill that serpent." [...] Xwechtáal protested that he had only recently been married, and wanted to enjoy his time with his new wife, start a family, and live his life. He told his father he would not go. The next morning, his father came to his bed and threw glacier <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> <b>on</b> him, waking him up. He told his son again, [...] "You will go kill that two-headed serpent" [...] and this time, Xwechtáal agreed.
