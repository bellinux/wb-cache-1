40|$|For {{thin film}} silicon solar cells and modules {{incorporating}} amorphous (a-Si:H) or microcrystalline (pc-Si:H) silicon as absober materials, light trapping, i. e. increasing the path length of incoming light, plays a decisive role for device performance. This paper discusses ways to realize efficient light trapping schemes by using textured transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) as light scattering, highly conductive and transparent front contact in silicon p-i-n (superstrate) solar cells. Focus is {{on the concept of}} applying aluminum-doped zinc oxide (ZnO:Al) films, which are prepared by magnetron sputtering and subsequently textured by a wet-chemical etching step. The influence of electrical, optical and light scattering properties of the ZnO:Al front contact {{and the role of the}} back reflector are studied in experimentally prepared a-Si:H and pc-Si:H solar cells. Furthermore, a model is presented which allows to analyze optical losses in the individual layers of a solar cell structure. The model is applied to develop a roadmap for achieving a stable cell efficiency up to 15 % in an amorphous/microcrystalline tandem cell. To realize this, necessary prerequisites are the incorporation of an efficient intermediate reflector between a-Si:H top and muc-Si:H bottom cell, the use of a front TCO with very low absorbance and ideal light scattering properties and a low-loss highly reflective back contact. Finally, the mid-frequency reactive sputtering technique is presented as a promising and potentially cost-effective way to up-scale the ZnO front <b>contact</b> <b>preparation</b> to industrial size substrate areas.

40|$|As {{the science}} and {{technology}} advance, {{people are looking for}} new discoveries to solve the existing problems and improve the quality of life. In this processes of development, nanoscience and nanotechnology have attracted technologists' attention and {{turned out to be one}} of the most promising technologies that could have a revolutionary impact. Znic Oxide (ZnO) nanostructures, in particular nanowires (NWs), have the potential to be one of such revolutionary material. ZnO is a piezoelectric, transparent and semiconducting material. With a direct band gap of 3. 37 eV and large excitation binding energy (60 meV), ZnO exhibits near-UV emission, and transparent conductivity. ZnO NWs, with all of the properties of bulk ZnO, have other properties that are distinct to nanoscale material. All of these make ZnO NWs a very unique material that has many potential applications in system miniaturization. System-on-package (SOP) technology is a new concept developed to solve the integration problem in microelectronic industry. SOP technology paradigm provides system-level miniaturization in a package size that makes today's hand-held devices into multi-functional systems, with applications ranging from computing, wireless communications, health care to personal security. The SOP is a system miniaturization technology that ultimately integrates nanoscale thin film components for batteries, thermal structures, active and passive components in low cost organic packaging substrates, leading to micro to nanoscale modules and systems. The goal of this research is to investigate and utilize the unique properties of ZnO NWs and apply them to the fabrication of devices that can be integrated with SOP platform. The issues include developing techniques to manipulate and align ZnO NWs; developing <b>contact</b> <b>preparation</b> method to improve the contact conductance for the fabrication of ZnO NW based devices. Also, the investigation of the oxygen diffusion coefficient in ZnO NWs is carried out, which serves as the basis of ZnO NWs for sensing applications. Two practical applications, which include fabricating and characterizing SOP compatible ZnO NW based bio-sensor and SOP compatible ZnO NW based nano-generator, are evaluated. Finally the remaining work beyond the scope of the thesis is outlined. Ph. D.

Their production does not require expensive semiconductor substrates and high temperature device processing, which allows reduced cost per unit area while maintaining reasonable efficiency. In this regard, superstrate CdTe/CdS solar cells are extensively investigated because of their suitable bandgap alignments, cost effective methods of production at large scales and stability against proton/electron irradiation. The conversion efficiencies in the range of 6 - 20 % are achieved by structuring the device by varying the absorber/window layer thickness, junction activation/annealing steps, with more suitable front/back <b>contacts,</b> <b>preparation</b> techniques, doping with foreign ions, etc. This review focuses on fundamental and critical aspects like: (a) choice of CdS window layer and CdTe absorber layer; (b) drawbacks associated with the device including environmental problems, optical absorption losses and back contact barriers; (c) structural dynamics at CdS-CdTe interface; (d) influence of junction activation process by CdCl 2 or HCF 2 Cl treatment; (e) interface and grain boundary passivation effects; (f) device degradation due to impurity diffusion and stress; (g) fabrication with suitable front and back contacts; (h) chemical processes occurring at various interfaces; (i) strategies and modifications developed to improve their efficiency.

We report two experiments in which participants reached, grasped and lifted objects of various size and mass, and their movement kinematics were recorded using a motion tracking system.

Both studies showed that the heavy compared to light objects caused increased peak grasp aperture, a final finger and thumb placement on the object that more closely passed through the object centre of mass, increased lift delay and reduced peak lift velocity.

40|$|A {{new type}} of bottom-emission {{electroluminescent}} device is described in which a metal oxide is used as the electron-injecting <b>contact.</b> The <b>preparation</b> of such a device is simple.

Electroluminescence with a high brightness reaching 5700 cd mâ 2 is observed at voltages as low as 8 V, demonstrating the potential of this new approach to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices. Unfortunately the device efficiency is rather low because of the high current density flowing through the device.

The protein architecture contains a dramatic â 80 Â° bend in the central helix, which focuses distortions at G 67 to promote ring formation from amino acids S 65, Y 66, and G 67.

One of the drawbacks of the use of liposomes is the fast elimination from the blood and capture of the liposomal preparations by the cells of the reticulo-endothelial system, primarily in the liver. A number of developments have aimed to reduce this problem, including coating the liposome surface with inert, biocompatible polymers, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), to slow down the clearance of liposomes [49]. Although PEG remains the gold standard for the steric protection of liposomes [50], it creates an impermeable layer over the liposome surface [51] which could decrease availability of blood asparagines to encapsulated ASNase II.

A lock-in process synchronized by the displacement of the continuous heat source along the crack is studied. The thermal signature of the crack is extracted via a space operator applied to the amplitude and the phase of surface temperature images for various speeds of the thermal source. With the technical solution presented in this article, the thermal signature images are analysed according to a length representative of the thermal diffusion length to give a local evaluation of the crack depth (around 3 [*]mm at the maximum) for crack lengths of about few centimetres long. The multi-speed lock-in thermography approach is initially studied with finite element method simulations. Experimental tests using an infra-red camera validate the method in a second part.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to map the {{literature}} on the adoption of children from public care, to identify the extent of research-based knowledge and to note gaps in the evidence. Adoption research has grown over the last 40 years but, as the methodological quality has increased, so has the complexity of the questions to be answered.

The article recommends that adoption research needs to be considered {{as an integral part of}} general research into placement choices for children. Looking to the future, the commissioning of large-scale studies is recommended to gain a life-long perspective on adoption, to identify predictors of outcome, the consequences of contact arrangements for all the parties, and the cost-effectiveness of different types of adoption support. Many smaller scale studies need to be commissioned to monitor the progress of the various policy initiatives and legislative changes designed to increase the use of adoption as a placement choice in the UK.
