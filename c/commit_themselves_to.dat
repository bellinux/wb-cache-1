5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where he tried to gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette College {{encompasses}} a lively Greek community. Though {{students are not}} eligible to join these organizations until sophomore year, approximately 40.20% of eligible students join the school's fraternities and sororities. All {{but two of the}} Greek organizations at Lafayette are located on campus, making it a viable living option. Additionally, members of each house <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> various philanthropic ventures throughout the academic year as these groups work together with the college, local, and national affiliates to help achieve the goals and ideals their organizations were founded upon.|$|E
25|$|Following the Lome Peace Agreement, the {{security}} situation in Sierra Leone was still unstable because many rebels refused to <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> the peace process. The DDR camps were an attempt to convince the rebel forces to literally exchange their weapons for food, clothing, and shelter. During a six-week quarantine period, former combatants were taught basic skills that could be put to use in a peaceful profession after they return to society. After 2001, DDR camps became increasingly effective and by 2002 they had collected over 45,000 weapons and hosted over 70,000 former combatants.|$|E

25|$|Columbia University in New York City, United States, {{was founded}} in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of King George II of England. It is the oldest {{institution}} of higher learning {{in the state of}} New York and the fifth oldest in the United States. The period leading up to the school's founding was marked in controversy, with various groups competing to determine its location and religious affiliation. Advocates of New York City met with success on the first point, while the Church of England prevailed on the latter. However, all constituencies agreed to <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> principles of religious liberty in establishing the policies of the College.|$|E
25|$|Some Hindus {{choose to}} live a monastic life (Sannyāsa) in pursuit of liberation (moksha) or another form of spiritual perfection. Monastics <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> a simple and celibate life, {{detached}} from material pursuits, of meditation and spiritual contemplation. A Hindu monk is called a Sanyāsī, Sādhu, or Swāmi. A female renunciate is called a Sanyāsini. Renunciates receive high respect in Hindu society because of their simple ahimsa-driven lifestyle and dedication to spiritual liberation (moksha) – {{believed to be the}} ultimate goal of life in Hinduism. Some monastics live in monasteries, while others wander from place to place, depending on donated food and charity for their needs.|$|E
25|$|The New Delhi Conference, held in February and March 1968, was a forum {{that allowed}} {{developing}} countries to reach agreement on basic principles of their development policies. The conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for schemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus in persuading the North to follow up UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing generalised preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was raised to 1% of the North's GNP, but the developed countries failed to <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> achieving the target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at UNCTAD conferences.|$|E

25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which {{can be summed up in}} a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. It is indeed not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E

They are the accepted guides of a Party which though a minority in this House, nevertheless embodies nearly half the nation.

25|$|Secular Franciscans {{are called}} {{to make their own}} contribution, {{inspired}} by the person and message of Francis, towards a civilization in which the dignity of the human person, shared responsibility, and love may be living realities. They should firmly <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> oppose every form of exploitation, discrimination, and exclusion and against every attitude of indifference in relation to others. They promote the building of fraternity among peoples: they should be committed to create worthy conditions of life for all and to work for the freedom of all people. Secular Franciscans attempt to be in the forefront in the field of public life. They should collaborate as much as possible for the passage of just laws and ordinances.|$|E

25|$|There {{is also a}} scientifique {{nomenclature}} {{offered to}} the spectator (the relativity of simultaneity), that artists themselves, art critics and art historians have not failed to notice. Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name Einstein was not yet a household word in 1912, {{there has been a}} rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, or, at the very least, they were unwilling to <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> a single coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|For Francis, {{work is a}} {{gift and}} to work is a grace. Daily work {{is not only the}} means of livelihood, but the {{opportunity}} to serve God and neighbor as well as a way to develop one's own personality. In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E
25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart will make up for the lack of intuition.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations' 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child, or CRC, is {{the first}} legally binding {{international}} instrument to incorporate {{the full range of}} human rights—civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights. Its implementation is monitored by the Committee on the Rights of the Child. National governments that ratify it <b>commit</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>to</b> protecting and ensuring children's rights, and agree to hold themselves accountable for this commitment before the international community. The CRC is the most widely ratified human rights treaty with 195 ratifications. South Sudan and the United States are the only two countries which have not ratified the CRC. The CRC is based on four core principles, namely the principle of non discrimination, {{the best interests of the}} child, the right to life, survival and development, and considering the views of the child in decisions which affect them (according to their age and maturity). The CRC, along with international criminal accountability mechanisms such as the International Criminal Court, the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, is said to have significantly increased the profile of children's rights worldwide.|$|E

The track [...] "Saturday Night Inside Out" [...] was originally from a mixtape in 2000 and was the first song Chater made after Since I Left You.

Until about 2014, Chater was using a Power Macintosh G3 beige with System 7 for Studio Vision, a sequencing program that ended support in 1997.

Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
