5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same contractors and suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E
25|$|The {{power density}} of boilers was {{increased}} by using forced combustion air and by using compressed air to feed pulverized coal. Also, <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> was mechanized and automated.|$|E
25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> facilities, coal washeries, and coal waste tips can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage.|$|E

25|$|Volumes of coal mined {{and carried}} on the line {{continued}} to increase, and a peak was reached in 1911 when 87,111 tons were mined {{and all of that}} output was {{carried on the}} Fordell Railway. The First World War reduced the volume of trade enormously, and after the cessation of hostilities, the trade at St David's never recovered, as shippers preferred to use nearby harbours which were better suited to handling larger vessels. That process accelerated to 1945, when the now-obsolete <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> equipment at St David's was an insuperable limitation. During World War II the Admiralty was the only customer, it was agreed that the coal output would all be taken north to the Alice Pit (a little to the east of the George Pit, and adjacent to the former ED line) and taken away by main line railway.|$|E
500|$|The {{stations}} burned {{a mix of}} bituminous and anthracite coal. They consumed [...] of coal {{per week}} and had a peak consumption of [...] per week during the winter. They were well positioned to use coal from the Northumberland and County Durham coal fields. All of the coal used in the stations was brought to them via rail transport from UK coal stocks. Trains delivered coal to the station using the North Blyth Branch of the Blyth and Tyne Railway. The stations' <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> facility was fitted with a Merry go Round (MGR) coal delivery system in 1981, after high capacity rapid discharge waggons became the British Rail standard. This system involved the trains slowly passing over a hopper and automatically discharging their cargo through doors underneath the train. Because of site space restrictions, a balloon loop track layout could not be constructed, so instead {{of being able to}} move continuously, trains arriving on site had to pull onto a reception track; the locomotive would then uncouple and recouple at the opposite end, before slowly moving over the unloading track hopper and discharging the coal and eventually leaving site. Towards the end of the station's operation, coal was more frequently brought in by road. All coal was delivered to and stored in a large open area {{to the north of the}} power stations. This had a tarmac barrier underneath it to prevent downward contamination. The coal was brought from the storage area to the station using a system of conveyor belts, which travelled over the Bedlington-Cambois Road separating the two sites, before being integrated to feed both stations as necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Mechanical stokers {{for feeding}} coal to {{locomotives}} were {{in use in}} the 1920s. [...] A completely mechanized and automated <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> and stoking system was first used to feed pulverized coal to an electric utility boiler in 1921.|$|E

2500|$|All {{refinery}}-based plants use refinery residues, {{rather than}} coal, as the feedstock. This eliminates <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> and coal preparation equipment and its problems. [...] Also, {{there is a}} much lower level of ash produced in the gasifier, which reduces cleanup and downtime in its gas cooling and cleaning stages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{railroad}} rapidly {{expanded its}} rail and shipping operations and it needed {{all of the}} shoreline for its new <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> and storage facility. By 1885 the Minnesota Iron Company convinced Thomas Sexton to sell his remaining four acres along Agate Bay. The railroad then simply evicted the tenants and moved any of the salvageable buildings inland. There are several homes in [...] "east" [...] Two Harbors whose original structures were built on Whiskey Row.|$|E
2500|$|Chennai Port Trust {{has plans}} to build a marina along a [...] stretch in the west quay to berth a dozen yachts. The marina will provide lockers, {{separate}} berths and other facilities to these sailors, who come in small boats. The sailors can then proceed inland for sightseeing. However, the plan still remains on paper. Although the plan to build a large-scale marina is at the proposal stage, the port cannot have a marina till the coal yard is vacated. After <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> is moved out, the port will reclaim land by constructing groynes—rigid hydraulic structures built from an ocean shore that interrupt water flow and limit the movement of sediment.|$|E
50|$|In 1914, 22 {{buildings}} had tunnel connections for coal delivery, {{including the}} First National Bank of Chicago, several hotels, Marshall Field's, City Hall and the County Building. A total of 16,414 carloads or 57906 ST of <b>coal</b> were <b>handled</b> in 1913.|$|R

2500|$|The Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company {{intended}} {{to upgrade the}} system to take 300 or 400 ton boats, and to allow compartment boats to be used. Coal from the collieries on the canal would transferred from the compartment boats to larger vessels at a new <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> plant to be located at Keadby. However, the company failed to raise the finance to purchase the canals from the railway company outright, and so struggled to make significant improvements. The Dearne and Dove was the least profitable part of the system, with high maintenance costs {{as a result of}} subsidence from the coal mining. As early as 1884, a [...] stretch of the Worsbrough branch had collapsed due to subsidence, which had taken 6 months and cost £19,000 to repair.|$|E
2500|$|The port handles around 8 {{million tonnes}} of coal for clients {{such as the}} Andhra Pradesh State Electricity Board, Karnataka Power Corporation, cement plants of Tamil Nadu and {{independent}} power producers in northern Tamil Nadu and southern Andhra Pradesh. The <b>coal</b> <b>handling</b> for the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board {{was transferred to the}} Ennore Port. In 2005, as part of pollution-control measure, the port has installed wind curtains made of ultraviolet resistant fabric along the harbour's beachfront for over 1.5km to the east of the coal terminal to prevent wind carrying coal dust into the city at a cost of [...] 3.7 million. In 2008, the port has also installed a semi-mechanised closed coal conveyor system comprising two streams with a capacity of 15 million metric tons/annum and a handling rated capacity of 1,500 metric tons/hour/stream and running for a length of 5km at two berths, namely, Jawahar Dock IV and VI, at a cost of [...] 430 million to transfer the coal to the individual coal plots {{at the southern end of}} the port, from where the cargo will be transported by rail to respective destinations, thus preventing pollution from coal dust and eliminating movement of coal-carrying trucks within the port. The conveyor runs at an elevation of 10–13m and has provision for longitudinal movement along the road to the plots and transverse movement for stacking coal at individual plots. Coal discharged into the hoppers located at the two docks is conveyed to coal plots through conveyors or tripper cars and is equipped with belt weigher. The conveyor system is expected to remain functional for about 5 years, till Ennore Port is ready to handle coal for all the clients.|$|E
