Apart from being appointed non-executive director of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in November 1996, she was chosen as the chairwoman of the ICAC <b>Complaints</b> <b>Committee</b> in the transitional period between 1997 and 1998. In the 1997 New Year Honours, she caught up the last chance before the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong that she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire and therefore became a Dame. Wong was the second Hong Kong woman, after Baroness Dunn, to be made a substantive Dame in history, and was the last person to receive a damehood in the colonial Hong Kong. She received the damehood from Governor Chris Patten in the Government House on 19 April 1997. In the same year, Wong also received her doctorate of sociology from the University of California, Davis. She personally chose to call herself Dr Rosanna Wong rather than Dame Rosanna Wong after 1997 in public occasions.|$|E

40|$|Two {{thirds of}} the clients who had made a {{complaint}} against the hospital were dissatisfied with {{the way in which}} the complaint was dealt with. The complaints were handled by <b>complaint</b> <b>committees</b> with an independent chair and according to written regulations. All health care providers in the Netherlands are obliged to install such <b>complaint</b> <b>committees</b> since the Clients Rights of Complaint Act was issued in 1996. The committees are to judge the complaint as founded or unfounded. In this article we investigated the factors related to clients dissatisfaction with the complaint handling. The method is secondary analysis. The data consist of 110 questionnaires completed by clients in 1999 when the Complaint Act was evaluated. The results show that clients' dissatisfaction was related to the <b>complaint</b> <b>committee</b> as well as to the hospital. In the clients' view the committee had not tried for an acceptable solution for the problem, the committee was biased and the committee had judged the complaint as unfounded. Besides, the hospital had not responded with correcting or preventive measures, according to the clients. Relatively many clients whose complaints were judged as founded remained dissatisfied. The reasons are as yet unknown. New research has been started to investigate causes of clients' dissatisfaction...|$|R

40|$|Background: In 1996 the Client Rights of Complaint Act {{was issued}} in The Netherlands. Since then, {{patients}} complaints are being handled by independent <b>complaint</b> <b>committees</b> according to legal regulations. Despite this patient centred Act, many patients {{appeared to be}} dissatisfied with {{the way in which}} their complaints were dealt with, even when the complaint was judged as founded. We investigated why and found some answers. Methods: Patients who lodged a complaint against the hospital completed a questionnaire at the start {{and at the end of}} the complaint handling (six months later). Patients’ expectations and ambitions at the start were compared with their experiences at the end. In this pre post design, 424 279 patients, respectively, completed a postal questionnaire in 2003, as well as 76 <b>complaint</b> <b>committees.</b> Dependent variable is patient satisfaction; independent variables are characteristics of the complaint handling procedures. Results A total of 36 % of patients were dissatisfied with the way in which their complaint was judged by the committee. Many more patients (65 %) were dissatisfied with the (legally required) response of the hospital. According to patients, hospitals had often not responded at all or not responded with correcting or preventive measures. However, the main reason for the majority of patients (94 %) to lodge a complaint was the ambition to bring about a change in the hospital: ‘this should never happen again’. A minority of patients (7 %) wanted a financial compensation. Conclusions: Patients’ dissatisfaction concerned the hospital more than the <b>complaint</b> <b>committee.</b> Hospitals should inform patients about improvements made as a consequence of complaints.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A common {{finding in}} several studies is patients' dissatisfaction with {{complaint}} handling in health care. The reasons why {{are for the}} greater part unknown. The key to an answer {{may be found in}} a better understanding of patients' expectations. We investigated patients' expectations of complaint handling in hospitals. METHODS: Subjects were patients who had lodged a complaint at the <b>complaint</b> <b>committees</b> of 74 hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 424 patients (response 75 %) completed a written questionnaire {{at the start of the}} complaint procedures. Derived from justice theory, we asked what they expected from fair procedures, fair communication and fair outcome of complaint handling. RESULTS: The predominant reason for complainants to lodge a complaint was to prevent the incident from happening again. Complainants expected fair procedures from the <b>complaint</b> <b>committee,</b> in particular an impartial position. This was most important to 87 % of the complainants. They also expected to be treated respectfully. Furthermore, they expected the hospital and the professional involved to respond to their complaint. A change in hospital performances was the most wanted outcome of complaint handling, according to 79 % of the complainants. They also expected disclosure from the professionals. Professionals should admit a mistake when it had occurred. More complainants (65 %) considered it most important to get an explanation than an apology (41 %). Only 32 % of complainants expected the professional to make an effort to restore the doctor-patient relationship. A minority of complainants (7 %) wanted financial compensation. CONCLUSION: Nearly all complainants want to prevent the incident from happening again, not out of pure altruism, but in order to restore their sense of justice. We conclude that complaint handling that does not allow for change is unlikely to meet patients' expectations. Secondly, complaint handling should not be left exclusively to <b>complaint</b> <b>committees,</b> the responses of hospital and professionals are indispensable. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
