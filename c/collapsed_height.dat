The performances of these embankments are evaluated and compared with {{each other on the}} basis of field measurements and FEM analysis. The analyses of failure mechanisms and the investigations on the embankment stability using undrained conditions were also done to determine the critical embankment height and the corresponding geotextile strain. The high-strength geotextile can reduce the plastic deformation in the underlying foundation soil, increase the <b>collapse</b> <b>height</b> of the embankment on soft ground, and produce a two-step failure mechanism. In this case study, the critical strain in the geotextile corresponding to the primary failure of foundation soils may be taken as 2. 5 - 3 % irrespective of the geotextile reinforcement stiffness.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of column collapse and pyroclastic density current (PDC) scenarios at Vesuvius {{were carried out}} using a transient 3 D flow model based on multiphase transport laws. The model describes the complex dynamics of the collapse {{as well as the}} effects of the 3 D topography of the volcano on PDC propagation. Source conditions refer to a medium-scale sub-Plinian event and consider a pressure-balanced jet. Simulation results provide new insights into the complex dynamics of these phenomena. In particular: 1) column collapse can be characterized by different regimes, from incipient collapse to partial or nearly total collapse, thus confirming the possibility of a transitional field of behaviour of the column characterized by the contemporaneous and/or intermittent occurrence of ash fallout and PDCs; 2) the collapse regime can be characterized by its fraction of eruptive mass reaching the ground and generating PDCs; 3) within the range of the investigated source conditions, the propagation and hazard potential of PDCs appear to be directly correlated with the flow-rate of the mass collapsing to the ground, rather than to the <b>collapse</b> <b>height</b> of the column (this finding is in contrast with predictions based on the energy-line concept, which simply correlates the PDC runout and kinetic energy with the <b>collapse</b> <b>height</b> of the column); 4) first-order values of hazard variables associated with PDCs (i. e., dynamic pressure, temperature, airborne ash concentration) can be derived from simulation results, thereby providing initial estimates for the quantification of damage scenarios; 5) for scenarios assuming a location of the central vent coinciding with that of the present Gran Cono, Mount Somma significantly influences the propagation of PDCs, largely reducing their propagation in the northern sector, and diverting mass toward the west and southeast, accentuating runouts and hazard variables for these sectors; 6) the 2 D modelling approximation can force an artificial radial propagation of the PDCs since it ignores azimuthal flows produced by real topographies that therefore need to be simulated in fully 3 D conditions...|$|R

A simple validation experiment is reported to test the concept following which, a case study is presented that explores the extent to which matric suction and its impact on shear strength can explain the large safe vertical cut height that is often observed in cohesionless pozzolan deposits in the field. Lastly, the impact of rainfall events and subsequent ponded infiltration is investigated using a very simple analytical technique based on the classical Terzaghi consolidation solution.

40|$|The {{present study}} was -undertaken to {{investigate}} the mechanism of void migration and the collapse characteristics of old shallow surface (< 50 m), pillar and stall coal mine workings. Simple stereo-photographic techniques have been employed to record these structures where they occur in the high walls of NCB and private opencast coal sites. Several relationships have been identified from this data, and the investigation concludes that the crushing of coal pillars at depth is rare and that the principal mechanism of failure involves {{the collapse of the}} roof material into the working. A classification of failure mechanisms based on the frequency and spacing of horizontal and vertical discontinuities relative to the span of the working is proposed. Two distinct situations for analysis are recognised. The first involves the stability of the immediate roof, while the second is concerned with the stability of the 'arch' that develops when the immediate roof beam collapses. Continuous roof beams {{have been found to be}} rare in Coal Measures rocks and therefore simple beam analysis is considered to be of little use. Where discontinuities are present Voussoir beam analysis may be appropriate, and Voussoir beam theory has been corrected and extended to overcome some of the problems recognised with the technique. Bulking and arching have been recognised as the 'normal' limiting factors on the <b>height</b> of <b>collapse</b> and are considered as complimentary failure mechanisms. For a 'typical coal mine collapse' situation arching is shown to be the dominant control. However, a review of arching has shown that in general all the theories underestimate the <b>height</b> of <b>collapse.</b> Thus, a statistically derived relationship of (<b>collapse</b> <b>height</b> = 2. 68 X span of working) has been proposed as the limiting height for arching situations.

40|$|The areas {{exposed to}} {{pyroclastic}} flow invasion {{in case of}} explosive eruptions at Ischia island (Italy) have been evaluated, together with the related volcanic hazard and risk. Ischia island lacks a central vent so, {{for the evaluation of}} volcanic hazard, it is necessary to forecast where a future explosive event might occur. At this purpose, we have evaluated the Vent Opening Probability by taking into account all the relevant geological information and processing them through spatial analysis. The whole Ischia island has been subdivided into 358 cells, in which we take into account the contribution of volcanological, geophysical and geochemical data to define the probability of opening of the vents. As a result, the highest spatial probability is found on the eastern sector of the island. Two series of simulations, by using the "energy cone" model [Malin, M. C., Sheridan, M. F., 1982. Computer-assisted mapping of pyroclastic surges. Science 217, 637 - 640] and assuming column <b>collapse</b> <b>heights</b> of 100 m, for eruptions of Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) = 3, and of 300 in for eruptions of VEI= 4, with Heim coefficient equal to 0. 1, were performed. Through the overlay of the energy cone to the Digital Elevation Model of Ischia, it has been possible to automatically detect the invaded areas for each hypothesized vent. The intersection of this areas made it possible to define the different spatial probabilities of invasion by pyroclastic flow (PyF) for each point of the Ischia territory. Two different types of hazard maps have been derived: an equi-probability hazard map, sensitive to the distance from the vents and the presence of topographic obstacles, and a weighted hazard map, in which the probability of vent opening has also been taken into account. For both types of eruptions, the highest spatial probability of invasion are the so-called "graben of Ischia", and the coastal plain between Monte Vico and Ischia Porto. Finally, by intersecting the exposed value map with the weighted hazard maps, the classification of the Ischia territory into three risk classes has been performed. The villages located in the Ischia graben and in the northern sector of the island have resulted to be exposed to the highest risk...|$|R

The MDPR is measured directly from the weight loss and is calculated from individual pit counts on damaged surfaces.

These patients underwent 105 operations to treat 132 vertebral compres-sion fractures between T 8 and L 5. Sagittal alignment was analyzed from standing radiographs (pre-and post kyphoplasty).

40|$|The main {{concepts}} of the proposed probability-based assessment method called Probabilistic Incremental Wave Analysis (PIWA) are investigated in the companion paper by the authors. This probability-based approach {{can be used for}} assessment of jacket-type offshore platforms against extreme sea states. In this methodology, the performance objective can be stated in terms of the mean annual frequency (MAF) of exceeding a given level of structural Demand Parameter (DP) or a limit state, e. g., the collapse prevention (CP) limit state. The CWH-based approach is suggested as a wave height-based scheme in order to estimate the CP limit state frequency. However, there are some complexities in numerical calculations associated with the PIWA framework, which can affect the practical implications of this probabilistic approach. As a result, to simplify the PIWA procedure, approximate closed-form analytical expressions are suggested herein in order to estimate the MAF of exceeding the CP limit state. The two alternative solutions are comprised of the ultimate capacity-based approach, and the <b>Collapse</b> Wave <b>Height</b> (CWH) -based approach. Hence, the proposed approximate methodologies make the PIWA framework generally suitable for being used in practical assessment of jacket-type platforms, and being implemented in guidelines and codes. Furthermore, the closed-form analytical expression regarding the CWH-based criterion provides an alternative interpretation for the design or assessment against extreme waves. It provides a simple and consistent method for probabilistic evaluation of the jacket structures.

It is found that for TCF and TBL at different Reynolds numbers, the averaged flow patterns in the local strain-rate eigenframe appear the same consisting of a pair of co-rotating vortices embedded in a finite-size shear layer. It is found that the core of the shear layer associated with the intense vorticity region scales on the Kolmogorov length scale, while the overall height of the shear layer and the distance between the vortices scale well with the Taylor micro scale. Moreover, the Taylor micro scale <b>collapses</b> the <b>height</b> of the shear layer {{in the direction of the}} vorticity stretching.

In order to characterise this behaviour, this paper concerns the crashworthiness of helicopters on water for an impact speed of 8 m s− 1, for a simple box-beam construction that is common to metallic helicopters.

Slow-manifold analysis is introduced to exploit this timescale separation when boundary layer air columns experience only slow changes in their boundary conditions.

Slow-manifold analysis is shown to apply to mixed-layer model and large-eddy simulations of an idealized nocturnal stratocumulus- capped boundary layer; simulations with different initial inversion <b>heights</b> <b>collapse</b> onto single relationships of cloud properties with inversion height.

However, we notice also that the critical filling height is reduced as the grain size dincreases. The importance of grain size contribution {{is controlled by the}} ratio d/(R t) ^{ 1 / 2 }. We rationalize these antagonist effects with a novel fluid-structure theory both accounting for the actual status of granular friction at the wall and the inherent shell imperfections mediated by the grains. This theory yields new scaling predictions which are compared with the experimental results. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|However, it is {{well known}} that there are various atomic scale defects, large number of wrinkles, and {{especially}} artificial cracks and impurity residues on the copper foil-based SLG films [13 – 17]. Previous studies have already primarily yielded insight into reducing all above defects density in the preparation and transfer process. Joshua determined that Cu substrate crystallography affects graphene nucleation and growth more than facet roughness by growing graphene on polycrystalline Cu with different crystal direction, coming to the conclusion that Cu (111) surface promoted few defects SLG [18]. Avouris studied the structural morphology and electronic properties in CVD graphene wrinkles by quantum transport calculations and AFM images; the maximum <b>collapsed</b> wrinkle <b>height</b> can reach about 6  nm, and the local interlayer tunneling effect across the collapsed region contributed a significant resistance to the overall device [19]. Generally, by adjusting the parameters of CVD process [20], pretreatment of copper foil [21], and surface modification [22, 23], the density of defects can be reduced to a certain extent. However, compared with these defects in the preparation process and the wrinkles caused by the transfer process, little attention has been paid to the sharp wrinkles caused by graphene duplicating the grain boundary cracks of copper foil. These grain boundary cracks, produced in Cu foil pre-annealing treatment process, are the result of polycrystalline copper recrystallizing at high temperature to form larger-size single crystal domains. Since graphene is grown on the surface of Cu foil, its topography will completely replicate the surface structure of Cu foil, including the cracks. After transferring, the cracks of graphene on Cu foil will become the sharp wrinkles on the target substrate, so sharp wrinkles are ubiquitous and inevitable on graphene film, no matter what type of transfer process used, such as mediator-assisted transfer [24], direct dry and wet transfer [25], and mass production roll-to-roll transfer [26]; these sharp wrinkles undoubtedly cause large surface roughness of graphene films, resulting in a poor performance of organic devices, especially FOLED [27].|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{fountain}} collapse for small-scale (Soufrière-type) explosive eruptions that relates the asymmetry of a volcanic crater (e. g., the presence of crater notches) with the emplacement direction of pyroclastic flows. Analysis of two-dimensional simulations of compressible fluids emanating from asymmetric nozzles shows that under sonic to supersonic conditions, the streamline of a jet can become tilted. The inclination of the streamline increases with greater slant angle of the nozzle and with increasing exit pressure. Using the two-dimensional simulations as analogues to volcanic eruptions, we propose that pyroclastic ejecta within the inner core of an erupting jet column can become asymmetrically focused before <b>collapsing</b> at fountain <b>heights</b> {{of a few hundred}} meters above the crater exit. The ensuing pyroclastic flows associated with fountain collapse thus become directional in character with flow orientation controlled by crater geometry and eruption exit pressure. The model applies to volcanoes with vertical conduits and crater to vent geometries that act as effective sonic to supersonic jet nozzles. We propose that the 1984 eruption of Mayon volcano fits this model. In the second phase of this eruption a prominent crater notch imparted a southeastward tilt to the basal gas thrust region of the eruption column. In turn, this led to the discharge of pyroclastic flows onto the southeast flank of the volcano. Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive open lumbar discectomy is {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed surgical procedure for patients with persistent low back and leg pain. In this retrospective study,  1, 380 patients were evaluated for long-term results of aggressive discectomy for the single level lumbar disk herniation. Demographic data, surgical data, complications and reherniation rate were collected and clinical outcomes were assessed using visual analogue score (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI) and modified Mcnab criteria. The mean follow-up period was 28. 8 months. According to the modified Mcnab criteria, the long-term results were excellent in 640 cases, good in 445 cases, fair in 255 cases, and poor in 40 cases. The mean VAS scores for back and radicular pains and ODI {{at the end of}} 2 years were 1. 1 ± 1. 0, 1. 5 ± 0. 5 and 6. 6 ± 3. 1 % respectively. The complications were foot drop (n= 7), dural tear (n= 14), superficial wound infection (n= 17), discitis (n= 37) and reherniation (n= 64). The dural tear and superficial wound infections resolved after treatment but 28 discitis patients were treated by conservatively and the remaining 9 underwent surgery. Among reherniation patients, 58 underwent revision discectomy and 4 underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion and stabilization. Aggressive discectomy is an effective treatment of lumbar disk herniation and maintains a lower incidence of reherniation but leads to a <b>collapse</b> of disc <b>height</b> and in long run gives rise to intervertebral instability and accelerates spondylosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Large conductance, Ca 2 +-activated, and voltage-dependent K+ (BK) {{channels}} {{control a}} variety of physiological processes in nervous, muscular, and renal epithelial tissues. In bronchial airway epithelia, extracellular ATP-mediated, apical increases in intracellular Ca 2 + are important signals for ion movement through the apical membrane and regulation of water secretion. Although other, mainly basolaterally expressed K+ channels are recognized as modulators of ion transport in airway epithelial cells, the role of BK in this process, especially as a regulator of airway surface liquid volume, has not been examined. Using patch clamp and Ussing chamber approaches, this study reveals that BK channels are present and functional at the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. BK channels open in response to ATP stimulation at the apical membrane and allow K+ flux to the airway surface liquid, whereas no functional BK channels were found basolaterally. Ion transport modeling supports the notion that apically expressed BK channels {{are part of an}} apical loop current, favoring apical Cl− efflux. Importantly, apical BK channels were found to be critical for the maintenance of adequate airway surface liquid volume because continuous inhibition of BK channels or knockdown of KCNMA 1, the gene coding for the BK α subunit (KCNMA 1), lead to airway surface dehydration and thus periciliary fluid <b>height</b> <b>collapse</b> revealed by low ciliary beat frequency that could be fully rescued by addition of apical fluid. Thus, apical BK channels play an important, previously unrecognized role in maintaining adequate airway surface hydration...|$|R
