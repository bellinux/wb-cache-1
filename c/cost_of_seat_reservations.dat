50|$|The {{last three}} decades have seen two issues confronting the Muslim community, often {{referred}} to as Mandir and Mandal. Mandir refers to the building of a Hindu temple in the town of Ayodhya in eastern Uttar Pradesh, on the site of Babri Mosque. This cause has been championed by the Bharatiya Janata Party, and as a consequence, there has been an increase in communal violence. The other issue is commonly referred to as Mandal, a reference to the Mandal Commission, which was set up to consider the question <b>of</b> <b>seat</b> <b>reservations</b> and quotas for people to redress caste discrimination. Among the groups identified for reservation included a number of ajlaf communities. This has led to greater assertion of ajlaf political power, and a decline in the ashraf leadership. A major controversy is a demand for the Muslim community to receive reservation as a whole, which is being opposed by many Ajlaf communities. There are also demands to extend the scheduled caste status, which the Indian Constitution restricts to Hindu castes only, to Muslim Ajlaf groups like the Halalkhor and Lal Begi.|$|R

We {{assume that a}} train travels from a start station to an end station, stopping at k stations, including the first and last.

All algorithms under consideration must be "fair", i. e., {{they are not allowed}} to reject a request for a reservation which could be made at the time. The accommodating ratio compares the performance of an on-line algorithm to that of the optimal off-line algorithm, under the assumption that the only sequences of requests allowed are sequences for which the optimal off-line algorithm could accommodate all requests.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} a new variant <b>of</b> the <b>Seat</b> <b>Reservation</b> Problem [4]in which seat changes are allowed. We analyze the problem using the competitive ratio and the competitive ratio on accommodating sequences [4]. A very promising algorithm defined {{in this paper}} is Min-Change, which will ask passengers to change seat, only if they {{would otherwise have been}} rejected. Min-Change belongs to a large class of conservative algorithms, for which we prove very high performance guarantees. For instance when assuming that all of the passengers could have been seated by an optimal off-line algorithm, at least 				 					 2 						 3 						 				 of the passengers can be seated on-line with only one seat change and at least 				 					 3 						 4 						 				 will be seated if two seat changes are allowed. This should be compared to the performance guarantee of 				 					 1 						 2 						 				 for the best deterministic on-line algorithm when no seat changes are allowed [2]...|$|R
