50|$|The check symbol is {{computed}} by summing the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> values separately, modulo 6, and {{combining the}} final sums to find the symbol.In the example above, the top half values are 2,0,1,1,4,5,1,2. This sums to 16 = 6×2 + 4. Thus the check symbol has a top value of 4. The <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> values are 0,4,2,2,4,0,2,5, which sum to 19 = 6×3 + 1. The check symbol's <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> value is 1, so it corresponds to the letter I.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. The <b>bottom</b> eggshell <b>half</b> behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another <b>bottom</b> <b>half.</b> However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a <b>bottom</b> <b>half,</b> the two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending {{on the number of}} monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded. If a falling top half does not have any <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> was a {{conventional}} single axle small trailer made from fibreglass. For the exhibit, {{it was shown}} with one inflatable tent next to it and another tent packed inside. The {{top half of the}} trailer was a small boat mounted upside-down, with the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the trailer matching the boat shape along their joining edges. The boat used an outboard motor that could be disconnected and stowed in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> when the halves were reassembled for towing. The exterior was painted white with a black stripe and the interior was painted bright orange.|$|R

50|$|Every red box has {{the same}} structure: each input in the top half is {{compared}} to the corresponding input in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half,</b> with all arrows pointing down (dark red) or all up (light red). If the inputs happen to form a bitonic sequence, then the output will form two bitonic sequences. The {{top half of the}} output will be bitonic, and the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> will be bitonic, with every element of the top half {{less than or equal to}} every element of the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> (for dark red) or vice versa (for light red). This theorem is not obvious, but can be verified by carefully considering all the cases of how the various inputs might compare, using the zero-one principle.|$|R
