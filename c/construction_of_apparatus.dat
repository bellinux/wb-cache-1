40|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to reduce fluorescence backgrounds in Raman spectra. A critical appraisal of fluoresence rejection techniques reveals that while many techniques are available which improve the Raman/fluorescence ratio (R/F), very few actually increase the spectral signal/noise (R/N), which is the most important parameter. Temporal-resolution of Raman and fluorescence photons was investigated in this laboratory, using a picosecond-laser system and gated photon detection. Two detection methods were evaluated. The first, an intensified diode array detector (DAD), could be gated "on" for periods of ca. 5 ns, at rates of up to 5 kHz. This gave a 5 -fold increase in R/F, but a slight reduction in R/N, for a fluorescor with τ(_f) ̴̱ 1 O. 5 ns. The R/N degradation arose as a result of the low laser output intensity at kHz pulse rates, rather than inefficiency in fluorescence rejection. The second method used a continuously-operated photomultiplie tube (PMT), and time-correlated photon counting with ca. 1 ns timing-resolution. This yielded R/F and R/N improvements of ca. 15 and 3 respectively (τ(_f) ̴̱ 12 ns). Although efficient fluorescence rejection was obtained with each system, the corresponding R/N enhancements were not practically significant. However, the development of theoretical models describing the performance of each system has identified modifications which should give valuable improvements. These include the use of a laser with MW peak powers at kHz pulse rates (DAD system), and use of a microchannel-plate PMT with 50 ps timing resolution. When these (and other) modifications are made, significant R/N enhancements (ca. 7 and 13 (DAD and PMT systems respectively)) are expected, thus enabling the study of the majority of "real world" samples. In addition, the limiting theoretical and practical performance of time-resolved rejection is considered, and several hitherto unreported aspects of the behaviour of the laser and detection systems are discussed. Other techniques were also evaluated, in particular utilising the differing Raman and fluorescence response to variations in laser intensity. While the non-linear fluorescence responseto intensity variations of cw lasers has been previously exploited, simple calculations indicate that the use of high-powered pulsed sources could allow discrimination at ca. 100 - fold lower average powers. However, a satisfactory test of the calculations requires the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>apparatus</b> not presently available in this. laboratory...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the Transplanar wicking of water through multi-layer fabric assemblies, with particular reference to firefighters’ under garments. The literature survey {{is concerned with}} a review of research work carried out on thermophysiological comfort and the heat and moisture transmission in relation to clothing. This serves as an introduction to which the experimental work has been concerned with the design and <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>apparatus</b> for the measurement of horizontal transplanar wicking (i. e. from a lower fabric layer to the adjacent upper fabric layers, laid horizontally). This apparatus has been constructed to allow the measurement of horizontal transplanar wicking under static fabric conditions, and another novel design has been built for horizontal transplanar wicking measurements under dynamic conditions. In addition a novel design of apparatus for the measurement of vertical transplanar wicking under static conditions has been designed and constructed. A series of horizontal transplanar wicking tests have been carried out on a range of lxl rib polypropylene, Nomex, and Coolmax (polyester) knitted fabrics, and cotton and acrylic interlock knitted fabrics. The initial wicking of water into the fabric occurs in the fine inter-fibre capillaries within the yam structure and then transplanar wicking occurs through contiguous inter-fabric contact points. The nature and number of these inter-fabric contact points in any two or more fabric layers has been demonstrated to depend upon the relative orientation of the fabric construction and the applied pressure. For these reasons some variability in the initial wicking stages of weft knitted fabrics is to be expected, as every two fabric layers in contact will exhibit different inter-fabric contact points. A model of horizontal transplanar wicking has been proposed to explain the observed phenomena. The type of water used (distilled) has been studied in comparison with deaerated and carbonated water, and been shown to have only a very minor influence on the initial rate of wetting and wicking. An empirical hyperbolic equation has been proposed to explain the results of the horizontal transplanar wicking in a single fabric layer which relates the change in percentage fabric water content (...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} are {{described}} further {{developments in the}} design and <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>apparatus</b> for producing very low temperatures by the technique of adiabatic demagnetization of nuclear spin systems, a technique proposed independently in 1934 by Gorter and by Kurti and Simon. Improved methods of measuring nuclear susceptibilities have led to a more accurate estimate of the value of θ n, the nuclear interaction temperature, for copper nuclei in copper metal. It is shown that θ n is four times smaller than the value estimated by Spohr in his earlier experiments and is in fact close to the theoretical value for magnetic dipole interaction. The nuclear spin-conduction electron relaxation time has been measured at various temperatures and this is discussed in relation to nuclear spin relaxation theories. The cryostat designed for these experiments is described in some detail. A metal helium dewar of large capacity has been designed with close spaced walls in the tail to make best use of the small internal diameter of the high powered solenoid for producing the strong magnetic fields. The advantages of this particular vessel are explained. A closed circuit He 3 system is described which enables a thermal shield to be maintained at 0. 35 Â°K. This overcomes the disadvantages of the thermal shield cooled by a separate paramagnetic salt, as used by Spohr, allowing the temperature of the paramagnetic heat sink to be measured. This He 3 system was designed to work on the principle of initial condensation at 1 Â°K followed by pumping with a diffusion pump to 0. 35 Â°K, using 0. 2 cm 3 of liquid (150 cm 3 of gas at N. T. P.). Subsidiary experiments are described to test the performance of this system. An A. C. method of measuring the nuclear susceptibility has been developed to replace the previous ballistic system. This method employed a balanced A. C. bridge which was unbalanced by the nuclear susceptibility. It was so arranged that the proximity of large masses of metal did not affect the measurements. The improvement in technique has shown that the form of decay of the nuclear susceptibility is exponential and not linear as previously assumed allowing more accurate values of the nuclear spin temperature at the instant of demagnetization to be found. The lowest spin temperature achieved was 1. 3 × 10 - 6 Â°K. It is shown also that the conduction electrons do not become cooled to these temperatures as previously thought. Experiments on copper give a nuclear interaction temperature θ n = 1. 75 × 10 - 7 Â°K where θ n is defined in terms of the splitting of the nuclear energy levels due to the internal field. The value of θ n is calculated using the expression θ n = (μ n T f H i) ⁄ (k I T i) where T i and H i are the initial temperature and field before demagnetization, T f is the final spin temperature and μ n and I are the nuclear magnetic moment and spin. This value is equal, within the range of experimental and theoretical uncertainty, to that computed on the basis of magnetic dipole, indirect exchange, and pseudo-dipolar interactions. This would seem to Indicate that quadrupole splitting is not as important as previously assumed. The relationship of this θ n to the Curie temperatures of the theories of nuclear ferromagnetism is discussed. The nuclear spin relaxation time τ has been measured with conduction electron temperatures in the range. 012 Â°K to 0. 10 Â°K. Those experiments showed the inverse relation of τ and T e, the conduction electron temperature. Furthermore the values of τ T e (which in this case were measured in zero field) were found to be a factor 3. 5 times smaller than those found by Redfield in an extorted field, using nuclear resonance techniques, above 1 Â°K. Application of an external magnetic field caused the relaxation time to increase. These results are discussed with reference to the theories of nuclear relaxation in metals by Korringa and more recently by Redfield. </p...|$|E
