5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, <b>carbamazepine</b> and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, <b>carbamazepine,</b> and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release <b>carbamazepine</b> appears to work as well as immediate release <b>carbamazepine,</b> and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, <b>carbamazepine</b> or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{contraceptive}} pills have contradictory {{results from}} different studies regarding any effect of decreasing relapse rate {{in women with}} multiple sclerosis. Certain medications for MS symptoms, such as <b>carbamazepine</b> (used to treat spasms and pain) and modafinil (used to treat fatigue) can make oral contraceptive pills less effective.|$|E
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid {{increases the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including <b>carbamazepine,</b> phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Pain: {{acute pain}} is mainly due to optic {{neuritis}} (with corticosteroids {{being the best}} treatment available), as well as trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign, or dysesthesias. Subacute pain is usually secondary to the disease and can be a consequence of spending too long in the same position, urinary retention, and infected skin ulcers, amongst others. Treatment will depend on cause. Chronic pain is very common and harder to treat as its most common cause is dysesthesias. Acute pain due to trigeminal neuralgia is usually successfully treated with anticonvulsants such as <b>carbamazepine</b> or phenytoin. Both Lhermitte's sign and painful dysesthesias usually respond to treatment with <b>carbamazepine,</b> clonazepam, or amitriptyline. Sativex is approved for treatment of pain in MS in different countries, but due to its derivation from cannabis, it is currently not available in others, such as the USA. This medication is also being investigated {{for the management of}} other MS symptoms, such as spasticity, and has shown long-term safety and efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and <b>carbamazepine,</b> sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, sleepiness, or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, <b>carbamazepine,</b> phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and <b>carbamazepine</b> are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E
5|$|Many drugs, {{including}} oral contraceptives, some antibiotics, antidepressants, and antifungal agents, inhibit cytochrome enzymes in the liver. They {{reduce the}} rate of elimination of the benzodiazepines that are metabolized by CYP450, leading to possibly excessive drug accumulation and increased side-effects. In contrast, drugs that induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as St John's wort, the antibiotic rifampicin, and the anticonvulsants <b>carbamazepine</b> and phenytoin, accelerate elimination of many benzodiazepines and decrease their action. Taking benzodiazepines with alcohol, opioids and other central nervous system depressants potentiates their action. This often results in increased sedation, impaired motor coordination, suppressed breathing, and other adverse effects that have potential to be lethal. Antacids can slow down absorption of some benzodiazepines; however, this effect is marginal and inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as <b>carbamazepine,</b> clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
25|$|When <b>carbamazepine</b> is {{concurrently}} {{used with}} clozapine, {{it has been}} shown to decrease plasma levels of clozapine significantly thereby decreasing the beneficial effects of clozapine. Patients should be monitored for “decreased therapeutic effects of clozapine if carbamazepine” is started or increased. If <b>carbamazepine</b> is discontinued or the dose of <b>carbamazepine</b> is decreased, therapeutic effects of clozapine should be monitored. The study recommends <b>carbamazepine</b> to not be used concurrently with clozapine due to increased risk of agranulocytosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbamazepine</b> has a {{potential}} for drug interactions; caution {{should be used in}} combining other medicines with it, including other antiepileptics and mood stabilizers. Lower levels of <b>carbamazepine</b> are seen when administrated with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. <b>Carbamazepine,</b> as a CYP450 inducer, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with <b>carbamazepine</b> include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, and valproic acid. Drugs that decrease the metabolism of <b>carbamazepine</b> or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. <b>Carbamazepine</b> also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. As a drug that induces cytochrome P450 enzymes, it accelerates elimination of many benzodiazepines and decreases their action.|$|E
25|$|Grapefruit juice {{raises the}} {{bioavailability}} of <b>carbamazepine</b> by inhibiting CYP3A4 enzymes {{in the gut}} wall and in the liver. <b>Carbamazepine</b> increases the processing of methadone resulting in lower blood levels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbamazepine</b> {{and other}} enzyme {{inducers}} may reduce plasma levels of risperidone. If {{a person is}} taking both <b>carbamazepine</b> and risperidone, the dose of risperidone will likely need to be increased. The new dose should not be {{more than twice the}} patient's original dose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbamazepine</b> is {{available}} worldwide under many brand names.|$|E
25|$|Some {{anticonvulsants}} including: <b>carbamazepine,</b> ethosuximide, phenytoin, topiramate, valproate.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbamazepine</b> and {{phenytoin}} {{are reported}} to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam {{decreases}} {{the levels of}} <b>carbamazepine,</b> and, likewise, clonazepam's level is reduced by <b>carbamazepine.</b> Azole antifungals, such as ketoconazole, may inhibit the metabolism of clonazepam. Clonazepam may affect levels of phenytoin (diphenylhydantoin). In turn, Phenytoin may lower clonazepam plasma levels by increasing the speed of clonazepam clearance by approximately 50% and decreasing its half-life by 31%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbamazepine</b> (CBZ), {{sold under}} the tradename Tegretol among others, is a {{medication}} used {{primarily in the}} treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. It is used in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second line agent in bipolar disorder. <b>Carbamazepine</b> appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate.|$|E
25|$|In 1971, Drs. Takezaki and Hanaoka {{first used}} <b>carbamazepine</b> to control mania in {{patients}} refractory to antipsychotics (lithium {{was not available}} in Japan at that time). Dr. Okuma, working independently, {{did the same thing}} with success. As they were also epileptologists, they had some familiarity with the antiaggression effects of this drug. <b>Carbamazepine</b> was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in 2002 found that vigabatrin causes a statistically significant increase in plasma clearance of <b>carbamazepine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the {{metabolism}} of zonisamide is inhibited by ketoconazole, ciclosporin, miconazole, fluconazole and <b>carbamazepine</b> (in {{descending order}} of inhibition) {{due to their}} effects on the CYP3A4 enzyme.|$|E
25|$|Interactions of {{potential}} clinical importance with cimetidine include warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, <b>carbamazepine,</b> pethidine and other opioid analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, terfenadine, amiodarone, flecainide, quinidine, fluorouracil, and benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Rifampin, phenytoin, <b>carbamazepine,</b> and {{phenobarbital}} {{increase the}} metabolism of diazepam, thus decreasing drug levels and effects. Dexamethasone and St John's wort {{also increase the}} metabolism of diazepam.|$|E
25|$|Phenobarbital {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of all types of seizures except absence seizures. It is no less effective at seizure control than phenytoin, however phenobarbital is not as well tolerated. Phenobarbital may provide a clinical advantage over <b>carbamazepine</b> for treating partial onset seizures. <b>Carbamazepine</b> may provide a clinical advantage over phenobarbital for generalized onset tonic-clonic seizures. Its very long active half-life means for some people doses {{do not have to be}} taken every day, particularly once the dose has been stabilized over a period of several weeks or months, and seizures are effectively controlled.|$|E
25|$|Valproate is {{available}} to be given intravenously, and {{may be used for}} status epilepticus. <b>Carbamazepine</b> is not available in an intravenous formulation, and does not play a role in status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|Combined use of {{clonazepam}} {{with certain}} antidepressants, antiepileptics, such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and <b>carbamazepine,</b> sedative antihistamines, opiates, antipsychotics, nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics like zolpidem and alcohol {{may result in}} enhanced sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{is one of}} the {{anticonvulsants}} {{associated with}} anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, others being <b>carbamazepine,</b> phenytoin, and phenobarbital. This syndrome consists of fever, rash, peripheral leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and occasionally hepatic necrosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carbamazepine,</b> an anticonvulsant, {{appears to}} have some {{beneficial}} effects in the treatment and management of benzodiazepine withdrawal; however, research is limited and thus the ability of experts to make recommendations on its use for benzodiazepine withdrawal is not possible at present.|$|E
25|$|Dangerous and {{potentially}} fatal skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, caused by <b>carbamazepine</b> therapy are significantly {{more common in}} people with a particular human leukocyte antigen allele, HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios {{for the development of}} Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele {{has been shown to be}} a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions to <b>carbamazepine</b> among Japanese and Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine {{has fewer}} drug {{interactions}} than many anticonvulsant drugs, although pharmacokinetic interactions with <b>carbamazepine,</b> phenytoin and other hepatic enzyme inducing medications may shorten half-life. Dose adjustments {{should be made}} on clinical response, but monitoring may be of benefit in assessing compliance.|$|E
25|$|Valproic {{acid and}} {{valnoctamide}} both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (MEH), the enzyme {{responsible for the}} breakdown of carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting MEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of <b>carbamazepine</b> and delaying its excretion.|$|E
25|$|Very limited {{evidence}} indicates that topiramate or pregabalin {{may be useful in}} the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Limited evidence supports the use of gabapentin or <b>carbamazepine</b> for the treatment of mild or moderate alcohol withdrawal as the sole treatment or as combination therapy with other medications; however, gabapentin {{does not appear to be}} effective for treatment of severe alcohol withdrawal and is therefore not recommended for use in this setting. A 2010 Cochrane review similarly reported that the evidence to support the role of anticonvulsants over benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not supported. Paraldehyde combined with chloral hydrate showed superiority over chlordiazepoxide with regard to life-threatening side effects and <b>carbamazepine</b> may have advantages for certain symptoms.|$|E
25|$|TB {{treatment}} involves numerous {{drug interactions}} with anti-epileptic drugs and serum drug levels should be closely monitored. There are serious interactions between rifampicin and <b>carbamazepine,</b> rifampicin and phenytoin, and rifampicin and sodium valproate. The {{advice of a}} pharmacist should always be sought.|$|E
25|$|Less than 1% of {{primidone}} {{users will}} experience a rash. Compared to <b>carbamazepine,</b> lamotrigine, and phenytoin, {{this is very}} low. The rate is {{comparable to that of}} felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam {{increases}} the central depressive effects of alcohol, other hypnotics/sedatives (e.g., barbiturates), other muscle relaxants, certain antidepressants, sedative antihistamines, opioids, and antipsychotics, {{as well as}} anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and <b>carbamazepine.</b> The euphoriant effects of opioids may be increased, leading to increased risk of psychological dependence.|$|E
25|$|A {{classical}} example includes anti-epileptic drugs. Phenytoin, for example, induces CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Substrates for {{the latter}} may be drugs with critical dosage, like amiodarone or <b>carbamazepine,</b> whose blood plasma concentration may either increase because of enzyme inhibition in the former, or decrease because of enzyme induction in the latter.|$|E
