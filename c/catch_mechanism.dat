Since the Book of the Later Han states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.|$|E

In practical programming, this mechanism {{plays an important}} role when programmers handle exceptional situations. In this thesis we give typing systems which capture the mechanism in the proofs-asprograms notion. The typing systems can be regarded as a constructive logic with facilities for exception handling, which includes inference rules corresponding to the operations of catch and throw. We show that we can actually regard their proofs as programs which make use of the <b>catch</b> and throw <b>mechanism</b> by a natural interpretation. On one hand the <b>catch</b> and throw <b>mechanism</b> provides only a restricted access to the current continuation, on the other hand its logic is still constructive, in contrast to the works due to Griffin and Murthy on more powerful facilities such as call/cc (call-with-current-continuation) of Scheme.

50|$|Bullfrogs {{are able}} to jump {{distances}} 10 times their body length due {{to the ability of}} activating muscular contractile units prior to extension of the plantaris muscle. In this process, sarcomeric contraction generates strain in elastic structures such as tendons, which in turn “catch” the energy generated by the strain. Such is subsequently released as the plantaris actively stretched during jumping, adding to the energy generated by muscular action alone, thus generating supramaximal powers that allow the bullfrog to jump great distances. Thus, the <b>catch</b> <b>mechanism</b> relies on elastic structures acting as muscle power amplifiers and their ability to absorb elastic strain energy and retain it for later explosive release during jumping.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} the <b>catch</b> <b>mechanism</b> relies on elastic {{structures}} used as power amplifiers implies a series of conditions much convenient for the bullfrog. Sonomicrometry and electromyographic recordings of the plantaris muscle corroborate a relationship between presence of muscle-tendon units and decreasing, variable gearing. By supplying additional work output through the coupling of elastic strain energy, elastic structures relieve the musculature from the need of shortening at velocities that would otherwise hinder the amount of force generated, thus the magnitude of power output. This is also aided by a decreasing gearing, which {{makes it possible for}} the bullfrog to generate the desired velocity of movement by relieving the plantaris from strenuous shortening velocities, achieving the velocity desired by slower, forceful contractions. As in the case of its ballistic tongue projection, elastic structures in the plantaris muscle also confer it thermal independence. Jumping peak power output and mechanical efficiency of high-elevation frogs of the genera Hyla, Eleutherodactylus,Colostethus, and Atelopus, which achieve these at temperatures as low as 5°C, are not statistically different from those achieved by tropical Bufo frogs at 35°C.|$|E

40|$|Although soluble inhibitors are {{frequently}} used to block cell binding to the extracellular matrix (ECM), mechanical stretching of a protein fibre alone can physically destroy a cell-binding site. Here, we show using binding assays and steered molecular dynamics that mechanical tension along fibronectin (Fn) fibres causes a structural mismatch between Fn-binding proteins from Streptococcus dysgalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus. Both adhesins target a multimodular site on Fn that is switched to low affinity by stretching the intermodular distances on Fn. Heparin reduces binding {{but does not}} eliminate mechanosensitivity. These adhesins might thus preferentially bind to sites at which ECM fibres are cleaved, such as wounds or inflamed tissues.

40|$|Frogs' {{outstanding}} jumping ability {{has been}} associated with a high power output from the leg extensor muscles. Two main theories have emerged to explain the high power output of the frog leg extensor muscles, either (i) the contractile conditions of all leg extensor muscles are optimized in terms of muscle length and speed of shortening, or (ii) maximal power is achieved through a dynamic <b>catch</b> <b>mechanism</b> that uncouples fibre shortening from the corresponding muscle-tendon unit shortening. As in vivo instantaneous power generation in frog hind limb muscles during jumping has never been measured directly, it is hard to distinguish between the two theories. In this study, we determined the instantaneous variable power output of the plantaris longus (PL) of Lithobates pipiens (also known as Rana pipiens), by directly measuring the in vivo force, length change, and speed of muscle and fibre shortening in near maximal jumps. Fifteen near maximal jumps (> 50 cm in horizontal distance) were analyzed. High instantaneous peak power in PL (536 ± 47 W/kg) was achieved by optimizing the contractile conditions in terms of the force-length but not the force-velocity relationship, and by a dynamic <b>catch</b> <b>mechanism</b> that decouples fascicle shortening from muscle-tendon unit shortening. We also found that the extra-muscular free tendon likely amplifies the peak power output of the PL by modulating fascicle shortening length and shortening velocity for optimum power output, but not by releasing stored energy through recoiling as the tendon only started recoiling after peak PL power had been achieved...|$|E
40|$|Kinetochores are {{macromolecular}} {{machines that}} couple chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips during cell division, thereby generating force to segregate the chromosomes. Accurate segregation depends on selective stabilization of correct ‘bi-oriented’ kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which come under tension due to opposing forces exerted by microtubules. Tension {{is thought to}} stabilize these bi-oriented attachments indirectly, by suppressing the destabilizing activity of a kinase, Aurora B. However, a complete mechanistic {{understanding of the role}} of tension requires reconstitution of kinetochore-microtubule attachments for biochemical and biophysical analyses in vitro.

Individual kinetochore particles maintain load-bearing associations with assembling and disassembling ends of single microtubules for 3 ̆e 30 min, providing a close match to the persistent coupling seen in vivo between budding yeast kinetochores and single microtubules. Moreover, tension increases the lifetimes of the reconstituted attachments directly, via a <b>catch</b> bond-like <b>mechanism</b> that does not require Aurora B.

Here, by using the multi-protein tip complex of the mannose-binding type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, we show how the entire quaternary structure of the adhesive organella is adapted to facilitate binding under mechanically dynamic conditions induced by flow. The fimbrial tip mediates shear-dependent adhesion of bacteria to uroepithelial cells and demonstrates force-enhanced interaction with mannose in single molecule force spectroscopy experiments. The mannose-binding, lectin domain of the apex-positioned adhesive protein FimH is docked to the anchoring pilin domain in a distinct hooked manner. The hooked conformation is highly stable in molecular dynamics simulations under no force conditions but permits an easy separation of the domains upon application of an external tensile force, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low- to a high-affinity state. The conformation between the FimH pilin domain and the following FimG subunit of the tip is open and stable even when tensile force is applied, providing an extended lever arm for the hook unhinging under shear. Finally, the conformation between FimG and FimF subunits is highly flexible {{even in the absence}} of tensile force, conferring to the FimH adhesin an exploratory function and high binding rates.

40|$|FimH, the {{adhesive}} subunit of type 1 fimbriae {{expressed by}} many enterobacteria, mediates mannose-sensitive binding to target host cells. At the same time, fine receptor-structural specificities of FimH from different species can be substantially different, affecting bacterial tissue tropism and, as a result, {{the role of}} the particular fimbriae in pathogenesis. In this study, we compared functional properties of the FimH proteins from Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are both 279 amino acids in length but differ by some ∼ 15 % of residues. We show that K. pneumoniae FimH is unable to mediate adhesion in a monomannose-specific manner via terminally exposed Manα(1 - 2) residues in N-linked oligosaccharides, which are the structural basis of the tropism of E. coli FimH for uroepithelial cells. However, K. pneumoniae FimH can bind to the terminally exposed Manα(1 - 3) Manβ(1 - 4) GlcNAcβ 1 trisaccharide, though only in a shear-dependent manner, wherein the binding is marginal at low shear force but enhanced sevenfold under increased shear. A single mutation in the K. pneumoniae FimH, S 62 A, converts the mode of binding from shear dependent to shear independent. This mutation has occurred naturally in the course of endemic circulation of a nosocomial uropathogenic clone and is identical to a pathogenicity-adaptive mutation found in highly virulent uropathogenic strains of E. coli, in which it also eliminates the dependence of E. coli binding on shear. The shear-dependent binding properties of the K. pneumoniae and E. coli FimH proteins are mediated via an allosteric <b>catch</b> bond <b>mechanism.</b> Thus, despite differences in FimH structure and fine receptor specificity, the shear-dependent nature of FimH-mediated adhesion is highly conserved between bacterial species, supporting its remarkable physiological significance...|$|R
