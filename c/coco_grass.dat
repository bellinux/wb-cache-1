40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of {{residues}} of tuber extract blady grass and <b>coco</b> <b>grass</b> on soybean seed germination, plant height, dry weight of weeds, flowering period, the number of productive branches, number of seeds and seed weight of plants. The study was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Faculty of Agriculture Syiah Kuala University. This study uses a factorial completely randomized design with three replications. The first factor {{is the type of}} weed extracts with 2 levels ie <b>Coco</b> <b>Grass</b> Extract (ET) and Blady Grass extract (EA), to the second factor is the concentration (K) which consists of 5 levels, namely, (K 0 = 0 %), (K 1 = 1. 5 %), (K 2 = 3. 0 %), (K 3 = 4. 5 %), (K 4 = 6. 0 %). Parameters measured were seed germination, plant height, dry weight of weeds, flowering period, the number of productive branches, number of seeds and seed weight of plants. The results showed that the application of <b>coco</b> <b>grass</b> and blady grass at various concentrations inhibited germination percentage of soybean, but does not inhibit soybean flowering period, the number of productive branches, number of seeds and seed weight it stimulates the growth of soybean plants. While plant height and dry weight of weeds does not affect the application of tuber extract blady grass and <b>coco</b> <b>grass.</b> Use of extract <b>coco</b> <b>grass</b> and blady grass at a concentration 1. 5 % - 6. 0 % can increase the number of productive branches, whereas the concentration of 4. 5 % can increase the number of seeds and seed weight of plants can be increased at a concentration of 3. 0 % and 4. 5 %...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{was aimed}} to {{evaluate}} three treatments for forest restoration {{in an area}} with periodic elevation of the groundwater, in the Corredor de Biodiversidade Santa Maria, located between the cities of Santa Teresinha de Itaipu and São Miguel do Iguaçu, in Paraná state. The treatments were: control, green manure and soil solarization. It was performed a monthly monitoring of mortality and development of 12 tree native species {{of the region and}} the persistence of two invasive species present in the area, Megathyrsus maximus (coloniao grass) and Cyperus rotundus (<b>coco</b> <b>grass).</b> Furthermore, it was evaluated the changes introduced in the soil by three soil samples during the experiment. After over a year of assessment, the treatments showed no statistically significant differences on the evaluations. The mortality was more pronounced in January (12. 08 %), with a higher percentage for Cabralea canjerana (canjarana) and lower for Luehea divaricata (açoita-cavalo). About the seedlings development, growth was higher for: Sapium glandulatum (leiteiro-do-banhado), Croton urucurana (sangra-d’água) and Luehea divaricata, with monthly increases in diameter of 3. 66 mm to 4. 12 mm, and height of 12. 39 cm to 17. 02 cm. Regarding the dry mass of ‘colonião’ grass and <b>coco</b> <b>grass</b> (nutsedge) in all treatments, the highest values were found in January (94. 14 g m - 2) and February (132. 76 g m - 2), remaining low throughout the experiment. Through soil analyzes, it was observed that treatments showed no significant differences, however, the physical and chemical changes in the soil were sensitive to the invasive species management, which may lead to new modifications during the growth of seedlings...|$|E
