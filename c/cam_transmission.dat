5000|$|The Twin Cam {{initially}} {{was not used}} in the Softail model family before the year 2000. This {{was due to the}} chassis design and vibration transfer to the Softail frame {{as a result of the}} direct (hard) mounting of the engine. Dyna models are [...] "rubber mounted", damping the majority of vibration transfer to the frame and rider. Another reason was that the engine and transmission on a Twin Cam are directly bolted (but are still separate units) to each other, with the chassis seat post on a Softail getting in the way of a Twin <b>Cam</b> <b>transmission</b> case. As the company determined that a rubber-mounted Softail would affect the line's visual styling, Harley solved the issue by designing an engine variant known as Twin Cam 88B. It is basically the same engine as the original (now called [...] "Twin Cam 88A"), but with a modified engine block design that incorporates twin chain-driven balance shafts. The Twin Cam 96B engine was released at the same time as the Twin Cam 96A model, for the 2007 model year, and was equipped on all Softail models until it was replaced by the 103 ci version.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} performance for a <b>cam</b> <b>transmission</b> of an engine valve train operating with a mechanical spring and with a return spring device that uses a pneumatic spring. Dynamic analysis of the cam mechanism is performed in the frequency and time domains employing a combined lumped-distributed parameter model capable of predicting {{the effects of the}} higher harmonics of the cam lift profile on system performance, in particular of the return spring device. Dynamic stiffness of the transmission in the frequency domain and time history of the contact force between cam and follower are evaluated. The limits of the traditional mechanical spring-closing system at high-speed camshaft operations are investigated, highlighting that they are mainly imposed by the internal resonances of the spring. The pneumatic spring is an improved replacement of the steel spring, because of better dynamic behavior. Furthermore, the pneumatic return device allows preload tuning of the spring, which may increase transmission efficiency through proper control of the fluid pressure. Study of the pressure control circuit is also presente...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe IEEE 802. 11 p is the de-facto {{vehicular}} radio communication technology for road safety and efficiency applications. With the advancements in the autonomous vehicle technology, studies on {{applicability of the}} IEEE 802. 11 p and the related protocols for the autonomous driving applications are needed. In this paper, we study the impacts of vehicular communication on platooning control considering that the ETSI-standardised message set Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) and the IEEE 802. 11 p are used for both the platooning and cooperative awareness applications. We first develop a theoretical model for {{the probability of a}} successful <b>CAM</b> <b>transmission</b> over IEEE 802. 11 p between platoon members by taking account of the existence of non-platoon vehicles on the road. The model is verified by comparing against simulation results obtained from the NS 3 simulator. Finally, we investigate the impacts of the communication performance on the behaviour of platoons, specially the chain stability, when hundreds of vehicles share the wireless channel. The theoretical model reveals that thanks to the capture effect, communications between platoon members drastically outperform communications between arbitrary two vehicles on the road. The simulation results show that in contrast to an adaptive cruise control (ACC), which does not use vehicular communication, the IEEE 802. 11 p based vehicle to vehicle (V 2 V) communication aids for realizing stable platoons in highway scenarios...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{a method}} for the dynamic {{optimization}} of a mechanical manipulator is proposed. A mechanical manipulator is, in general, a device able to load, to unload or to move objects automatically and rapidly, acting by its own or as a module of more complex mechanisms (parallel manipulators, pallets chargers, dischargers, etc.). This kind of manipulator executes the desired movement by virtue of a conjugate <b>cams</b> <b>transmission,</b> which assures a pre-fixed trajectory during the whole position cycle of the end-effector. If the accuracy {{at the end of}} motion is always very high, backlash effects and elasticity in the kinematic chain can cause excessive vibration phenomena and, consequently, overstress effects, which can damage the cam and roller surfaces in brief time. This paper, after a framing of the problem, suggests a motion profile which appears particularly suitable to improve the dynamic behaviour caused by system compliances (mainly backlash) ...|$|R
40|$|Epicyclic {{mechanisms}} {{have found}} wide applications in industry, especially in automobiles and robotics. Low efficiency {{due to the}} high gearing power occurring in an epicyclic train is an important problem. This thesis develops a novel family of epicyclic <b>transmissions,</b> based on <b>cams</b> and rollers. This kind of cam-based mechanical transmissions, Speed-o-Cam (SoC), offers features such as high stiffness, low backlash, and high efficiency. We develop multi-lobbed cam profiles, the sun cam and the ring cam, which comprise an epicyclic cam train (ECT) with the roller follower. New design criteria are established: the generalized transmission index (GTI) and the contact ratio in <b>cam</b> <b>transmissions.</b> The GTI is an index that quantifies the force transmission quality in a mechanism, thereby generalizing the pressure angle, the transmission angle, and the transmission index (TI) proposed by Sutherland and Roth in 1973. The contact ratio is an index of the quantity of overlap occurring between two conjugate <b>cams</b> during <b>transmission.</b> A contact ratio greater than unity guarantees smooth motion during operation. In order to avoid "poor" transmission, we apply an undercutting technique on the cam profile to achieve a smooth motion. We introduce two new concepts, virtual power and virtual power ratio, and derive an original algorithm to compute the efficiency in an epicyclic train upon the assumption that power loss is due only to friction upon meshing. The results show that friction has a larger effect on the total efficiency of an epicyclic train than on a simple train. Examples are given to validate this algorithm, by comparison of our results with previous works. The dual-wheel transmission (DWT), proposed elsewhere using epicyclic gear trains (EGTs), is designed here with epicyclic trains of cams and rollers. We optimize the DWT to achieve a compact design and a high transmission performance. Furthermore, we define the total transmission index (TTI), which allow us to evaluate the final DWT design. Two virtual prototypes of the DWT, the central and the offset versions, are generated: the former is capable of quasi-omnidirectional mobility, the latter of full omnidirectional mobility. Finally, we include a general kinematic analysis of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs) with single-wheel drives and apply this method to WMRs with DWT units; then, we obtain symbolic solutions to the direct kinematics (DK) and inverse kinematics (IK) problems, for both central and offset types of units...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} a {{mechanical}} transmission {{taking into account the}} transmitted forces is reported in this paper. This transmission is based on Slide-o-Cam, a cam mechanism with multiple rollers mounted on a common translating follower. The design of Slide-o-Cam, a transmission intended to produce a sliding motion from a turning drive, or vice versa, was reported elsewhere. This transmission provides pure-rolling motion, thereby reducing the friction of rack-and-pinions and linear drives. The pressure angle is a relevant performance index for this transmission because it determines the amount of force transmitted to the load vs. that transmitted to the machine frame. To assess the transmission capability of the mechanism, the Hertz formula is introduced to calculate the stresses on the rollers and on the <b>cams.</b> The final <b>transmission</b> is intended to replace the current ball-screws in the Orthoglide, a three-DOF parallel robot for the production of translational motions, currently under development for machining applications at Ecole Centrale de Nantes...|$|R

40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen a growing trend towards {{lightweight}} and high performance mechanical systems. Meanwhile, the average time-to-market has been drastically reduced. These recent developments are driving the manufacturer's need to predict the dynamic machine behaviour more accurately and at an early design stage. Due to the advent of modern computational capabilities, numerical simulation tools {{can be used for}} this purpose. Rolling element bearings are among the most essential components in numerous machinery applications. If not modelled with the required level of detail, computer models are unable to attain the desired predictive power. In today's lightweight and fast-moving machines, this implies that the bearing has to be considered {{as an integral part of}} the machine's numerical model. As a matter of fact, the flexibility of both support and bearing rings [...] together with their mounting conditions [...] is often decisive for the bearing's behaviour and consequently for that of the entire mechanical system. Accurately capturing this flexibility is therefore indispensable to obtain a reliable prediction of the machine's performance, even when the internal bearing dynamics are not the main point of interest. Traditional finite element techniques offer an effective means to account for the flexibility of the rings and their [...] often complex [...] supporting structures in the modelling of bearing applications. Nevertheless, exceedingly refined meshes are typically required in the vicinity of the contact zones between the rolling elements and the rings in order to correctly represent the local nonlinear contact deformations, and to alleviate the known issues of non-smoothness. The finite element models generally end up with a computationally intractable number of degrees of freedom; together with the high cost of imposing the contact constraints, the applicability of these methods for industrial bearing applications is limited. This dissertation aims to alleviate the computational burden of system-level time simulations of flexible bearing applications, without losing the degree of accuracy required to properly capture the dynamic interactions between various components in the mechanical system. Methods are introduced that simultaneously tackle the problems related to first, the dimensionality of the finite element representation to model flexibility, and second, the large sliding or rolling contact interactions. The developed methods, once combined, serve as a complete bearing modelling strategy that offers computationally efficient models for system-level analysis. A first part of this dissertation focusses on model order reduction techniques capable of efficiently reducing the dimensionality of systems with time-varying load locations. A novel reduction method is presented and elaborated in order to deal with bearing contact simulations. The method uses a reduction space that continuously adapts during the simulation, depending on the contact locations of the rolling elements. Due to a one-to-one relation between these locations and the contact deformation patterns that constitute the reduction space, the number of degrees of freedom during simulation is kept to a minimum while retaining a desired level of accuracy compared to the corresponding full order model. Moreover, it is shown that the dimension of the reduced model is independent of this full order model. To eliminate the need for highly refined meshes at the contact zone, a semi-analytic modelling strategy is put forward in a second part of this dissertation. The strategy separates the global linear deformation [...] represented by the aforementioned reduced order models [...] from the nonlinear local deflections at the contact zone, which are described by analytic models of a nonlinear spring-damper type. To alleviate issues of non-smoothness, the bearing raceways are represented by B-spline surfaces. These parametric surfaces allow for highly efficient contact formulations that are independent of the mesh size. In applications where the internal bearing dynamics do not considerably influence the overall system behaviour, the spline surfaces are even further exploited by novel [...] bearing type specific [...] contact strategies, thereby further reducing the complexity of the models. Furthermore, a method is introduced that allows for an efficient redefinition of these deformed interacting surfaces, without necessitating back-projections to the nodal coordinates. Instead, the deformed smooth surface follows directly from the generalized coordinates of the reduced order model. The numerical results presented over the various chapters demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the new semi-analytic strategy to model flexibly supported rolling element bearings, and compare the proposed time-varying reduction scheme to traditional reduction techniques. The results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms the other techniques considered, either on accuracy or efficiency level. Although applied here to rolling element bearings, some of the developed concepts are readily applicable in other contact applications such as gears or <b>cam</b> followers in <b>transmissions.</b> nrpages: 252 status: publishe...|$|R
