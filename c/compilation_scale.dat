40|$|This {{short summary}} helps {{to grasp the}} motive behind the research, its {{objectives}} {{and to find out}} what is presented on the following pages of the report. It offers a condensed, one page recapitulation of its contents and intentions and suggests who might be interested to read it. CONTEXT Map generalisation is a tedious task, requiring skilled cartographers to work for long periods of time. Experience shows that compiling a map can take several months. It is the common wisdom that such labour?intensive tasks should be consigned to computers and thus be accomplished more uniformly, more precisely, more rapidly, and at much reduced cost (Buttenfield & McMaster, 1991). The benefits of automatic generalisation could aid hydrographic offices (HOs) in their ENC creation. OBJECTIVES The aim of the project is to create ‘hard knowledge’ specifications that could be subsequently used to create/use with tools for automatic generalisation of ENCs. The research compiles requirements of various HOs with the recommendations of S? 4 and knowledge in model and cartographic generalisation of topographic charts to create computer translatable rules that allow creating a smaller scale/usage ENCs from a higher scale/usage ENC / S? 57 data without or with minimum human interference. DELIVERABLES AND THEIR IMPACT The final report present a set of specifications, rules and tools that allow going from one <b>compilation</b> <b>scale</b> (Approach) to another (Coastal) without or with minimum human interference. It also discusses shortcomings and rate of success of such approach. The study mainly bases on the existing generalisation operators available in the literature, but where it is just? points out scarceness of the choice and proposes new solutions. As a result, an IHO standard could be created for the generalisation of charts (ENCs) and tools implemented in the software used for chart creation. WHO SHOULD READ THIS REPORT? This report might be found interesting by the GIS community, especially when interested in advancements in digital cartography and ENCs. The main recipients, however, are the hydrographic community, mainly Hydrographic Offices, and hydrographic software vendors. They may find ideas for potential implementations that could aid their business. The secondary recipients could be other parties linked to Electronic Navigational Charts, namely ECDIS producers and chart users. The author hopes that this research could also inspire other projects on automatic chart generalisation and complement projects on bathymetric generalisation.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} is the study the physics of the solar corona through {{the analysis of the}} EUV and UV data produced by two flights (12 May 1992 and 25 April 1994) of the Lockheed Solar Plasma Diagnostics Experiment (SPDE) sounding rocket payload, in combination with Yohkoh and groundbased data. These joint datasets are useful for understanding the physical state of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the corona {{at the time of the}} rocket flights. Each rocket flight produced both spectral and imaging data. Highlights of this initial year of the contract included <b>compilation,</b> <b>scaling</b> and co-alignment of image sets, substantial progress on the Bright Point study, initial work on the Active Region and Large Scale Structure studies, DRSC slit-aspect determination work and calibration activities. One paper was presented at the 1997 Annual Meeting of the AAS/SPD in Bozeman, Montana. An initial set of calibrated spectra were placed into the public domain via the World Wide Web. Three Quarterly Progress Reports have been submitted; progress for the fourth quarter of the contract is summarized in this Final Contract Report. The intent of the investigation is to compare the physics of small- and medium-scale structure with that of large-scale structures with weak fields. A study has been identified in each size domain. The calibration of the rocket data forms an important element of the work. Of equal importance is the slit-aspect solution, which determines the correspondence between locations along the spectrograph slit and points on the solar disk...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{new method}} to design Application-Specific Processors (ASP) for computation-intensive {{scientific}} and/or embedded applications is presented. Target application areas include scien­tific and engineering programs and mission-oriented signal-processing systems requiring very high numerical computation and memory bandwidths. The application code in conventional HLL such as FORTRAN or C is the input to the synthesis process. Latest powerful VLSI chips {{are used as}} the primitive building blocks for design implementation. The eventual performance of the application-specific processor in executing the application code is {{the primary goal of}} the synthesis task. Advanced code scheduling techniques that go beyond basic block bound­aries are employed to achieve high performance via exploitation of fine-grain parallelism. The Application-Specific Processor Design (ASPD) method divides the task of designing an special-purpose processor architecture into Specification Optimization (behavioral) and Implementation Optimization (structural) phases. An architectural template resembling a scalable Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processor and a suite of compilation tools are used to generate an optimized processor specification. The designer quickly explores vari­ous cost versus performance tradeoff points by performing repeated <b>compilation</b> for <b>scaled</b> architectures. The powerful microcode compilation techniques of Percolation Scheduling and Enhanced Pipeline Scheduling extract and enhance parallelism in. the application object code to generate highly parallelized code, which serves as the optimized specification for the architecture. Further performance/efficiency enhancement is obtained in Implementation Optimization by tailoring the implementation template to the execution requirements of the optimized processor specification. A scalable implementation template constrains the im­plementation style. Graph-coloring algorithms that exploit special graph characteristics are used to minimize the amount of hardware to support execution of the optimized application microcode without impairing code performance. Compilation techniques to allocate data over multiple memory banks are used to enhance concurrent access. The entire architecture synthesis procedure has been implemented and applied to numerous examples. Speedups in the range of 2. 6 to 7. 7 over contemporary RISC processors have been obtained. The computation times needed for the synthesis of these examples are on the order of a few seconds...|$|R

The pelagic succession of the Umbria-Marche Apennines (central Italy) includes a complete and continuous sequence of marly limestones and marls, with volcaniclastic layers that enable us to construct an integrated stratigraphic framework for this time period. We present here a synthesis of detailed biostratigraphic, magnetostratigraphic, and emostratigraphic studies, along with geochronologic results from several biotite-rich volcaniclastic layers, which provide the means for an accurate and precise radiometric calibration of the Oligocene time scale. From this study, the interpolated ages for the Rupelian/Chattian stage boundary, located in the upper half of Chron 10 n at meter level 188 in the Monte Cagnero section, and corresponding to the O 4 /O 5 planktonic foraminiferal zonal boundary, are 28. 36 Ma (paleomagnetic interpolation), 28. 27 ± 0. 1 Ma (direct radioisotopic dating), and 27. 99 Ma (astrochronological interpolation).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} the relations between stellar mass and optical circular velocity for early-type (ETG) and late-type (LTG) galaxies [...] - the Faber-Jackson (FJ) and Tully-Fisher (TF) relations. We combine measurements of dark halo masses (from satellite kinematics and weak lensing), and the distribution of baryons in galaxies (from a new <b>compilation</b> of galaxy <b>scaling</b> relations), with constraints on dark halo structure from cosmological simulations. The principle unknowns are the halo response to galaxy formation and the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The slopes of the TF and FJ relations are naturally reproduced {{for a wide range of}} halo response and IMFs. However, models with a universal IMF and universal halo response cannot simultaneously reproduce the zero points of both the TF and FJ relations. For a model with a universal Chabrier IMF, LTGs require halo expansion, while ETGs require halo contraction. A Salpeter IMF is permitted for high mass (sigma > 180 km/s) ETGs, but is inconsistent for intermediate masses, unless V_circ(R_e) /sigma_e > 1. 6. If the IMF is universal and close to Chabrier, we speculate that the presence of a major merger may be responsible for the contraction in ETGs while clumpy accreting streams and/or feedback leads to expansion in LTGs. Alternatively, a recently proposed variation in the IMF disfavors halo contraction in both types of galaxies. Finally we show that our models naturally reproduce flat and featureless circular velocity profiles within the optical regions of galaxies without fine-tuning.

The project methodology involved gathering expert judgments on the usability of the CEFR for test construction, identifying what might be missing from the CEFR, developing a frame for analysis of tests and specifications, and examining a range of existing test specifications and guidelines to item writers and sample test tasks for different languages at the 6 levels of the CEFR.

To better understand the properties of bedrock aquitards, we initiated a project that utilizes widely ranging methods to gain insights into the properties of the St Lawrence Formation and adjacent strata of the upper Tunnel City Group (Mazomanie and Lone Rock Formations) and lower Jordan Sandstone. The St Lawrence Formation has been traditionally regarded as an aquitard in the Paleozoic bedrock hydrogeologic system. Our investigation addresses hydraulic properties at site-specific as well as sub-regional (square miles) scales. Specific activities included drilling, testing and instrumentation of a borehole in the eastern Twin Cities Metro area (TCMA), the Afton multilevel system (MLS) hole, that has provided us with detailed multi-level measurements of hydraulic characteristics above, below and within the St. Lawrence Formation.

SLA flew {{as a part of the}} STS- 72 mission in January, 1996 observing the latitude band from +/- 28. 5 deg, and on STS- 85 in August, 1997 extending the observations to +/- 57 deg. Combining the SLA ranging data with shuttle position and pointing knowledge yields surface elevation data of very high vertical accuracy in an Earth-centered, absolute reference frame (2. 8 m rms difference for SLA- 01 with respect to ocean reference surface). Use of the well-determined mean sea surface reference for calibration allows propagation of high accuracy altimetry onto the continents. 436, 635 SLA- 01 land elevations were compared to the GTOPO 30 grid after conversion to a mean sea level vertical datum using the Earth Geoid Model 96, jointly developed by Goddard and NIMA.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{questions}} on various applications using soils and sediments {{as sources of}} information in archaeological research. Human environmental impact on soils and sediments, in terms of pollution, is a well known phenomenon as the industrialisation intensified during historical times and onwards and has left strong pollutive marks. However, humans have always accumulated or emitted matter and various compounds in connection to their habitats for subsistence, but these earlier traces are not always detectable, depending on soil and sediment state of preservation. Bioessential elements are intimately linked to humans and their dwellings and especially phosphate has been evident in this respect. It was established already in the 1930 s, that even Stone Age settlements could be located through elevated phosphate content in extensive soil phosphate mappings. This thesis is a compilation on results from several sites and excavations from the southern to the northern parts of Sweden. There is {{a wide variety of}} soil types and chronological setting in the material, from highly acid podzols to calcareous soils, and sediments dated to Younger Dryas to current top soils. Sites from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Early and Late Iron Age and Medieval are all represented. Methods that have been implemented are firstly various forms of analysis in regards to soil phosphate, magnetic susceptibility and organic matter. Furthermore, metal and non-metal elements have been considered, as well as lead isotopes. A multiproxy approach is applied in some examples where biological and chemical data is combined to interpret past events. In this thesis there are also five papers presented. The first paper deals with methodological issues concerning multi-element analyses of various soil samples (off-site to feature) from an archaeological excavation. The second paper is about the possibilities that may be used when analysing the soil organic phosphate in relation to prehistoric agriculture.

The inter-rater reliability and {{the construct validity of}} this scale were investigated. Six investigator teams were trained by means of a standard package of instruction material {{to such an extent that}} a single member of the team could represent the entire team. Thirty-one patients [20 male/ 11 female; 57 · 1 ± 6 · 5 yr (mean±S. D.) ] with a variety of movement disorders were recorded on videotape according to the SADIMoD Schedule. Single representatives of all six teams scored these video recordings. To this set the existing SADIMoD ratings of 82 patients were added to form the so-called ¿total data set¿. These patients were examined by 6 different researchers, who rated 4, 8, 10, 14, 18 and 28 patients, respectively, mostly in the context of a research protocol. A specific subset consisted of 12 patients that were examined three times with a two-weekly interval without any change of their medical condition or treatment. The 6 ratings of the 31 individual patients correlated to a highly significant degree, with Kendall's Coefficients of Concordance of 0 · 436 to 0 · 891 (median 0 · 717). The same was true for the 6 ratings of the 7 SADIMoD subscales (median 0 · 578, range 0 · 462 ¿ 0 · 715) Considering the total data set, the homogeneity of the various subscales was good (Cronbach's [alpha] = 0 · 81 ¿ 0 · 94, median: 0 · 87). The SADIMoD dyskinesia and dystonia subscales showed a highly significant mutual correlation. The Parkinsonism subscale correlated highly significantly with the rest and postural tremor subscales and to a lesser extent with the akathisia and ataxia subscales. An analysis of variance showed that the three ratings in the subset of 12 patients were not significantly different for any scale. Also Scheffé tests for homogenous subsets did not reveal any significant differences. When investigated under ¿real world¿ circumstances, the inter-rater reliability of the SADIMoD was found to be satisfying. The instruction material, that was developed and used in this study, fully comes up to the requirements. The construct validity of the SADIMoD is more than sufficient. ...|$|R
40|$|The here {{presented}} PhD project {{explores the}} phenomenon of cereal cultivation during the Iron Age (c. 500 BC – AD 1100) in southern Scandinavia. The {{main body of the}} thesis consists of four articles. These were written with the aim to identify chronological, geographical, theoretical and methodological gaps in current research, to develop, apply and evaluate approaches to how new knowledge on Iron Age cereal cultivation can be attained, and to assess the interaction between archaeobotany and other specialisms currently used in settlement archaeology. The introduction section of the thesis also contains a historical overview of archaeobotanical research on cereal cultivation in southern Scandinavia. The first article is a compilation and summary of all available previously performed  archaeobotanical investigations in southern Sweden. This data is compared and discussed in relation to similar publications in Denmark and smaller <b>scale</b> <b>compilations</b> previously published in Sweden. The main result of the study is an updated and enhanced understanding of the main developments in the investigation area and a deepened knowledge of local development chronologies and trajectories in different parts of southern Sweden. The second article is a methodological presentation of a multiproxy analysis combining plant macrofossil analysis, phosphate analysis, magnetic susceptibility analysis and measurement of soil organic matter by loss on ignition. The applicability of the method for identification and delineation of space functions on southern Scandinavian Iron Age sites is discussed and illustrated by two case studies from the Danish site of Gedved Vest. Particular focus is placed on exploration of the use of the functional analysis for assessment of taphonomic and operational contexts of carbonised plant macrofossil assemblages. The third article aims at presenting an Iron Age cereal cultivation history for east-central Jutland, an area identified {{at the outset of the}} project as under-represented in archaeobotanical studies. The article combines data from depth analyses of material from the sites of Gedved Vest and Kristinebjerg Øst (analysed with the methods and theory presented in the second article) with a compilation of previously performed archaeobotanical analyses from east-central Jutland. The main results of the study are that developments in the study area appear to follow a chronology similar to that previously observed on Funen rather than the rest of the peninsula. Rye cultivation is furthermore discussed as more dynamic and flexible than previously presented in Scandinavian archaeobotanical literature. The fourth and final article leaves archaeobotany as the main topic. It focuses instead on evaluating, theorising and expanding the multiproxy method presented in the second article by a thorough comparison of the botanical, geochemical and geophysical methods to other techniques of functional analysis currently used in archaeology. These techniques include studies of artefact distributions, assessments of spatial relations between settlement features, and studies of the structural details of dwellings and other constructions. The main result is that there is a correspondence between the functional indications provided by botanical, geochemical and geophysical methods and techniques used in mainstream archaeology. The comparison furthermore shows that a combination of the two data sets allows for more highly resolved functional interpretations than if they are used separately. The main conclusion of the PhD thesis, based on the discussions in all four articles, is that archaeobotanical questions commonly necessitate the assessment of non-botanical archaeological material. The comparison of archaeobotanical data to other segments of the archaeological record does, however, enable the use of the former as an archaeological resource for addressing non-botanical questions. The increased understanding of (mainly settlement) site dynamics resulting from this integration of methods allows archaeobotanists to address increasingly complex botanical questions. Increased and more structured integration between archaeobotany and other specialisms operating within the framework of settlement archaeology is therefore argued to be the preferred approach to performing both high quality archaeobotany and settlement archaeology...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHOResearch in {{connection}} with the female is nothing new in Physical Education. It is a generally accepted fact that the female need not play second fiddle to the male. Misconceptions with regard to the place of the female in society as well as her place in sport have long since disappeared. It is thus? logical that the education of the female in all its ramifications should enjoy the same degree of attention as that of the male. In older European countries and especially in the U. S. A. much research has been done {{in connection}} with the Physical Education of the female. In South Africa research in this connection has not lagged behind. Various problems have already been satisfactorily solved, some have had less satisfactory results while others have not been touched. The necessity for an investigation into the performance of white South Africans has partly been satisfied by the researches of Van der Merwe and Van Zyl (Chapter 3). Research projects in this field have already been done overseas. It is, however, known that the tests and their results based on a specific group of people are only applicable to that group, except if the opposite can be scientifically proved. Another important investigation into Physical Education of white South African girls has been done by De Jager. (Chapter 3). In this research work he studied the influence of chronological age upon the motor-performance of white school girls. This research must in the first instance be considered as supplementary to the researches of the aforementioned people. Seen in this light it is a modest attempt to {{contribute to the development of}} the Physical Education of white South African girls. In this investigation performance scales for white schoolgirls in the Transvaal were compiled in for activities. An attempt was also made to study the motor development of white schoolgirls in the four activities mentioned. The performance scales were compiled with the purpose of: 1. To provide a measure for determining the girls aptitude and progress; 2. To improve and supplement the methods of Physical Education; 3. To diagnose the physical capabilities and thus to show and eliminate possible short-comings; 4. To provide a stimulus for self-exercise; 5. To provide standards (norms) of performance that satisfy the requirements of the metric system; 6. To study the motor development of white South African girls as indicated by their performances; 7. To compare age grouping, as now applied to athletics and swimming for competitions purposes, with the performance curve derived from the data of the investigation. On the grounds of the literature as discussed in Chapter 3, it appears justified to confine it to the grouping of girls based on chronological age only. The scales are, consequently, simple to apply and can even be used by pupils themselves, The activities of this investigation had been chosen with an eye to fundamental components, namely speed, strength, stamina and co-ordination. The prevalence in the Republic of South Africa of the "fitness concept" and the activities of the Nation 2 l Fitness Scheme were additional considerations for the choice of exercises and their uses and values. For the <b>compilation</b> of performance <b>scales</b> from the results of this study use has been made of the Sigmascale method as well as the cumulative frequency method in swimming. In order to simplify the discussion of the findings and for the sake of clarity all processed data have been tabulated and graphically presented. For the purpose of this study 2 1 422 tests have been made. In addition the height of 718 persons and the bodyweight of 706 persons have been taken. The results of this study show that in the development in performance of girls of 11 to 16 years two peaks especially are reached - at 13 and at 14 years. In the 100 metre sprint performance reached its maximum at 13 years. In the 300 metre the peak was at 14 years. In the push-ups from a 12 inch high bench the peak was again at 13 years. In the 25 metre crawl the maximum was again at 14 years. It is thus clear that the findings of DcCloy (Chapter 2), namely that, in the case of American girls, age has an influence on performance only up to 13 t years, cannot as such be accepted in South Africa. De Jager carne to the same conclusion in his investigation. From the results it is evident that maximum performance is reached at 13 - or 14 years. This again corroborates the findings of Johnson and his colleagues. These researchers have found that maximum athletic performance occurs at 13 - or 14 years. (Chapter 7). The results have also indicated that the age of 12 is a "weak” period. The increase in performance is small between 11 and 12 in two out of every four cases, namely the 100 metres and the swirnrnin 3 event. In the push-ups the performance of twelve year olds is even weaker than that of eleven year olds. From the results of this study it appears that fifteen year olds give weaker performances than 13 -, 14 - and 16 year olds. In three of the four events, namely the 100 metres sprint; the 300 metres flatrace and the swimming event, fifteen year olds gave weaker performances than 13 -, 14 - and 16 year olds. In the push-ups even eleven- and twelve year olds fared better than the fifteen year olds. For the pattern of development of the performance ability with the increase in age and for the question as to why certain age-groups do worse than others; no satisfactory explanation has yet been found. It is clear that there are factors which can possibly influence this development pattern and performance. On the strength of these findings it seems justified to consider the eleven- and twelve year olds as a homogene group for the purpose of classification. Furthermore thirteen-, fourteen-, fifteen- and sixteen year olds can be taken as a homogene group. In the push-ups, however, it is evident that the thirteen year olds should compete separately as is highly evident from the difference between thirteen und fourteen, between thirteen and fifteen and between thirteen and sixteen - in all cases to the advantage of the thirteen year olds. With regard to age-grouping of girls in athletics and swimming it is clear that many changes can be brought about. This study has been conducted with the purpose of contributing to the Physical Education of the female. In Physical Education, especially with regard to the female there is still a large field that has to be covered. The lack of female researchers naturally curbs the development of Physical Education in the case of the female. FURTHER STUDIES. Further scientific research {{in connection with}} the female sex is an absolute necessity. This study was confined to schoolgirls in the Transvaal. The results draws the attention to many problems which can only be solved by general and thorough investigation. From the foregoing it follows that: 1. The scales compiled in this study are only applicable to schoolgirls in the Transvaal. Before these scales can be accepted as national, their validity, trustworthiness and objectivity “’till first have to be proved for the other provinces. 2. The <b>compilation</b> of performance <b>scales</b> in activities of Physical Education for white girls under 11 years, is very necessary. 3. The question of the development of performance ability according to age increase up to university age has to be investigated. 4. Factors such as physiological, psychological and economic circumstances which can possibly influence performance of girls, should be studied. 5. The performance ability of non-white girls, especially Bantu, Coloured and Indian, needs research. It will give us the opportunity to compare the performance of white girls with that of other races. 6. Performance scales in activities of Physical Education, especially those that answer to the requirements of the metric system, should be amplified. Master...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU vir CHOIn Physical Education the feminial {{individual}} is {{looked upon as}} the weaker sex which has to be protected against an excess of physical activity and achievements. Investigation has proved that, although there are certain anatomic and physiological differences between the sexes these differences are not as radical as was formerly maintained. Furthermore {{it has been found}} that in the programmes for physical education for girls one can with safety concentrate {{on the development of the}} fundamental aspects, e. g. strength, dynamity, velocity, endurance and co-ordination, and thereby procure physical achievements of a high standard. An investigation in South Africa was found to be necessary to ascertain the possibilities of achievement of girls in a diversity of physical activities because differences in achievement vary from country to country. In this investigation scales of achievement in six activities for white girls have been compiled. As far as these girls are concerned numerous activities must still be tested. The chronological grouping of girls seems to be well grounded on the strength of the findings of Delaney, Adams, Cozens, Cubberley, Neilson, Mitchell and Espenschade. (Chapter 4) Hence the application of these scales is rather simplified. The scales of achievements are compiled with the view of 1) supplying a gauge according to which the capability and improvement of the girls can be ascertained objectively; 2) to assess the physical possibilities of girls and thereby to eliminate weaknesses and to provide a stimulus for the improvement thereof; 3) to obtain a picture of the physical efficiency and achievement possibilities of white school girls in Transvaal; 4) to contribute to a better method of teaching the subject of physical education. For the <b>compilation</b> of the <b>scale</b> of achievements 4, 645 tests by 797 school girls in the province of Transvaal were taken. The procedure followed in taking these tests was standardised beforehand, and most activities are in agreement with the procedure followed at athletic meetings. Implementing the scales is thus very simple and intelligible. In choosing the activities the fundamental aspects borne in mind are strength, dynamity, velocity, endurance and co-ordination. The tests are also chosen such that their penultimate aim is of a high practise value and usefulness as well as versatile development. B. Conclusions: a) The scales provide for objective and the reliable determining of the physical capabilities of 11 to 17 year old Transvaal school girls in the six activities, i. e. 100 yards sprint, standing broad jump, throwing the hockey ball, putting the shot, the side step test and the basket-ball go throw. The compiled results are obtained from a representative group of school-going girls in the Transvaal. The scales cannot thus be accepted as national standards unless the possibilities of the differences of achievements of corresponding groups in other provinces have been ascertained. b) The results of the investigation throw light on the achievement capabilities of the Transvaal school girl. (i) It would seem as if the Transvaal white school girl surpasses all other racial groups, i. e. Bantu, Chinese, Coloured and Indian girls between 11 and 17 years of age as far as speed is concerned. The white girl is capable of a much higher achievement capability which could be due to better teaching facilities and abilities for physical training. (ii) In the standing broad jump the South African girl beats the American girl in all age groups. (iii) A comparison between the South African boy and girl indicates that the boy in the age group from 12 - 17 years beats the opposite sex in all activities with the exception of the girl in the thirteen year old age group in which the girl is superior by 1. 1 seconds taken on an average basis. c. The differences of the average achievement capabilities of the different activities and the significance thereof justify the conclusion that girls from 11 to 13 years of age should not be grouped in the activities of this investigation with the exception of the side step-test for 11 and 12 year olds who should enjoy this activity together as a single group. Primarily it seems feasible to classify 15 to 17 year old girls as a homogeneous group, but when the significance of the differences is being assessed it becomes obvious that this grouping becomes unjustified (p 66 - 67) C. Further Investigations: This investigation is limited to the school-going girl of the Transvaal. The following are revealed: 1. Before these scales can be accepted as national standards their validity must be verified by means of a comparison with similar data obtained from the other provinces of our country. 2. The question of the achievement capabilities of girls of other races in South-Africa, especially the Bantu girl, should be investigated, 3. Achievement scales for white girls under 11 years of age and of those of women students would be a welcome appendix. 4. The scales in this investigations provide data for six Physical Training activities only. Hence it is essential to extend this test programme in order to supply objective standards to ascertain the value of other activities of Physical Education. 5. Factors such as social and economic conditions could influence the achievement capabilities of the individual. Such an investigation could reveal important facts. As far as scientific investigation in connection with the female {{individual is}} concerned, a wide field for investigation is still left open. Master...|$|R
