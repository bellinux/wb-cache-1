5000|$|The {{original}} Prestel system, {{designed for}} cost effectiveness and simplicity, employed a rudimentary graphic capability known as serial mosaics. Through juxtaposition {{of the special}} mosaic characters, crude but recognizable graphic representations could {{be made on the}} screen. This graphic scheme had its limitations. To change colors between two mosaic graphic characters or between any two characters in general, a color <b>change</b> <b>command</b> was required. This command signal, however, physically occupied a blank space on the screen.The French sought to overcome this limitation when they joined the videotex world in the mid-1970s. They called their system Antiope. While based on the same mosaic graphics that were employed by the British, Antiope added a new feature, parallel attributes, or the ability to change the color from one cell to another without the need for a blank space.At approximately the same time, the Canadians adapted standard computer graphic commands into a set of functions called alphageometrics. These alphageometric functions did away with the block mosaic graphics used by the British and French and replaced them with drawing instructions, such as: DRAW LINE, DRAW ARC, DRAW POLYGON, etc. Through use of these geometric commands much higher resolution could be achieved than with the mosaic commands. This alphageometric scheme was integrated into the Canadian videotex system which the Canadians referred to as [...] "Telidon".|$|E

A real UAV {{has been used as}} a model in this project. The flight behavior of the UAV has been modeled in terms of simple analytic relationships, which proved very helpful in representing UAV’s actual horizontal motion. A fuzzy controller for the autonomous navigation of UAVs on the horizontal plane, has been developed. The controller inputs are the heading error of the aircraft and its current roll angle, whereas the output is the <b>change</b> <b>command</b> of the roll angle. Despite its simple design, the controller achieved the desired performance as evidenced from various simulated test flights...|$|E

In VHDL and mixed models, you cannot force an input port that is mapped at a higher level or that has a conversion function on the input. You cannot force bits or slices of a register; you can force only the entire register. You cannot force VHDL or Verilog variables (reg, integer, time, real (or realtime)); these must be changed. See the <b>change</b> <b>command</b> (CR- 87). You cannot force a VHDL alias of a VHDL signal. You cannot force any items within SystemC modules...|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} the process of {{training}} nurses at ARO ward of Krajská nemonice Liberec a. s. (Regional Hospital Liberec). The theoretical part consists of two large chapters - Personnel Management (Personální řízení) and <b>Change</b> <b>Command</b> (Řízení změny). The field of health service is included in both of these chapters too. The empirical part concentrates on the diagnostic process of the present system of nurse training at this ward. In this field I used the three following methodological approaches - document analysis, questionnaires and semi-standardised interviews with the top management of ARO sick-bed ward and a nurse instructor. In the analytical part I present the results of individual methods and its next part contains the main and detailed findings of this process. The analytical part is concluded with assembling the team with which I organized facilitated meeting whose highlight was setting priorities for the change in the nurses training system at this ward...|$|E
40|$|As {{the motor}} consumes more than 50 % of total {{electrical}} energy {{produced in the}} world, the efficiency optimization of the motor is a burning issue in terms of saving energy and the environment. In modern days researchers display immense interest in the control of a high performing interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) drive for general industrial applications. The IPMSM is largely used in low and medium power applications such as adjustable speed drives, robotics, aerospace and electric vehicles due to its several advantageous features such as high power density, greater flux weakening capability, high output torque, high power factor, low noise, robustness and high efficiency {{as compared to the}} dc motors and induction motors (IM). Nevertheless, its high efficiency characteristics are influenced by applied control strategies. Most of the reported works developed control algorithms for IPMSM to achieve high performance. However, the efficiency optimization of IPMSM, {{which is one of the}} important aspects is often ignored. Therefore, in this thesis the efficiency optimization issues is also considered along with high performance control. This thesis presents a nonlinear loss model-based controller (LMC) for IPMSM drive to achieve both high efficiency and high performance of the drive. Among numerous loss minimization algorithms (LMA), a LMC approach offers a fast response without torque pulsations. However, it requires the accurate loss model and the knowledge of the motor parameters. Therefore, a difficulty in deriving the LMC lies in the complexity of the full loss model. Moreover, the conventional LMC does not pay attention to the performance of the drive at all. In an effort to overcome the drawbacks of conventional LMC, an adaptive backstepping based nonlinear control (ABNC) is designed to achieve high dynamic performance speed control for an IPMSM drive is developed in this thesis. The system parameter variations as well as field control are taken into account at the design stage of the controller. Thus, the proposed ABNC is capable of maintaining the system robustness and stability against mechanical parameter variation and external load torque disturbance. To ensure stability the controller is designed based on Lyapunov?s stability theory while the LMC ensures high efficiency of the drive. A neuro-fuzzy logic controller (NFC) including LMC is also developed in this work. The proposed NFC overcomes the unknown and nonlinear uncertainties of the drive, the membership function of the controller is tuned online. An important part of this work is directed to develop an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based NFC. In this work, an adaptive tuning algorithm is also developed to adjust the membership function and consequent parameters. The complete closed-loop system model is developed and then simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software. Performance of the various control algorithms based IPMSM drive is investigated extensively at different dynamic operating conditions such as sudden load <b>change,</b> <b>command</b> speed change, parameter variation, etc. The performance of the proposed loss minimization based ABNC and NFC are also compared with the conventional id= 0 control scheme. The complete IPMSM drive have been successfully implemented in real-time using digital signal processor (DSP) controller board DS 1104 for a laboratory 5 hp motor. The experimental results verify the simulation of NFC based loss minimization. It is found from the results that proposed drive algorithms can improve the efficiency by around 3 % as compared to without any LMA...|$|E
