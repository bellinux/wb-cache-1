However, bamboo scaffolds are generally erected by scaffolding practitioners based on their intuition and experiences without any structural design. In general, <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> {{is considered to be}} one of the critical modes of failure in bamboo scaffolds, often leading to their overall collapse. This paper presents a research and development project for structural bamboo where the <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> behaviour of two structural bamboo species, namely Bambusa pervariabilis (or Kao Jue) and Phyllostachys pubescens (or Mao Jue) were investigated. A total of 72 <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> tests with bamboo culms of typical dimensions and properties were executed to study the <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> behaviour of structural bamboo. Furthermore, a limit state design method against <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> of structural bamboo based on modified slenderness was established and carefully calibrated against test data. It is shown that for Kao Jue, the average model factors of the proposed design method are 1. 63 and 1. 86 for natural and wet conditions, respectively. Similarly, the average model factors of the proposed design method for Mao Jue are 1. 48 and 1. 67 for natural and wet conditions, respectively. Consequently, the proposed design method is shown to be adequate. With the availability of design data on the dimensions and the mechanical properties of structural bamboo together with the proposed <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> design rule, structural engineers are encouraged to take the advantage offered by bamboo to build light and strong bamboo structures to achieve enhanced economy and buildability.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{stainless}} steel tubular section beam-columns have revealed shortcomings in established codified design methods. These shortcomings stem principally from inaccurate {{predictions of the}} bending and <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> end points of the design interaction curves, where the bending moment end points {{are tied to the}} elastic or plastic moment capacities without considering strain hardening, while the <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> end points are often over-predicted. Inaccuracies also arise due to the adopted interaction factors, which do not fully capture the structural response of the stainless steel members under combined loading. These observations prompted the present research, which is aimed at developing more efficient design rules for stainless steel tubular section beam-columns. In the presented design proposals, the deformation-based continuous strength method (CSM), allowing for strain hardening, was used to determine the bending moment capacities (i. e. the bending end points), while the <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> strengths (i. e. the column end points) were calculated according to recently proposed buckling curves. Based on these more accurate end points, new interaction factors were derived following a comprehensive numerical simulation programme. The accuracy of the new proposals was assessed through comparisons against over 3000 experimental and numerical results. Compared to the current design standards, the new proposal yields a higher level of accuracy and consistency in the prediction of stainless steel square and rectangular hollow section (SHS and RHS) beam-column strengths. Use of the proposed interaction factors but with the Eurocode bending moment capacities and revised <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> strengths as the end points was also assessed and shown to result in more accurate and less scattered strength predictions than the current Eurocode provisions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the behaviour of restrained steel columns in fire. It follows {{the introduction of}} extra load into the column through the axial restraint of the surrounding cooler structure and the consequential buckling. Key to this understanding is the post-failure behaviour and re-stabilisation of the column, which is discussed with reference to a finite element model and an analytical model. Through bi-directional control of the temperature, the finite element model allows the snap-back behaviour to be modelled in detail {{and the effects of}} varying slenderness and load ratio are investigated. The analytical model employs structural mechanics to describe the behaviour of a heated strut, and is capable of explaining both elastic and fully plastic post-buckling behaviour. Through this detailed explanation of what happens when a heated <b>column</b> <b>buckles,</b> the consequences for steel-framed building design are discussed. In particular, the need to provide robustness is highlighted, {{in order to ensure that}} alternative load paths are available once a <b>column</b> has <b>buckled</b> and re-stabilised. Without this robustness, the dynamic shedding of load onto surrounding structures may well spread failure from a fire's origin and lead to progressive collapse. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Stability of load {{carrying}} elements in glass The increasing demand in modern architecture for more slender and lighter structures requires {{the use of}} new construction materials. Glass, a material that has been used {{for a long time in}} windows as a filling material, has much to offer in this regard due to its very high compressive strength and transparency. For this reason, there is a growing trend to extend the use of glass sheets to {{load carrying}} elements such as columns, beams and panels. Due to their high slenderness and high compressive strength, such elements tend to fail because of instability (i. e. <b>column</b> <b>buckling,</b> lateral torsional buckling or plate buckling). At the moment little knowledge exists about the load carrying behaviour of glass structural elements, and existing design methods for other materials (i. e. steel) have been found to be unsuitable for direct transfer to the design of glass panels. With this in mind, the main objectives of the current thesis are: The study of the load carrying behaviour of glass elements which may fail due to lack of stability by means of laboratory tests and analytical and numerical models, as well as the study of the main influencing parameters. Discussion of possible design methods for glass elements which may fail due to lack of stability for the three main stability problems (<b>column</b> <b>buckling,</b> lateral torsional buckling and plate buckling) and proposition of possible aids for design such as buckling curves. The main influencing parameters (dispersion of the glass thickness, initial deformation) on the load carrying behaviour of glass elements which may fail due to lack of stability have been measured and are evaluated herein using statistical methods. The breakage stress, the thermal prestress and the effective tensile strength are defined and explained. Existing models to determine the tensile strength of glass are discussed. The <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> behaviour of single layer and laminated safety glass is studied by means of <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> tests, which are compared to analytical and numerical models. The models are used to study the influence of the main parameters, particularly the shear connection due to the interlayer (PVB) in laminated safety glass, on the load carrying behaviour and buckling strength of glass elements. On the basis of this study different possible design methods for <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> of glass elements in compression are proposed and discussed. It is shown that a second order stress analysis is the most appropriate method for glass. As a further simplification, the cross section of a laminated safety glass structural element can be modelled as a monolithic cross section with an effective thickness. Analytical and numerical models for the lateral torsional buckling of glass beams are also verified by a comparison to test results. Along with a study of the main parameters, different methods to determine the lateral torsional buckling strength are discussed, and it is shown that buckling curves for lateral torsional buckling should be developed for glass beams using a slenderness ratio based on effective tensile strength. As a result of numerical simulations, recommendations for the future development of lateral torsional buckling curves of glass beams are given. The <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> behaviour of single layer and laminated safety glass is also studied by means of <b>column</b> <b>buckling</b> tests, analytical and numerical models. It is shown that glass panels have a large post critical load carrying capacity but the way the loads are introduced into the panels, as well as the buckling shape, have an important influence on the plate buckling capacity. A design method with buckling curves using a slenderness ratio based on effective tensile strength seems applicable for the design of glass panels. As a result of numerical simulations, recommendations for the future development of plate buckling curves for plate glass elements under compression are given...|$|E

In order to predict the inelastic buckling behavior of the member, the load-deformation relationship needs to be identified in the whole process.
