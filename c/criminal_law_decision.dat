50|$|The 1997 Reference caused {{numerous}} challenges {{regarding the}} creation of compensation committees. Some governments needed more time to establish and consult them. Moreover, by finding provincial courts were not independent because salary commissions were not used, the Reference seemed to imply <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>decisions</b> by provincial courts were invalid under section 11(d), since defendants were not tried before independent tribunals. Consequently, the governments of Alberta, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island turned to the Court again. In Re Remuneration of Judges (No. 2) (1998), Lamer for a unanimous court decided that necessity dictated that dependent provincial courts be deemed acceptable for the time being.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between European sources and national provisions {{have increased the}} level of uncertainty {{with regard to the}} nature of time limitation in <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> in the Italian system. With decision no. 24 / 2017 the Italian Constitutional Court showed the intent to start a dialogue with the European Court of Justice, after the well-known 2015 Taricco decision.

5000|$|The Supreme Court's {{opinion was}} written by Chief Justice Antonio Lamer, who had also {{authored}} the 1997 Reference. He declined to give a declaration that the <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>decisions</b> by Provincial Courts should be considered constitutional, since they would be constitutional anyway. According to the [...] "Doctrine of Necessity," [...] Lamer found, a non-impartial judge can hear a case {{when there is no}} impartial judge available as an alternative. As Lamer wrote, [...] "The law recognizes that in some situations a judge who is not impartial and independent is preferable to no judge at all." [...] Lamer then held this doctrine went back to 1430, when judges considered a challenge against themselves. This was allowed since there was no court besides their own that could hear the case. Lamer also concluded the doctrine was used, albeit not overtly, in Beauregard v. Canada (1986), since the Supreme Court had to consider its own independence, {{as well as that of}} other Canadian courts. [...] However, the Court in 1998 cited Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, a decision by the High Court of Australia, to say the doctrine was limited. It should not be used where it would lead to considerable injustice, and it should not be used more than necessity dictates. If these conditions are not followed, Lamer said, the doctrine would [...] "gravely undermine" [...] section 11(d). In all, Lamer acknowledged, this was a situation in which [...] "finality and continuity" [...] were needed over fairness, and section 11(d) does not provide total fairness.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the advent}} of the Human Genome Project in 1989, the ethical, legal, and social {{implications}} inherent in future genetic science and its applications have worried researchers and scholars in law and ethics. Concern that the results of genetic testing might be used to discriminate against particular individuals and groups of individuals has been paramount, prompting calls for specific legislation to protect against genetic discrimination. Against this backdrop we sought to investigate instances of genetic discrimination in Canadian legal decisions. We searched Canadian court and administrative tribunal decisions, using the key words “genetic predisposition” and its cognates, and found none that took up the issue of genetic discrimination. However, in 468 decisions, “genetic predisposition” was used by courts and tribunals when describing the causal origins of health related conditions. Genetic predisposition was cited with respect to numerous health conditions, and in various areas of <b>law,</b> in particular <b>criminal,</b> family, workers’ compensation, and tort. In several <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>decisions,</b> genetic predisposition served to explain the origin of a mental health condition in addressing the issue of criminal responsibility. The predominant use in family law was in describing a child’s health condition in crown wardship and youth protection proceedings. In workers’ compensation and tort, genetic predisposition was used to argue whether the claimant’s condition was inherited rather than related to the workplace or the negligence of the defendant. Genetic predisposition, when used to argue the issue of disease causation on a balance of probabilities, reflects “geneticization”: the tendency to describe the underlying basis of health and disease as genetic. Geneticization, like genetic discrimination, can be problematic. Specifically, both may exaggerate the extent to which genetic information is exceptional and determinative of health and disease outcomes. Also, geneticization, like genetic discrimination, may marginalize people on a perceived genetic basis...|$|R
