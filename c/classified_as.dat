5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> cities; those having {{less than five}} thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E

5|$|Carbon is ordinarily <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a nonmetal but {{has some}} {{metallic}} properties and is occasionally <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic carbon (graphite) {{is the most}} thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions. It has a lustrous appearance and is a fairly good electrical conductor. Graphite has a layered structure. Each layer comprises carbon atoms bonded to three other carbon atoms in a honeycomb lattice arrangement. The layers are stacked together and held loosely by van der Waals forces and delocalized valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Centaurs {{typically}} behave with {{characteristics of}} both asteroids and comets. Centaurs can be <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> comets such as 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, {{and so is}} <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> a comet despite its orbit, and 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active, and was then <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> both a comet and an asteroid (174P/Echeclus). One plan for Cassini involved sending it to a centaur, but NASA decided to destroy it instead.|$|E
5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> starburst galaxies, one quarter are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder are <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E
