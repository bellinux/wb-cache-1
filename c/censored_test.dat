40|$|Abstract: The {{instrument}} {{ball bearings}} often operate with high speed and light load. The com-mon failure mode is wear-out occurring under insufficient lubrication condition. As a result, the vibration/noise and frictional torque will be enlarged, and the bearings lose accuracy and pre-cision. In this article, the wear lifetime model of instrument ball bearings is established based on Archard’s theory. A new wear coefficient curve is {{developed from the}} relationship of Archard wear coefficients obtained by a ball-plate experiment, which is related to oil type and load, with a certain lubricant film parameter (). Then a computer program has been developed to calculate the location of pure rolling lines on the contact ellipse and obtain the contact stress and sliding speed on both inner and outer ball-raceway contact zones. Hence, the total wear time can {{be determined by the}} volume of wear with the allowable radial clearances. A 4000 -h <b>censored</b> <b>test</b> of eight group samples, with its subgroup size of two bearings, has been conducted in special high-speed test rigs.

It begins with a definition and purpose {{for the study of}} life testing and progresses to a discussion of failure rate, an important factor in the science of life testing. It is established that there are certain items that exhibit a constant failure rate, and hence obey the exponential life distribution. It is with these items that the majority of this paper is devoted. A <b>censored</b> <b>test</b> plan of an exponential life distribution is discussed in Chapter 2 and certain important aspects of this plan are demonstrated. This includes finding the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean life, its density function, and material concerning the failure out of n items on test. Chapter 3 describes a truncated test plan for an exponential life distribution, using both finite and infinite lot sizes. This is related to the various quality levels required of the product. Single-stage plans are contrasted with multi-stage plans in this section. Chapter 4 concludes this paper with a discussion of the exponential distribution as a boundary between the increasing failure rate and decreasing failure rate distributions. It includes a description of tolerance limits and confidence limits...|$|E
