Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as [...] "that woman", and the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as [...] "Cookie", because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook. Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards the Duchess were denied by her close friends; the Duke of Grafton wrote that she [...] "never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> she was dealing with." ...|$|E
500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire.

Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E

In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Keenan stated [...] "we didn't really have any <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret." [...] Keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool—went on to add that [...] "you just can't really describe it, you just have to see it, then it makes sense." [...] Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance.|$|E

500|$|According to John Brousseau, the bad {{publicity}} led to {{reforms of the}} Hole. Its inmates were allowed to sleep in proper beds in the [...] "Berthing" [...] quarters elsewhere in the compound. Brousseau describes their new seven-days-a-week routine starting when [...] "they got up, showered, {{then went to the}} dining hall at 9:30. They had 30 minutes for breakfast. Then they walked up to the Hole. They sat down at desks. I have no <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> work they did. They worked until 12:30 or 1 pm. Then they were marched back to the dining hall and had 30 minutes for lunch. Then they were marched back to the Hole and were there until 6 pm." [...] After a 30-minute dinner, they were taken to the study hall and stayed there [...] "for two and a half hours, until about 9:30. Then they went to the Hole again to wrap up their day. At 11 or midnight, they'd get marched back to Berthing." [...] Some of the restrictions on contacting people outside the Hole were also said to have been eased. However, other Church staff were still encouraged to avoid contact with the inmates: [...] "You didn't talk to them, you looked the other way, you'd leave the area if you saw them, it's like the black plague." [...] Brousseau commented: [...] "You stayed away from these people. They're considered the worst of the worst." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Preston North End {{asked for}} {{permission}} to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager. Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't surprise me. When you have got people in your own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place. At the end of the season, Westley criticised the club's [...] "mediocre" [...] mentality, stating the squad have [...] "not got a <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> it takes to get success".|$|E

500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Eyeshield 21 received positive and mixed responses. Bobby Cooper from DVD Talk praised how {{the rules of}} American football are [...] "explained to a foreign audience that has no <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> it's all about", adding that instructions at the commercial breaks [...] "were informative and similar to the Go lessons of Hikaru No Go." [...] He also said the explanations was [...] "hilarious", but that [...] "Eyeshield 21 is an excellent introduction to football". The on-field action was also praised, with he saying the sports action is [...] "where Eyeshield 21 truly shines", although he criticized the scenes away from the football field, [...] "the pacing slows to a crawl and the storyline gets a little boring". In her review, Erin Finnegan from Anime News Network stated, [...] "he pace of Eyeshield 21 is its saving grace. It's way less boring than all the time outs and commercial breaks in a regular NFL game. Football is hard to understand, but Eyeshield 21 explains the Byzantine rules...in an entertaining way. We're never left waiting for the ref's decision for long minutes like in real life. A lot of dramatic tension carries the action between plays." [...] Finnegan also criticized the artwork, saying, [...] "any episode [...] without a game is clearly farmed out to an inferior animation studio". Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment wrote that Eyeshield 21 [...] "has a good solid story idea, showing a young man finding his way through sports by finding friends and realizing he has potential, {{but it is so}} sidelined so often that it's frustrating to see it deal with situations as it does." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward {{was created}} Duke of Windsor by his brother, George VI, {{prior to the}} marriage. However, letters patent, passed by the new king and {{unanimously}} supported by the Dominion governments, prevented Wallis, now the Duchess of Windsor, from sharing her husband's style of [...] "Royal Highness". George VI's firm view that the Duchess should not be given a royal title was shared by Queen Mary and George's wife, Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother). At first, the British royal family did not accept the Duchess and would not receive her formally, although the former king sometimes met his mother and siblings after his abdication. Some biographers have suggested that Wallis's sister-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, remained bitter towards her {{for her role in}} bringing George VI to the throne (which she may have seen as a factor in his early death) and for prematurely behaving as Edward's consort when she was his mistress. These claims were denied by Queen Elizabeth's close friends, such as the Duke of Grafton, who wrote that she [...] "never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a <b>clue</b> <b>what</b> she was dealing with." [...] On the other hand, the Duchess of Windsor referred to Queen Elizabeth as [...] "Mrs Temple" [...] and [...] "Cookie", alluding to her solid figure and fondness for food, and to her daughter, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II), as [...] "Shirley", as in Shirley Temple. The Duchess bitterly resented the denial of the royal title and the refusal of the Duke's relatives to accept her as part of the family. Within the household of the Duke and Duchess, the style [...] "Her Royal Highness" [...] was used by those who were close to the couple.|$|E

[...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.'

Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, there were lots of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it.
