40|$|Adding {{trees to}} {{a mixed farm}} Cue: The {{benefits}} of mixed crop and livestock farming are well known. Livestock produce manure which can boost soil fertility and crop production. Those crops produce by-products, such as maize stover, {{which can be used}} to feed the livestock. Planting trees on a mixed farm can increase whole farm productivity even further, particularly if farmers are careful in their choice of species. Eric Kadenge recently visited a farmer in Kikuyu division, not far from Nairobi, who has introduced a wide variety of tree species to her farm. Having discussed her use of agroforestry, Eric also spoke to the extension officer responsible for Kikuyu division, and sent us this report. IN:		?I am standing on a two acre. ? OUT:		?. even the watering and caring for them. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 34 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: John Kibuika ending that report from Kikuyu division near Nairobi in Kenya. The farmer Eric spoke to was Virginia Wangui Njunge. Transcript Kadenge 	I am standing on a two acre farm in a place known as Muguga that is about 20 km west of Nairobi. And right now from where I am standing, there are some nice and healthy-looking cattle on my left, there is also some cabbages, some sugar cane, some arrow roots and a number of fruit trees and many other trees on this farm. And today I will be talking to a lady who practises mixed farming, and she will be telling us more about her farming and the trees especially and of what benefit they are to her. Wangui 	My names are Virginia Wangui Njunge. I am a retired teacher, I do farming - mixed farming - I keep cattle, I also grow fruits like avocado, guavas, I also grow apples on my two-acre land. I also grow beans, tomatoes cabbages and sukuma wiki. [Kale] Kadenge 	Well that sounds like quite a large variety of crops. Now next to us is a tree that has got some bright and broad looking leaves. Let's start with this one. What tree is this? Wangui	This one is an avocado tree. I have two trees and they give me fruit, which I sell and get some money. Kadenge 	Okay let's move on now to these other smaller looking trees. What trees are these? Wangui	This one is the apple tree. It has been grafted and it gives me fruit as you can see them and I sell them. Now they have been flowering. You can see some have got fruits also they have got flowers. You can see that there are no weeds. So I always pull the weeds so that they can do the flowering nearly all the year round. Kadenge 	And what fruit is this that we have here right now? <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> pluck one? Wangui	Guavas. They are fruits, I also sell some and children use the others. Kadenge 	Okay. And this certainly looks like a mango tree is it? Wangui	Yes it is a mango tree. It has now taken two years, but it has not started giving fruit because it was not grafted this one. It failed the first time but I am planning to do it again. If I graft it, it will give me fruits soon. Kadenge 	Now are all your fruit trees grafted or some of them are not? Wangui	No they are all grafted - all of them. Kadenge 	And what was the reason for grafting them? Wangui	To make them start flowering soon instead of taking long time so they flower quickly when they are grafted than when they are not grafted. Kadenge 	Now earlier on we saw some cows just as I was entering your farm and you have talked about manure. Do you get your manure from the cows? Wangui	Yes. I get a lot of manure from those cows because I have zero grazing so I get a lot of manure from there. Kadenge 	And do you mix the manure from with cow with any other manure - maybe from the vegetation on the farm? Wangui	Yes I do because I have got a compost pit so I get the manure from there. Afterwards I put some weeds and all the leaves, the dry leaves, and so I mix them and then spread them on my farm. Kadenge 	Okay let?s walk {{over to the other side}} of the farm. Now we are walking down to an area where there are eucalyptus trees being grown, but just before we get there, we have some grass here. What grass is this? Wangui	This is Napier grass which I use to feed my cows. Kadenge 	I notice that in between the Napier grass there are some small seedlings. What trees are these? Wangui	Grevillea. Kadenge 	And what is the benefit - why are you planting this tree on your farm? Wangui	They give food to the cows and also it helps my farm - I have planted it where it is not very fertile. Kadenge 	So it also is able to enrich the soil fertility? Wangui 	Yes it is. Kadenge 	Okay let?s move nearer to the eucalyptus trees. Wangui	Yes these are the ones which I have planted on half an acre. Kadenge 	And the benefits of the eucalyptus to you? Wangui	They grow very fast and also they will give timber and also firewood and that is why I have planted them. Kibuika	My names are John Kibuika. I am an extension officer in Kikuyu division. So my work is to co-ordinate extension activities in the division whereby there are livestock, there are crops, that are grown and all rely on extension. Of course when I mean crop/livestock farming it also encompasses agroforestry. Kadenge 	Yes, in fact I was going to mention right now I can see something that looks like a seed bed. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> explain to us what little trees I am seeing here are and some of their benefits? Kibuika	We have a number of different type of trees. Like we have the Grevillea robusta. They are fast growing, they are also very good for wood. They also provide the foliage part of it. The leafy part of it are fed to the animals during the dry period whereby we have nothing to give to our animals. They are also very good in soil fertility because of their leaves fall quite frequently and they decompose very fast. So they also improve soil fertility. We also have another tree called the neem tree, which are good for medicinal value. They prevent and also heal malaria and other diseases. We have the Eucalyptus, the blue gums, which are very fast growing especially this variety from South Africa which grow within five years, they mature within five years. And we get poles from them, also they are very good for charcoal and they are also very important in preventing soil erosion. Kadenge 	And so are you involved in making sure that such nursery beds are taken well care of and made in the right way? Kibuika	That is actually our work. We had a demonstration sometime back whereby we showed them the way to go about making a nursery just from the beginning. The way to lay a nursery bed, filling the poly tubes and of course even transferring the small seedlings to the poly tubes and of course even the watering and caring for them. End of track.

40|$|Gliricidia sepium {{for field}} and garden Cue: Gliricidia sepium is {{a tree with}} many uses. Originating in the {{lowlands}} of Central America, the tree is now planted widely across the tropics, and is commonly used as a living fence species. Its nitrogen-rich leaves {{can be used as}} a mulch or green manure; adding the leaves to the soil improves crop production by boosting soil nutrients, controlling weeds, conserving moisture and reducing soil temperatures. Its leaves can also be used as fodder, especially for ruminants, and its branches make good firewood and building materials. In eastern Zambia, the World Agroforestry Centre has been working closely with farmers to develop better ways of using this versatile tree. Chris Kakunta spoke to one of these farmers, Harrison Chongwe from Chipata North, about how cultivating Gliricidia sepium, and using the leaves as a green manure, has affected his productivity, both in his maize fields and in his vegetable garden. IN:		?This tree is a tree that will continue. ? OUT:		?. have palatable vegetables on their plate. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Chris Kakunta was talking to Harrison Chongwe, known as the Professor because of his agroforestry innovations. Transcript Chongwe	This tree is a tree that will continue to supply fertility into your garden because once you plant it, you plant it at least for a long time. You can cut the stump, it will re-shoot, regenerating each time supplying leaves every season. Kakunta 	We are right up in your garden. <b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> show me some of the vegetables that you have grown and perhaps also show me exactly what type of leaves you have put in the soil. Let?s go and show me. Chongwe 	Yes sure. Kakunta	I can see that you have some onion here and some cabbages. What did you do to these crops, they look so beautiful? Chongwe	Oh yes, in this area here, this is the red creola onion and I?ve applied Gliricidia sepium leaves, we call it biomass technology. We have got a first bed of onions, a second bed of sugarloaf cabbage, in fact six of them I have been applying, have incorporated them with Gliricidia sepium. Kakunta 	With the leaves? Chongwe	With the leaves. Kakunta 	So the leaves are actually helping you fertilise your crop in the main field as well as in the garden? Chongwe	Yes it does. So researchers have come up to say a farmer could be helped for two seasons possibly. During the rainy season we can apply biomass in the main field, but off-season it could be useful in somewhere. So they have come up with a good answer to say, can?t we try it on a dimba, in the garden? Kakunta 	And it?s working also well? Chongwe	And it is working so well. Kakunta 	So are you benefiting from this technology Mr Chongwe? Chongwe	Yes very much so because it has saved me with the fertiliser headache. Kakunta 	So in terms of the yield, how different is this yield compared to when you were applying fertilisers? Chongwe	Previously if fertiliser could come in good time it could put up a good yield. But of late, during the past ten years there has been an erratic supply of fertilisers. So you cannot say I had a good harvest time previously but this time my harvest is steadily increasing. Kakunta 	Obviously one would say why did it take so long for you to actually embark on this project? You didn?t know about it? Chongwe	No, the thing is when you are given trials by the researchers each project has got its own advantages or disadvantages. But in this one here the only disadvantage is the labour that is involved, there is intensive labour. It takes time to learn, that is what I can say. But now this technology is settling with me, I can do anything, I?ve got my own innovations as you can see. Kakunta 	In fact I?m told they call you Professor in this area? Why do they call you Professor? Chongwe	That name came as a professor because the retired general at the head office paid me a visit. And seeing my work that we have done as partners, researchers and the farmers, they were impressed. Kakunta 	Wonderful. Now as we come to the end of the interview Mr Chongwe, what would you like to tell your fellow farmers who are yet to practise this concept? Chongwe	My word is to encourage them to participate in this technology. This technology is very much free. Anybody can take it. If they have got a dimba they should also try it on the dimba and they will have palatable vegetables on their plate. End of track.

40|$|Domesticating and {{cultivating}} {{fruit trees}} Cue: You {{would think that}} if something is special it is safe. But with indigenous or local fruit trees {{that is not the}} case. Trees that have been used and enjoyed by our people for generations are at risk. Some are dying out. Ferdinand Mushinge is the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. He encourages us to identify our favorites and to domesticate these wild trees by raising on our farms. A collection of fruit tree varieties ? and all their characteristics ? is a gene bank where the diversity is preserved. As he explained to Chris Kakunta, the trees on your land need to be nurtured just as tenderly as any other crop, or foreign, exotic trees. If not, then they will not thrive and the genetic treasure they hold could be lost forever. IN:	?We have been involved? OUT:	? they will have a regular harvest. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 21 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: The things you will need to get the best from your domesticated fruit trees were explained to Chris Kakunta by Ferdinand Mushinge, the technical officer for Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mushinge	We have been involved in indigenous fruit trees because some were being heavily harvested for firewood. So genetic erosion was slowly creeping in. Future generation might not have such fruits in the future. So far I can say so good, these trees can be domesticated. That is what is initially required is, farmers can set up what we call community seed banks. The seed can be collected, processed and then planted out in what we call small nurseries and then re-grown in strategic areas. But one thing you should know when you talk about domestication. The trees should be grown in their natural ecological sites. Kakunta	When you talk of ecological sites what exactly do you mean? Mushinge	What I am trying to say when I say ecological sites, tree species, can only establish properly, they only flower and fruit properly in particular geographical areas which are adapted to certain climatic conditions which are conducive for them to flower and fruit. Kakunta	If the farmers have to choose an indigenous tree which they can domesticate, what factors do they have to follow? Mushinge	The factors which farmers have to follow if they have to domesticate a particular indigenous fruit tree is one the climatic factor, two the rainfall pattern, three the species of that wild fruit tree. Soil conditions are also important. For example I will give you a very common fruit tree which is very vital in agriculture, you will find it commonly in the markets but unfortunately it is slowly phasing out, you find {{that a lot of the}} trees have been cut. The example I am talking about is Uapaca Kirkiana which is commonly known as masuku. Very nice, very tasty but can be successfully grown. Kakunta	Wonderful, so what about in terms of the period under which the farmer can grow the tree and be able to get the fruits, don?t you think it matters as well? Mushinge	That is a very important point. If you talk about such trees like mango which is exotic, mango normally will flower and fruit after 3 to 4 years. And from there one aspect you have to consider is biennial bearing. Sometimes the fruit might not be too well because of maybe climatic factors, if the rainfall has not dropped very well the fruit might not flower and fruit very well. But a point in fact is if it is properly cultivated, that is such factors like proper fertilisation in fact even irrigate in terms of scarce rainfall periods you can even put in some water. As a matter of fact when you plant out these trees like the masuku you only need to establish it in the first year. In the next years or so you let nature run its course. Kakunta	<b>Could</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> tell us some steps towards cultivation of this particular tree? Mushinge	One, what is most important is tillage. For example the trees, when you plant them out in the field they have to be 4 by 4 metres apart. Two, they have to irrigated at least once per week. When I say irrigate them, irrigate them once per week with 15 to 20 litres of water, make sure that you apply some fertiliser, that is X or D compound and then you really should be applying it once per year as and when the need arises. Kakunta	Now in the absence of these chemical fertilisers would you recommend farmers to use manure for instance? Mushinge	That is a very good question. Manure behaves like fertiliser. The most important aspect one should consider is that it should properly decompose. Make sure that it decomposes properly but it is an excellent alternative to inorganic fertilisers. Kakunta	So once the farmer follows this procedure are they assured that these indigenous fruit trees can grow just like the exotic ones? Mushinge	When these plants follow out the proper agronomic procedures which I have stipulated after 3, 4 and 5 years depending on the species in question they will definitely have a continuous yield but a point in fact is management is very important. Exotic fruit trees need to be managed same as indigenous fruit trees, they can be domesticated, managed and they will have a regular harvest.
