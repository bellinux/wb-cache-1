5|$|Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade {{student who}} {{commonly}} has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town {{life in his}} hometown of South Park, Colorado, where he lives with his poverty-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer to look as he did in the show's original method of <b>cutout</b> animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , in which his true appearance and voice was first revealed, and various South Park merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Kyle is {{animated}} by computer {{in a way}} to emulate the show's original method of <b>cutout</b> animation. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film , as well as South Park-related media and merchandise. While Parker and Stone portray Kyle as having common childlike tendencies, his dialogue is often intended to reflect stances and views on more adult-oriented issues, and has been cited in numerous publications by experts in the fields of politics, religion, popular culture, and philosophy.|$|E
5|$|The Malloch Building was {{featured}} in the 1947 film noir work titled Dark Passage. In the film, Humphrey Bogart, playing an escaped prisoner, is invited by Lauren Bacall into her apartment unit, Number 10 {{on the third floor}} of the Malloch Building. In the apartment, Bogart hides out while he heals from plastic surgery, and plots to clear his name. Bogart wearily ascends the nearby Filbert Steps in one scene, on his way to the Malloch Building. Modern-day residents have been known to put a <b>cutout</b> of Bogart in the street-facing window of Number 10.|$|E
50|$|The game {{begins with}} three {{cardboard}} <b>cutouts</b> moving into position against a blank wall {{and turning to}} face the player. The <b>cutouts</b> display a mixture of gangsters and innocent/friendly people; the player must react quickly and shoot only the gangsters. In later rounds, the backdrop changes from the blank wall to a city block, with some <b>cutouts</b> already exposed as they emerge into view. The player is confronted with five <b>cutouts</b> {{in each of these}} latter rounds.|$|R
30|$|Thinner shells {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to the <b>cutouts</b> compared to thicker ones. <b>Cutouts</b> reduce the local buckling capacity of shell about 10 – 15  % in the cylindrical shells, with the diameter to thickness ratio of less than 1, 000. Meanwhile in shells with diameter to thickness more than 1, 000, such <b>cutouts</b> reduce the shell capacity about 30 – 35  %.|$|R
30|$|Thin-walled {{cylindrical}} shells {{are important}} components of many industrial complexes. Most of these components have circular <b>cutouts</b> in manholes and pipe-to-shell junctions. Performance of cylindrical shells {{due to the}} extreme loading conditions shows that buckling is the major failure mode in such components. This study aims to indicate the effect of circular <b>cutouts</b> on buckling capacity of cylindrical shells due to pure axial compression. To this end, cylindrical shells of different geometric specifications and various arrangements and sizes of <b>cutouts</b> were considered. Numerical nonlinear analyses were conducted using ANSYS software. Result of this study revealed that <b>cutouts</b> can play a noticeable role in creating stress concentration and affect destructively the stability of structures. It is shown {{that there is a}} noticeable difference between the effects on <b>cutouts</b> in buckling of thinner shells and thicker ones. <b>Cutouts</b> reduce the local buckling capacity of shell about 10 – 15  % in the cylindrical shells, with the diameter to thickness ratio of less than 1, 000. Meanwhile in shells with diameter to thickness, more than 1, 000 such <b>cutouts</b> reduce the shell capacity about 30 – 35  %.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the cavalry}} had been {{successful}} in protecting the park, by 1914 the average soldier was not <b>cutout</b> for the strenuous, diplomatic and tedious nature of the work, and {{the high level of}} training related to cavalry skills. World War I added further impetus to a transition back to civilian management, to relieve the army of a duty that could be performed by civilian rangers. In July 1914, the 1st Cavalry was withdrawn from Yellowstone and replaced with a composite unit of 200 cavalrymen from throughout the army, many of whom had served in Yellowstone previously.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax <b>cutout</b> with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{returning}} immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex {{to accompany him}} to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a <b>cutout</b> picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a honeymoon. When the groom gets cold feet, Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade the groom {{to go through with}} the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches.|$|E
5000|$|After {{completing}} the handwritten {{portion of the}} work, Clairmont cut his copy into 50 5x7 inch mats, with rectangular <b>cutouts</b> {{in the center of}} each mat. These <b>cutouts</b> were taken to Skunk Prairie, a traditional hunting and gathering area of the Salish Kootenai people. He distributed the <b>cutouts</b> under rocks, representing the ongoing relationship of humans and the earth, covered in lichen, photographing them and leaving them as an offering. The photographs were placed in the rectangular <b>cutouts</b> of the mats, then the mats were placed in clear plastic envelopes and displayed in the form of an [...] "X" [...] the wall, representing the signatures of those who signed the treaty.|$|R
30|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of circular <b>cutouts</b> on inelastic buckling and post-buckling behavior of cylindrical shells. In this study, the effects of different arrangements of the circular <b>cutouts</b> on buckling and post-buckling behavior of the cylindrical shells are investigated. To this end, FEM models were prepared in ANSYS (2009) environment, and nonlinear analyses have been performed. Herein, the effects of various arrangements of <b>cutouts</b> on buckling of cylindrical shells of different geometric specifications were studied.|$|R
50|$|Extensive redesigns {{were made}} for the M1918 model. A new two-piece chin strap was introduced, and was {{attached}} directly to the helmet liner rather than the shell. Certain examples of the M1918 had <b>cutouts</b> in the rim {{along the sides of}} the helmet. It has incorrectly been said that these <b>cutouts</b> were to accommodate using headphones while wearing the helmet. These <b>cutouts</b> were actually done to improve hearing and to reduce echo created by the large, flared skirt.|$|R
5|$|Prizes {{were awarded}} {{for the best}} structures, the best art posters, and the best <b>cutout</b> books made by {{students}} about Tiny Town. The prizes were available only to vocational-training students and students otherwise involved in the project. Student officials were in charge during the awards at the Springfield convention center. The carpentry of the framing and exterior of the homes was done primarily by the boys. The supervisor of the art department of the participating schools had an interior home-decoration contest to involve the girls, who made draperies, furniture, and floor coverings and beautified the homes' interiors.|$|E
5|$|The French {{animator}} Émile Cohl {{produced a}} version of the stories using silhouette <b>cutout</b> animation in 1913; other animated versions were produced by Richard Felgenauer in Germany in 1920, and by Paul Peroff in the United States in 1929. Colonel Heeza Liar, the protagonist of the first animated cartoon series in cinema history, was created by John Randolph Bray in 1913 as an amalgamation of the Baron and Teddy Roosevelt. The Italian director Paolo Azzurri filmed The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in 1914, and the British director F. Martin Thornton made a short silent film featuring the Baron, The New Adventures of Baron Munchausen, the following year. In 1940, the Czech director Martin Frič filmed Baron Prášil, starring the comic actor Vlasta Burian as a 20th-century descendant of the Baron.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{style of}} {{animation}} {{is inspired by}} the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. Construction paper and traditional stop motion <b>cutout</b> animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of animatics drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E
40|$|In the {{fabrication}} of offshore structures, <b>cutouts</b> are often made on pipes to allow {{access to the}} interior of the pipes for maintenance and servicing. Thus, there is a necessity to investigate the effects of <b>cutouts</b> on the buckling load of pipes. Both the finite element and experimental techniques have been employed to investigate several series of pipes with and without <b>cutouts.</b> The results obtained were in reasonably good agreement with those obtained by the semiempirical solution. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{aerospace}} structures {{it is common}} to find stiffened panels with transverse supporting structures, e. g. wing ribs or fuselage frames. Incorporating <b>cutouts</b> into these supporting structures to allow the stringers to pass through freely considerably reduces the buckling load of the panels. It is shown that a minor modification in the fabrication of the stiffened panel gives most of the advantages of <b>cutouts</b> while still giving a buckling load close to that of a panel with no <b>cutouts...</b>|$|R
40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{are used for}} a wide variety of aerospace applications. Practical structures contain <b>cutouts</b> and these {{structures are}} subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane loading conditions. Structurally efficient designs for composite structures require a thorough understanding of the effects of <b>cutouts</b> on the response of composite plates subjected to inplane or out-of-plane loadings. Most investigations of the behavior of composite plates with <b>cutouts</b> have considered in-plane loadings only. Out-of-plane loadings suchas bending or twisting have received very limited attention. The response of homogeneous plates (e. g., isotropic or orthotropic plates) subjected to bending or twisting moments has been studied analytically. These analyses are for infinite plates and neglect finite-plate effects. Recently, analytical and experimental studies were conducted to determine the effects of <b>cutouts</b> on the response of laminated composite plates subjected to bending moments. No analytical or experimental results are currently available for the effects of <b>cutouts</b> on the response of composite laminates subjected to twisting moments...|$|R
5|$|Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) built animatronic WALL-E's {{to promote}} the picture, which made {{appearances}} at Disneyland Resort, the Franklin Institute, the Miami Science Museum, the Seattle Center, and the Tokyo International Film Festival. Due to safety concerns, the 318kg robots were always strictly controlled and WDI always needed {{to know exactly what}} they were required to interact with. For this reason, they generally refused to have their puppets meet and greet children at the theme parks in case a WALL-E trod on a child's foot. Those who wanted to take a photograph with the character had to make do with a cardboard <b>cutout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal <b>cutout</b> representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first <b>cutout</b> animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} optical character recognition. It focuses on recognizing hand-written text. The theoretical introduction describes {{the methods used}} for optical character recognition and selected machine learning methods. Subsequently, the work describes two methods for making <b>cutouts</b> of characters, using a sliding window. <b>Cutouts</b> are used in training and testing datasets of machine learning models. The document includes methods to improve the accuracy of character recognition. The accuracy of the models is evaluated in conclusion. Charcters in <b>cutouts</b> are clasified by an automated recognition program...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{interior}} <b>cutouts</b> in laminated composite panels {{is of great}} importance in aerospace, automobile and structural engineering. Based on the Tsai–Hill failure criterion of the first ply, this paper presents a newly developed Fixed (FG) Grid Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) method to explore shape optimization of multiple <b>cutouts</b> in composite structures. Different design cases with varying number of <b>cutouts,</b> ply orientations and lay-up configurations {{are taken into account}} in this study. The examples demonstrate that the optimal boundaries produced by FG ESO are much smoother than those by traditional ESO. The results show the remarkable effects of different opening numbers and various lay-up configurations on resulting optimal shapes. The paper also provides an in-depth observation in the interactive influence of the adjacent <b>cutouts</b> on the optimal shapes...|$|R
5|$|The {{station has}} beige wall tiles with intertwining blue and orange stripes, {{representing}} the two {{colors of the}} New York City flag, and {{the colors of the}} IND Eighth Avenue and Sixth Avenue lines which serve the station. There are two fare control areas. The full-time area at the east end of the station, between 179th and 180th Streets, has a token booth and a bank of 12 turnstiles and two high-exit-only turnstiles. The part-time exit at 178th Street contains a nine-turnstile bank, two high exit entrance turnstiles (HEETs), and two high exit turnstiles. The two ends are connected by a full-length mezzanine, which features Our Spectrum of Support artwork by Reginald Polynice, a set of plywood <b>cutout</b> figures appearing to hold up the ceiling of the mezzanine. The station also features a control tower. The station is ADA-accessible via an elevator installed at 179th Place {{on the north side of}} Hillside Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Suffering {{withdrawal}} syndrome from {{the lack of}} cable, Peter straps a television-sized cardboard <b>cutout</b> to himself, making it appear as though his whole world is actually a television programme. When Meg can no longer deal with the public scorn, she reveals that her father is really responsible for Quahog's loss of television, causing the town to turn against him. In an attempt to save Peter from further scorn and verbal attacks, Lois gives a heartfelt speech to the community about how television has kept them all from enjoying one another. Inspired by the speech, Peter drags the family to one outdoor activity after another, which quickly exhausts them. Once the family can no longer keep up with him, Peter decides to go off with William Shatner, who has appeared on the Griffin family doorstep after experiencing a flat tire, to a nearby festival. Meanwhile, Stewie's weather machine creates a huge rainstorm. The storm's lightning strike destroys Stewie's weather machine and blows Stewie off the roof and on the ground. While Meg is practicing driving with Lois, the storm causes her to accidentally hit Shatner and Peter, killing Shatner and hospitalizing Peter. As her father recovers, in a full-body cast, he is forced to watch television, causing him to become addicted once again, much to his family's relief.|$|E
5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard <b>cutout</b> of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1. Overview of iCoseg: (a) shows a {{group of}} Stonehenge images, and foreground/background scribbles on two images (with green borders); (b) shows <b>cutouts</b> using these scribbles. A naïve {{interactive}} co-segmentation setup would force a user to examine all <b>cutouts</b> for mistakes, and then iteratively scribble on the worst segmentation to obtain better results. <b>Cutouts</b> needing correction are shown with red borders. (c) shows the region prompted for more scribbles by iCoseg, thus avoiding exhaustive examination of all <b>cutouts</b> by users. This paper presents an algorithm for Interactive Cosegmentation of a foreground object from {{a group of}} related images. While previous approaches focus on unsupervised co-segmentation, we use successful ideas from the interactive object-cutout literature. We develop an algorithm that allows users to decide what foreground is, and then guide the output of the co-segmentation algorithm towards it via scribbles. Interestingly, keeping a user in the loop leads to simpler and highly parallelizable energy functions, allowing us to work with significantly more images per group. However, unlike the interactive single image counterpart, a user cannot be expected to exhaustively examine all <b>cutouts</b> (from tens of images) returned by the system to make corrections. Hence, we propose iCoseg, an automatic recommendation system that intelligently recommends where the user should scribble next. We introduce and make publicly available the largest co-segmentation dataset yet, the CMU-Cornell iCoseg Dataset, with 38 groups, 643 images, and pixelwise hand-annotated groundtruth. Through machine experiments and real user studies with our developed interface, we show that iCoseg can intelligently recommend regions to scribble on, and users following these recommendations can achieve good quality <b>cutouts</b> with significantly lower time and effort than exhaustively examining all <b>cutouts...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} to computationally simulate probabilistic buckling behavior of multilayered composite shells. The simulation accounts for all naturally-occurring uncertainties {{including those in}} constituent (fiber/matrix) material properties, fabrication variables, and structure geometry. The method is demonstrated for probabilistically assessing the buckling survivability of a specific case of a stiffened composite cylindrical shell with and without <b>cutouts.</b> The sensitivities of various uncertain variables on the buckling survivability are evaluated at specified reliability. The {{results show that the}} buckling survivability for a shell without <b>cutouts</b> depends primarily on shell skin related uncertainties. However, stringer related uncertainties become important for a shell with <b>cutouts...</b>|$|R
