According {{to the rule}} of axial forces redistributing between two kinds of bearings under earthquake, a calculating method considering the vertical force redistribute of isolation layer was given. With this method, the results of an example show that axial force will transfer from rubber bearings to sliding isolated bearings along with the horizontal displacement of isolation layer. The bigger the displacement is the more axial force transfers. So the axial-forces redistribution is a self-adjustable performance of the system, and also is an advantage for the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{dielectric}} {{response of}} {{three kinds of}} filled high temperature vulcanization (HTV) silicone rubber – SiO 2 based nanocomposite with different alumina tri-hydrate (ATH) micro-filler contents are investigated {{over a wide range}} of frequency and temperature. The results are analyzed in terms of the many-body Dissado-Hill dielectric response theory. In all three kinds of silicone rubber, a quasi-DC (QDC) process, a Dissado-Hill loss peak process and a diffusion process are observed. Specifically, the ATH filler contributes a QDC electrical transport/hopping process, which at higher temperatures causes the formation of a diffusion layer at the electrodes. The nano-SiO 2 particles <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>rubber</b> matrix give a Dissado-Hill loss peak dielectric relaxation. These two dispersion processes are shown {{to be associated with the}} interior interfaces of filled HTV silicone rubber.

40|$|Passive and {{semi-active}} tuned {{mass damper}} (PTMD and SATMD) building systems are proposed to mitigate structural response due to seismic loads. The structure's upper portion self plays a role either as a tuned mass passive damper or a semi-active resetable device is adopted as a control feature for the PTMD, creating a SATMD system. Two-degree-of-freedom analytical studies are employed to design the prototype structural system, specify its element characteristics and effectiveness for seismic responses, including defining the resetable device dynamics. The optimal parameters are derived for the large mass ratio by numerical analysis. For the SATMD building system the stiffness of the resetable device design is <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> <b>rubber</b> bearing stiffness. From parametric studies, effective practical control schemes can be derived for the SATMD system. To verify the principal efficacy of the conceptual system, the controlled system response is compared with the response spectrum of the earthquake suites used.

50|$|Modern {{professional}} recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with {{a constant}} rotational speed drives the capstan. This, usually <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a <b>rubber</b> pinch roller, {{ensures that the}} tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called Torque Motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take up reels during recording and play back functions and maintain the tape's tension. During fast winding operations the pinch roller is disengaged and the take up reel motor is supplied with a higher voltage than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the supply and take-up reels are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, in which one motor is used for rewinding only.|$|R

In this way, it seems useful to <b>combine</b> nanoclay reinforcement <b>with</b> <b>rubber</b> toughening to balance end use performance. In this work, the feasibility of producing this kind of nanocomposites by direct injection molding is evaluated. The performance of actual injected pieces of polypropylene (PP) compounded with thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) and organoclay (MMT) is analyzed and compared. Ternary composite presents low warpage and so better final quality. Morphology developed in actual pieces is influenced both by processing and by MMT presence, this morphology giving place to alternative deformation mechanisms and crack arrest. Also, a good impact resistance compared with neat PP is observed. Weld lines are diluted and they do not act as stress concentrators, this being of mechanical and aesthetical interest. The use of PP/TPV/MMT seems to be promising for injected moldings. Authors would like to thank CONICET, ANPCyT and UNMdP from Argentina and University of Minho from Portugal for financial support.

40|$|Abstract. Design and {{fabrication}} {{of an object}} with parts embedded internally within the part {{has always been a}} difficult challenge to fabricate. This is mainly due to limitations in design for manufacturing (DFM). The objective of this work is to investigate improvements in overcoming limitations in DFM of non-metallic object with embedded part within a part through 3 D printing technology and silicone rubber. 3 D printing technology is a type of Rapid Prototyping (RP) method which has limitations in its material durability and product failure rate. This technology <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> silicone <b>rubber</b> is envisaged capable to overcome some of the limitations in DFM while increasing its durability. Layer manufacturing using 3 D printing is used to construct scaffolding of the end product and silicone rubber used as material to fill the cavities.

The nature of my invention consists in compounding <b>with</b> <b>rubber,</b> in any proportions, other suitable substances, so as to form not only an agreeable chewing-gum, but also, that from the scouring-properties of the same, it will subserve the purpose of a dentifrice. It is well known that rubber itself is too hard {{to be used as a}} chewing-gum, but in combination with non-adhesive earths may be rendered capable of kneading into any shape under the teeth. In the manufacture of this improved chewing-gum, no vulcanizing-process is employed. It is produced by simply dissolving the rubber in naphtha and alcohol, and when of the consistence of jelly, mixing with it prepared chalk, powdered licorice-root, or any other suitable material, in the desired proportions, and subsequently evaporating the solvents. I do not, however, confine myself to this method alone for the manufacture of the gum. For commercial purposes, other equally effectual processes maybe used for the uniting of the <b>rubber</b> <b>with</b> suitable substances. Instead of the solvents named, any other that will soften the rubber, without being offensive, may be employed, such as paraffine, spermaceti, wax, gums, resins, and the like. Any of the materials commonly used for the manufacture of dentifrices may be <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> the <b>rubber,</b> such as orris-root, myrrh, licorice-root, sugar, barytes, charcoal, &c.

The original design of the hose {{was based on a}} helically coiled metal strip with an S-shaped profile. The profile interlocked along the windings of the helical coil.

Coburn Haskell of Cleveland, Ohio had driven to nearby Akron, Ohio for a golf date with Bertram Work, {{the superintendent of}} the B.F. Goodrich Company. While he waited in the plant for Work, Haskell picked up some <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> and wound it into a ball. When he bounced the ball, it flew almost to the ceiling. Work suggested Haskell put a cover on the creation, {{and that was the}} birth of the 20th century wound golf ball that would soon replace the guttie bramble ball. The new design became known as the rubber Haskell golf ball. For decades, the wound rubber ball consisted of a liquid-filled or solid round core that was wound with a layer of <b>rubber</b> <b>thread</b> into a larger round inner core and then covered with a thin outer shell made of balata sap. The balata is a tree native to Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree is tapped and the soft, viscous fluid released is a rubber-like material similar to gutta-percha, which was found to make an ideal cover for a golf ball. Balata, however, is relatively soft. If the leading edge of a highly lofted short iron contacts a balata-covered ball in a location other than the bottom of the ball a cut or [...] "smile" [...] will often be the result, rendering the ball unfit for play in most instances.|$|R

40|$|Sufficient {{ballistic}} {{protection of}} the neck area would significantly reduce the vulnerability of an infantry soldier. So far this protection is offered by extensions on the ballistic vest or combat helmet. However, the requirements for head agility and the various body to head positions <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> the design of current body armour solutions, generally result in an unprotected in-between gap. The combination of critical body functions in the neck area, causing casualties in case of fragment penetrations, has motivated TNO to investigate options for ballistic protection of this area. In this paper {{the vulnerability of the}} neck area is briefly addressed. Casualty data of infantry operations and model analysis show the potential value of sufficient ballistic protection of this part of the body. A range of options has been considered, finally resulting in a closed 3 -dimensional geometry that maintains its ballistic function, independently of head position and angle of the ballistic threat. In this so called flexible ballistic collar, aramid weave layers were <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> a <b>rubber</b> support structure. By using the possibility of the two main fibre orientations of these weaves to shear to non-perpendicular orientations, the product can deform to different heights (in shoulder to head direction) at minimum force. With this deformation capability, the gap between combat helmet and ballistic vest is closed at any conceivable head position. A range of prototypes was manufactured and tested on fragment penetration resistance. Because of the geometry of the flexible ballistic collar, combining a wide range of angle of impact effects over the contour of the collar, standard V 50 testing was not possible. An alternative method has been developed and used, providing a clear limit velocity for 1. 1 gram Fragment Simulating Projectiles (FSPs). Operational use of the ballistic collar, results in multiple collar compressions while following head to body movements. The product’s ballistic performance has been determined also after 10. 000 of these simulated deformations of the product. It showed that the products ballistic performance was not significantly affected by these repeated deformations...|$|R
