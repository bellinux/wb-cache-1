The telescope mount is located on a cylindrical concrete pier so that the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is [...] above ground level, which lifts the telescope above ground-layer air turbulence for better seeing. A conventional up-down 6m-wide shutter with wind-blind, several large vents with extractor fans for thermal control, and a [...] capacity crane (used for moving the primary mirror e.g. for aluminising) are all incorporated. The {{size and shape of}} the shutter allow observations down to 12° above the horizon, which corresponds to an airmass of 4.8. The total moving mass of the dome is , which is mounted on top of a three-storey cylindrical building. The dome was designed to minimise wind stresses and can support up to its own weight again in ice during inclement weather. The dome and telescope rest on separate sets of foundations (driven [...] down into the volcanic basalt), to prevent vibrations caused by dome rotation or wind stresses on the building affecting the telescope pointing.|$|E

50|$|For {{determining}} the instant <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> {{of the third}} element of the linkage, the body BAC, the two points A and B are used because its moving characteristics are known, as derived from {{the information about the}} links P1-A and P2-B. The direction of speed of point A is indicated by vector VA. Its instant <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> must be perpendicular to this vector (as VA is tangentially located on the circumference of a circle). The only line that fills the requirement is a line colinear with link P1-A. Somewhere on this line there is a point P, the instant <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> for the body BAC. What applies to point A also applies to point B, therefore this instant <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> P is located on a line perpendicular to vector VB, a line colinear with link P2-B. Therefore, the instant <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> P of body BAC is the point where the lines through P1-A and P2-B cross.|$|E

The order of rotational symmetry can be estimated, and if it is greater than two, the tilt and orientation of the rotationally symmetric surface can be found and the symmetric region segmented. Local features robust to local affine distortion are matched to obtain pairs of features. Each feature pair hypothesises a set <b>of</b> <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> for different tilts and orientations and the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> that are close to each other are grouped together to find the dominant rotational symmetries in the image.

5000|$|If two planar rigid {{bodies are}} in contact, and each body {{has its own}} {{distinct}} <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> then the relative <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> between the bodies has to lie somewhere on the line connecting the two centres.

In fact, the gearing ratio between the two rotating parts is found by the ratio of the two distances to the relative centre. In the example in Sketch 4 the gearing ratio is ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{preclinical}} in vitro method to predict the occurrence and severity of edge loading condition associated with the dynamic separation <b>of</b> the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> the head and cup (in the absence of impingement) for variations in surgical positioning of the cup. Specifically, this study investigated the effect of both the variations in the medial–lateral translational mismatch between the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> the femoral head and acetabular cup and the variations in the cup inclination angles on the occurrence and magnitude of the dynamic separation, the severity of edge loading, and the wear rate of ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacement bearings in a multi-station hip joint simulator during a walking gait cycle. An increased mismatch between the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the femoral head and acetabular cup resulted in an increased level of dynamic separation and an increase in the severity of edge loading condition which led to increased wear rate in ceramic-on-ceramic bearings. Additionally for a given translational mismatch, an increase in the cup inclination angle gave rise to increased dynamic separation, worst edge loading conditions, and increased wear. To reduce the occurrence and severity of edge loading, the relative positions (the mismatch) <b>of</b> the <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> the head and the cup should be considered alongside the rotational position of the acetabular cup.

40|$|Objective. In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that the}} tibialis anterior tendon moment arm increases during maximum isometric dorsiflexion as compared with rest. Background. In musculoskeletal modelling applications, moment arms from passive muscles at rest are assumed representative of those measured during isometric muscle contraction. The validity of this assumption is questionable in musculotendon actuators enclosed by retinacular systems as in tibialis anterior. Design and Methods. Sagittal-plane magnetic resonance images of the right ankle were taken in six subjects at rest and during maximum isometric dorsiflexion at six ankle angles between dorsiflexion and plantarflexion having the body placed in the supine position and the knee flexed at 90 °. Instant <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> in the tibio-talar joint, tibialis anterior tendon action lines and moment arms were identified in the sagittal plane at ankle angles of - 15 °, 0 °, + 15 °and + 30 °at rest and during maximum isometric dorsiflexion. Results. At any given ankle angle, the tibialis anterior tendon moment arm during maximum isometric dorsiflexion increased by 0. 9 - 1. 5 cm (P < 0. 01) compared with rest. This was attributed to a displacement of both tibialis anterior tendon action line by 0. 8 - 1. 2 cm (P < 0. 01) and all instant <b>centres</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> by 0. 3 - 0. 4 cm (P < 0. 01) distally in relation to their corresponding resting positions. Conclusions and implications. The assumption that the tibialis anterior tendon maximum isometric dorsiflexion is invalid. Erroneous tendon forces, muscle stresses and joint moments by as much as 30 % would be calculated using resting tibialis anterior tendon moment arms in the moment equilibrium equation around the ankle joint during maximum isometric dorsiflexion...|$|R
