25|$|In the 2010s, {{cars are}} {{increasingly}} sold with electronic remote <b>control</b> <b>door</b> locks. These remotes transmit {{a signal to}} the car which locks or unlocks the door locks or unlocks the trunk. An aftermarket device sold in some countries is the remote starter. This enables a car owner to remotely start their car. This feature is most associated with countries with winter climates, where users may wish to run the car for several minutes before they intend to use it, so that the car heater and defrost systems can remove ice and snow from the windows.|$|E

50|$|Ziggy's new outdoor {{facility}} was completed {{during the summer}} of 1971. Most of the $50,000 was spent on a remote <b>control</b> <b>door,</b> which would allow the elephant to go inside and outside without human intervention. Ziggy finally entered his new home on August 28, 1971, in front of more than one thousand cheering people. Over the next few months, the zoo added a wading pool to Ziggy's yard and refurbished his indoor stall.|$|E

Contactless smartcards are used for all other applications: library cards, contactless payment systems, and public transit fare cards.|$|R
25|$|The {{first stage}} of this research, which began on 24 August 1998, {{involved}} a simple RFID transmitter being implanted beneath Warwick's skin, which was used to <b>control</b> <b>doors,</b> lights, heaters, and other computer-controlled devices based on his proximity. The main purpose of this experiment {{was said to be}} to test the limits of what the body would accept, and how easy it would be to receive a meaningful signal from the microprocessor.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{subsystems}} in a rail vehicle, such as {{a locomotive}} or multiple unit, depend on a reliable and precise rotary speed signal, in some cases {{as a measure of}} the speed or changes in the speed. This applies in particular to traction control, but also to wheel slide protection, registration, train <b>control,</b> <b>door</b> control and so on. These tasks are performed by a number of rotary speed sensors that may be found {{in various parts of the}} vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Semi-intelligent readers: {{have all}} {{inputs and outputs}} {{necessary}} to <b>control</b> <b>door</b> hardware (lock, door contact, exit button), but do not make any access decisions. When a user presents a card or enters a PIN, the reader sends information to the main controller, and waits for its response. If the connection to the main controller is interrupted, such readers stop working, or function in a degraded mode. Usually semi-intelligent readers are connected to a control panel via an RS-485 bus. Examples of such readers are InfoProx Lite IPL200 by CEM Systems, and AP-510 by Apollo.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} 2010, it was {{revealed}} that ten stations would receive platform screen door installation in an attempt to increase the average speed of trains and reduce track-related incidents. After a test a few years earlier, the RATP decided that such doors must be built as crowding increases so that passengers cannot fall off the platform; to do this, the agency recruited the Kaba Group to perform automation and installation on Lines 1 and 13. The company uses the ClearSy security system to <b>control</b> <b>door</b> opening and closing. However, the new platform screen doors {{are not the same as}} the prototypes installed at Invalides.|$|E

40|$|The {{project was}} to develop a radio <b>controlled</b> <b>door</b> holder system as the first in a range of radio based {{products}} for Stephenson Gobin Eng Co. Ltd. Stephenson Gobin manufacture and market a wide range of electromechanical products, including retaining devices for fire doors and smoke vents. Typical installations are in hospitals, nursing homes, shopping centers, hotels or any building open to the public. The author discusses why a radio <b>controlled</b> <b>door</b> holder system is commercially and technically viable. Various wired and Wirefree door holder systems are evaluated on merits of safety and ease of installation. Stephenson Gobin developed a bi-stable latching door holding device which consumed no current in a state that was capable of holding a fire door open. This was due to a rotating magnetic slug assembly which only drew current to latch from one state to other. The device needed to be controlled wirelessly and possible methods of communication were assessed. Communicating using the license free radio frequency spectrum was selected due to the falling costs of radio components and the huge growth in the radio communication sector. The author developed and tested the hardware and software necessary to communicate with and actuate such a device...|$|R
50|$|The {{cars have}} no driver's cab, {{although}} there is a small driver's console concealed behind a locked panel at each outer car end from which the Passenger Service Agent (PSA) can drive the train when necessary. Other consoles at each door opening allow the PSA to <b>control</b> <b>door</b> closure and make announcements whilst patrolling the train. Because of the absence of a driver's position, the fully glazed car ends provide a panoramic forward (or rear) view for passengers. At least one PSA is required on each train to close the doors upon departing and for emergency situations, such as taking the controls or evacuating the train, especially in tunnelled sections.|$|E
5000|$|Intelligent readers: {{have all}} {{inputs and outputs}} {{necessary}} to <b>control</b> <b>door</b> hardware; they also have memory and processing power necessary to make access decisions independently. Like semi-intelligent readers, they are connected to a control panel via an RS-485 bus. The control panel sends configuration updates, and retrieves events from the readers. Examples of such readers could be InfoProx IPO200 by CEM Systems, and AP-500 by Apollo. There is also {{a new generation of}} intelligent readers referred to as [...] "IP readers". Systems with IP readers usually do not have traditional control panels, and readers communicate directly to a PC that acts as a host.|$|E
50|$|As {{military}} action grows more advanced and lethal, robotic platforms help soldiers perform tasks without endangering their lives but still accomplish their tasks efficiently. As a result, MATILDA {{can be used}} for various tasks such as: reconnaissance, bomb <b>control,</b> <b>door</b> breaching, weapon control, remote mine detection, and the remote launching of unmanned aerial vehicles. With bomb control, soldiers lives are often put at risk so MATILDA aims to solve this issue by having the capability to perform life-threatening tasks without the loss of human life. These activities are known as unexploded ordnance, or UXO activities. Military personnel can use MATILDA to detect and neutralize different types of UXOs, such as man-to-man and land-mine situations, in all types of weather. Additionally, to support troops Mesa has also released special attachments like the manipulator arm, which would assist specific tasks such as bomb control even further. MATILDA also comes built with a variety of sensors allowing it to manipulate objects, avoid crashes, assemble, inspect, and recognize items. This allows others beside the military to use this platform for recreational or experimental purposes.|$|E
50|$|For rear doors, most buses have {{doors opened}} by the driver {{controls}} or patron (with touch-to-open, motion sensor or push bars). Most doors on buses use air-assist technology, the driver <b>controlled</b> <b>doors,</b> use air pressure {{to force them}} open, patron-operated doors, can push them open, however, the doors are heavy, so the touch-to-open or push bar mechanism, sends pressurized air to open the doors. Most doors will signify that they are unlocked and open with lights, this gives guide {{to those who are}} going up or down the door steps to not trip and fall.|$|R
50|$|Later in the game, {{the player}} {{encounters}} SCP-079, a malicious artificial intelligence (inhabiting a microcomputer), and learns that it caused the power outage when several Chaos Insurgency spies gave it {{control over the}} facility. From here SCP-079 will propose that the player reactivates the <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system, allowing SCP-079 to regain <b>control</b> over the <b>doors,</b> in exchange for helping the player escape the facility. If the player re-activates the <b>door</b> <b>control</b> system, SCP-079 will open the doors to two different exits, Gate A and B. From here 4 different endings can be reached.|$|R
