40|$|Our {{empirical}} {{study examines}} {{the role and}} importance of arbitration <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> standard form contracts, primarily with other businesses. While {{much has been written}} about the impact of mandatory arbitration <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> consumer contracts, relatively little has been written on mandatory arbitration <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> customer agreements where the customer was a business and not an individual consumer. In this Article, we specifically address the findings presented in Theodore Eisenberg, Geoffrey Miller, and Emily Sherwin’s study, Arbitration’s Summer Soldiers: An Empirical Study of Arbitration <b>Clauses</b> <b>in</b> Consumer and Nonconsumer Contracts. 1 Our study finds that many businesses employ mandatory arbitration <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> their customer contracts with other businesses. Our study also suggests that the primary reason for mandatory arbitration <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> customer contracts where the customer is a business is the avoidance of expenses associated with litigation. Our study may help companies to better understand attitudes about arbitration and assist in contract negotiations. The results of our study may also help courts determine whether arbitration <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> merchant form agreements––and changes to those clauses––are “material” under section 2 - 207 (2) of the Uniform Commercial Code...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{description}} of three types of subordinate <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> Surui: adverbial subordinate clauses, complement clauses, and quotative <b>clauses.</b> <b>In</b> adverbial and in one type of complement clauses, reflexive forms are used to show coreference with {{the subject of the}} independent clause. This type of complement clause is closely linked with its complementizer, whereas another type is only in loose construction with a demonstrative complementizer. In this paper, we will survey different types of subordinate <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> Surui. 1 One of the first things one notices about subordinate <b>clauses</b> <b>in</b> Surui is their scarcity: ignoring direct quotations for the moment, only about 11 % of all <b>clauses</b> are subordinate <b>in</b> text count, compared with 34 % in English (Mithun 1984 : 493).

5|$|An ouster <b>clause</b> <b>in</b> {{a statute}} {{is an attempt}} by the {{legislature}} to prevent an act or decision by a public authority from being challenged before the courts. Such clauses thus serve as a signal to decision-makers that they may operate without fear of intervention by the courts at a later stage. One common kind of ouster clause is the total ouster or finality clause, which is inserted into a statute to indicate that the decision of a particular judge or tribunal is final and cannot be challenged by any court.|$|E
