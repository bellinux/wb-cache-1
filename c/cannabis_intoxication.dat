5000|$|A 2011 {{systematic}} review evaluated published {{studies of the}} acute and long-term cognitive effects of <b>cannabis.</b> THC <b>intoxication</b> is well established to impair cognitive functioning on an acute basis, including effects {{on the ability to}} plan, organize, solve problems, make decisions, and control impulses. The extent of this impact may be greater in novice users, and paradoxically, those habituated to high-level ingestion may have reduced cognition during withdrawal. Studies of long-term effects on cognition have provided conflicting results, with some studies finding no difference between long-term abstainers and never-users and others finding long-term deficits. The discrepancies between studies may reflect greater long-term effects among heavier users relative to occasional users, and greater duration of effect among those with heavy use as adolescents compared to later in life. [...] A second {{systematic review}} focused on neuroimaging studies found little evidence supporting an effect of cannabis use on brain structure and function. A 2003 meta-analysis concluded that any long-term cognitive effects were relatively modest in magnitude and limited to certain aspects of learning and memory.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of cannabis on traffic crashes {{is a growing}} concern. Experimental studies provide ample evidences of cannabis influence on psychomotor and cognitive performances. Epidemiological works describe the excess crash risk that this substance causes. And yet, this psychotropic drug influence in causing crashes is still at the centre of many discussions. The present analysis consists in exploiting crash data in detail to obtain a more precise understanding of the failures that drivers are subject to when they have consumed cannabis, depending {{on the level of}} Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) measured in blood samples. Two groups representative of fatal crashes occurring in France were studied: the Cannabis group (n= 174) and a Control group (n= 174) involving neither cannabis nor alcohol. The results of this analysis notably show that cannabis consumption significantly increases the rate of "generalized failures" by the driver, reflecting an alteration of all sensorial, motor and cognitive functions, specifically for high blood levels of THC (> 5 ng/mL). At lower levels of <b>intoxication,</b> <b>cannabis</b> leads to a poor diagnosis of driving difficulties...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{simultaneous}} {{use of alcohol}} and cannabis is common among adolescents, but has been little studied. In this study, we examine predictors and consequences of this behavior in a population-based sample of high school students. Method: Self-reports were obtained from students in Quebec (Canada) followed throughout high school (N= 6589). Logistic regressions were {{used to test the}} association between individual, family, and peerrelated predictors in grades 7 – 8 and simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use in grade 10, as well as between simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use in grade 10 and experiencing 3 or more substance-related problems of various types (legal, physical, etc.) in grade 11. Results: Most predictors in grades 7 – 8 were associated with simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use in grade 10. Only variables reflecting early-onset substance use involvement — alcohol <b>intoxication,</b> <b>cannabis</b> use, and drug use by close friend(s) — remained predictive in a multivariate model. Simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use was associated with increased substance-related problems in grade 11, above and beyond baseline problems and the concurrent use of the two substances in separate episodes in grade 10. Conclusions: Simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use 1) is anticipated by multiple psychosocial risk factors which come together with individual and peer substance use in early high school and 2) is independently predictive of subsequent substance-related problems. Providing adolescents with adequate information regarding the potential harm of {{simultaneous use}} may be a useful prevention strategy...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic Cannabinoids are {{a street}} drug that is widely {{attainable}} and cheap compared to natural cannabis, and has variable potency and unpredictable effects with no commercially available diagnostic test to confirm its presence. Similar to natural <b>cannabis,</b> Synthetic Cannabinoid <b>intoxication</b> can present {{in several ways}} with the most common emergency room presentations to be of neurologic and psychiatric manifestation. The respiratory depressive effect of Synthetic Cannabinoids has not been well documented in medical literature. We report four patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit with acute respiratory failure necessitating endotracheal intubation after use of Synthetic Cannabinoid. All patients had a reversal of respiratory failure in less than 24  h, three patients had a complicated course due to aspiration pneumonia. All four patients exhibited aggressive behavior, with two of them diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and Cocaine Use Disorder. The effect of Synthetic Cannabinoids in peripheral receptors such as chemoreceptors and baroreceptors can increase bronchial airway resistance. It is postulated that CB 1 receptor stimulation {{could be one of}} the possible mechanisms of synthetic cannabinoid-induced respiratory depression. Chemical gases released after its inhalation may also cause damage to the bronchiolar epithelium and has the potential to disrupt the protective surfactant layer in the alveoli, which then could interfere with effective gas exchange leading to hypoxia and acidosis. The stimulation of CB 1 receptors have a series of downstream signaling effects in the G protein-coupled pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, causing suppression of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. The aforementioned molecular changes in the central nervous system after CB 1 receptor stimulation could impact respiration. The use of Synthetic Cannabinoids can cause respiratory depression in individuals without an underlying pulmonary disease and adds to the growing number of literature about the presentation and debilitating adverse events from its consumption. Although there is no specific toxidrome associated with it, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion with its use especially in patients presenting with a history of drug overdose...|$|R

5000|$|THC, the {{principal}} psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has low toxicity. The dose of THC needed to kill 50% of tested rodents is extremely high.

Short-term <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> can hinder the mental processes of organizing and collecting thoughts. This condition is known as temporal disintegration. [...] Psychotic episodes are well-documented and typically resolve within minutes or hours. There have been few reports of symptoms lasting longer.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> {{is related}} {{to a number of}} {{physical}} and mental health risks with ensuing social costs. However, little attention has been given to the investigation of possible pharmacological interactions in this condition. Objective To review the available scientific literature concerning pharmacological interventions for the treatment of the acute effects of cannabis. Methods A search was performed on the Pubmed, Lilacs, and Scielo online databases by combining the terms <b>cannabis,</b> <b>intoxication,</b> psychosis, anxiety, and treatment. The articles selected from this search had their reference lists checked for additional publications related to the topic of the review. Results The reviewed articles consisted of case reports and controlled clinical trials and are presented according to interventions targeting the physiological, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms provoked by cannabis. The pharmacological interventions reported in these studies include: beta-blockers, antiarrhythmic agents, antagonists of CB- 1 and GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, antipsychotics, and cannabidiol. Conclusion Although scarce, the evidence on pharmacological interventions for the management of <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> suggests that propanolol and rimonabant are the most effective compounds currently available to treat the physiological and subjective effects of the drug. Further studies are necessary to establish the real effectiveness of these two medications, as well as the effectiveness of other candidate compounds to counteract the effects of <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication,</b> such as cannabidiol and flumazenil. </p...|$|E

40|$|Intoxication from {{cannabis}} impairs cognitive performance, in {{part due}} to the effects of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the primary psychoactive compound in cannabis) on prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. However, a relationship between impairment in cognitive functioning with THC administration and THC-induced change in hemodynamic response has not been demonstrated. We explored the feasibility of using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to examine the functional changes of the human PFC associated with <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> and cognitive impairment. Eighteen adult regular cannabis users (final sample, n = 13) performed a working memory task (n-back) during fNIRS recordings, before and after receiving a single dose of oral synthetic THC (dronabinol; 20 – 50 mg). Functional data were collected using a continuous-wave NIRS device, in which 8 Sources and 7 detectors were placed on the forehead, resulting in 20 channels covering PFC regions. Physiological changes and subjective intoxication measures were collected. We found {{a significant increase in the}} oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) concentration after THC administration in several channels on the PFC during both the high working memory load (2 -back) and the low working memory load (0 -back) condition. The increased HbO response was accompanied by a trend toward an increased number of omission errors after THC administration. The current study suggests that <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> is associated with increases in hemodynamic blood flow to the PFC, and that this increase can be detected with fNIRS...|$|E

40|$|Cannabis use {{history as}} {{predictor}} of neurocognitive response to <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> remains subject to scientific and policy debates. The present study assessed {{the influence of}} cannabis on neurocognition in cannabis users whose cannabis use history ranged from infrequent to daily use. Drug users (N = 122) received acute doses of cannabis (300 mug/kg THC), cocaine HCl (300 mg) and placebo. Cocaine served as active control for demonstrating neurocognitive test sensitivity. Executive function, impulse control, attention, psychomotor function and subjective intoxication were significantly worse after cannabis administration relative to placebo. Cocaine improved psychomotor function and attention, impaired impulse control and increased feelings of intoxication.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{association}} between cannabis use and frequent sexual risk behavior, we tested the hypothesis of a situational influence of cannabis use in sexual encounters {{using a combination of}} global association study and event-level analysis and examined possible mediator variables, including the personality trait of hedonism/risk preference, psychosocial stress, and HIV-related beliefs, using mediation models. The results of a computer-assisted telephone interview of a random sample of 2790 heterosexual men and women aged 16 - 24 years showed that risky sexual behavior was more frequent in cannabis-using men and women than in non-using persons. The results did not support a situational effect of <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> on sexual risk behavior. The more frequent sexual risk behavior among cannabis users was mediated by decreased intentions to use HIV protection, by lower HIV-self-efficacy, and higher risk preference/hedonism. Only among women psychosocial stress was a partial mediator.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether {{and to what}} extent acute <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> increases motor vehicle crash risk. Design: Study 1 replicates two published meta-analyses, correcting for methodological shortcomings. Study 2 is an updated meta-analysis using 28 estimates from 21 observational studies. These included studies from three earlier reviews, supplemented by results from structured search in Web of Science and Google Scholar, supplemented by the personal libraries of the research team. Risk estimates were combined using random effects models and meta-regression techniques. Setting: Study 1 replicates the analysis of Asbridge et al, based on 9 studies from 5 countries - published 1982 - 2007, and Li et al, based on 9 studies from 6 countries - published 2001 - 10. Study 2 involves studies from 13 countries published in the period 1982 - 2015. Participants: In Study 1, total counts extracted totalled 50 877 (27 967 cases, 22 910 controls) for Asbridge et al and 93 229 (4 236 cases and 88 993 controls) for Li et al. Study 2 used confounder-adjusted estimates where available (combined sample size of 222 511) and crude counts from the remainder (17 228 total counts), giving a combined sample count of 239 739. Measures: Odds-ratios were used from case-control studies and adjusted odds-ratio analogues from culpability studies. The impact of the substantial variation in confounder adjustment was explored in subsample analyses. Findings: Study 1 substantially revises previous risk estimates downwards, with both the originally reported point estimates lying outside the revised confidence interval. Revised estimates were similar to those of Study 2, which found cannabis-impaired driving associated with a statistically significant risk increase of low-to-moderate magnitude (random effects model odds ratio 1. 36 (1. 15 - 1. 61), meta-regression odds ratio 1. 22 (1. 1 - 1. 36)). Subsample analyses found higher odds-ratio estimates for case control studies, low study quality, limited control of confounders, medium quality use data, and not controlling for alcohol intoxication. Conclusions: Acute <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> is associated with a statistically significant increase in crash risk. The increase is of low to medium magnitude. Remaining selection effects in the studies used may limit causal interpretation of the pooled estimates...|$|E
40|$|Trait impulsivity {{has been}} linked to {{addiction}} in humans. It has been suggested that drug users with high trait impulsivity levels are more sensitive to subjective drug intoxication. This study assessed whether subjective response to drugs differs between drug users with normal or high levels of trait impulsivity. Regular drug users (N = 122) received doses of cocaine HCl, cannabis, and placebo in a three-way crossover study. Their mood, dissociative state, and psychedelic symptoms were measured with subjective rating scales (CADDS, Bowdle, POMS). Trait impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. Cannabis increased dissociation and psychedelic state, as well as fatigue, confusion, depression and anxiety, and decreased arousal, positive mood, vigor, friendliness, and elation. Cocaine increased dissociation, psychedelic state, vigor, friendliness, elation, positive mood, anxiety and arousal, while decreasing fatigue. Only a few subjective items revealed a drug x trait impulsivity interaction, suggesting that psychedelic symptoms were most intense in high impulsivity subjects. Trait impulsiveness ratings were negatively correlated with ratings of vigor (r = -. 197) and positively correlated with ratings of loss of thought control (r =. 237) during <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication.</b> It is concluded that a broad association between trait impulsivity and psychedelic subjective drug experience appears to be absent...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to gain more insight into the {{positive}} and negative effects of cannabis in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia and in the ultrahigh-risk (UHR) state for psychosis. Method: A theory-driven questionnaire was used to examine subjective effects in the prodromal phase in male subjects with a recent onset of schizophrenia or related disorder (n = 52) and in the UHR state in help-seeking male subjects screened for being at UHR for psychosis (n = 17); both groups were compared to cannabis-using controls from the general population (n = 52). Results: Recent-onset patients and UHR subjects reported feeling more anxious, depressed and suspicious immediately after cannabis use. Some patients also reported feeling less depressed after cannabis use. Recent-onset patients reported increased visual and acoustic hallucinations, and confusion after cannabis use. Of the recent-onset patients 37 % reported that their very first psychotic symptoms occurred during <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication.</b> Long-term effects of cannabis reported more often by both patient groups were depression, less control over thoughts and social problems. Conclusions: These results suggest that schizophrenia patients in the prodromal phase and subjects at UHR for psychosis are more sensitive to some negative effects of cannabis, in particular psychotic effects, compared to cannabis users from the general population. Although limited by the retrospective design in the recent-onset patients, the present study adds qualitative evidence to longitudinal studies that suggest that cannabis is a component cause in the onset of the first psychotic episode.

40|$|RATIONALE: Experimental {{laboratory}} {{studies suggest that}} the approach bias (relatively fast approach responses) toward substance-related materials {{plays an important role in}} problematic substance use. How this bias is moderated by intention to use versus recent use remains unknown. Moreover, the relationship between approach bias and other motivational processes (satiation and craving) and executive functioning remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the cannabis approach bias before and after cannabis use in real-life setting (Amsterdam coffee shops) and to assess the relationship between approach bias, craving, satiation, cannabis use, and response inhibition. METHODS: Cannabis, tobacco, and neutral approach and avoidance action tendencies were measured with the Approach Avoidance Task and compared between 42 heavy cannabis users with the intention to use and 45 heavy cannabis users shortly after cannabis use. The classical Stroop was used to measure response inhibition. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to investigate relationships between approach bias, satiation, craving, cannabis use, and response inhibition. RESULTS: In contrast to the hypotheses, heavy cannabis users with the intention to use did not show a cannabis approach bias, whereas intoxicated cannabis users did show an approach bias regardless of image category. This could be attributed to a general slowing of avoidance action tendencies. Moreover, craving was negatively associated with the approach bias, and no relationships were observed between the cannabis approach bias, satiation, prior cannabis use, and response inhibition.

MethodsFrom 2003 to 2013, data of all patients with STEMI aged < 35 years were retrospectively retrieved from our database. Baseline, procedural characteristics, and clinical outcome were analyzed. In 2013 we prospectly analyzed the causal lesion with a systematic coronary angiogram and a comparison between patients in whom an underlying atypical aetiology was found (non-ATS group; ATS: atherosclerosis) and patients in whom no such aetiology was detected (ATS group). ResultsA total of 98 young patients with STEMI aged < 35 years were admitted during the study period. They accounted for 1. 94 % of all STEMI admitted. Mean patient age was 28. 7 ± 4. 7 years and 93 patients (95 %) were men. Current smoking (77 %) and dyslipidaemia (43 %) were the most frequent risk factors. Typical chest pain (n = 90; 92 %) and inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (n= 67; 68 %) were most often found. <b>Cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> was the most frequently encountered atypical aetiology (n= 11; 11. 2 %).

40|$|Cannabis {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{recreational}} drugs. The rates of use and dosage, based on the levels of active compounds present in street drugs, is thought to be climbing in the UK and Europe; 40 % of 15 years olds in the UK are thought to have tried the drug. There is no dis-pute that <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> can cause brief psychotic episodes or short-term relapse of pre-existing psychotic symptoms (Negrete et al., 1986; Thornicroft, 1990; Mathers & Ghodse, 1992). More worryingly, during the past few years a number of studies have indicated that exposure to cannabis is associated with cognitive impair-ment and the risk (about two fold) of developing psy-chosis (Ashton, 2002; Iversen, 2003; Arseneault et al., 2004). It is quite surprising that it has taken more than fifteen years to produce public health interest in the association between one of the most widely used psychotropic drugs and one of the most devastating of mental illnesses. In 1987 Andreasson described an association between cannabis use and onset of psychosis (Andreasson et al., 1987). This landmark cohort-study of 45, 000 Swedish male conscripts (representing 97 percent of men age 18 - 20 in the population at that time) and a 15 -year follow up, found that heavy use of marijuana at age 18 increased the risk of schizophrenia later in life by six times. There was a dose-response relationship between cannabis use at age eighteen and schizophrenia diagnosis 15 years later. However only 3 % of conscripts heavy cannabis users went onto develop schizophrenia, suggesting that cannabis might exert its causal role only in already vul-nerable individuals...|$|E

RESULTADOS: O canabidiol demonstrou apresentar potencial terapêutico como antipsicótico, ansiolítico, antidepressivo e em diversas outras condições. O &# 916; 9 -tetraidrocanabinol e seus análogos demonstraram efeitos ansiolíticos, na dependência de cannabis, bem como adjuvantes no tratamento de esquizofrenia, apesar de ainda carecerem de mais estudos. O rimonabanto demonstrou eficácia no tratamento de sintomas subjetivos e fisiológicos da intoxicação pela cannabis e como adjuvante no tratamento do tabagismo. Os potenciais efeitos colaterais, de induzir depressão e ansiedade limitaram o uso clínico deste antagonista CB 1.

Estudos de neuroimagem funcional relatam aumento na atividade neural em regiões que podem estar relacionadas com intoxicação por cannabis e alteração do humor (lobos frontais mesial e orbital) e redução na atividade de regiões relacionadas com funções cognitivas prejudicadas durante a intoxicação aguda. A questão crucial se efeitos neurotóxicos residuais ocorrem após o uso prolongado e regular de maconha permanece obscura, não existindo até então estudo endereçando esta questão diretamente. Estudos de neuroimagem com melhores desenhos, combinados com avaliação cognitiva, podem ser elucidativos neste aspecto. Cannabis {{is the most}} widely used illicit drug. Despite this, {{only a small number of}} studies have investigated the long-term neurotoxic consequences of cannabis use. Structural and functional neuroimaging techniques are powerful research tools to investigate possible cannabis-induced pathophysiological changes. A computer literature review was conducted in the MEDLINE and PsycLIT databases between 1966 and November of 2004 with the search terms 'cannabis', 'marijuana', 'neuroimaging', 'magnetic resonance', 'computed tomography', 'positron emission tomography', 'single photon emission computed tomography", 'SPET', 'MRI' and 'CT'. Structural neuroimaging studies have yielded conflicting results. Most studies report no evidence of cerebral atrophy or regional changes in tissue volumes, and one study suggested that long-term users who started regular use on early adolescence have cerebral atrophy as well as reduction in gray matter. However, several methodological shortcomings limit the interpretation of these results. Functional neuroimaging studies have reported increases in neural activity in regions that may be related with <b>cannabis</b> <b>intoxication</b> or mood-change effects (orbital and mesial frontal lobes, insula, and anterior cingulate) and decreases in activity of regions related with cognitive functions impaired during acute intoxication. The important question whether residual neurotoxic effects occur after prolonged and regular use of cannabis remains unclear, with no study addressing this question directly. Better designed neuroimaging studies, combined with cognitive evaluation, may be elucidative on this issue...|$|E
