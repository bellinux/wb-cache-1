In our study, these characteristics were compared among brand name and generic <b>cataplasms</b> containing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; indomethacin (IM) (8 products), ketoprofen (KP) (7 products) and flurbiprofen (FP) (4 products)) using artificial sweat and the apparatus described in JP 14 Dissolution Test Method 2. For <b>cataplasms</b> containing IM and FP, {{the degree of}} swelling of generic products was {{less than that of}} brand name products but {{there was no significant difference}} in release rate. On the other hand, for KP-containing <b>cataplasms,</b> disintegration of the base material was observed for three of the four generic products tested, and all four had higher release rates than the brand name products. Thus, the drug release testing method used in the present study showed that the release and swelling characteristics differed between brand name and generic <b>cataplasms</b> and we felt that it was a useful way of evaluating their quality...|$|R

The individualized recovery programme focused on: isometric contractions, analytical active mobilisations of the non-affected segments, Trendelenburg positions, cryotherapy with antialgic decontracting role, massage, manual lymphatic drainage, ultrasounds and ionizations with anti-inflammatory and anti-sclerotic effect, orthotic therapy, application of wet <b>cataplasms</b> with Mg sulphate, passive, auto-passive, active exercise and active exercise with resistance, as well as facilitation techniques. The results achieved confirm the hypotheses formulated, and in conclusion we can state that the facilitation techniques, more exactly the repeated contractions (RC) and the active relaxation-opposition movement (AROM) are the basic methods during the first stage of the recovery of the peripheral motor neuron injuries, since only by using them can we induce the voluntary motor activity, and later increase the muscular strength, which lead to the improvement of the sensorial and the vascular-motor parameters and finally the patient recovers the functionality during the daily activities...|$|R

Peni had another touch of fever, and was forced to have a doctor and <b>cataplasms</b> to his feet. It was only a day's anxiety, but I didn't like writing just then. He had been in the sun or the wind or something. I was glad to get away from Rome. There were two cases of fever in our courtyard, and both the sun and the shade were suspectés. As far as Pen is concerned, the evil was averted, and I assure you he is looking in the full bloom of health, and we have been congratulated on all sides on his {{appearance}} and growth since we returned to Florence. Riding so much has agreed well with him; and the general results of the Roman campaign cannot be said to be otherwise than favourable. Set down as much for Robert. Everybody exclaims at his stoutness. In fact, never since I have known him has he condescended to put on such an air of robustness, there's no other word for it. Shall we give the glory to Rome, or to nux, to which he is constant. For two years and a half he has had recourse to no other remedy, and it has not yet failed to produce its effect.

It is not difficult to discern what sort of humanity our government is to learn from these Siren singers. Our government also; I admit, with some reason, as a step towards the proposed fraternity, is required to abjure the unjust hatred which it bears to this body of honor and virtue.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} Yiguanjian (YGJ) <b>cataplasm</b> {{on the development of}} opioid dependence in a mouse model of naloxone-induced opioid withdrawal syndrome. MethodsOne hundred Swiss albino mice, of equal male to female ratio, were randomly and equally divided into 10 groups. A portion (3 cm 2) of the backside hair of the mice was removed 1 day prior to the experiment. Morphine (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered twice daily for 5 days. YGJ <b>cataplasm</b> was prepared and pasted on the bare region of the mice immediately before morphine administration on day 3 and subsequently removed at the end day 5. On day 6, naloxone (8 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected to precipitate opioid withdrawal syndrome. Behavioral observation was performed in two 30 -min phases immediately after naloxone injection. ResultsThe YGJ <b>cataplasm</b> significantly and dose-dependently attenuated morphine-naloxone-induced experimental opioid withdrawal, in terms of withdrawal severity score and the frequencies of jumping, rearing, forepaw licking, and circling behaviors. However, YGJ <b>cataplasm</b> treatment did not alter the acute analgesic effect of morphine. ConclusionYGJ <b>cataplasm</b> could attenuate opioid dependence and its associated withdrawal symptoms.

40|$|Man has for a {{long time}} searched means of {{fighting}} pain, by administration of plant extracts such as poppy seed, jimson weed, henbane, mandrake and alcohol. These substances were given in the form of <b>cataplasms,</b> potions or clysters. Somniferous sponges, applied on the face, were known since Antiquity and have been in use in some countries up to the 13 th century. ~ Surgery and pain were inseparable till mid 19 th century. Indications for surgery were few, even though some patients could benefit from these sedative drugs. The anesthetic properties of ether and nitrous oxide (laughing gas), known since the 18 th century, were only recognized in the ~ 19 th century. William Morton, a dentist, was the first to successfully provide general anesthesia with ether in 1846 in Boston. News spread to England shortly afterwards. On the European continent, the first use of ether was due to 2 Belgian surgeons. Next came chloroform as novel anesthetic. They were administered via either a gauze or a mask by the general practitioner, a medical student or a nurse. Unlike England, the use of these drugs for obstetrical anesthesia (called anesthesia "à la reine", alluding to Queen Victoria who benefited from chloroform during childbirth) was never very popular in Belgium. Since the years 1880, the use of cocaine, then of novocaine allowed to perform local anesthesia, then local nerve blocks and spinal anesthesia, installed by the surgeon prior to operating. Since then, surgery experienced rapid progress, Belgium included. During the 1914 - 1918 first World War, these advances saved many human lives. When general anesthesia was necessary, it was cared for by another physician or a nurse. The interwar period did not see significant advances in anesthesia, except in intravenous anesthesia with barbiturates, appeared in the late 1930 's. Intra- and postoperative complications were frequent. Apart from sulfonamides, antibiotics were non-existent. During the war 1940 - 45, there was no progress in anesthesia and surgery in Belgium. After the Liberation, Belgian doctors specifically trained in anesthesia by the British army, or elsewhere in non-occupied countries, will form the core of a new specialty, "anesthesiology-reanimation", ~who will fight to be recognized as a specialty in itself in Belgium. It will beneficiate from - and largely contribute to - the technical and scientific advances in the medical field. Initially based on clinical symptoms, monitoring and care of operated patients, during and after operation, will beneficiate from modern monitoring and other technical apparatus, which will allow the most audacious surgical technical performances in all domains. Postoperative and intensive care units ~will appear in the years 1960 's. Nowadays, anesthesiologists work in all hospital settings, and also organize One-day clinics and Pain clinics. In Belgium, the quality of the clinical and scientific training of anesthesiologists is widely acknowledged, as well as clinical and experimental research.

At 30 days, we evaluated the animal bone regeneration through both qualitative macroscopic analysis of the fracture focus as by determination of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP). The evolution of bone repair has been verified at 30 and 45 days through the histological analysis. No significant difference in ALP levels was observed between groups. In addition, no allergic reactions or impairment of tissue adjacent to the fracture focus were seen in any of the groups. In contrast, although all groups exhibited similar tissue architecture, the histological analysis revealed greater formation of mature bone tissue in MZG at 30 days, when compared to DG and control group. In addition, higher collagen fiber density was observed in MZG at 45 days. These results indicate Chenopodium ambrosioides as a promising therapeutic agent for bone regeneration.
