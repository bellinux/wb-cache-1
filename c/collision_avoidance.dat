5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> System (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> system in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> system was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E
5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, the NTSB also recommended that the Department of Defense restrict high-speed, low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian air corridors, consider <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> technologies on military aircraft, and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|E

While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E

Although there has been substantial work in this context, automation has been limited to only transporting a few objects at a time, particularly while ensuring <b>collision</b> <b>avoidances</b> with other freely diffusing objects in the workspace. In this paper, we provide {{the first step in}} addressing this limitation by developing a new algorithm that combines a model predictive controller with a fast grid search-based path planning method.

5|$|The NTSB {{added that}} {{the design of the}} Embraer's {{avionics}} is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. The NTSB noted:Using only static text messages to indicate a loss of <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> system functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) was {{conducted}} to evolve the F-16's capabilities, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure the aircraft's worth. The program upgraded the F-16 in three stages. The MSIP process permitted the quick introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs and with reduced risks compared to traditional independent upgrade programs. In 2012, the USAF had allocated $2.8 billion to upgrade 350 F-16s {{while waiting for the}} F-35 to enter service. One key upgrade has been an auto-GCAS (Ground <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> system) to reduce instances of controlled flight into terrain. Onboard power and cooling capacities limits the scope of upgrades, which often involves the addition of more power-hungry avionics.|$|E

40|$|We derive a {{hierarchy}} of kinetic and macroscopic models from a noisy variant of the heuristic behavioral Individual-Based Model of Moussaid et al, PNAS 2011, where the pedestrians {{are supposed to have}} constant speeds. This IBM supposes that the pedestrians seek the best compromise between navigation towards their target and <b>collisions</b> <b>avoidance.</b> We first propose a kinetic model for the probability distribution function of the pedestrians. Then, we derive fluid models and propose three different closure relations. The first two closures assume that the velocity distribution functions are either a Dirac delta or a von Mises-Fisher distribution respectively. The third closure results from a hydrodynamic limit associated to a Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium. We develop an analogy between this equilibrium and Nash equilibia in a game theoretic framework. In each case, we discuss the features of the models and their suitability for practical use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} {{coordinating}} construction vehicles in formations is tackled using the {{particle swarm optimization}} algorithm. Coordinated multi-vehicles are anticipated to outperform single vehicles in terms of economy and flexibility. A possible approach is to apply control theoretic methods to vehicle coordination but this may require complicated system models to be employed. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm adopted in this work, as an evolutionary computation based methodology, is able to provide a near-optimal solution {{without the need for}} a precise system model. The control commands for the vehicles are treated as particles in a swarm and a sequence of controls is derived to achieve the desired formation. With regard to inter-vehicle <b>collision</b> <b>avoidances,</b> behaviour-based control strategies are incorporated into the formation framework. Simulations for multi-vehicle formation in a construction site scenario are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{efficient}} traffic allocation technique and a slotted delay-sensitive WDMA protocol suitable for ring metropolitan area networks is proposed. Our {{purpose is to}} improve the limited bandwidth utilization that many WDMA protocols for MANs introduce, especially at high loads.

Thus, we obtain not only dropping probability and delay reduction, but also significant throughput enhancement. The required number of buffers per node to maximize throughput is investigated. Performance evaluation is provided by a discrete event simulation model based on self-similar traffic. Comparative results prove that the proposed architecture manages efficient bandwidth utilization as compared with other WDMA protocols, especially under high loads...|$|R
