40|$|Abstract. The {{squirrel}} <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> (Pallas) (Rodentia: Sciuridae) was intentionally {{introduced to}} Japan in 1935 {{and has become}} established {{throughout much of the}} country. Although they live mainly in forests, Pallas squirrels come into gardens and are frequently fed by people or kept as pets, so their ectoparasites could be of potential medical as well as veterinary importance. During 2001 – 2003 we conducted the first ectoparasite survey of Pallas squirrels in Japan. From 105 C. erythraeus captured in Kamakura District of Kanagawa Prefecture on Honshu Island, three types of ectoparasite were found: 52 specimens of the sucking louse Neohaematopinus callosciuri Johnson (Anoplura: Haematopinidae), 26 fleas Ceratophyllus (Monopsyllus) anisus Rothschild (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae) and four nymphs of the tick Haemaphysalis flava Neumann (Acari: Ixodidae) on 22, 13 and one squirrels, respectively. Evidently in Japan C. erythraeus carries relatively few ectoparasite species; this may be a contributory factor to their invasive success. Further investigations are needed to assess risks of zoonotic transmission of plague or murine typhus by C. anisus, of louse-borne typhus by N. callosciuri and of tularaemia and especially Japanese spotted fever (Rickettsia japonica) by H. flava.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the macroparasite fauna of Pallas's squirrel, <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus,</b> native to SE Asia, recently introduced to Italy and co-occurring with the native Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris. A total of 161 Pallas's squirrels harboured a poor macroparasite fauna, characterized by two main ectoparasite species, the flea Ceratophyllus (M.) sciurorum sciurorum (prevalence 50 %, mean intensity 1. 0 ± 0. 1) and the tick Ixodes ricinus (prevalence 47 %, mean intensity 3. 0 ± 0. 7), and a few helminths (Rodentoxyuris sciuri, Trichuris muris, Strongyloides callosciureus) all with prevalence below 10 %. All parasites, except S. Callosciureus, are native to Europe and were acquired in the invaded range. The loss of native parasites might have contributed to their successful invasion. The acquisition of local parasites C. Sciurorum and Trichuris sciuri, and the introduction of the Asiatic nematode S. Callosciureus may lead to spill-back and spill-over processes towards red squirrels...|$|E
40|$|The Formosan red-bellied tree {{squirrel}} (<b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus.)</b> is a pest {{animal that}} causes serious damage to many conifer plantations in Taiwan. Poisoning {{has been the}} major means to control the damage. The feasibility of forestry control through habitat manipulation has been evaluated during the past 5 years. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of forest-tending operations on the activity and damage by squirrels. Forest-tending conducted included weeding and thinning. Test sites were at three Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations located in Chitou. The results of this study revealed that squirrel activity in the treated plots was greatly reduced. It was found that new damage done by the squirrels in treated areas was also reduced. This was particularly significant during an abnormal weather period when there was a continual rainstorm lasting for about 3 months. The treatments of weeding and thinning showed more significant effects on the reduction of squirrel activity than the reduction in the occurrence of new damages...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} origin of <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> {{introduced}} to Japan, we compared mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of eight haplotypes from Japan with those of 42 haplotypes from Taiwan. There were two distinct phylogroups in Japan. Six haplotypes from Japan {{were included in the}} Taiwan population, suggesting that they could have been introduced from Taiwan. Two haplotypes, however, were distantly related to the cluster consisting of all Taiwanese haplotypes and six Japanese haplotypes. The uncorrected genetic distances (5. 2 - 5. 7 %) between these two haplotypes and the out-group (Callosciurus finlaysonii from Laos) were less than those (8. 3 - 9. 8 %) between these two haplotypes and the cluster consisting of the other six Japanese haplotypes and all Taiwanese haplotypes. Both C. erythraeus and C. finlaysonii have variable external characteristics, such as pelage color, and include many variable subspecific forms, so {{that it is difficult to}} evidently identify both species on the basis of their external characteristics. Callosciurus finlaysonii may have been also introduced in Japan with both species now coexisting in Japan. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|When {{alien species}} {{introduced}} {{into a new}} environment have a strong niche overlap with ecologically similar native species, interspecific competition can cause a decrease in abundance and distribution of native species. Pallas’s squirrel (<b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus)</b> was introduced in Northern Italy where it currently co-occurs with native Eurasian red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). The alien species {{is known for its}} invasiveness but so far negative effects of Pallas’s squirrels on native tree squirrels have not been demonstrated. Here, we compare demographic parameters of red squirrel populations between sites without (red-only sites) and with (red-Pallas’s sites) C. erythraeus and present results of trapping and removal of Pallas’s squirrel and its effects on red squirrel population dynamics. The native species was patchily distributed and absent in many trapping sites occupied by the Pallas’s squirrel. Red squirrels occurred at much lower densities and showed reduced adult survival in areas of co-occurrence than in red-only sites, but there were no differences in reproductive rate. Removing invasive squirrels throughout the study period resulted in re-colonisation by the native species only in some trapping sites, and several alternatives to explain the lack of a marked increase in population size are discussed. This study is the first to provide evidence that presence of Pallas’s squirrel reduces viability of local red squirrel populations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{techniques to}} maximize trap efficiency and minimize trapping effort when using live traps {{to capture the}} invasive alien Pallas’s squirrel (<b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus),</b> which was introduced in Italy near the Swiss borders. We explored the effects of time of day, season, number of checks in the capture session and type of live trap (single or multi-capture). Moreover, the vegetation around traps (characteristics of the tree supporting the trap, vegetation growth, vegetation cover, vegetation richness and similarity index) was tested. Squirrels were caught more frequently in the morning, but trapping success was not affected {{by the type of}} trap used. Squirrel trap response varied significantly in relation to the season, and a higher trapping success in the first days of the trapping session suggests the importance of prebaiting. We reject the hypothesis that vegetation around traps affected the capture success of Pallas’s squirrel in deciduous forests. Thus, recommendations to improve the trapping efficiency of this species are to (1) use single capture live traps with at least one week of prebaiting, (2) increase the capture effort in winter and (3) set traps where access is easy and where there are signs of high activity of individuals of the alien species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:  Spotted fever {{caused by}} spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) is found {{throughout}} China. During 2007 – 2008, 28 human SFGR isolates and 34 rat SFGR isolates including 15 isolates from Rattus fulvescens, 5 isolates from R. edwardsi, 7 isolates from <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> roberti and 7 isolates from Dremomys rufigenis) {{were obtained from}} L 929 cell culture. Previous research indicated that the 62 strains of SFGR mentioned above shared not only the same serophenotype but also 100 % of identity sequences of 16 S rRNA, gltA, ompA, groEL and 17 KD, which enabled us to apply multispacer typing (MST) to the 62 SFGR isolates in the study. Six primer pairs, which were used for typing of Rickettsia rickettsii and Rickettsia conorii, were chosen, and the results exhibited greater nucleotide polymorphisms among the 62 isolates tested. A total of 48 distinct genotypes were identified. The dominant genotype, represented by h 3 isolates, accounted for 21. 7 % (13 / 60) of the isolates tested, and the remaining 47 genotypes were all unique. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all the 48 genotypes could be classified in the same clade, while the genetically related strain, R. heilongjiangensis, was close but {{not the same as}} the cluster. We concluded that the genetically diverse of spotted fever group rickettsiae strains are endemic i...|$|E
40|$|Although mammals are a well-studied {{group of}} animals, making {{accurate}} field identification of small mammals is still complex because of morphological variation across developmental stages, color variation of pelages, and often damaged osteological and dental characteristics. In 2008, small mammals were collected for an epidemiological {{study of a}} spotted fever outbreak in Hainan, China. Ten species of small mammals were identified by morphological characters in the field, most using pelage color characters only. The study is extended here, {{in order to assess}} whether DNA barcoding would be suitable as an identification tool in these small mammals. Barcode clusters showed some incongruence with morphospecies, especially for some species of Rattus and Niviventer, so molecular delineation was carried out with an expanded dataset of combined cytochrome b (Cyt-b) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences. COI sequences were successfully amplified from 83 % of collected mammals, but failed in all specimens of Suncus murinus, which were thus excluded in DNA barcoding analysis. Of note, ten molecular taxonomic units were found from samples of nine morphologically identified species. Accordingly, 11 species of small mammals were present in the investigated areas, including four Rattus species, three Niviventer species, <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus,</b> Neohylomys hainanensis, Tupaia belangeri, and Suncus murinus. Based on the results of the phylogenetic and molecular delineation analyses, the systematic status of som...|$|E
40|$|Extensive forest {{conversion}} of the low-valued natural hardwood forest into coniferous plantations is the possible cause of the critical problem of squirrel debarking. The tree squirrel that causes the major damage is the red-bellied tree squirrel (<b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus).</b> Conifers {{are more susceptible to}} the damage than are hardwood species, especially the exotics. Intermediate-aged plantations appear to have the highest debarking. More damage occurs in the spring than the other seasons. The lower part of the trunk is more heavily debarked than the upper. Debarking is progressively upward to the crown as the tree grows older. Home range, food habit and behavior of the red-bellied tree squirrel are under intensive study and some preliminary results have been obtained. Selection of tree species less susceptible to squirrel debarking has been a main step to control the damage. Intensive weeding and thinning may reduce much of the squirrel preferred habitat and therefore reduce damage. Leaving any natural hardwood forest within or adjacent to the coniferous plantations may provide squirrels with a more attractive cover and food supply. A rice-paraffin bait block of warfarin has been used to poison them with some success. But laboratory studies show klerat (brodifacoum) has a faster lethal efficacy than warfarin. Application of baits and other trapping methods to control squirrel populations need more study and evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Scented nectar {{secreted}} by flowers is {{an interesting}} natural phenomenon in angiosperms that is often overlooked by most researchers. Scented nectar is an evolutionary feature coupling the behavior between flower-visitors and their rewards. The effect of scented nectar on pollinator or nectar-thief is a scientific problem which deserves further exploration. We evaluated Mucuna sempervirens flowering dynamics, floral nectar volatiles, behaviors of Dremomys pernyi and <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> to inflorescence opening, nectar’s attraction effect to Apis cerana cerana, and the toxic effect of M. sempervirens nectar to Tapinoma sp. Aliphatic compounds (87. 2 %) were the main volatiles in nectar of M. sempervirens, whereasketones accounted for 56. 1 % of the total volatiles. Lastly, volatile components with sulfur elements were absent from nectar samples. Previous studies of bat pollinated plant species have found that plants in the genus Mucuna always release sulfur compounds. Additionally, {{we found that the}} nectar of M. sempervirens was poisonous to Tapinoma sp. ant species, whereas it attracted A. cerana cerana using the Y olfactory bioassay. Squirrel species (D. pernyi and C. erythraeus) were effective pollinators of M. sempervirens, so we suspected that M. sempervirens might not be pollinated by bats only. This study provides data of pollination mechanisms in Mucuna and provides a new perspective of composition and function study of nectar in other plant groups in future...|$|E
40|$|Introduced {{species may}} lose their natural parasites when invading a new habitat, may acquire new, local parasites or may {{introduce}} parasites from their native range. We studied the gastro-intestinal helminth fauna {{associated with the}} red-bellied squirrel <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> (Pallas, 1778) introduced in Argentina to evaluate {{its role as a}} host of either specific or acquired parasites in two invasion foci. We analyzed entire digestive tracts of 72 red-bellied squirrels captured in the main invasion focus (Luján, province of Buenos Aires) between February and May 2011, and in a secondary focus (Cañada de Gómez, province of Santa Fe) in December 2008. We only found two nematode specimens: an adult male belonging to the genus Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) Quentin, 1969 and another adult male belonging to the genus Stilestrongylus (Freitas, Lent and Almeida, 1973). None of these genera were previously listed for the red-bellied squirrel in introduced areas, but a species of the genus Pterygodermatites was previously reported for this squirrel in its native habitat. These results indicate that, to date, the red-bellied squirrel in Argentina is accidentally parasitised by nematodes acquired in its new environment and has no specific gastro-intestinal helminths. This could be related with a "founder effect" and/or the lack of sciurid rodents that prevent the red-bellied squirrel to be colonized by pre-adapted helminth taxa. Other factors that may play a role are the small number of mammals with arboreal habits and some "encounter barriers" in the new environment that prevent the acquisition of helminths with a wide host spectrum.

40|$|Using acorns from Castanea henryi (CH) and Quercus variabilis (QV) with {{contrasting}} germination schedule (related to food perishability) and tannin levels, {{we conducted}} field experiments in a subtropical forest in Southwest China to investigate how free-ranging Pallas's squirrels (<b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus)</b> utilize acorns as long-term storage {{based on the}} food perishability and high-tannin hypotheses. Though QV acorns germinated much earlier than CH ones, we found that Pallas's squirrels hoarded more high-tannin QV acorns over low-tannin CH ones, supporting the high-tannin hypothesis (but not the food perishability hypothesis). However, several other predictions derived from the food perishability hypothesis received sound support: nondormant QV acorns had their embryos removed with a higher probability (68. 5 %) than dormant CH ones (8. 8 %) and embryo-removed acorns had a much lower germination success but had a higher probability surviving as long-term storage. During the caching-recovery process, hoarding animals actively detected acorn state (dormant or not) and removed acorn embryos with an increasing probability in subsequent hoarding events. In addition, embryo-removed acorns could serve as long-term storage {{because they had a}} very low probability being infested by fungi as intact acorns did during the time of storage. We conclude that tree squirrels can differentially respond to acorn germination and remove the embryos of nondormant acorns more frequently as long-term storage, but tannin level is more important in determining whether a given acorn is hoarded or not. Combined with the studies from North America, our results suggest convergent evolution of acorn hoarding behavior in tree squirrels across different continents.

40|$|Biological invasions {{are one of}} {{the major}} threats to both {{ecosystem}} and economic functioning. Their management typically involves culling of the pest or removal of its habitat. The Asiatic red-bellied beautiful squirrel <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> is the first known introduction of a squirrel into South America. It established from five releases in 1973, using exotic trees to spread through Argentinean Pampas. It now causes substantial economic damage in agricultural and urban areas across > 680 km 2, and its continued spread threatens indigenous species. We developed a spatially explicit model of the invasion for the likely range of life-history parameters, matched against empirical data on patch occupancy in 2004. The two best-fitting models suggest the current population to be on the cusp of an explosive expansion. These models were used to predict future trends under alternative scenarios of strategic culling or habitat removal aimed at slowing the spread. The predictions for 18 yr into the future were that 1) the present lack of systematic management will lead to a 5 -fold increase in area of occupancy, 2) removal of habitat down to half carrying capacity will thin the population but accelerate its spread, 3) 10 yr of culling above the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) will precipitate declines in abundance and patch occupancy towards extinction, but with immediate recovery upon cessation of the cull. We recommend continuous culling above the MSY in priority patches, aimed at slowing arrival to valuable conservation areas. This study demonstrates the need for prompt action to terminate invasions before they establish. The squirrel invasion is now irreversible after 30 yr of slow spread across fragmented habitat. Although culling requires public awareness campaigns and sustained governmental commitment, it is now the best feasible strategy for managing this invasion...|$|E
40|$|In {{invasion}} ecology, reliable {{measures of}} female fecundity {{are necessary to}} infer population growth rate and develop control programs to determine the proportion of animals that should be culled to reduce population size. Here, we present a reliable staining technique of uterine scars to determine individual fecundity {{in terms of both}} seasonal and total (annual) number of young born per female. We applied this method to two alien squirrels species (grey squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis and Pallas’s squirrel, <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus)</b> introduced in Northern Italy, obtaining carcasses from control campaigns from 2011 to 2013. We also investigated environmental and phenotypic variables that might affect individual variation in fecundity and compared annual reproductive output between the two species. For grey squirrels (n= 44), 25 % of examined females produced a single litter and 61 % two litters. Females which reproduced in both seasons tended to have larger summer than spring litters (on average 2. 61 and 1. 94 offspring, respectively) and mean annual fecundity was 3. 4 scars/female ranging from 1 to 8 births. There was no effect of year, eye lens weight, body size or body mass on total fecundity. For Pallas’s squirrel (n= 31), 58 % of females had a spring litter, some of these also produced a summer litter (35 %) and a few even a third litter in autumn (10 %). Heavier and older females (higher eye lens weight) had more uterine scars than younger animals with lower body mass. Finally, fecundity of the two IAS in Italy was similar or even higher than in the native range and/or in other countries of introduction, suggesting they are well adapted to their new environment and potentially have a high capacity to spread and recover after reduction of population size...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of an exotic species usually modifies parasite–host dynamics by {{the import of}} new parasites or the exotic species' acquiral of local parasites. The loss of parasites may determine the outcome of an invasion if the introduced species is liberated from co-evolved parasites in its range of invasion. In addition, an introduced species may pose sanitary risks to humans and other mammals if {{it serves as a}} reservoir of pathogens or carries arthropod vectors. The red-bellied squirrel, <b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus</b> (Pallas) (Rodentia: Sciuridae), was introduced into Argentina in 1970, since when several foci of invasion have been closely associated with humans. Investigation of the parasitological fauna of C. erythraeus in Argentina will generate new information about novel parasite–host dynamics and may provide new insight into the reasons for the successful invasion of this species. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the arthropod parasites of C. erythraeus in Argentina in comparison with previous studies of parasites of this species in its native habitat and in the ranges of its invasion. Occasional host–parasite associations with local arthropod parasites not previously described for C. erythraeus are reported; these include the mites Androlaelaps fahrenholzi (Ewing) (Mesostigmata: Laelapidae) and Ornithonyssus cf. bacoti (Mesostigmata: Macronyssidae), the flea Polygenis (Polygenis) rimatus Jordan (Siphonaptera: Rhopalopsyllidae) and the botfly Cuterebra Clark (Diptera: Oestridae: Cuterebrinae). Cheyletus sp. mites (Trombidiformes: Cheyletidae) were also found. The low prevalence and mean intensity of ectoparasite species may influence invasion dynamics. Fil: Gozzi, A.

40|$|The {{introduction}} and spread of {{invasive alien species}} (IAS) constitutes {{one of the most}} important drivers of global change in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Robust risk assessment methods are required for IAS to provide the foundation upon which to prioritise appropriate action. In a previous study (Roy, Schonrogge et al. 2014) minimum standards were developed to provide an assessment framework for risk assessments and ultimately for underpinning the development of a proposed list of “IAS of EU concern”, in accordance to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 1143 / 2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 on the prevention and management of the {{introduction and}} spread of invasive alien species. In practice, of the protocols assessed in detail, only four (GB NNRA, EPPO DSS, Harmonia+ and ENSARS) were sufficiently compliant with the minimum standards to be considered and of these only the GB NNRA and EPPO DSS have published IAS risk assessments. As a result, using the information from such “substantially compliant” protocols, a draft list of approximately 50 species was compiled. It is important to note that this list of species is based on availability of robust risk assessments already completed through methods which are almost compliant with the minimum standards, and it does not constitute the list of “IAS of EU concern”. In view of the application of the forthcoming EU Regulation on IAS (and building-on ENV. B. 2 /ETU/ 2013 / 0026) the Commission hosted a 2 -day scientific workshop to examine the selected risk assessments and pool the existing knowledge existing in the EU to complete the missing information, on the basis of robust scientific evidence, in order to make them fully compliant with the minimum standards, wherever possible. The workshop was led by Helen Roy (CEH) and Riccardo Scalera (ISSG). An additional 16 experts from fifteen member states were selected based on their expertise in invasion biology and represented a breadth of expertise from a variety of perspectives including taxonomic (all taxa), environmental (freshwater, marine and terrestrial), impacts (environmental, socio-economic and health) and disciplines (ecologists, conservation practitioners, scientists, policy-makers, risk assessors). In view of the gaps across risk assessments for ecosystem services and climate change two experts were invited to guide the development of approaches for these specific themes. In total the risk assessments for 56 species were considered. The GB NNRA and EPPO DSS have published IAS risk assessments which, when considering species that score medium to high impact, together cover 51 species (noting that Fallopia japonica and F. sachalinensis are separate species). Two further risk assessments were suggested for consideration by the GB Non-Native Species Secretariat which follow the GB NNRA protocol: coati (Nasua nasua) and skunk (Mephitis mephitis), although scored as low impact. Finally an additional three species have been considered through new European–wide risk assessments, with the reported outcome of high impact, for this project which again follow the GB NNRA protocol: Pallas squirrel (<b>Callosciurus</b> <b>erythraeus),</b> grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and coypu (Myocastor coypus). The main gaps across all risk assessments were in relation to climate change and ecosystem services but additional information was also required on benefits as mentioned with minimum standard “Description (Taxonomy, invasion history, distribution range (native and introduced), geographic scope, socio-economic benefits) ” and in some cases information to support the minimum standard “Includes status (threatened or protected) of species or habitat under threat“ was missing. It was agreed that systematic consideration of a list of questions in relation to the minimum standards on ecosystem services and climate change would be useful guidance for experts. An outline of the approaches agreed through the workshop for the minimum standards “Includes possible effects of climate change in the foreseeable future“ and “Can broadly assess environmental impact with respect to ecosystem services” were developed as guidance for documenting information in relation to climate change and ecosystem services. Each species was considered separately with the experts providing an overview of the information available for addressing the identified gaps. After all species had been considered the workshop participants (excluding the EC, Helen Roy and Riccardo Scalera) adopted a consensus approach to confirm whether or not the risk assessment was compliant with the minimum standards and whether the overall score of the risk assessment remained applicable. No changes were made to the scores but any recommendations were noted. There were very few recommendations for change. The outcome for each risk assessment was agreed and summarised as “compliant” or “not compliant” with the minimum standards. Of the risk assessments for the 56 species considered through this project, 53 were agreed to be fully compliant with the minimum standards. However, Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, although compliant with the minimum standards should be excluded as it is not within the scope of the regulation (see art 2. e) because it is listed in annex IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 708 / 2007 of 11 June 2007 concerning use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture. Four of the risk assessments were not considered to be compliant because of major information gaps: Elodea canadensis (Canadian pondweed), Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed), M. mephitis (skunk), N. nasua (coati) ...|$|E
