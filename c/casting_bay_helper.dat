50|$|The {{molten metal}} had alloys added, then sampled and after {{satisfactory}} laboratory checks {{of the metal}} composition the furnaces were tapped out into preheated bottom pouring ladles holding some 20 tons. The ladles were manoeuvred by overhead crane into the <b>casting</b> <b>bays</b> over several ceramic runner systems each feeding six preheated one-ton ingot moulds. After cooling the ingot moulds were stripped of the still hot ingots and taken to the ingot yard. In the 1950s the transport from the Open Hearth <b>Casting</b> <b>Bays</b> to the ingot yard was by steam lorry, or on the internal steam railway system. As of 2016, a fully restored original example {{of one of the}} steam lorries carrying the Brown Bayley livery {{can be found at the}} Riverside Museum in Glasgow.|$|R

Although larger castings were made by mixing metal from all the sources these were machined and finished outside.

Following World War II a new laboratory block was added adjacent to the Sheffield Road entrance. This comprised facilities for Chemical Analysis, Physical Testing, Non-Destructive Testing, Mechanical Testing and Metallography. This facility also had its own small machine shop, for making mechanical test pieces, and a reference library / conference facility.|$|R
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{experimented with}} {{numerous}} robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers {{to form the}} final <b>cast.</b> <b>Bay</b> acknowledged {{that most of the}} Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.|$|R

[...] "Here is a brocade, whose fellow is worn openly {{in the presence}} of our royal mistress, though it came from the forbidden looms of Italy; and the ladies of the court return from patriotically dancing, in the fabrics of home, to please the public eye, once in the year, to wear these more agreeable inventions, all the rest of it, to please themselves. Tell me, why does the Englishman, with his pale sun, spend thousands to force a sickly imitation of the gifts of the tropics, but because he pines for forbidden fruit? or why does your Paris gourmand roll a fig on his tongue, that a Lazzarone of Naples would <b>cast</b> into his <b>bay,</b> but because he wishes to enjoy the bounties of a low latitude, under a watery sky? I have seen an individual feast on the eau sucre of an European pine, that cost a guinea, while his palate would have refused the same fruit, with its delicious compound of acid and sweet, mellowed to ripeness under a burning sun, merely because he could have it for nothing. This is the secret of our patronage; and as the sex are most liable to its influence, we owe them most gratitude." ...|$|R
50|$|The Art Deco-inspired front {{elevation}} {{of the church is}} the key feature introduced as part of GB Gill's 1938 refurbishment and is made up of a series of engaged piers forming a parapet wall to the main face of the church and repeated in style on its porch. The detailing of the larger piers at each end and framing the centre, along with the smaller piers in the bays created by these, emphasises verticality, as well as solidity. The pattern of render is smooth for the piers and other built-up details, and rough <b>cast</b> in the <b>bays.</b> Double, glass-panelled entrance doors, approached by a flight of concrete steps from the footpath, provide access through the porch. A stained timber Latin cross is fixed to exterior of the door mullions. Tall, narrow windows with no arch at their heads and filled with coloured lead lights, open either side of the porch. Above it, as well in each porch side wall, there are shorter windows of otherwise similar dimensions. The central one is filled with fixed louvres. A set of stained timber, double doors open from the porch into the interior. These are high-waisted with coloured leadlight windows set into each top panel, the design of which features a narrow border, green background lights and a central arrow and torch motif. This patterning is extant in many of the early windows facing Brisbane Street.|$|R
