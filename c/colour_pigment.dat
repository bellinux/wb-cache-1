Unfortunately, many thermoplastic materials contain <b>colour</b> <b>pigments</b> that cause undesired colour effects and, therefore, have to be removed before recycling. The {{purpose of this study}} was to reduce the inorganic <b>colour</b> <b>pigments</b> titanium dioxide, chromium(III) oxide and iron(III) oxide from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. Based on experiences with dissolution-based polymer recycling, the two methods for removing these <b>colour</b> <b>pigments</b> studied in this project were filtration and centrifugation. Multiple laboratory-scale experiments were performed with two solvent formulations, acetone and CreaSolv® SB. Using the filtration method, both solvent formulations achieved reduction rates of 80 % for titanium and iron and 90 % for chromium. While similar reduction rates were obtained with high-speed laboratory-type centrifuges for acetone solutions, the results for CreaSolv® SB solutions were considerably lower under the same experimental conditions. Increasing the temperature or centrifugation speed, however, will also increase the reduction rates. Thereby, CreaSolv® SB solutions become suitable for industrial-scale processes. This is important because industrial processes based on CreaSolv® SB solutions are significantly safer than acetone-based processes...|$|R
50|$|Rage {{syndrome}} {{is most often}} associated with the Show Cocker Spaniel breed, although cases {{have been found in}} other breeds and cases are relatively rare even within the Cocker Spaniel breed. Rage Syndrome is described as when a dog attacks suddenly and often savagely, without any warning and during the attack the dog often has a glazed look and appears to be unaware of its surroundings. Rage Syndrome can affect any and all breeds. Though not a common ailment, studies have found it is more common in solid coloured Cockers than in particolours and also more common in darker coloured Cockers than lighter coloured Cockers, being most common in solid gold and black coloured spaniels. Their health issues are typical for a purebred dog breed; however they are closely associated with rage syndrome even though cases are really quite rare. Rage syndrome cannot be accurately predicted and can only be diagnosed by EEG or genetic testing and these tests are not conclusive.A link between coat colour and temperament has been proposed. This link could be the <b>colour</b> <b>pigment</b> melanin, which is biochemically similar to chemicals that act as transmitters in the brain. A study made by the University of Cambridge involving over 1,000 Cocker Spaniel households throughout Britain concluded that solid colour Cockers {{were more likely to be}} aggressive in 12 out of 13 situations. Red/golden Cockers were shown to be the most aggressive of all, in situations involving strangers, family members, while being disciplined, and sometimes for no apparent reason. A study by Spanish researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona revealed a similar link between golden Cockers and aggression. Males were also more likely to be aggressive. The study found the English Cocker Spaniel to have the highest level of owner- and stranger- directed aggression compared to other breeds.|$|E

The goats were slaughtered at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 kg liveweights. Half of the goats were castrated and half were left as intact animals. The quality profiles of meat (e. g. pH, <b>colour,</b> <b>pigment</b> concentrations, cooking loss, shear force value and eating quality of cooked meat) from both castrated and intact feral goats started to decrease when animals were slaughtered at heavier liveweights (e. g. above 40 kg). The nutritive value of the meat (chemical compositions, fatty acids and total cholesterol concentrations) changed when animals were castrated and had heavier slaughter weights. Overall, we recommend that 40 kg liveweight is the heaviest slaughter weight, since the quality characteristics of meat will be lower when feral goats were slaughtered above 40 kg liveweight...|$|E

All the analysed results will be used in the next study for the production of new food colouring material. From the observation, it shows that S 3 flower developmental stage contains the highest anthocyanin concentration. Simple linear regression method was used to find the significant level correlating the anthocyanin concentration and storage time. Throughout the whole experiments, the extracted anthocyanin contents are quite stable. The graphs show a small degradation rate in the anthocyanin total concentration, except for the extracts that were exposed to the light where the degradation level reached more than 50 %. At different pH values, the anthocyanin concentration decreased and the colour faded at higher pH. Extracts that were stored at high temperatures (31 °C) showed higher degradation levels compared to the one kept at lower temperatures (25 °C).

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{the optimal}} process {{conditions}} in the physically refined vegetable oils have been determined. The oils involved in this analysis were Palm Oil (PO), and Palm Kernel Oil (PKO). The oils, obtained from a local market in Enugu, North – East province of Nigeria, were characterized {{with a view to}} finding the ordinary values of the variables that were optimized, especially in the degumming, bleaching, and deodorization sections, as well as the cost of refining and the revenue accruable from the sale of the products. The AOCS method of AOCS, [1], was used in the analysis. Graphical method of linear programming and Sinplex Alogrithm methods were also used in order to optimize the variables. The objectives and the constraints were formulated into standard models with temperature, pressure, chemical concentration and clay dosage as the variables. It was found that optimal values of phosphotide in the refined oils, measured as Phosphorous, were 0. 0105 and 0. 0047 Ppm; <b>Colour</b> <b>pigment,</b> measured in Red Units, 1. 92 and 1. 35, for PO and PKO, respectively, and odour, measured as FFA, was 0. 1 and 0. 05 %, accordingly.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the effect of body weight and fillet parts on sensory quality of raw and cooled salmon fillets and consumer preference of cooked salmon fillets. Three groups of salmon with the average body weight of 3991 ± 61 g, 5005 ± 54 g and 6013 ± 68 g respectively were filleted. Fillet colour, gaping, pigment, fat content and texture were analyzed in the raw fillets after 6 days of ice storage. A consumer sensory test was carried out to evaluate the acceptability of colour, odour, flavour, firmness and juiciness of cooked fillets after 5 months of storage at - 40 °C. No significant differences in the fillet <b>colour,</b> <b>pigment</b> content or gaping were observed between the 4 kg, 5 kg and 6 kg salmon. The result also showed that the loin fillet (anterior dorsal section) contained significantly thicker and firmer muscle compared to the NQC parts (dorsal section between dorsal fin and gut). Sensory analyses of cooked fillets revealed significant higher preference for flavour and juiciness of the 5 kg and 6 kg salmon compared to the 4 kg salmon. Also a tendency to preferred colour, firmness and juiciness were observed for salmon loin fillet part compared with the NQC part. The sensory parameters of all three groups of salmon were well acceptable. The odour, flavour, firmness and juiciness correlated significantly to the overall preference while the colour of the cooked fillets had no effect on the overall preference.

40|$|AbstractVacuum {{infusion}} is used {{to facilitate}} the peeling of citrus fruit for the fresh-cut market, giving, as a by-product, a peel soaked with water but quite undamaged. Osmotic dehydration, commonly used to remove part of the water content of fruit before further drying, could increase {{the stability of the}} <b>colour</b> <b>pigment</b> and minimize the shrinkage phenomenon. The aim of this research is to apply to orange peels the osmodehydration followed by air-drying in order to obtain a high quality food ingredient both from a nutritional and sensorial aspect. Peels from vacuum infused organic oranges, cv Tarocco and cv Navel, were cut into slices (1 x 2 cm) and then osmodehydrated at 20 °C in sucrose solution (60 % w/w) for different times (1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 24 h), followed by air drying at 80 °C up to a constant weight. Solid gain and water loss of the osmotic process were assessed. Changes of colour and shape, due to processing, were evaluated by image analysis technique. The bitterness sensorial characteristic of powders, obtained from grinding the dried peel, was judged by a panel test. The high solid gain of peels, due to the osmotic step, was attributed to the particular structure of pith, which was able to absorb an elevated amount of sugar solution thanks to its wide intercellular spaces and not turgid cells. The solid gain allowed colour attributes of slices after air dehydration to be maintained. The air drying without pre-treatment, caused a structural collapse of peels which looked wrinkled. This effect was noticeably reduced in pre-osmodehydrated slices with a positive progressive trend in function of osmosis time. Furthermore the solid-liquid exchanges and the consequent sucrose intake had a positive effect on sensorial quality of the dried product, decreasing the characteristic bitter perception...|$|E
40|$|Gloss {{is one of}} {{the optical}} {{properties}} of primary concern to papermakers due to its strong impact on visual perception. In order to improve gloss of coated papers, it is necessary to better understand the relationship governing the behaviour of gloss as a function of surface texture attributes of coated paper. Since pigment represents between 80 to 95 % in weight of any coating <b>colour,</b> <b>pigment</b> characteristics, such as particle size, size distribution, and morphology, play a fundamental role in determining the coating structure. In addition, intensive calendering is often used to achieve a high sheet gloss, but can cause a significant increase in gloss variation (besides to a reduction in bulk). In this study, macro gloss, microgloss and microgloss nonuniformity of laboratory coated paper samples containing seven different delaminated and undelaminated kaolin clays with various particle size distributions were studied as a function of calendering conditions and coat weight. It was found that the average microgloss, given as average gray level, is strongly related to the macro gloss measured using the standard glossmeters. In addition, higher sheet average gloss corresponds to a larger gloss variability at the micro scale. It was also found that by increasing the calendering temperature from 28 to 150 oC, the average microgloss and the microgloss nonuniformity increased while the RMS surface heights decreased. For most samples, increasing the calendering temperature resulted in a decrease in surface roughness, σh. A semi-empirical model based on Alexander-Katz and Barrera’s approach of the Kirchhoff theory can be successfully used to identify key surface parameters for gloss and gloss nonuniformity. It showed that the average microgloss of the coated paper is strongly dependent on the surface texture parameter (LC/λ) /(σh/λ) 2. In addition, the microgloss variability of these coated papers also exhibited a strong linear correlation with the surface texture parameter (LC/λ) /(σh/λ) 2, but the relationship itself was found to be specific to each pigment type...|$|E
