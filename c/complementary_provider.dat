40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{perspectives}} of consumer health organizations about the burden of chronic illness and multiple treatment regimens experienced by the consumers they represent. Methods: In-depth interviews (n ¼ 15) were conducted with senior representatives from peak Australian consumer health organizations representing diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease, cancer, musculoskeletal illness and mental health. Results: Medication burden, which included aspects such as multiple medications, side effects, stigma and adverse events resulting from medication use, emerged as the most significant and prevalent theme. Carer burden and {{the negative impact of}} financial burden was widely discussed, particularly for low-income earners with claims that these consumers were forced to prioritise medications according to how effective they perceived them to be. Time taken to learn about treatment, administer, and monitor or travel to obtain treatment also emerged as being burdensome, however, difficulty accessing treatment was considered to be particularly burdensome. The disjointed nature of care among healthcare services was thought {{to create a sense of}} confusion and distress. Discussion: Many of the issues discussed by participants corroborated existing research, underscoring the <b>complementary</b> <b>provider,</b> and advocacy role of these organisations in mitigating treatment burden for people with chronic illness...|$|E
40|$|Background: Effective {{interdisciplinary}} {{communication is}} important to achieve better quality in health care. The aims {{of this study were}} to compare conventional and complementary providers’ experience of communication about complementary therapies and conventional medicine with their cancer patients, and to investigate how they experience interdisciplinary communication and cooperation. Method: This study analyzed data from a self-administrated questionnaire. A total of 606 different health care providers, from four counties in Norway, completed the questionnaire. The survey was developed to describe aspects of the communication pattern among oncology doctors, nurses, family physicians and complementary therapists (acupuncturists, massage therapists and reflexologists/zone-therapists). Between-group differences were analyzed using chi-square, ANOVA and Fisher’s exact tests. Significance level was defined as p < 0. 05 without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Result: Conventional <b>providers</b> and <b>complementary</b> therapists had different patterns of communication with their cancer patients regarding complementary therapies. While complementary therapists advised their patients to apply both complementary and conventional modalities, medical doctors were less supportive of their patients’ use of complementary therapies. Of conventional providers, nurses expressed more positive attitudes toward complementary therapies. Opportunities to improve communication between conventional and <b>complementary</b> <b>providers</b> were most strongly supported by <b>complementary</b> <b>providers</b> and nurses; medical doctors were less supportive of such attempts. A number of doctors showed lack of respect for complementary therapists, but asked for more research, guidelines for complementary modalities and training in conventional medicine for complementary therapists. Conclusion: For better quality of care, greater communication about complementary therapy use is needed between cancer patients and their conventional and <b>complementary</b> <b>providers.</b> In addition, more communication between conventional and <b>complementary</b> <b>providers</b> is needed. Nurses may have a crucial role in facilitating communication, as they are positive toward complementary therapies and they have more direct communication with patients about their treatment preferences...|$|R

Interestingly, this effect is particularly strong if the integrated firm is highly efficient. We also study the incentives for a counter-merger and obtain two main results: First, the counter-merger is generally profitable. Second, although the first merger is anticompetitive, the counter-merger is often procompetitive and involves below cost pricing at the wholesale level. We also show that a horizontal merger between complementary input suppliers harms welfare. These results have profound consequences for antitrust policy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{this paper}} is to report on the {{findings}} of a consultation project exploring demand for mental health related complementary therapy services in the local area. The project and findings are reported with reference to historical context and the literature from service user, healthcare policy and complementary therapy fields. Design The consultation was commissioned by a voluntary sector mental health organisation to establish whether a case could be made for the development of a mental health related complementary therapy service, and what form such a service might take. The researchers sought breadth and balance by seeking views from four standpoints: mental health service users, informal carers, health and social care professionals, and <b>complementary</b> therapy <b>providers.</b> SETTING The consultation activities took place in statutory and voluntary sector settings in Liverpool and surrounding areas. The Merseyside region is an area of long term social disadvantage and environmental neglect, currently subject to extensive regeneration activity with significant UK and EU funding. METHOD Service user views were captured through a combination of focus groups, in mental health centres, and questionnaires, completed at these events or distributed through mental health groups. Health and social care professionals' views were elicited through group meetings, questionnaires or interviews based on the questionnaire structure. <b>Complementary</b> therapy <b>providers</b> completed questionnaires or were interviewed using the questionnaire structure. RESULTS The consultations discovered a high level of interest and confidence in holistic forms of therapy amongst service users, carers and professionals, together with interest and expertise in helping with mental health related problems amongst the therapists. CONCLUSION This main contribution to knowledge is in the wealth of detail about potential therapeutic applications and suggested organisational principles for complementary therapy services in the mental health field. The findings are inconclusive on the macro question of service design. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the process of}} how entrepreneurs assemble resources. In the model, the entrepreneur’s challenge is to convince two <b>complementary</b> resource <b>providers</b> to commit their resources to a new venture. Before committing their resources, one of them needs to perform a costly evaluation. The entrepreneur {{has a problem with}} getting sufficient attention, because each provider has an incentive to wait and free-ride on the other’s evaluation. For some parameters the entrepreneur solicits both partners with equal intensity (“knocking on every door”); for others, the entrepreneur always solicits the same partner (“pestering”). For many but not all parameter ranges, the process of assembling resources takes too much time relative to what is socially efficient. The model thus explores what factors facilitate or hinder the creation of new firms. 1...|$|R
40|$|The rise {{of managed}} {{healthcare}} organizations (MCOs) {{and the associated}} increased integration among providers has transformed US healthcare {{and at the same}} time raised antitrust concern. This paper examines how competition among MCOs affects the efficiency gains of improved price coordination achieved through integration. MCOs offer differentiated services and contract with specialized and <b>complementary</b> upstream <b>providers</b> to supply these services. We identify strategic pricing equilibria under three different market structures: overlapping upstream physician-hospital alliances, upstream-downstream arrangements such as Preferred Provider Organizations, and vertically integrated Health Maintenance Organizations. The efficiency gains achieved depend not only on organizational form but also on the toughness of premium competition. We show that, contrary to popular thinking, providers and insurers do not earn maximum net revenue when they are monopolies or monopsonies, but rather at an intermediate level of market power. Furthermore, closer integration of upstream and downstream providers does not necessarily increase net revenues. ...|$|R

In order to support the effective usage of 4 PL services, this paper proposes an analytical multiple criteria decision making approach to evaluate 4 PL operating models. While decision criteria and their hierarchy were identified, it is observed that there exist interactions, e. g. simultaneous satisfaction of two or criteria is sometimes required.

40|$|A {{number of}} internet-based digital {{currency}} platform based on decentralized public ledgers have started since {{the introduction of}} the blockchain concept by the founder of Bitcoin in 2008. An important element of these public ledger platforms is an incentive system that elicits efforts from a distributed global workforce to verify and record transactions on the public ledger and a governance system for the platform. The economic efficiency and possibly viability of a public ledger platform ultimately depend on the design of these incentive and governance systems. Even if a decentralized public ledger were a more efficient technology for conducting financial transactions, and for providing a platform for distributed innovation, deficiencies in its incentive and governance systems could make it overall inferior to alternatives, including existing systems. Current claims that public ledger platforms can conduct financial transactions more efficiently ignore the inefficiencies associated with the incentive and governance systems and the likely costs associated with regulation of these platforms and <b>complementary</b> service <b>providers</b> such as vaults, wallets, and exchanges. It is possible that public ledger platforms are more efficient than other alternative platforms for conducing financial transactions, but as of now the proposition is based on apples-to-oranges comparisons compounded with speculation.

40|$|Venture philanthropy {{provides}} {{a blend of}} performance-based development finance and professional services to social purpose organisations in helping them expand their social impact. This is a high-engagement, partnership approach analogous to the practices of venture capital in building the commercial value of companies. In its modern form, venture philanthropy developed significantly in the US in the mid 1990 s, took hold in the UK from 2002 and is now expanding into continental Europe. Although not without its sceptics, venture philanthropy {{has the potential to}} contribute to developing a more responsive and diverse capital market for the social sector. Its focus on building organisational capacity in entrepreneurial social purpose organisations, matching appropriate finance with strategic business-like advice, makes it a distinctive provider of capital. Venture philanthropy in Europe has strong links to the private equity and venture capital community, giving it opportunities to influence the corporate social responsibility of a set of major players in Europe's financial services industry. Several new venture philanthropy funds have been established by philanthropists with successful careers in private equity. Europe's transitional countries, in Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic States and former Soviet Union, have under-capacitated social sectors and widespread, unmet social needs.

Patients can procure supplements {{without a}} prescription, and often do not disclose supplement use to their healthcare providers. Providers and patients may be uncertain about what would be appropriate or helpful in discussions of supplements during routine office visits. OBJECTIVE: To explore provider and patient expectations for discussions of dietary supplements. DESIGN: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a purposeful sample of healthcare providers from three specialties and their patients who reported taking supplements. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five outpatient providers (14 primary care, six integrative medicine, and 15 complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers) and 107 of their patients. APPROACH: Qualitative analysis of transcripts using grounded theory and iterative review. RESULTS: Both providers and patients raised twelve common topics about dietary supplements that they felt were important to discuss during office visits, such as: supplements taken; supplement risks (interactions, safety/harm, side effects/adverse events); treatment benefits; efficacy; alternative treatments; and patient expectations/preferences for treatment. Some topics were mentioned more frequently by providers than patients, such as how to take, reason for taking, and evidence for use. Providers raised several topics that were mentioned infrequently by patients. Supplement costs and regulations were not brought up by any patients, even though consideration of these topics could influence patient decisions to take supplements. <b>Complementary</b> healthcare <b>providers</b> brought up topics not mentioned by primary care providers, such as the importance of supplement brands and supplement mega-dosing.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Health {{outcomes}} {{in developing countries}} continue to lag the developed world, and many countries are not on target to meet the Millennium Development Goals. The private health sector provides much of the care {{in many developing countries}} (e. g., approximately 50 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa), but private providers are often poorly integrated into the health system. Efforts to improve health systems performance will need to include the private sector and increase its contributions to national health goals. However, the literature on constraints private health care providers face is limited. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyze data from a survey of private health facilities in Kenya and Ghana to evaluate growth constraints facing private providers. A significant portion of facilities (Ghana: 62 percent; Kenya: 40 percent) report limited access to finance as the most significant barrier they face; only a small minority of facilities report using formal credit institutions to finance day to day operations (Ghana: 6 percent; Kenya: 11 percent). Other important barriers include corruption, crime, limited demand for goods and services, and poor public infrastructure. Most facilities have paper-based rather than electronic systems for patient records (Ghana: 30 percent; Kenya: 22 percent), accounting (Ghana: 45 percent; Kenya: 27 percent), and inventory control (Ghana: 41 percent; Kenya: 24 percent). A majority of clinics in both countries report undertaking activities to improve provider skills and to monitor the level and quality of care they provide. However, only a minority of pharmacies report undertaking such activities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that improved access to finance and improving business processes especially among pharmacies would support improved contributions by private health facilities. These strategies might be <b>complementary</b> if <b>providers</b> are more {{able to take advantage of}} increased access to finance when they have the business processes in place for operating a successful business and health facility...|$|R

Unfortunately, despite its benefits, the role of {{non-formal education}} has mostly remained unrecognized {{due to lack of}} research and poor information base resulting in ignoring of this <b>complementary</b> education <b>provider.</b> For this purpose, this study aimed to investigate and explore the role of scouting as non-formal education in youth development in Karachi, Pakistan. The study used sequential explanatory design of the mixed methods, which consisted of first phase of quantitative data collection followed by a qualitative data collection phase. For quantitative phase, stratified random sampling was used to ensure proper representation for the purpose of generalization. A sample of 266 young individuals aged 18 - 25 years, and 50 adult leaders aged 26 and above participated in quantitative data collection through a self-administered written questionnaire. For qualitative phase, the researcher selected two young individuals based on criterion sampling and two adult leaders based on expert sampling to collect data through semi-structured interviews along with triangulation using document analysis. Both phases were carried out separately; however, findings of the quantitative phase were used to design data collection instruments of qualitative phase to integrate the two methods. The dissertation presents findings of the two phases in separate chapters; however, the final chapter presents an integrated version of both findings.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{existing}} {{studies on}} the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) have produced diverse results regarding the types and prevalence of CAM use due, in part, to variations in the measurement of CAM modalities. A questionnaire that can be adapted for use in a variety of populations will improve CAM utilization measurement. The purposes of this article are to (1) articulate the need for such a common questionnaire; (2) describe the process of questionnaire development; (3) present a model questionnaire with core questions; and (4) suggest standard techniques for adapting the questionnaire to different languages and populations. METHODS: an international workshop sponsored by the National Research Center in Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NAFKAM) of the University of Tromsø, Norway, brought CAM researchers and practitioners together to design an international CAM questionnaire (I-CAM-Q). Existing questionnaires were critiqued, and working groups drafted content for a new questionnaire. A smaller working group completed, tested, and revised this self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: the questionnaire that was developed contains four sections concerned with visits to health care <b>providers,</b> <b>complementary</b> treatments received from physicians, use of herbal medicine and dietary supplements, and self-help practices. A priori-specified practitioners, therapies, supplements, and practices are included, as well as places for researcher-specified and respondent-specified additions. Core questions are designed to elicit frequency of use, purpose (treatment of acute or chronic conditions, and health maintenance), and satisfaction. A penultimate version underwent pretesting with "think-aloud" techniques to identify problems related to meaning and format. The final questionnaire is presented, with suggestions for testing and translating. CONCLUSIONS: once validated in English and non-English speaking populations, the I-CAM-Q will provide an opportunity for researchers to gather comparable data in studies conducted in different populations. Such data will increase knowledge about the epidemiology of CAM use and provide the foundation for evidence-based comparisons at an international leve...|$|R

DeGroote Endowed Chair in Cardiovascular Nursing Research, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada; 5 Ascentum, Ottawa, ON, CanadaAbstract: The Interprofessional Resource Centre (IRC) {{was based}} on an {{extensive}} literature search and a provincial consultative process that involved administrators, health care providers, educators, preceptors, and alternative and <b>complementary</b> health care <b>providers</b> from different disciplines. Information from the literature review was synthesized into a logic model that served as a preliminary outline for the IRC to be further developed during the stakeholder consultation. The findings from the literature were triangulated with the opinions of different groups of key stakeholders who participated in three different methods of data collection: 1) a large-scale deliberative survey, 2) an in-person dialogue, and 3) targeted questionnaires. The result of this process was an online tool that presents information on what needs to be considered when planning interprofessional practice and education within an organization with the purpose of: 1) building capacity within agencies for interprofessional, collaborative practice; 2) providing preceptors with educational strategies to develop interprofessional competencies in their students; 3) promoting the use of technology as a strategy for knowledge transfer within the agencies and between educational institutions; and 4) developing an evaluation plan to measure interprofessional practice and education.

40|$|Abstract Background The Feldenkrais Method ® of somatic {{education}} {{purports to}} guide people of varying ages and abilities to improve function. Many people choose this method to aid with recovery from injury, manage chronic conditions, or enhance performance even though limited research supporting its {{safety and effectiveness}} exists to guide decisions about use and referral. Very little information about practitioner characteristics and practice patterns is publicly available to assist researchers {{in the design of}} appropriate safety and effectiveness studies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain an initial overview of the characteristics of United States Guild Certified Feldenkrais Practitioners CM. Methods Of 1300 certified Feldenkrais ® practitioners at the time of the study, there were 1193 practitioners with email accounts who were sent invitations to complete a web-based survey. The survey inquired about practice locations, additional credentials, service patterns and workloads during the previous 3 months. Response rate and descriptive statistics were calculated. Results The survey had a 32. 3 % (385 / 1193) response rate. The top states in which responders practiced were California (n = 92) and New York (n = 44). Most responders did not hold other credentials as traditional health care <b>providers</b> or as <b>complementary</b> and alternative medicine providers. Among those who did, the most common credentials were physical therapist (n = 83) and massage therapist (n = 38). Just over a third of traditional health care providers only provided Feldenkrais lessons, compared to 59. 3 % of <b>complementary</b> and alternative <b>providers.</b> On average, responders saw 7. 6 ± 8. 1 (median = 5) clients per week for individual lessons, 8. 4 ± 11. 5 (median = 5) clients per week for group lessons, and 2. 9 ± 3. 9 (median = 2) new clients per month for individual lessons. Conclusions This preliminary survey of United States Guild Certified Feldenkrais Practitioners indicated that most practiced in the west and northeast, did not hold additional credentials, and had part-time practices. Those who were traditional health care providers were more likely than complementary and alternative medicine providers in other areas to combine their services. These results provide a foundation for further analyses of Feldenkrais practitioner characteristics and practice patterns that can aid the design of safety and effectiveness studies, and enhance use and referral decision-making. </p...|$|R
40|$|Italian {{ministerial decree}} number 279 of May 18 th, 2001, {{provides}} {{the establishment of}} a national network devoted to rare diseases, by means of which preventing action is to be developed, care is to be activated, interventions directed to diagnosis and therapy are to be improved, information and education are to be promoted. Rare Disease Network is made up by all structures and regional system services which contribute, in an integrated way and each one related to its specific competences and functions, to develop and implement all actions provided by the up decree. In detail, main nodes of Rare Diseases Network are accredited providers, preferably hospital ones, suitably identified by Regions among those which possess documented experience in diagnosis and cure of specific Rare Diseases or Rare Diseases groups, and are equipped with adapt support structures and <b>complementary</b> services. Network <b>providers</b> are connected, in a diversified way on the basis of different regional health organizations, to hospital and territorial services closer to sick people residence places. These connections, even if experimented as strategic for the effective charge of people with rare diseases, currently suffer from a fulfilment diversity and still result lacking in many territorial areas. The present paper has the objective of carrying out of a simulation model, made out by language Rockwell Arena, which permits to reproduce the Rare Diseases network actual system and to dynamically analyse its behaviour, to test management criteria, to evaluate critical situations in running queues and in efforts to which each node is called, to suggest and validate planning choices, to compare alternative solutions in short times and with very small expenses. Moreover, data processing supplies a by-product consisting in a database which records all paths covered by every patient among centres both from a medical and simply from a geographical point of view; such paths may be influenced both by external parameters (managed as system variables) like for instance the appeal of a professional operating in a centre, or by inner parameters like the specific planning which assigns a larger or a smaller basin to a node. Such a way we can not only observe how patients’ population is distributed on the basis of statistical laws, but also how patients’ population behaves on the basis of strategic decisions. In the model, every newborn is inserted into the system according to a statistic which arrives at different distributions for every week of the year, with characteristics like for instance the birth zone. If the newborn is sick, then all necessary treatments are listed with necessary resources, duration, beginning, etc. All treatments remain in a queue until they are effected: queues (time and lengths) are revealed related to every centre resources and to centre choice policy. All of the parameters regarding each treatment is stored in a database and can be handled without accessing Arena Simulation giving to the model a great flexibility in representing actual situation and the issues concerning the Rare Diseases Network. ...|$|R
