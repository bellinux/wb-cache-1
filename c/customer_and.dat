However, growth was steady after 1934, with profits of £23,000, £38,000, £54,000 and then a large jump to £139,000 in 1938. By 1939 the Redman operation alone employed 300 people, compared to around 30 in 1920.

Promoting CP could be a double-edged sword for firms: It enhances customers’ economic value attainment and strengthens the relational bond between <b>customers</b> <b>and</b> employees, but it also increases employees’ job stress and hampers their job satisfaction.
