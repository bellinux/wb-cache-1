40|$|AbstractEffect of <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> {{and surface}} {{roughness}} on friction behavior in plane strain extrusion {{is one of}} the biggest phenomena in improving the sliding performance of cold forward extrusion. Wear resistance that commonly occurs on the plane requires an appropriate method to obtain the finest product surfaces. This paper highlighted is the correlation between <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> and surface roughness on the friction behavior and wear resistance of the sliding plane in the extrusion process. The analysis described in this paper involved the experiments to assess the <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> in the extrusion and the surface roughness. The experiments were set up by using pure aluminium A 1100 as billet extruded between dies made of hot work tool steel (SKD 11). Extrusion ratio of the process is three (3) and the billets were pressed by a hydraulic press machine. The <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> for each experiment was taken at a 20 mm length of the extrusion, and the average surface roughness of the aluminium was plotted on a graph. Three types of lubricants were used in this study: Refined Bleached Deodorized (RBD) palm stearin and two types of paraffinic mineral oil, 95 and 460. These two types of paraffinic mineral oil differed in viscosity. These three types of lubricants were run with four different quantities: 0. 1 mg, 1 mg, 5 mg, and 20 mg. The results showed that an increased amount of lubricant reduced the surface roughness. The correlation between <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> and surface roughness showed significant differences for each lubricant while at 5 mg of RBD palm stearin and paraffinic mineral oil 460, the results showed the same <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> but different surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|Background Inappropriate tibiofemoral joint <b>contact</b> <b>loading</b> during gait {{is thought}} to {{contribute}} to the development of osteoarthritis. Increased co-activation of agonist/antagonist pair of muscles during gait has commonly been observed in pathological populations and it is thought that this results in increased articular loading and subsequent risk of disease development. However, these hypotheses assume that there is a close relationship between muscle electromyography and force production, which is not necessarily the case. Methods This study investigated the relationship between different electromyography-based co-activation measures and articular loading during gait using an electromyography-driven model to estimate joint <b>contact</b> <b>loads.</b> Findings The results indicated that significant correlations do exist between selected electromyography-based activity measures and articular loading, but these are inconsistent and relatively low. However despite this, it was found that it may still be possible to use carefully selected measures of muscle activation in conjunction with external adduction moment measures to account for up to 50 % of the variance in medial and lateral compartment loads. Interpretation The inconsistency in correlations between many electromyography-based co-activation measures and articular loading still highlights the danger of inferring joint <b>contact</b> <b>loads</b> during gait using these measures. These results suggest that some form of electromyography-driven modelling is required to estimate joint <b>contact</b> <b>loads</b> in the tibiofemoral joint. No Full Tex...|$|R

Abrasive wear testing was performed using a pin-on-disk device in which LDGC disks prepared with different surface finishes were against alumina pins at different <b>contact</b> <b>loads.</b> Coefficients of friction and wear volumes were measured as functions of initial surface finishes and <b>contact</b> <b>loads.</b> Wear-induced surface morphology changes in both LDGC disks and alumina pins were characterized using three-dimensional laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The {{results show that}} initial surface finishes of LDGC specimens and <b>contact</b> <b>loads</b> significantly affected the friction coefficients, wear volumes and wear-induced surface roughness changes of the material. Both wear volumes and friction coefficients of LDGC increased as the load increased while surface roughness effects were complicated. For rough LDGC surfaces, three-body wear was dominant while for fine LDGC surfaces, two-body abrasive wear played a key role. Delamination, plastic deformation, and brittle fracture were observed on worn LDGC surfaces. The adhesion of LDGC matrix materials to alumina pins was also discovered. This research has advanced {{our understanding of the}} abrasive wear behavior of LDGC and will provide guidelines for better utilization and preparation of the material for long-term success in dental restorations...|$|R

40|$|Fretting fatigue is a {{mechanical}} failure process, {{which consists of}} two complex failure mechanisms. Fretting is caused by small relative movement between connected parts and fatigue is due to alternating bulk load. Fretting fatigue is highly non-linear and subjected to non-proportional loading condition. The multiaxial nature of stress at contact interface can be highly influenced by different phase difference between axial, tangential and <b>contact</b> <b>load.</b> In this study, the effect of different phase difference between axial and tangential load on fretting fatigue behaviour is investigated. Moreover, by applying cyclic <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> instead of constant <b>contact</b> <b>load,</b> its effect on fretting fatigue response and crack initiation lifetime is investigated.

The resulting boundary value problem was then solved numerically by finite difference methods using the method of successive over relaxation. The pressure distribution and hydrodynamic load capacity of plane slider and journal bearings were calculated for various design data. The effects of attitude and roughness of surface on the bearing performance were shown. The results are compared with similar available solution of rough surface bearings.

The results of the experimental study of specific <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> distribution over the artificial flank wear-land of the cutter in free orthogonal turning of the disk from titanium alloy (Ti[6]Al[2]Mo[2]Cr), ductile (63 Cu) and brittle (57 Cu 1 Al[3]Mn) brasses are described. Investigations were {{carried out by the}} method of 'split cutter' and by the method of the artificial flank-land of variable width. The experiments with a variable feed rate and a cutting speed show that in titanium alloy machining with a sharp-cornered cutting edge the highest normal <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> ([sigma][h max]= 3400 [...] . 2200 MPa) is observed immediately at the cutting edge, and the curve has a horizontal region with the length of 0. 2 [...] . 0. 6 mm.

40|$|Wear {{behavior}} of freshly cleaved single crystal calcite (CaCO 3) was investigated by continuous scanning using the Hysitron Triboindenter in ambient environment {{as a function}} of scanning frequency (1 Hz 3 Hz) and <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> (2 µN 8 µN). At lower loads below 4 µN, initiation of the ripples takes place {{at the bottom of the}} surface slope, which continue to propagate up the slope as scanning progresses. The orientation of these ripple structures is perpendicular to the long scan direction. As the number of scans increases, ripples become fully developed, and their height and periodicity increase with the number of scans. At 6 µN normal load, tip-induced wear occurs as the tip begins removing the ripple structures with increased number of scan cycles. As the <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> increased further, ripples did not initiate and only tip-induced wear occurred on the surface, and saturated after 20 scans. At 1 Hz frequency wear takes place as material slides towards the scan edges when the tip moves back and forth. Material removal rate increased with <b>contact</b> <b>load</b> and it is observed that the number of scans required to create a new surface is inversely proportional to the <b>contact</b> <b>load.</b> Possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of ripples at higher frequencies are attributed to the slope of the surface, piezo hysteresis, system dynamics, or a combination of effects. The wear regime is due to abrasive wear.

30|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>loading</b> {{is a type}} of {{mechanical}} impact that many electronic materials experience during processing or application, there are several issues to be addressed. Firstly, the mechanical responses of materials to an applied load might be vastly {{different from that of the}} same bulk ones. For this purpose, unfortunately, the traditional methods such as tensile measurements do not scale well into the micrometer- and nanometer-regions. Secondly, the role of structural changes under <b>contact</b> <b>loading</b> are largely underestimated owing to the difficulties in probing the structural characterizations of materials affected by the contact interaction directly. In this respect, depth-sensing indentation (nanoindentation) has proven to be a powerful technique in providing information on mechanical properties (hardness and elastic modulus) of materials and, variation of these properties with the penetration depth, based on the analysis of the respective load-displacement curves [1 – 6] while also producing contact-induced damage.

40|$|Mechanical load-assisted {{dissolution}} {{is identified}} {{as one of the}} key mechanisms governing material removal in fretting and crevice corrosion of biomedical implants. In the current study, material removal on a stressed surface of cobalt–chromium–molybdenum (CoCrMo) and titanium (Ti 64) alloys subjected to single asperity contact is investigated to identify the influence of <b>contact</b> <b>loads</b> and in-plane stress state on surface damage mechanisms. The experiments were conducted in three different aqueous environments—phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7. 4, PBS at pH 4. 1, and high chloride solutions at pH 2. 0. The tip of an atomic force microscope is used as a well-characterized “asperity” to apply controlled contact forces and mechanically stimulate the loaded specimen surface in different aqueous environments from passivating to corroding. The volume of the material removed is measured to determine the influence of <b>contact</b> <b>loads,</b> in-plane stresses, and the environment on the material dissolution rate. Experimental results indicate that surface damage is initiated at all the <b>contact</b> <b>loads</b> studied and as expected in a wear situation, removal rate increases with increase in <b>contact</b> <b>loads.</b> For both alloys, removal rates display a complex dependence on residual stresses and the environment. In a passivating environment, the material removal rate is linearly dependent on the stress state such that surface damage is accelerated under compressive stresses and suppressed under tensile stresses. In a corrosive environment, the dissolution rate demonstrates a quadratic dependence on stress, with both compressive and tensile stresses accelerating material dissolution. The material removal rates are found to be consistently larger for CoCrMo in comparison to Ti 64 surfaces under the same mechanical and electrochemical stimuli, despite the higher hardness of CoCrMo surfaces.

40|$|The {{process known}} as {{fretting}} fatigue occurs at the contact surface between two components pressed together by a static load and {{is related to the}} simultaneous occurrence of wear, corrosion and fatigue damage. A small-amplitude oscillatory movement leads to friction stresses and surface wear. The oxidation of small fragments of metal (in normal atmospheric conditions) produces oxide debris. A cyclic external load applied to one or both the components gives rise to the early initiation of fatigue cracks. In this paper, the fretting fatigue behavior of commercially pure titanium flat samples (1. 5 mm thick) is evaluated. In order to carry out the experimental work, a fretting device composed by a frame, load cell and screw-mounted fretting pads was built and mounted in a servo-hydraulic testing machine.

However, the temple region is only minimally covered by most helmet models. Impact tests were performed on human cadavers to investigate whether current bicycle helmets are capable of preventing direct contact on the temporal area in side impacts. METHODS: Lateral head impacts, corresponding to a force load of 15, 000 N on an nonhelmeted head, were applied on 11 helmeted cadavers by a steel pendulum with a flat impact surface, and the contact between the impactor plate and the temporal and zygomatic area was investigated by means of paint transfer. In eight tests, a common design bicycle helmet was used, whereas in three tests the helmets provided larger temporal coverage (temporal helmet edge < 10 mm above Frankfort plane).
