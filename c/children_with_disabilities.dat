40|$|Background: Facilitating {{participation}} in physical recreation among <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> is {{an increasingly important}} aim of paediatric rehabilitation. Aim: To compare the extent (diversity and frequency), context (where and companionship), experience (enjoyment) and preference for {{participation in}} physical recreation activities outside-of-school between <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical development. Methods and procedures: One hundred and sixty-three <b>children</b> <b>with</b> physical, intellectual, sensory or multiple disabilities (67 girls; mean age 10. 8 yr) were matched <b>with</b> 163 <b>children</b> <b>with</b> typical development for age, sex, geographical location and socioeconomic status. Participation in 16 physical recreation activities (including walking, cycling, team sports) was compared between these two groups using non-parametric statistics and relative risk ratios. Outcomes and results: There were {{significant differences between the}} groups in 14 activities. A lower percentage of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> reported participating in 5 physical recreation activities. A higher percentage of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> reported not participating in their preferred activities. <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> were less likely to participate on their own in some day-to-day physical recreation activities such as walking and cycling.

40|$|While {{there is}} {{increasing}} international interest in disability inclusive development, people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> largely remain ‘unseen, unheard and uncounted’ (UN ESCAP 2012 : 1). <b>Children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> particularly, remain excluded from research informing development, {{and there is a}} paucity of information that is drawn directly from the self-report of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> living in developing countries.

40|$|Abstract The {{bachelor}} thesis, {{which is}} called Swimming for <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in České Budějovice town and in Jihlava town" is aimed to a swimming realization for the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in the civic associations named KONTAKT without barriers (hereinafter only: KONTAKT wB) and Vodomílek Sport Club (hereiafter only: Vodomílek SC). The theoretical part characterizes an impact of the water surroundings, the importance {{and the use of}} swimming for the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Furthermore the hydrotherapy, the hydro-kinesiological therapy, the suckling swimming and the swimming classification are specified in that part. The aim of my work has been to find out, how the swimming for the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in both the already mentioned associations is realized. The aim was reached by means of a structured conversation to parents and to the children from KONTAKT wB and from Vodomílek SC, and also by means of semi-structured conversations to specialists of the given sphere. Furthermore the research was completed by watching of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> during their swimming lesson. Comparison of the theoretical part and the practical part show the swimming itself enables the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> their multilateral development and it increases their self-activity. It also contributes to their socialization and to their resocialization. It teaches the human being to get to know himself, his body and his possibilities. Furthermore it increases his fitness and his organism resistance. It is proved the swimming lesson realization in both associations corresponds to the parents´ideas of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> The swimming itself is mainly realized by volunteers, who have to be empathetic, persevering and firm. That can also be practised by the parents themselves last but not least. It is clear from the results that the way of the swimming realization in KONTAKT wB and in Vodomílek SC is not the same. The common feature is their individual approach to the children as well as their typical swimming lesson configuration. The difference rests in the teaching method, which both the associations purvey. KONTAKT wB proceeds according to their own methodical line, Vodomílek SC combines various teaching methods. Results of that research will be used as the better understanding of the swimming purpose for the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and will help promote that sports activity. The theoretical part and the research can be used as the knowledge summary related to problems of the <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> It can be used by parents, volunteers, swimming coaches and others, who want or need to get more detailed pieces of information related to that theme...|$|R

The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the world of education after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education.

These notions were often used as a basis for excluding <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> from the public schools.

25|$|Play is {{included}} as a productive occupation as it is often the primary activity for children. If play becomes difficult due to a disability, like CP, this can cause problems for the child. These difficulties can affect a child's self-esteem. In addition, the sensory and motor problems experienced by children with CP affect how the child interacts with their surroundings, including the environment and other people. Not only do physical limitations affect a child's ability to play, the limitations perceived by the child's caregivers and playmates also impact the child's play activities. Some <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> spend more time playing by themselves. When a disability prevents a child from playing, there may be social, emotional and psychological problems {{which can lead to}} increased dependence on others, less motivation and poor social skills.|$|E

40|$|Children {{and young}} people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are often absent in discussions about child sexual abuse as people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are left out of discussions about violence, abuse and neglect. This {{is due in part}} to {{individuals}} <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> being excluded from society, hidden away in institutions or in family homes. Community attitudes contribute to and are informed by the fact that people <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> including <b>children,</b> are often seen in segregated, special and demeaning settings. This situation is changing slowly. People <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are taking their rightful place as citizens actively contributing to and increasingly benefiting from all that our society has to offer. Segregation and exclusion in closed institutional contexts away from public scrutiny leaves <b>children</b> (and adults) <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> at heightened risk of violence and harm including sexual abuse. Further, when <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are stereotyped as dependent and passive and unable to ‘speak up’, they are at heightened vulnerability to being segregated, abused, overlooked and not heard. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse recognised early on the likely particular vulnerabilities of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and the institutional contexts which they encounter. This commissioned discussion paper set out to provide a reasoned analysis of the historical, social and policy context surrounding <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and to examine the evidence about prevalence and prevention of sexual abuse of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in institutional contexts. To achieve this aim we proceeded iteratively and conceptually, drawing on our expertise and cumulative experience of over 60 years in disability, child and family studies, and care and protection. We used reports, submissions, position papers and scientific literature in Australia to analyse past approaches to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and the present context of the changing nature of disability services in Australia. While the paper draws from materials that are relevant to Australia as a whole, some documents from New South Wales are used to illustrate specific points. Just as children {{and young people}} <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are rarely present in discussions about sexual abuse, they are also remarkably absent from Australian literature on this subject. This is a major failing: we do not know the extent of sexual abuse of Australian <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> We therefore turned to international literature to identify prevalence figures and to examine the interactions between impairment and environment and their potential influence on the risk of sexual abuse. We found that internationally there is no clearly developed evidence base for the prevalence and risk of sexual abuse of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> We provide an analysis and critique of international prevalence and risk figures and the application of these in the Australian context. Quality of care and safeguarding processes form the basis of the disability reform agenda in Australia and also of the incoming market approach to specialist support and service delivery, which relies on mainstreaming, and building inclusive and accessible communities. This has led to debate on possible fail-safe governance mechanisms and prevention strategies, although with remarkably less focus on children and young people <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> There is an absence of empirical data in Australia on strategies to prevent sexual abuse of <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in institutional contexts. Again, we turned to the international literature to source information on relevant key factors. We approached this from a public health perspective that recognises the need to implement both population-based and targeted interventions. In this discussion paper we argue the need to put aside the community perception that disability is embedded within the child. This is not the official understanding of disability in Australia. Instead, disability is understood as arising from interactions between individuals with impairment and the various barriers that may hinder (their) full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. This understanding comes from the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). We adhere to the key frameworks of the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC) and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> (CRPD). These international covenants require that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are considered as <b>children</b> first, <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> considered as only one feature and not the defining feature of their everyday lives. We also present an analysis and critique of the available literature on prevention of sexual abuse, noting the pitfalls in assuming a ‘special group’ approach to <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> or a broad-brush approach to diversity. The human rights perspective is embedded within Australian legislation and policy directives in disability. It provides an excellent foundation to ensure that <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and their rights are more visible and to give them the same priority as other children. This is essential to ensure <b>children</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> are safe in institutional contexts in the future...|$|R
