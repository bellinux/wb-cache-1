Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studied the}} effect of <b>cryogenic</b> {{treatment}} on the fatigue crack propagation property of 7075 aluminum alloy at a series of <b>cryogenic</b> temperatures using mechanics testing. Three <b>cryogenic</b> temperatures were chosen for <b>cryogenic</b> treatment:- 60 ℃,- 120 and ℃- 196. ℃ The result showed that <b>cryogenic</b> treatment, especially at the <b>cryogenic</b> temperature of- 120, can significantly ℃ improve the fatigue performance. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) result showed the <b>cryogenic</b> treatment caused the XRD diffraction peak intensity of (200) obvious enhanced. The tendency of XRD diffraction peak intensity of (200) was in good consistence with that of fatigue crack propagation behavior of 7075 aluminum alloy after <b>cryogenic</b> treatment. Therefore, the mechanism for the improvement in fatigue crack propagation property is proposed to be the preferred orientation of crystalline grains through <b>cryogenic</b> treatment. ...|$|R

5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in <b>cryogenics</b> because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Urey and Murphy {{calculated}} from the Debye model that the heavy isotope would have a slightly higher boiling point than the light one. By carefully warming liquid hydrogen, 5 litres of liquid hydrogen could be distilled to 1 millilitre, which would be enriched in the heavy isotope by 100 to 200 times. To obtain five litres of liquid hydrogen, they traveled to the <b>cryogenics</b> laboratory at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., where they obtained the help of Ferdinand Brickwedde, whom Urey had known at Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|Crystal {{structures}} of proteins (which are irregular {{and hundreds of}} times larger than cholesterol) began to be solved in the late 1950s, beginning with the structure of sperm whale myoglobin by Sir John Cowdery Kendrew, for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Max Perutz in 1962. Since that success, 132055 X-ray crystal {{structures of}} proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules have been determined. For comparison, the nearest competing method in terms of structures analyzed is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which has resolved 11904 chemical structures. Moreover, crystallography can solve structures of arbitrarily large molecules, whereas solution-state NMR is restricted to relatively small ones (less than 70 kDa). X-ray crystallography is now used routinely by scientists to determine how a pharmaceutical drug interacts with its protein target and what changes might improve it. However, intrinsic membrane proteins remain challenging to crystallize because they require detergents or other means to solubilize them in isolation, and such detergents often interfere with crystallization. Such membrane proteins are a large component of the genome, and include many proteins of great physiological importance, such as ion channels and receptors. Helium <b>cryogenics</b> are used to prevent radiation damage in protein crystals.|$|E

5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium {{were found in the}} natural gas fields of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in <b>cryogenics,</b> in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E
5|$|Liquid helium {{is used in}} <b>cryogenics</b> (its {{largest single}} use, {{absorbing}} {{about a quarter of}} production), particularly in the cooling of superconducting magnets, with the main commercial application being in MRI scanners. Helium's other industrial uses—as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for arc welding and in processes such as growing crystals to make silicon wafers—account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships. As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. In scientific research, the behavior of the two fluid phases of helium-4 (heliumI and heliumII) is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics (in particular the property of superfluidity) and to those looking at the phenomena, such as superconductivity, produced in matter near absolute zero.|$|E

More recently, closed-cycle cryocoolers, e.g., pulse tube refrigerators have gained considerable popularity as they eliminate <b>cryogenic</b> liquids which are both costly and require periodic refilling. <b>Cryogenic</b> cooling is also an advantage since it reduces the working environment's thermal noise.|$|R
30|$|The <b>cryogenic</b> plant {{placed in}} {{service for the}} SRF module(s) on duty used in a {{synchrotron}} light source is typically oversized, following a standard rule of thumb commonly adopted to select a <b>cryogenic</b> plant with safety factor 1.5 for its refrigeration capacity. The inclusion of this safety factor opens a possibility to support a <b>cryogenic</b> test stand in a parasitic mode while maintaining an uninterrupted operation of the SRF modules on duty. The location of the <b>cryogenic</b> plant is commonly selected to be as near the SRF modules on duty as practical for the light source to benefit the routine operational efficiency, but the <b>cryogenic</b> test stand might be compelled to be located {{some distance from the}} main Dewar (MD) of the <b>cryogenic</b> plant because of space limitations. Under these circumstances, it becomes unavoidable to deliver liquid helium (LHe) from MD of a <b>cryogenic</b> plant to the tested SRF module at the <b>cryogenic</b> test stand to maintain the level balance of the SRF module and to send the evaporated cold gaseous helium (CGHe) from the tested SRF module to the cold box (CB) of a <b>cryogenic</b> plant to maintain the pressure balance of a SRF module over a long distance. Some operational challenges are consequently expected, such as insufficient pressure drops and a deterioration of the refrigeration capacity of the <b>cryogenic</b> plant. Both situations are induced mainly by the unexpected heat loads in the LHe and CGHe transfer lines. Such unexpected heat loads are easily introduced into a long-distance <b>cryogenic</b> transfer line. It might be questioned whether the guideline with safety factor 1.5 to account for the uncertainty of the heat load in the <b>cryogenic</b> designs is applicable also to the design of a long-distance <b>cryogenic</b> transfer line. Its validity must be verified for a design concept of this kind applied to long-distance <b>cryogenic</b> transfer lines of two-phase helium flow.|$|R
