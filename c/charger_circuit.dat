50|$|A typical CDI module {{consists}} of a small transformer, a <b>charging</b> <b>circuit,</b> a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 250 to 600 volts by a power supply inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> and <b>charges</b> the capacitor. The rectifier inside the <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> prevents capacitor discharge before the moment of ignition. When the triggering circuit receives the triggering signal, the triggering circuit stops {{the operation of the}} <b>charging</b> <b>circuit,</b> allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil. In a CD ignition, the ignition coil acts as a pulse transformer rather than an energy storage medium as it does in an inductive system. The voltage output to the spark plugs is highly dependent on the design of the CD ignition. Voltages exceeding the insulation capabilities of existing ignition components can lead to early failure of those components. Most CD ignitions are made to give very high output voltages, but this is not always beneficial. When there's no triggering signal, the <b>charging</b> <b>circuit</b> is re-connected to charge the capacitor.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} design and control {{approach}} to parallel resonant converter (PRC) based battery chargers. The proposed approach is particularly {{suitable for the}} constant-current constant-voltage (CC-CV) charging method, {{which is the most}} commonly utilized one. Since the PRC is operated at two different frequencies for each CC and CV charging modes, this approach eliminates the need for complicated control techniques such as the frequency-control and phase-shift-control. The proposed method not only simplifies the design and implementation processes of the converter unit but also simplifies the design of output filter configuration and decreases the number of the required components for the control of the charger. The proposed method is confirmed by two experimental setups. The results show that the designed <b>charger</b> <b>circuit</b> ensured a very stable constant current in CC charging phase, where the charging current is fixed to 1.75 A. Although a voltage increase in CV phase is observed, the <b>charger</b> <b>circuit</b> is able to decrease the charging current to 0.5 A in CV phase, as depicted in battery data-sheet. The efficiency of the charger is figured out to be in the range of 86 %- 93 % in the first setup, while it is found to be in the range of 78 %- 88 % in the second setup, where a high frequency transformer is employed.|$|E
