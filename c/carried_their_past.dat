40|$|Ethnographic poetry {{allows me}} to {{describe}} the often viscous, clumsy, awkward encounters between self and other that leave both parties covered in the complex residues of each Other. This poem {{came out of a}} summer of visits I made to the homes of Bhutanese elderly in Burlington, Vermont. I was trying {{to get a sense of}} their well-being, levels of isolation, challenges, and hopes. Poetry allows for a kind of ethnographic fabric, woven from the ethnographer and the subjects’ voices, memories, expectations and doubts, which resists more linear, one dimensional descriptions. The Bhutanese elderly so obviously <b>carried</b> <b>their</b> <b>pasts,</b> religious beliefs, and conceptions of self right on into the ethnographic present, just as I came to meet them riddled with my own questions, anticipation, and confusion...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{followers}} may invoke ritual {{practices to}} determine if a young child is in fact an [...] "elder" [...] - including rituals undertaken while the future mother is pregnant. In naparay, all people are considered to have had previous lives. However, {{the extent to which they}} <b>carry</b> <b>their</b> <b>past</b> lives with them into the present is determined by these ritual practices. A newborn with the capability, or [...] "life force", of an elder may be deferred to as an elder, for example being called [...] "Baba" [...] (father, elder) and be trained to lead ceremonies at a young age. Naparay is seen as the method by which ancient knowledge is passed on to present society. Rituals and prayer are performed during early pregnancy to guide the vital force of the recently deceased toward the new child.|$|R
40|$|This whakataukī or ‘proverb’ {{speaks to}} Māori {{perspectives}} of time, where the past, {{the present and}} the future are viewed as intertwined, and life as a continuous cosmic process. Within this continuous cosmic movement, time has no restrictions – it is both past and present. The past is central to and shapes both present and future identity. From this perspective, the individual <b>carries</b> <b>their</b> <b>past</b> into the future. The strength of carrying one’s past into the future is that ancestors are ever present, existing both within the spiritual realm and in the physical, alongside the living as well as within the living. This article explores Māori perspectives of the past and the models and inspiration they offer. In this way, it provides a critique of the practices in early childhood education, highlighting the importance of cultural concepts and practices, and discusses implications for both teaching and academic practice...|$|R
60|$|For {{many days}} they {{continued}} their journey, sometimes floating quietly along a comparatively wide valley, sometimes <b>carrying</b> <b>their</b> boats <b>past</b> dangerous rapids, sometimes rushing along at great {{speed on the}} black, deep water, occasionally meeting with falls where everything {{had to be taken}} out of the canoes, and the boats themselves allowed to shoot over the falls with long ropes attached, by which they were drawn to shore lower down. It was seldom that they were without meat, as several big-horns and two bears were shot by the Indians. They had no doubt that they could have caught fish, but as a rule they were too tired when they arrived at their halting-place to do more than cook and eat their suppers before they lay down to rest.|$|R

He claims there are too many incentives to get an abortion and said, [...] "We have folks who try to get pregnant in this state so that they can get a free trip to the city, and we have folks who want to <b>carry</b> <b>their</b> baby <b>past</b> the point of being able to have an abortion in this state so that they can have a free trip to Seattle." [...] He repeated similar comments later that day to a public radio reporter.Some say Eastman refused to apologize for said comments because he is hoping for a free, state-funded medical trip to Seattle to remove his head from his anal cavity.|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{emptying}} the nest {{along with the}} period of the empty nest is absolutely one of the biggest turning points {{in the life of the}} family. The state which follows this process requires the reorganisation of relationships between parents and children who left the family nest or are still at home as well as the relationship between partners who somehow “lost” their parenting role which was in many cases dominant and again became only partners. In the theoretical part of the thesis, {{the period of the}} empty nest and the period of middle adulthood that coincide with one another were defined. In addition, the formation of a partner relationship, a transition from a partner dyad into a parent triad and finally a scale of partner satisfaction during the years spent together were discussed. In discussions carried out with four couples, the focus was laid on how they were dealing with their children’s independence as individuals, partners and parents and what the empty nest brings for their relationship. In addition, I was also interested in how their partner satisfaction changed over the years spent together and whether there were any differences in response to children leaving home. I also draw attention to any potential emotional crisis as a consequence of the empty nest and the contacts the couples have with their adult children. The findings suggest great differences in couples’ reactions to children leaving home. They depend on their life’s priorities, personal orientation and “baggage” they are <b>carrying</b> from <b>their</b> <b>past</b> or nuclear families. Even the couples who experienced an emotional crisis successfully dealt with it, however, each in their own way. And it applies to all of them that they are in contact and on good terms with their adult children. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{station at}} Cockermouth {{was on the}} south bank of, {{and close to the}} road bridge over, the River Derwent; the line ran westwards south of the Derwent and {{immediately}} north of Brigham and Broughton Cross, crossing the River Marron near its confluence with the Derwent. West of the Marron, the railway kept to the low ground of the flood plain of the Derwent, crossing and re-crossing the Derwent five times, finally running along {{the north side of the}} Derwent to a junction with the Whitehaven Junction Railway just north of the latter's bridge over the Derwent; passenger trains ran over the WJR to reach Workington railway station (now joint between the C&WR and the WJR). The line was single track throughout, and all the bridges were built as timber trestles. Originally, there were intermediate stations at Brigham and at Camerton; additional stations were soon added at Broughton Cross and at Workington Bridge at the northern end of the road bridge over the Derwent (the latter station to remove the objection that travellers to the upper end of Workington were being <b>carried</b> <b>past</b> <b>their</b> ultimate destination on the opposite bank of the Derwent and then faced a 10-15 minute walk uphill from the WJR station.) ...|$|R
