5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, won first prize at the American <b>Color</b> <b>Print</b> Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E

25|$|The first {{permanent}} color {{photograph was}} taken in 1861 using the three-color-separation principle first published by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1855. The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, Maxwell's idea was to take three separate black-and-white photographs through red, green and blue filters. This provides the photographer with the three basic channels required to recreate a color image. Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an additive method of color reproduction. A <b>color</b> <b>print</b> on paper could be produced by superimposing carbon prints of the three images made in their complementary colors, a subtractive method of color reproduction pioneered by Louis Ducos du Hauron in the late 1860s.|$|E
5000|$|The volumes {{are one of}} {{the first}} uses of color {{photography}} and <b>color</b> <b>printing.</b> Since a nationwide search failed to find suitable <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> technology, The Luther Burbank Press set up a photo-chemical laboratory using the process of Lumiere of Paris. [...] The last volume has a section which describes how color photography and <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> is accomplished.|$|R
2500|$|According to Michael Sullivan, the {{earliest}} known example of <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> [...] "is a two-color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll, dated 1346". <b>Color</b> <b>printing</b> continued {{to be used in}} China throughout the Ming and Qing Dynasty.|$|R

500|$|Amid {{the massive}} crowds that {{arrived at the}} U.S. Capitol for the inauguration, about 4,000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to {{reserved}} areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates {{at the start of}} the formal ceremony. Many ticket holders were stuck in underground tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the National Mall. People dubbed one such tunnel [...] "the Purple Tunnel of Doom", after the purple tickets that would-be viewers held. Others remained stuck in long lines as they waited to gain entry to the reserved areas. Senator Dianne Feinstein, in her capacity as chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, launched an investigation to address complaints by the affected ticket holders. The committee later announced that ticket holders who were unable to enter the Capitol grounds to view the ceremony would receive a copy of the swearing-in invitation and program, photos of President Obama and Vice President Biden and a <b>color</b> <b>print</b> of the inaugural ceremony.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} bundled with consoles in different regions. The game was bundled in Japan with a limited-edition white PlayStation 3 {{with a pink}} <b>color</b> <b>print</b> of Lightning {{on the surface of}} the console, and with an Xbox 360 with the silver strip on the hard drive emblazoned with the Final Fantasy XIII logo in the western release. A limited quantity of themed Xbox faceplates created by Nomura were made available through a select few retailers in Europe, North America, and Australia. PAL territories received a limited collector's edition of the game for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with the Final Fantasy XIII Original Sound Selection [...] "best of" [...] soundtrack CD, three Eidolon art prints, a Brand of the l'Cie decal and The World of Final Fantasy XIII, a hardback book featuring character artwork, CG-rendered artwork, and environments from across the game production. Square Enix published three Ultimania books: the Final Fantasy XIII Scenario Ultimania and the Final Fantasy XIII Battle Ultimania on January 28, 2010, and the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimania Ω on September 30, 2010. The Battle Ultimania provides a description and analysis of the new battle system and its components, and developer interviews. The Scenario Ultimania describes the main scenarios in the game, profiles on the characters and areas in Cocoon and Gran Pulse, developer interviews, and details on each location. The last guide, the Ultimania Ω, includes voice actor and additional staff interviews, the complete story of Final Fantasy XIII including additional character profiles, a collection of artworks and illustrations, and additional dissections of the story and background.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of Prizma {{led to a}} series of similarly printed color processes. [...] This bipack color system used two strips of film running through the camera, one recording red, and one recording blue-green light. With the black-and-white negatives being printed onto duplitized film, the color images were then toned red and blue, effectively creating a subtractive <b>color</b> <b>print.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1924, the Republican and American began {{printing}} their Sunday comic {{pages in}} color and started selling their <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> services to other newspapers. A few years later, Pape founded a separate company, Eastern <b>Color</b> <b>Printing</b> Company, to oversee the <b>color</b> <b>printing</b> end of the business. In 1934, it produced what is considered the first modern comic book, named Famous Funnies. It featured the adventures of Mutt and Jeff, Donald Dare the Demon Reporter, Buck Rogers and other comic characters.|$|R

Instead, the company name was shortened to World <b>Color</b> <b>Printing</b> and continued as a commercial printer, focusing on a new business: the color [...] "funnies" [...] section of the Sunday newspaper.|$|R

Prior to the ceremony, a new 35mm <b>color</b> <b>print</b> of her 1953 film, Flame of Calcutta, was screened at the Egyptian Theatre. After the screening, at the banquet, she cheerfully announced to the audience, [...] "I'm back".|$|E
2500|$|Technicolor {{continued}} to offer its proprietary imbibition dye-transfer printing process for projection prints until 1975, and even briefly revived it in 1998. [...] As an archival format, Technicolor prints {{are one of}} the most stable <b>color</b> <b>print</b> processes yet created, and prints properly cared for are estimated to retain their color for centuries. [...] With the introduction of Eastmancolor low-fade positive print (LPP) films, properly stored (at 45°F or 7°C and 25 percent relative humidity) monopack color film is expected to last, with no fading, a comparative amount of time. [...] Improperly stored monopack color film from before 1983 can incur a 30 percent image loss in as little as 25 years.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic film is {{made for}} {{specific}} light sources (most commonly daylight film and tungsten film), and, used properly, will create a neutral <b>color</b> <b>print.</b> Matching {{the sensitivity of the}} film to the color temperature of the light source is one way to balance color. If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the tungsten incandescent lamps will appear as white (3200K) in the photograph. [...] Color negative film is almost always daylight-balanced, since it is assumed that color can be adjusted in printing (with limitations, see above). [...] Color transparency film, being the final artefact in the process, has to be matched to the light source or filters must be used to correct color.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} rush of sound films, 1929–30, MacDonald starred in six films, {{the first four}} for Paramount Studios. Her first, The Love Parade (1929), {{directed}} by Lubitsch and co-starring Chevalier, was a landmark of early sound films and received a Best Picture nomination. MacDonald's first recordings were two hits from the score: [...] "Dream Lover" [...] and [...] "March of the Grenadiers". The Vagabond King (1930) was a lavish two-strip Technicolor film version of Rudolf Friml's hit 1925 operetta. Broadway star Dennis King reprised his role as 15th-century French poet François Villon and MacDonald was Princess Katherine. She sang [...] "Some Day" [...] and [...] "Only a Rose".

2500|$|In 1967, the Corvair {{line was}} trimmed to the 500 and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans, and the Monza Convertible. This model {{year was the}} first with a {{collapsible}} steering column. A dual circuit master cylinder with warning light, nylon reinforced brake hoses, stronger steel (instead of aluminum) door hinges, [...] "mushroomed" [...] instrument panel knobs and a vinyl-edged day/night mirror were all made standard equipment. Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same [...] "Astro" [...] style as those on the new-for-1967 Camaro, featuring a new-thin-shell design. [...] Chevrolet introduced a [...] engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair. Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in 1967, including <b>color</b> <b>print</b> ads and an [...] "I Love My Corvair" [...] bumper sticker campaign by dealers, but production and sales continued to fall off drastically. Only 27,253 copies were built.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic {{emulsion}} film sometimes {{appears to}} exaggerate {{the color of the}} light, as it does not respond to lighting color in the way human visual perception does. An object that appears to the eye to be white {{may turn out to be}} very blue or orange in a photograph. The color balance may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a neutral <b>color</b> <b>print.</b> [...] The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the [...] "wrong" [...] light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the enlarger. [...] Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.|$|E

2500|$|In 1916 President Wilson {{decided to}} make a change in the presidential flag, the Navy version of which used the Great Seal on a blue {{background}} (there was a competing design from the Army, which was different but also used the Great Seal). [...] The Aide to the Secretary of the Navy, Lt. Commander Byron McCandless, suggested adding four stars to the Navy version. [...] Wilson however wanted the [...] "president's eagle" [...] used on the flag instead, showing McCandless the Martiny plaque as an example. [...] Wilson at some point obtained a <b>color</b> <b>print</b> of the president's seal, probably from the Philadelphia firm of Bailey Banks & Biddle, which was also used in the discussions. [...] The eagle in this version was more based on the 1885 Great Seal, and is essentially the design used in the modern seal — the style and details of the eagle, the rays of the glory, the arrangement of the thirteen stars, and the cloud puffs have all been carried over into the current version.|$|E
