40|$|The CRISTA {{instrument}} (CRyogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere) {{is designed}} to analyse dynamical processes in the middle atmosphere. Emphasis is on small scale spatial structures. Several trace gases {{can be used as}} tracers for these atmospheric processes. Their abundance is derived from an analysis of their IR emissions measured at the earth limb. CRISTA is integrated in the free-flying satellite ASTROSPAS and will be launched in Oct. 1994 by the US Space Shuttle for a 10 day mission. To obtain high spatial and temporal resolution the CRISTA instrument uses three independent telescopes for simultaneous measurements in three horizontal directions. The ''center'' telescope senses the atmosphere in a direction antiparallel to the flight vector. Two ''lateral'' telescopes are directed #+-# 18 wrt the <b>center</b> <b>telescope.</b> Cryogenic cooling of the optical system by supercritical Helium to temperatures of 10 Kelvin reduces thermal self emission of the CRISTA instrument and allows operation of high sensitivity doped semiconductor detectors. From a near earth orbit with a flight altitude of 300 km and an inclination of 57 CRISTA will cover the height regime from 20 km to 150 km with a vertical resolution of approximately 1, 5 km FOV by independently scanning the lines-of-sight of the three telescopes. One altitude scan lasts about 1 min. This yields a resolution of about 480 km along track. The three view directions result in a resolution across track of about 600 km, so that the atmosphere is sensed by a narrow grid of measurement points. Spectral analysis of the radiation received is performed by grating spectrometers of the Ebert-Fastie type. The wavelength range covered is 4 #mu#m to 71 #mu#m with a spectral resolution of about 500. A spectral scan is performed in 1 sec. CRISTA uses a total of 26 spectral channels. Each telescope has one spectrometer as focal plane instrument which is optimized for the wavelength range from 4 #mu#m to 14 #mu#m. The <b>center</b> <b>telescope</b> is equipped with an additional spectrometer for the wavelength interval from 15 #mu#m to 71 #mu#m. Three of the detectors for the FIR in this spectrometer need cooling below 4, 5 Kelvin. An efficient connection to a second subcooled Helium tank provides the necessary operating conditions. Due to the large wavelength interval, an all reflective optics with gold coated, nickel plated aluminum mirrors is used. As the mounting structure is also made from aluminum, image degradations due to differential thermal contractions are avoided. Special care has been taken to achieve high straylight rejection. This is to allow detection of weak atmospheric IR signals {{in the vicinity of the}} bright earth surface. Each telescope is a two stage optical system using a tiltable off axis spherical primary mirror, several flats for beam folding up to the first focus and a Cerny-Turner reimager including a Lyot stop as a second stage. Numerous tests show the ability of the optical system to meet the scientific objectives of the experiment. (orig.)

40|$|We {{obtained}} J-, H- and JH-band photometry {{of known}} extrasolar planet transiting systems at the 2. 1 -m Kitt Peak National Observatory Telescope using the FLAMINGOS infrared camera between October 2008 and October 2011. From the derived lightcurves we have extracted the mid-transit times, transit depths and transit durations for these events. The precise mid-transit times obtained help improve the orbital periods and also constrain transit-time {{variations of the}} systems. For most cases the published system parameters successfully accounted for our observed lightcurves, but in some instances we derive improved planetary radii and orbital periods. We complemented our 2. 1 -m infrared observations using CCD z'-band and B-band photometry (plus two Hydrogen Alpha filter observations) obtained with the Kitt Peak Visitor's <b>Center</b> <b>telescope,</b> and with four H-band transits observed in October 2007 with the NSO's 1. 6 -m McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The principal highlights of our results are: 1) our ensemble of J-band planetary radii agree with optical radii, with the best-fit relation being: (Rp/R*) J = 0. 0017 + 0. 979 (Rp/R*) optical, 2) We observe star spot crossings during the transit of WASP- 11 /HAT-P- 10, 3) we detect star spot crossings by HAT-P- 11 b (Kepler- 3 b), thus confirming that the magnetic evolution of the stellar active regions can be monitored even after the Kepler mission has ended, and 4) we confirm a grazing transit for HAT-P- 27 /WASP- 40.

Our goal is to characterize the brightness distribution of debris to the faintest limiting magnitude possible. Our data was obtained during 6 hours of observing time during the photometric nights of 26 and 27 March 2011 with the IMACS f/ 2 instrument, which has a field of view (fov) of 0. 5 degrees in diameter. All observations were obtained through a Sloan r filter, and calibrated by observations of Landolt standard stars.
