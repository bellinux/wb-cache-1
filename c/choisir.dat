25|$|In 1997, he was {{retired from}} racing to {{stand as a}} {{stallion}} at Coolmore Stud, where he became a successful sire, producing over 80 Group or Grade race winners, including Again, <b>Choisir,</b> Speciosa, Mastercraftsman, Lillie Langtry and Dancing Rain. In 2009, Mastercraftsman won the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St. James's Palace Stakes, and Again won the Irish 1,000 Guineas. These victories, along with successes from two-year-olds Alfred Nobel and Lillie Langtry, helped Danehill Dancer be crowned champion sire in Great Britain and Ireland that year. Danehill Dancer was at Coolmore Stud for his entire stud career, often travelling to Australia for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season, and was retired in 2014 due to declining fertility. Both <b>Choisir</b> and Mastercraftsman, who are also now stallions at Coolmore, have made promising starts as sires.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Deneuve {{signed the}} Manifesto of the 343. The {{manifesto}} was an admission by its signers to have practiced illegal abortions and therefore exposed themselves to judicial actions and prison sentences. It {{was published in}} Le Nouvel Observateur on 5 April 1971. That same year, feminist lawyer Gisèle Halimi founded the group, <b>Choisir</b> ("To Choose"), to protect the women who had signed the Manifesto of the 343.|$|E
25|$|Danehill Dancer was {{retired to}} {{stand as a}} {{stallion}} at Coolmore Stud in 1997, with his stud fee initially set at Ir£4,000, and he traveled to stand at Coolmore's Australian stud for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. In 1997, he never covered any mares in Europe, as {{he was still in}} training, but did travel to Australia to cover mares there, although he did not produce any top-class foals that year. Danehill Dancer sired three Group 1 winners from his 1999 foals, including <b>Choisir,</b> who was a top-class sprinter in both Australia and Great Britain, winning the Lightning Stakes, King's Stand Stakes and Golden Jubilee Stakes. He now stands at stud for Coolmore in Ireland for a fee of €12,500 and shuttles to Australia for the southern hemisphere spring, where his stud fee is $29,700. His best progeny so far are Olympic Glory, Sacred Choice and Starspangledbanner. The other Group 1 winners from Danehill Dancer's first crop were Private Steer (Stradbroke Handicap, Doncaster Handicap and All Aged Stakes) and Where or When (Queen Elizabeth II Stakes). Danehill Dancer did not produce any horses that scored at the top level for a few seasons until Speciosa (foaled 2003) won the 1000 Guineas in 2006. She later finished fourth in the Oaks and second in the Pretty Polly Stakes. Danehill Dancer's 2004 crop included Alexander Tango (Garden City Handicap), Arapaho Miss (Crown Oaks), Light Fantastic (Australian Guineas), Miss Beatrix (Moyglare Stud Stakes) and Risky Business (Singapore Gold Cup). The following season he produced Atomic Force (The Galaxy and Railway Stakes) and Super Satin (Hong Kong Derby).|$|E
2500|$|Valve S.a.r.l. {{was used}} to sell games to United Kingdom–based users to avoid paying the full 20% VAT. The tax {{loophole}} {{was expected to be}} closed on January 1, 2015.

One of the reasons was for using the tax loophole. Valve S.a.r.l. stopped doing business on January 1, 2017, with the main company taking over EU sales again.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{gay activist}} Satou Masaki criticized yaoi fans and artists {{in an open}} letter to the feminist zine <b>Choisir</b> in May 1992, writing that the genre was lacking in any {{accurate}} information about gay men and conveniently avoided the very real prejudice and discrimination that gay men faced as a part of society. More significantly, its portrayal of gay men as wealthy, handsome and well-educated was simply a vehicle for heterosexual female masturbation fantasies. An extensive debate ensued, with yaoi fans and artists arguing that yaoi is entertainment for women, not education for gay men, and that yaoi characters are not meant to represent [...] "real gay men." [...] As internet resources for gay men developed in the 1990s, the yaoi debate waned but occasionally resurfaced; for example, when Mizoguchi in 2003 characterized stereotypes in modern BL as being [...] "unrealistic and homophobic".|$|E

50|$|A test by French Que <b>Choisir</b> {{concluded}} that Hövding {{did not meet}} international safety requirements, according to the magazine of the Swedish Consumers' Association. The critique against Hövding was that the helmet did not fully protect against impact with hard, narrow objects, such as curbstones or metal posts. Hövding refuted the critique, claiming that the tests was irrelevant as the helmet is so different in design that normal standards cannot be used; instead they referred to the tests performed during the CE certification, which show Hövding to be far safer than the average bike helmet. Que <b>Choisir,</b> in turn, stated that the laboratory they used for the tests is highly reputable and that the tests are still relevant regardless of design. Another critique Hövding received from Que <b>Choisir</b> was the inflation time. Que <b>Choisir</b> listed the inflation time to 382 ms, comparing this with airbags for motorcycles which has a limit of maximum 200 ms, is almost twice as long time. There is, however a difference in crash velocities between motorcycles and bicycles and tests showed that it deployed as it should in a test crash by a stunt person. The test by Que <b>Choisir</b> was performed on Hövding 1.0, whether the issues have been addressed {{for the release of}} Hövding 2.0 is unknown as no new tests has been performed.|$|E
