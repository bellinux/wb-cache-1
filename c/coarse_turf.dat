Burn the whole down; build it up again in wood and plaster; widen it a little; throw in part of St. John's Wood; put green blinds outside all the private houses, with a red curtain and a white one in every window; plough up all the roads; plant {{a great deal of}} <b>coarse</b> <b>turf</b> in every place where it ought NOT to be; erect three handsome buildings in stone and marble, anywhere, but the more entirely out of everybody's way the better; call one the Post Office; one the Patent Office, and one the Treasury; make it scorching hot in the morning, and freezing cold in the afternoon, with an occasional tornado of wind and dust; leave a brick-field without the bricks, in all central places where a street may naturally be expected: and that's Washington.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{formulate}} an integrated disease management (IDM) strategy for winter sports turf. (Winter sports turf, or <b>coarse</b> <b>turf,</b> consists primarily of perennial rye grass, Lolium perenne, which is used for football, rugby and hockey pitches because of its wear tolerant characteristics). IDM involves the use of a number of control strategies to suppress disease economically and efficiently. Such strategies incorporate cultural, biological, genetic, legislative and chemical control. In order to formulate a successful disease management strategy, all the significant diseases affecting winter sports turf and the effects of different management strategies on these target pathogens needed to be identified and collated. This was achieved by a comprehensive questionnaire survey to professional football clubs (who require a high level of turf maintenance) and local authorities (moderate/low maintenance). The questionnaire sought information regarding disease, pest and weed incidence, control measures employed and general problems, e. g. drainage, wear and routine management practices. Red thread, Laetisariafiiciformis, and Fusarium patch, Microdochium nivale appeared to be the most ubiquitous diseases on winter sports turf. Some important management practices that suppress red thread can, however, encourage Fusarium patch, e. g. the application of nitrogenous fertiliser. A series of experiments and field trials have been initiated to identify a number of specific factors which manage to effectively suppress both diseases. A field trial involving the use of species mixtures, perennial rye grass and smooth stalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis), illustrated that genetic diversity can help to reduce both red thread and Fusarium patch compared to turf grown in monoculture. The amount Fusarium patch and red thread cover indicated that disease severity was significantly lower in dual species stands as compared to monoculture. A mixture comprising 50 % perennial rye grass and 50 % smooth stalked meadow grass appeared the most effective at suppressing disease incidence. Similarly, mixtures of three perennial rye grass cultivars appeared more successful at suppressing slight outbreaks of red thread as compared to bi-blends and monoculture. In addition, individual perennial rye grass cultivars also vary in tolerance to red thread. One hundred and ten cultivars, under three different nitrogen regimes were assessedto determine which were the most disease resistant. The cultivars, received artificial football type wear treatment throughout the winter, to determine if red thread incidence predisposes rye grass to be less wear tolerant. The results indicate that a number of cultivars tolerant to red thread throughout the summer were also more resistant to wear. These cultivars included Quickstart, DelDwarf and Brightstar. Wear tolerance was also increased under a moderate nitrogen level (150 kg/ha/yr). Finally, a field trial investigating the effect of nitrogen rate on red thread and Fusarium patch incidence on five different constructions for football pitches was set down. Both diseases appeared to be efficiently suppressed under a moderate/high nitrogen level (N= 225 kg/ha/yr). The 'pipe/slit' construction type also appeared to contain both diseases effectively, whilst sustaining a healthy, vigorous sward throughout the Winter when subjected to artificial football-type wear treatment. In addition to the field studies, an investigation to isolate potential microbial antagonists for use as biocontrol agents against Fusarium patch was undertaken; Fusarium patch was identified as the most economically important disease on winter sports turf from the original survey. A number of known antagonists and indigenous fungi and bacteria isolated from the phylloplane and rhizosphere of Lolium perenne were screened in vitro on turfgrass extract agar against Fusarium patch. This in vitro assay identified which species effectively suppressed disease growth. These potential antagonists were further tested in vivo to determine efficacy under field conditions. Fungi from the genus Trichoderma and bacteria from the genera Bacillus and Pseudornonos appeared the most effective antagonists against Fusarium patch in the in vivo study. In all cases where an antagonist was present, Fusarium patch severity was significantly lower than the untreated control, e. g. the indigenous Bacillus sp. reduced disease severity by 76. 1 %. The results obtained from the field trials are encouraging and suggest that the use of species/cultivar mixtures, disease tolerant cultivars and a balanced fertiliser regime on a freely-draining construction type can successfully be incorporated into an IDM plan. An IDM strategy will help to effectively suppress both red thread and Fusariurn patch on winter sports turf. Biological control of Fusariurn patch was successful on an experimental basis, although further research is required to identify an appropriate formulation and optimum application technique for successful commercial use. The use of IDM on winter sports turf will help reduce reliance on chemical control, may delay the onset of fungicide resistance and reduce non-target impacts of fungicides. IDM will also help limit the need for potentially hazardous chemicals in recreational areas open to the public...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Full-system {{calibration}} of acoustic instruments used {{to measure}} high-frequency backscatter from zooplankton and small fish in the ocean is required if the data are {{to be used to}} estimate biomass and populations from signals at different frequencies. Here we describe a test tank facility for calibrating high-frequency, narrow-band sonars operating at one or more frequencies from 125 kHz to 775 kHz and with beam-widths between 1. 8 and 11 degrees. The all steel tank is cylindrical with a diameter of 2. 43 metres and a length of 6. 10 metres and holds 28. 5 cubic metres of water. The absorbing material on the end wall is a <b>coarse</b> artificial <b>turf</b> which is easily available at minimal cost and reduces high-frequency reverberations in the tank to negligible levels after 6 reflections. Pulsed operation at pinging rates up to 10 Hz is therefore possible without interference from reverberations. Echoes from the target are recorded over a series of pings; the difference between the target strength computed from the mean of those echoes and the known target strength {{is a measure of the}} accuracy of the nominal instrument response calculated from the manufacturer’s transducer characteristics and bench measurements of the system electronics, and therefore allows a calibration correction to be made. An acoustic propagation model of the tank has also been developed to characterize the response of instruments placed in it and to identify optimum target placements. I...|$|R
