40|$|AbstractPrimary {{immunodeficiency}} diseases often fully {{meet the}} definition of "experiments of nature. " Much of the expanding understanding of the lymphoid systems and immunologic functions generated {{in recent years has}} been derived from studying patients with primary, generally genetically determined immunodeficiency diseases, as well as other relatively rare secondary immunodeficiency diseases. Increasing knowledge of immunologic defenses, their interacting cellular and molecular components, the evolving details of sequential stages of cellular differentiation, and the nature and control of the cellular and molecular interactions in immunity have now made it possible to define precisely many primary immunodeficiency diseases in full molecular genetic terms. With this wealth of scientific information based on experimental and clinical research, incredible advances have also been made in using bone marrow transplantation (BMT) often as a curative treatment for immunodeficiency, some 60 to 70 other diseases, leukemias, lymphomas, other cancers, and a rapidly expanding constellation of metabolic diseases or enzyme deficiencies. Also, progress in applying allogeneic BMT to prevent, treat, and cure complex autoimmune diseases, primary immunodeficiency diseases and certain forms of cancers, is considered. Further, mixed BMT (syngeneic plus allogeneic) that establishes a form of stable mixed chimerism has also been employed in animal experiments, which revealed that BMT can be used to treat not only immunodeficiency diseases, but also systemic and organ-specific autoimmune diseases, eg, diabetes and erythematous lupus-like diseases. Moreover, performing BMT in conjunction with organ allografts, eg, thymus or pancreatic transplants, has successfully prevented rejection of these allografts, sometimes without recourse to long-term irradiation or toxic <b>chemical</b> <b>immunosuppressive</b> agents. A crucial role for stromal cells in cellular engineering has now also been realized in animal models as a means of preventing graft rejection and promoting full and persistent reconstitution or correction of genetically-based diseases. With all of these achievements, BMT promises continued dramatic and impressive new approaches to clinical and scientific research and reveals an attractive strategy for the treatment and prevention of many currently intractable human diseases. If these achievements can be extended to larger outbred animals and humans, BMT may set the stage for induction of improved immunologic tolerance and for developing treatments for additional intractable human diseases in the 21 st century.

30|$|Ascomycin, a key {{intermediate}} for <b>chemical</b> {{synthesis of}} <b>immunosuppressive</b> drug pimecrolimus, {{is produced by}} Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus. In order to improve the strain production, the original S. hygroscopicus ATCC 14891 strain was treated here with atmospheric and room temperature plasma to obtain a stable high-producing S. hygroscopicus SFK- 36 strain which produced 495.3  mg/L ascomycin, a 32.5 % increase in ascomycin compared to the ATCC 14891. Then, fermentation medium was optimized using response surface methodology to further enhance ascomycin production. In the optimized medium containing 81.0  g/L soluble starch, 57.4  g/L peanut meal, and 15.8  g/L soybean oil, the ascomycin yield reached 1466.3  mg/L in flask culture. Furthermore, the fermentation process {{was carried out in}} a 5  L fermenter, and the ascomycin yield reached 1476.9  mg/L, which is the highest ascomycin yield reported so far. Therefore, traditional mutagenesis breeding combined with medium optimization is an effective approach for the enhancement of ascomycin production.|$|R
40|$|Primary brain tumours in {{cetaceans}} {{are rare}} with only four {{reported cases of}} intracranial tumours in the scientific literature. A juvenile female, striped dolphin live-stranded at Whitepark Bay, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland, UK, and died after an unsuccessful attempt at refloatation. Necropsy examination revealed a large, soft, non-encapsulated friable mass, which expanded and replaced the frontal lobes, corpus callosum and caudate nucleus {{of the brain and}} extended into the lateral ventricles, displacing the thalamus caudally. Microscopically, this comprised moderately pleomorphic neoplastic cells arranged variably in dense monotonous sheets, irregular streams, ependymal rosettes, ‘ependymoblastomatous rosettes’ and multilayered to pseudostratified tubules. Liquefactive necrosis, palisading glial cells, haemorrhage and mineralization were also observed. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells expressed vimentin but not S 100, glial fibrillary acidic protein, cytokeratin, neuron-specific enolase or synaptophysin. Based on these findings a diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumour was made. Monitoring and recording such cases is crucial as neoplasia may be related to viral, carcinogenic or <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>chemical</b> exposure and can ultimately contribute to assessing the ocean health...|$|R
5000|$|Opportunistic {{pathogens}} {{can cause}} an infectious disease {{in a host}} with depressed resistance (immunodeficiency) or if they have unusual access {{to the inside of}} the body (for example, via trauma). Opportunistic infection may be caused by microbes ordinarily in contact with the host, such as pathogenic bacteria or fungi in the gastrointestinal or the upper respiratory tract, and they may also result from (otherwise innocuous) microbes acquired from other hosts (as in Clostridium difficile colitis) or from the environment as a result of traumatic introduction (as in surgical wound infections or compound fractures). An opportunistic disease requires impairment of host defenses, which may occur as a result of genetic defects (such as Chronic granulomatous disease), exposure to antimicrobial drugs or <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>chemicals</b> (as might occur following poisoning or cancer chemotherapy), exposure to ionizing radiation, or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity (such as with measles, malaria or HIV disease). Primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host.|$|R
40|$|Immunotoxicity of {{xenobiotics}} is {{of growing}} concern for various levels in society, including industry and regulatory authorities. Despite that EU legislation aims at {{reducing the number}} of laboratory animals by promoting the development of alternative validated methods, at present, immunotoxicity is generally evaluated through standard in vivo toxicity studies. The lack of alternative methods is due, in particular, to the complexity of the immune system and its responses, but possibly alternative methods for <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>chemicals</b> are most achievable. The present study describes a long term culture (LTC) method capable of inducing the formation of lymphocyte subsets from human mononuclear bone marrow cells that may allow evaluation of lymphotoxicity. The LTC consisted of a two stages: a myeloid stage to allow the formation of a stromal layer and a lymphoid stage to allow expansion of lymphocytes. Results show that the use of IL- 7 in LTC inhibits precursor and mature B cells, while it supports the proliferation of CD 3 (+) CD 8 (+) and CD 3 (+) CD 4 (+) T-cells. The bone marrow LTC model may in future be used to test the effect of xenobiotics on stromal dependent lymphocyte formation...|$|R
40|$|Human {{cytochrome}} P 450 3 A 4 {{is recognized}} as the catalyst for the oxygen-dependent metabolism of {{a diverse group of}} medically important <b>chemicals,</b> including the <b>immunosuppressive</b> agent cyclosporin; macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin; drugs such as benzphetamine, nifedipine, and cocaine; and steroids; such as cortisol and testosterone to name but a few. We have engineered the cDNA for human cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 by linkage to the cDNA for the rat or human flavoprotein, NADPH-P 450 reductase (NADPH:ferrihemoprotein oxidoreductase, EC 1. 6. 2. 4). An enzymatically active fusion protein (rF 450 [mHum 3 A 4 /mRatOR]L 1) has been expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Enzymatic studies show a requirement for lipid, detergent, and cytochrome b 5 for the 6 beta-hydroxylation of steroids and the N-oxidation of nifedipine. In contrast, these additions are not required for the N-demethylation of erythromycin or benzphetamine. A spectrophotometrically detectable metabolite complex of P 450 3 A 4 is formed during the metabolism of triacetyloleandomycin, and this has a pronounced inhibitory effect on the metabolism of both testosterone and erythromycin. These results relate to the interpretation of current methods used to assess the in vivo activity of P 450 3 A 4...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dysregulation of {{positive}} and negative selection, antigen presentation, or apoptosis in the thymus can lead to immunosuppression or autoimmunity. Diethylstilbestrol (DES), dexamethasone (DEX), cyclophosphamide (CPS), and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) are <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>chemicals</b> that induce similar immunotoxic effects in the thymus, however, the mechanism of toxicity is purported to be different for each compound. Objectives: We hypothesized that genomic analysis of thymus after chemical-induced atrophy would yield transcriptional profiles that suggest pathways of toxicity associated with reduced function. Me t h o d s: Female B 6 C 3 F 1 mice were exposed to these immunosuppressive agents and changes in gene expression and immune cell subpopulations were evaluated. Re s u l t s: All four chemicals induced thymic atrophy and changes in both the relative proportion and absolute number of CD 3 +, CD 4 + /CD 8 –, CD 4 – /CD 8 +, and CD 4 + /CD 8 + thymocytes. The most significant impact of exposure to DEX, DES, and CPS was modulation of gene expression in the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex and TCR and CD 28 signaling pathways; this could represent a common mechanism of action and play a pivotal role in lineage commitment and development of T cells.

40|$|BDE- 47 {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely found {{congeners}} of PBDEs in marine environments. The potential immunomodulatory effects of BDE- 47 on fish complement system were studied using the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma as a model fish. Three-month-old O. melastigma were subjected to short-term (5  days) and long-term (21  days) exposure to two concentrations of BDE- 47 (low dose at 290 ± 172  ng/day; high dose at 580 ± 344  ng/day) via dietary uptake of BDE- 47 encapsulated in Artemia nauplii. Body burdens of BDE- 47 and other metabolic products were analyzed in the exposed and control fish. Only a small amount of debrominated product, BDE- 28, was detected, while other metabolic products were all under detection limit. Transcriptional expression of six major complement system genes involved in complement activation: C 1 r/s (classical pathway), MBL- 2 (lectin pathway), CFP (alternative pathway), F 2 (coagulation pathway), C 3 (the central component of complement system), and C 9 (cell lysis) were quantified in the liver of marine medaka. Endogenous expression of all six complement system genes was found to be higher in males than in females (p < 0. 05). Upon dietary exposure of marine medaka to BDE- 47, expression of all six complement genes were downregulated in males at day 5 (or longer), whereas in females, MBl- 2, CFP, and F 2 mRNAs expression were upregulated, but C 3 and C 9 remained stable with exposure time and dose. A significant negative relationship was found between BDE- 47 body burden and mRNA expression of C 1 r/s, CFP, and C 3 in male fish (r = - 0. 8576 to - 0. 9447). The above findings on changes in complement gene expression patterns indicate the complement system may be compromised in male O. melastigma upon dietary exposure to BDE- 47. Distinct gender difference in expression of six major complement system genes was evident in marine medaka under resting condition and dietary BDE- 47 challenge. The immunomodulatory effects of BDE- 47 on transcriptional expression of these complement components in marine medaka were likely induced by the parent compound instead of biotransformed products. Our results clearly demonstrate that future direction for fish immunotoxicology and risk assessment of <b>immunosuppressive</b> <b>chemicals</b> must include parallel evaluation for both genders. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose- To {{assess the}} state of the art in the {{development}} and practicability of the concept that full and permanent donor specific immunotolerance within a host to allogeneic transplant can be induced with pretransplant hematopoietic stem cell chimerism, i. e., a mixed host/donor immunopotent cell phylogeny in the host after an initial HSC transplant, which becomes a plural immune system mutually tolerant to both host and donor immune codes, thus sparing any immunological crossreactivity between the host and HSC donor. The HSC donor may then hypothetically donate any other tissue without the need for immunosuppressive therapy in the host. Methods- A selective representational literature review Results- Mixed chimerism donor specific immunotolerance is routinely applied in transplant medicine and hematology to reduce dependence on transplant immunosuppressive therapy, augment host immunocompetence with donor lymphocytes, and for a graft versus tumor selectivity against dysplasias. Long term effect and weaning off posttransplant immunosuppressive therapy has been preliminarily achieved and is under study. However, the utilization of the full hypothetical concept is immature, and still requires partially myeloablative conditioning with radio. active or <b>chemical</b> regimens, paradoxical <b>immunosuppressive</b> therapy at induction, growth factor stimulation, and clonal T-cell deletion therapy. Pure immunoprivileged hematopoietic stem cells usually do not engraft without partially myeloablative therapy and the facilitation of mature donor T-cells. Such facilitator cells are not immunoprivileged and thus require paradoxical host immunosuppression anyway in both the host versus graft sense and vice versa. The partially depleted host+donor HSC bed does not repopulate well without growth factor therapy. There is a temporal discrepancy between the thymic reconditioning, i. e., the natural clonal deletion of existing mature T -cells with respect to the differentiated or repopulated phylogeny of the mixed host/donor HSC bed. This represents a potential late rejection mechanism even if the initial HSC engraftment were possible without mature donor Tcells, requiring clonal deletion therapy with specific anti-T-cell. antibodies. Conclusions- A cross representation of articles indicate that full use of the mixed chimerism concept specifically to avoid transplant rejection without any immunosuppression is not practicable at this time. Each of these necessities represents treatment risks and failures in themselves despite the realized and hypothetical potentials. The paradoxical necessities of partially myeloablative conditioning and immunosuppression to achieve stable mixed immunological chimerism in the host defeats the purpose of doing it unless the host 2 ̆ 7 s outlook is already grave. If the host must be exposed to risks equivalent to myeloablation, immunosuppression, and graft versus host disease anyway, mixed chimerism is well-practiced as augmentative donor-specific immunotolerance induction, and is emerging as a way to replace immunosuppressive therapy later on in the course of the life of a graft, but it is not yet practicable by itself. In order to become practicable, the mechanisms requiring myeloablation and of mature donor T-cell facilitation must be elucidated and compensated for, and specific clonal deletion of existing mature host T-cells must be more perfected for prophylactic use without compromising general host immunocompetence. Arguably the only component of the practicable concept with a risk low enough for elective use is growth factor therapy. This currently relegates the concept to only non-elective transplants and dysplasias wherein these risks are already incurred, but with the promising prospect that immunosuppressive therapy may not necessarily be lifelong anymore...|$|R
