If it could be shown {{that this is not}} realizable with m = O (n log log n) <b>common</b> <b>bits</b> then a significant breakthrough in Boolean circuit complexity would follow.

The construction therefore establishes a novel way of realizing communication in the manner of Network Coding for the shift problem, but leaves the viability of the common information approach to proving lower bounds in Circuit Complexity open. The construction uses the graph-theoretic notion of guessing number. As a by-product the paper also establish an interesting link between Circuit Complexity and Network Coding, a new direction of research in multiuser information theory. ...|$|R

With a large number of cheap and unreliable transmitters, it seems unlikely that these transmitters will be able to achieve high precision in synchronizing their transmissions in the cooperative transmission step.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different bit profiles on possible fracture modes was investigated using Finite Element Method. The International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) classification {{was used to}} design 14 types of profiles. The formation model was built, with given bit size, formation properties, meshing method and boundary conditions, etc. Moreover, the pseudo-static state and mass scaling were used to reduce the simulation time and increase the simulation accuracy. The simulation results showed that, for nine <b>common</b> <b>bit</b> profiles, larger cone height led to larger area of high stress zone, and the gauge height was not apparently related to the stress generated. When the gauge height decreased, the high stress zone turned from the nose and center to the gauge zone. For the non-common bit profiles, the convex bit produced larger high stress field, and the pilot section bottom of bicentre bits had concentrated stress. Fractures were created in the gauge zones and noses, and the bits with larger cone height and gauge height induced longer vertical fractures. The flat and convex bits did not generate longer vertical fractures. The bicentre bit can hinder the vertical fractures in the gauge zone, but enables the horizontal fractures easier.

40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{introducing}} a novel technique called as redundant binary booth algorithm. The redundant binary {{in the design}} of high-speed digital multipliers is beneficial due to its high modularity and carry-free addition. Generally, in a high radix modified Booth encoding algorithm the partial products are reduced in multiplication process. But it yields complexity in producing in generation of hard multiples. Therefore booth encoding scheme along with redundant binary scheme solve this problem by using Booth encoder, RB partial product generator, RB partial product accumulator, RB to NB converter stages. In this process after booth encoding the two booths encoded digits are polarized in to differential pair to restore the effective RB partial product reduction rate without the NB to RB conversion over head. A new Booth encoding algorithm is presented in this project to simplify the generation of hard multiples and reduce the number of RB partial products without {{introducing a}}ny form of correction vector. The proposed algorithm binds two adjacent Booth encoders to compose an RB partial product by exploiting the RB coding. The <b>common</b> <b>bit</b> of the two adjacent Booth encoders is used as an enabler for the polarization of two equally weighted partial product bits. As the formation of an RB partial product digit is analogous to the charge sharing of two oppositely charged atoms in a covalent bond, we name the algorithm the covalent redundant binary Booth encoding.

3000|$|For {{increasing}} {{values of}} n, the brute force generation process becomes unfeasible, {{and more sophisticated}} techniques shall be applied [13]. A useful overview of possible alternative approaches suggested in the literature {{may be found in}} [17]. However, the main limitation of such solutions is related to the reduced number of sequences they allow to obtain by a single generation step. As a consequence, in this article, we opted for a generation strategy that we named [...] "tree approach". Basically, sequence generation starts with n zeros (the all-zero n-tuple shall be always included in a period of a span n De Bruijn sequence) and appends a one or a zero, as the next bit of the sequence, thus originating two branches. As long as the last n-tuple in the partial sequence obtained has not yet appeared before, generation goes on by iterating the process; otherwise the generation path is discarded. This generation scheme that proceeds by parallel branches is fast to execute, and has the advantage of providing the whole set of sequences that we need to perform our correlation-related evaluations. However, the approach suggested suffers for memory limitations, because all the sequences having the same span n must be generated at the same time. As a consequence, taking into account our focus on the correlation properties of the sequences, we introduce in the generation process a constraint related to cross-correlation: when two generation paths share a common pattern of bits in their initial root, one of them is pruned, in order to reduce a priori the number of sequences that will provide high cross-correlation, due to the presence of <b>common</b> <b>bit</b> patterns.|$|E
