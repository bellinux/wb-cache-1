The classification of chemical compounds used as irritants, and their structure - activity relationship established through different studies has been examined. A review of toxic effects which is different from irritancy of Adamsite, w- <b>chloroacetophenone</b> (CN), o-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile (CS) and Dibenz (b,f), [1, 4] - oxazepine (CR) has been presented...|$|E

CNTs used in this research were synthesized using Floating Catalyst â€“ Chemical Vapor Deposition (FC-CVD) method in optimum condition. The synthesized CNTs were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Raman Spectroscopy. The variation of resistance changes towards the tested gases were recorded using a multimeter. CNTs sensor pellet showed good responses towards the tested gases, however, the sensitivity, response time and recovery time of sensor pellet need to be optimized...|$|E
40|$|After the World War II, approx. 40. 000 tonnes of {{chemical}} munitions containing about 13. 000 tonnes {{of chemical}} warfare agents (CWAs) were {{dumped in the}} Baltic Sea [1]. As the artillery shells, aircraft bombs and containers are corroding, the contents are leaking into the environment contaminating the surrounding sediments but also spreading far beyond the dumpsite boundaries [2]. Thus, the necessity of investigations {{on the impact of}} chemical warfare on biota, such as inorganic arsenic and organo-arsenic compounds, is increasing. Among the dumped CWAs are the vesicant mustard gas (Bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide), the tear gas <b>chloroacetophenone</b> (2 -Chloro- 1 -phenylethanone) as well as the irritants Clark I (Diphenylarsinechloride) and Adamsite (10 -Chloro- 5 -hydrophenarsazine(10)) [3]. Persistent contaminations at dumping sites are mostly related to arsenic containing compounds [2]. Thus, arsenic containing CWAs have been chosen as model CWAs in the present study. Here, we present the first approach to investigate biological effects of CWA mixtures on the health of blue mussels (M. trossulus) under laboratory conditions. The evaluation of the health status was based on a great array of biomarkers encompassing immunocompetence, oxidative stress defence and pathological alterations in different tissues. Chemical analysis of tissue and water samples facilitated an integrated assessment. ...|$|E
40|$|Within this thesis, primary the {{application}} of optically active phosphoniumsalts in asymmetric phase transfer catalysis is described. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} Darzens-reaction of benzaldehyde and <b>chloroacetophenone.</b> First, achiral phosphoniumsalts were used under variation {{of the structure of the}} salt, temperature, reaction time and base. This was followed by the synthesis of polymerbound alkltriphenylphosphonium iodides, which were repeatedly used up to 18 times in a row as phase transfer catalysts. To obtain optically active phosphoniumsalts, first optically active phosphane precursors were quarternised with methyl iodine. Subsequently, phosphoniumsalts were derived from diphenylphosphino benzoic acid amides. The use of diphenylphosphino benzoic acid pentafluorophenol esters paved the way for the synthesis of a wide range of amides, which were obtained by conversion with diverse amines. It was found that sterically demanding substituents in alpha-position to the amide group led to the highest enantiomeric excesses, whereas the enantioselectivity dropped in case of substitution at the beta position. The highest enantiomeric excess was obtained with the methyl phosphonium iodine of ortho-diphenylphosphino benzoic acid coupled with adamantyl glycinole in 36 % ee and 13 % yield. The role of the hydroxy group is not clear yet, however it appears that an sp 3 -Carbon in alpha-position to the nitrogen of the amide group has an advantage. The application of an "inverse" salt derived from diphenylphosphino aniline, as well as optically active oxosulfoniumsalts and optically active copper complexes, led to racemic products. Quite interesting results were observed with an optically active P-chiral phosphoniumsalts, although products were generated with moderate enantioselectivities and yields (7 %ee and 8 % yield). Except two, the corresponding phosphanes are not reported in literature to date. Thus, they were tested as ligands in numerous metal-catalyzed reactions including: rhodium catalyzed hydrosilylation, palladium catalyzed allylic substitutions, hydroamination of cyclohexadiene, hydrovinylation, rhodium-catalyzed 1, 2 -addition and ruthenium catalyzed transfer hydrogenation...|$|E
40|$|This volume, {{the second}} {{in a series of}} three devoted to the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) in World War II, now the Chemical Corps, covers research, development, procurement, and {{distribution}} of chemical warfare materiel. It traces the history of these activities from the World War I period, when the CWS was activated to supervise the offensive and defensive aspects of gas warfare throughout the Army, until the end of World War II. The first volume in the series, "Organizing for War", discusses the development of the CWS organization and mission as well as personnel management and military training. The third volume, entitled "Chemicals in Combat", will deal with the chemical warfare activities in the theaters of operations. In treating research and development, the present volume concentrates on CWS projects that proved of greatest significance to the armed forces during World War II. It attempts to point up the problems that arose in course of research and development and to indicate the solutions which the scientists hit upon. Since research and development in the zone of the interior was closely related to research and development in the theaters of operations, the volume covers activities in both areas. In contrast to research and development, procurement and distribution differed considerably as between the zone of the interior and the theaters of operations; in the theaters these activities were closely associated with the commanders' combat responsibilities. The volume, therefore, confines itself to a review of procurement and distribution in the zone of the interior, leaving narration of theater activities to the volume "Chemicals in combat". U. S. G.
