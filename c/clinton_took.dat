5|$|Shortly after <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> office, Richard Mellon Scaife, a {{conservative}} newspaper owner, organized a fundraising campaign to smear Clinton's {{image in the}} media.

5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E

5|$|The {{appointment}} {{required a}} Saxbe fix, passed and {{signed into law}} in December 2008. Confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee began on January 13, 2009, {{a week before the}} Obama inauguration; two days later, the Committee voted 16–1 to approve Clinton. By this time, her public approval rating had reached 65percent, the highest point since the Lewinsky scandal. On January 21, 2009, Clinton was confirmed in the full Senate by a vote of 94–2. <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> the oath of office of Secretary of State, resigning from the Senate later that day. She became the first former first lady to serve in the United States Cabinet.|$|E
5|$|When Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> {{office as}} President in January 1993, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the First Lady and her press {{secretary}} reiterated {{that she would}} be using that form of her name. She was the first inaugural First Lady to have earned a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the White House. She was also the first to have an office in the West Wing of the White House in addition to the usual first lady offices in the East Wing. She was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven top-level positions and dozens more lower-level ones. After Eleanor Roosevelt, Clinton was regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in American history.|$|E

He went on to be Commodore and Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1736 but, with the War of Jenkins' Ear looming, he stepped down to take command of the third-rate HMS Prince Frederick in 1739 and of the second-rate HMS Marlborough in 1740 during the War of the Austrian Succession.|$|E
25|$|Five years later, the {{revitalization}} of 125th Street resumed, {{with the construction of}} a Starbucks outlet backed in part by Magic Johnson (1999), the first supermarket in Harlem in 30 years, the Harlem USA retail complex, which included the first first-run movie theater in many years (2000), and a new home for the Studio Museum in Harlem (2001). In the same year, former president Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> office space in Harlem, at 55 West 125th Street. In 2002, a large retail and office complex called Harlem Center was completed at the corner of Lenox and 125th. There has been extensive new construction and rehabilitation of older buildings in the years since.|$|E
25|$|<b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> {{the oath}} of office of Secretary of State. Just before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton {{resigned}} her senate seat effective just hours before her oath as Secretary of State. She became the first former First Lady to serve in the United States Cabinet. She also became the first Secretary of State to have previously been an elected official since Edmund Muskie's less-than-a-year stint in 1980, with Christian Herter during the Eisenhower administration being the last one before that. In being selected by her formal rival Obama, she became only the fourth person in the preceding hundred years to join the cabinet of someone they had run against for their party's presidential nomination that election year (Jack Kemp ran against and was later chosen by George H. W. Bush to be Secretary of HUD in 1988, George W. Romney by Richard Nixon for Secretary of HUD in 1968, and Philander Knox by William Howard Taft for Secretary of State in 1908 preceded her; Obama's pick of Tom Vilsack for Secretary of Agriculture followed her {{a couple of weeks later}} to be the next such person).|$|E

50|$|During the {{campaign}} of 1982, Clinton promised to make major strides in education, including a large investment of public money, but he avoided saying he would raise taxes.

25|$|Barack Obama {{scored a}} major victory in the Iowa Democratic Caucuses due {{to a number of}} factors. According to exit polls, 93 percent of voters in the Iowa Democratic Caucus were Caucasian and 33 percent voted for Obama, 27 percent for Clinton, and 24 percent for Edwards; 4 percent of voters were African American and 72 percent voted for Obama, 16 percent for Clinton, and 8 percent for Edwards; 3 percent {{represented}} other races and they went 49 percent for Obama, 26 percent for Clinton, 10 percent for Richardson, and 5 percent for Edwards. Obama also won young voters ages 17–44 with 52 percent of the vote compared to 16 percent for both Clinton and Edwards. Edwards won middle-age voters ages 45–59 with 30 percent while Obama received 29 percent and <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> in 26 percent of their support. Clinton did best among elderly voters ages 60 and over with 40 percent of the vote while Edwards received 27 percent and Obama took in 19.5 percent of their support. Obama won self-identified Democrats by a margin of 32-31-23 (Obama-Clinton-Edwards), Independents backed Obama 41-23-17 (Obama-Edwards-Clinton), as well as self-identified Republicans who supported Obama 44-32-10 (Obama-Edwards-Clinton). Obama also won moderates and liberals but Edwards won conservatives. Socioeconomic class was not really a factor in how voters made their decisions, as Obama won all groups of family incomes.|$|E

He engaged in various fundraising efforts during 2015 {{in an effort to}} reduce this debt, which brought about some criticism from The Center for Public Integrity that these efforts were not fully transparent. He had planned to raise money towards paying off that debt at his 85th birthday celebration to be held at the Plaza Hotel that month. Guests included Lady Gaga, Tony Bennett, and Hillary Clinton, however <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> over Rangel's party as a [...] "Hillary for America" [...] event to raise money for her 2016 presidential campaign.|$|E

5000|$|The Clinton Foundation {{has been}} praised {{as a force}} for good, and {{condemned}} as a [...] "slush fund".

60|$|So the <b>Clintons</b> <b>took</b> {{one of the}} twenty-three similar {{houses on}} the {{left-hand}} side of the street, and there lived in peaceful happiness. But Mr Clinton always pointed the finger of scorn at the houses opposite, and he never rubbed {{the back of his}} hands so heartily as when he could point out to his wife that such-and-such a number was having its roof repaired; and when the builder went bankrupt, he cut out the notice in the paper and sent it to his spouse anonymously....|$|R

500|$|On 24 May, the day Howe sailed for England, General <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> over as {{commander-in-chief}} of British armies in America, {{and made}} preparations for an overland march to New York. Howe arrived back in England on 1 July, {{where he and}} his brother faced censure for their actions in North America. [...] It is likely that the resignation of both William and his brother Richard was due to their desire to hurry home to vindicate their conduct during the campaign. In 1779 Howe and his brother demanded a parliamentary inquiry into their actions. [...] The inquiry that followed was unable to confirm any charges of impropriety or mismanagement levelled against either of them. Because of the inconclusive nature of the inquiry, attacks continued to be made against Howe in pamphlets and the press, and in 1780 he published a response to accusations levelled by Loyalist Joseph Galloway, who issued a reply that harshly criticized the general's conduct and accused him of deliberately undermining the war effort {{for the benefit of the}} anti-war Whig faction in Parliament.|$|E
500|$|When Cornwallis reached Portsmouth, {{he began}} embarking troops {{pursuant}} to Clinton's orders. [...] On July 20, with some transports {{almost ready to}} sail, new orders arrived that countermanded the previous ones. [...] In the most direct terms, Clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep-water port, using as much of his army as he thought necessary. <b>Clinton</b> <b>took</b> this decision because the navy had long been dissatisfied with New York as a naval base, firstly because sand bars obstructed {{the entrance to the}} Hudson River, damaging the hulls of the larger ships; and secondly because the river often froze in winter, imprisoning vessels inside the harbour. [...] Arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development, Clinton now acceded to the Navy's request, despite Cornwallis's warning that the Chesapeake's open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there [...] "will always be exposed to sudden French attack." [...] It was to prove a fatal error of judgement by Clinton, since the need to defend the new facility denied Cornwallis any freedom of movement [...] Nevertheless, having inspected Portsmouth and found it less favourable than Yorktown, Cornwallis wrote to Clinton informing him that he would fortify Yorktown.|$|E
