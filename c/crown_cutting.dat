50|$|This shark {{is known}} from the fossil teeth and fossilized {{vertebral}} centra. Like other elasmobranchs, the skeleton of Otodus was composed of cartilage and not bone, resulting in relatively few preserved skeletal structures appearing within the fossil record. The teeth of this shark are large with triangular <b>crown,</b> smooth <b>cutting</b> edges, and visible cusps on the roots. Some Otodus teeth also show signs of evolving serrations.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{discovery}} that Victoria, the future German Empress, had stayed in Versailles and Saint-Cloud (a town destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War) during her unofficial visit to France in 1891, the Ligue incited a public uproar. The disorder surrounding the visit eventually resulted in the <b>Crown</b> Princess <b>cutting</b> her trip short and being escorted under French military protection, for her safety, to Calais to board a ship to England.|$|R
50|$|A <b>crown</b> race <b>cutting</b> tool is a {{hand tool}} used to counter-ream {{and face the}} base of the fork column at the crown (known as the crown race seat). A single cutter is usually used to perform both aspects of the cutting operation. The process {{machines}} the crown race seat to be precisely perpendicular to the steering column axis and of the correct press-fit diameter, ensuring the proper alignment of the crown race with the lower headset bearing.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of resin composite to enamel treated with Er:YAG laser. It was used 33 human third molars. After the dental <b>crowns</b> <b>cutting,</b> the mesial and distal surfaces were embedded perpendicularly to the PVC cylinders long axis. Enamel was ground and the samples were randomly divided into 6 groups: G 1 - phosphoric acid (control), G 2 - Er:YAG laser (60 mJ/ 10 Hz), G 3 - Er:YAG (100 mJ/ 10 Hz), G 4 - Er:YAG (60 mJ/ 10 Hz + acid), G 5 - Er:YAG (100 mJ/ 10 Hz + acid), G 6 - Er:YAG (80 mJ/ 2 Hz). In all groups, Single Bond was used and resin composite cylinders (Z 100) were prepared. The samples were stored in distilled water at 37 oC for 24 hours and submitted to shearing test. G 1 presented bond strength values significantly higher than G 2, G 3 and G 6. The groups irradiated only with Er:YAG laser, in different intensities and frequencies, were equivalent as for the bond strength values. The groups treated with laser + acid presented strength values statistically equal {{to those of the}} control group. The enamel treatment with phosphoric acid, or its association with laser, is important to obtain good bond. The use of Er: YAG laser alone is not recommended, considering the conditions tested in this study...|$|R

6000|$|Some other {{peculiarities of}} the {{dentition}} {{of the horse}} must be noticed, as they bear upon what I shall have to say by and by. Thus the <b>crowns</b> of the <b>cutting</b> teeth have a peculiar deep pit, which {{gives rise to the}} well-known [...] "mark" [...] of the horse. There is a large space between the outer incisors and the front grinder. In this space the adult male horse presents, near the incisors on each side, above and below, a canine or [...] "tush," [...] which is commonly absent in mares. In a young horse, moreover, there is not unfrequently to be seen in front of the first grinder, a very small tooth, which soon falls out. If this small tooth be counted as one, it will be found that there are seven teeth behind the canine on each side; namely, the small tooth in question, and the six great grinders, among which, by an unusual peculiarity, the foremost tooth is rather larger than those which follow it.|$|R
60|$|Why, exclaims the Officer, {{there are}} a dozen ways out. Let us find one of them. You, A., have been faithless to your wife. Well, when the matter is {{explained}} to her, I daresay she will forgive you. You, B., have defrauded your employer. Well, employers are not always relentless. I'll call on him this evening and talk the matter over. You, C., are hopelessly in debt through horse-racing or speculation. Well, at the worst you can go through the Court and start afresh. You, D., have committed a crime. Go and own up to it like a man, stand your trial, and work out your sentence. I daresay it won't be so very heavy if you take that course, and we will look after you when it is over. You, E., have been brought into this state through your miserable vices, drink, or whatever they may be. Cure yourself of the vices--we'll show you how--don't <b>crown</b> them by <b>cutting</b> your throat like a cur. You, F., have been afflicted with great sorrows. Well, those sorrows have some purpose and some meaning. There's always a dawn beyond the night; wait for that dawn; it will come here or hereafter.|$|R
5000|$|The English word clergy {{derives from}} the same root as clerk and {{can be traced to}} the Latin clericus which {{derives from the}} Greek word kleros meaning a [...] "lot" [...] or [...] "portion" [...] or [...] "office". The term Clerk in Holy Orders is still the {{technical}} title for certain Christian clergy, and its usage is prevalent in ecclesiastical and Canon Law. Holy Orders refer to any recipient of the Sacrament of Ordination, both the Major Orders (bishops, priests and deacons) and the now less known Minor Orders (Acolyte, Lector, Exorcist and Porter) who, save for certain reforms made at the Second Vatican Council in the Roman Catholic Church, were called clerics or Clerk, which is simply a shorter form of Cleric. Clerics were distinguished from the laity by having received, in a formal rite of introduction into the clerical state, the tonsure or corona (<b>crown)</b> which involved <b>cutting</b> hair from the top and side of the head leaving a circlet of hair which symbolised the Crown of Thorns worn by Christ at His crucifixion. Though Christian in origin, the term can be applied by analogy to functions in other religious traditions. For example, a rabbi can be referred to as being a clergy member.|$|R
40|$|Although liana cutting benefi ts for {{tropical}} timber management have been documented, benefi ts for {{non-timber forest product}} (NTFP) management have not. We tested the silvicultural recommendation that lianas should be cut from Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) to improve host tree fecundity and thus, commercial nut yields. Our 10 -year experiment was conducted where local harvesters collect Brazil nuts {{as part of their}} forest-based livelihoods. We cut 454 lianas from 78 of 138 host trees &# 8805; 50 cm DBH. Treated trees were better producers 3. 5 years after liana cutting, and by years 9 and 10 produced three times more fruits than untreated trees. Number of lianas rooted within 5 m of the host tree explained production levels, suggesting both above- and belowground liana competition. Once host crowns were liana free, branch regrowth was highly visible, and crown reassessments suggested that liana <b>cutting</b> improved <b>crown</b> form. Liana <b>cutting</b> may induce non-producing trees to become producers and may circumvent mortality of heavily infested trees. Only lianas associated with Brazil nut trees should be cut to conserve liana ecosystem functions. Liana cutting could be applied to other tropical trees to boost NTFP fruit and seed production and increase host tree fecundity. 2014 Editado por: John A. Parrota; Cynthia F. Moser; Amy J.

40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic rotary-hammer drill (USRoHD) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the collection of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC). As described below, the USRoHD has several features, not present in a basic USDC, that increase efficiency and provide some redundancy against partial failure. USDCs and related apparatuses were conceived for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. They have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: A USDC {{can be characterized as}} a lightweight, lowpower, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. A basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, an ultrasonic transducer horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can bounce axially a short distance between hard stops on the horn and the bit), and a tool bit. The piezoelectric stack creates ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. The bouncing of the free mass between the hard stops generates the sonic vibrations. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that unlike in conventional twist drilling, little applied axial force is needed to make the apparatus advance into the material of interest. There are numerous potential applications for USDCs and related apparatuses in geological exploration on Earth and on remote planets. In early USDC experiments, it was observed that accumulation of cuttings in a drilled hole causes the rate of penetration of the USDC to decrease steeply with depth, and that the rate of penetration can be increased by removing the cuttings. The USRoHD concept provides for removal of cuttings in the same manner as that of a twist drill: An USRoHD includes a USDC and a motor with gearhead (see figure). The USDC provides the bit hammering and the motor provides the bit rotation. Like a twist drill bit, the shank of the tool bit of the USRoHD is fluted. As in the operation of a twist drill, the rotation of the fluted drill bit removes cuttings from the drilled hole. The USRoHD tool bit is tipped with a replaceable <b>crown</b> having <b>cutting</b> teeth on its front surface. The teeth are shaped to promote fracturing of the rock face through a combination of hammering and rotation of the tool bit. Helical channels on the outer cylindrical surface of the crown serve as a continuation of the fluted surface of the shank, helping to remove cuttings. In the event of a failure of the USDC, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a twist drill. Similarly, in the event of a failure of the gearmotor, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a USDC...|$|R
