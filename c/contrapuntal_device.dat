He employs virtuosic figurations (the so-called glosa) in his works to a much greater extent, often at the expense of contrapuntal development; after the initial exposition, restatements of the theme are rare, and thematic development and use of <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>devices</b> such as inversion or augmentation are almost non-existent. Correa's harmonic language, while not devoid of tonally suggestive progressions, is quite distinctly modal and represents a continuation of the idiom established by Cabezón and Aguilera de Heredia.|$|R

A typical Froberger ricercare or fantasia uses a single subject (with different rhythmic variations for different sections) throughout the whole piece, and the counterpoint adheres almost flawlessly to the 16th century prima pratica. Any of the standard <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>devices</b> may be used; the main subject is sometimes paired with another theme for a section or two, and there is usually a marked contrast between sections and much variety inside a single piece.|$|R

Another motet from this same book is a mensuration canon, that most difficult of all contrapuntal forms to carry off. While many composers were reacting to the strictures of the Council of Trent against excessive polyphonic practice, Porta evidently felt unobliged to follow them; perhaps he had sufficient confidence in his skill in conveying the text.

Broad, sweeping melodies frequently inform whole strains of his allemandes and courantes. However, beneath the pleasing melodic surface there frequently is a substantial degree of polyphonic complexity, and carefully concealed <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>devices</b> are quite common in Chambonnières's works even if most of the pieces are more homophonic rather than fully polyphonic. In Allemande La rare, for example, both strains have a canonic structure which is easy to miss: while the contours and pitches are subjected to canonic treatment, the durations are not. The following courante paraphrases the melody of the allemande. Such structural connections are not uncommon in Chambonnières's suites, and sometimes they define subgroups in manuscript collections: the three courantes of the third suite of the livre premier are a prime example, linked by a scale motif both in the published versions and in the Oldham manuscript, where they too appear together, in the same sequence. The same suite has more examples of imitative counterpoint worked into the dance texture, e.g., in the final gigue and in the thematic importance of the tenor voice in the three- and four-part textures of the first few pieces.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{examination}} of the musical style of Richard Strauss has been {{to determine if there}} are elements in his compositions which represent significant contributions to music. This study was limited to a discussion of the tone poems, since they were adequate for an elucidation of his style and since it is generally conceded that they represent his greatest contribution in the field of instrumental writing. The musical content of his works was discussed from three angles, thematic material, <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>devices</b> and harmonic structure. It was pointed out that in many respects he utilized Classic and Romantic principles. This adherence to the traditional was also evident in the various forms he employed in the tone poems. In regard to his orchestration he admitted his indebtedness to Wagner. While he believed in expressing things in the simplest way possible, he was fascinated with the challenge of scoring for an enlarged orchestra. In contrast to the emphasis on traditional elements in the writing of Strauss, his singular treatment of the melodic line stands out as perhaps his most significant contribution. It is in the ingeniousness of his thematic material that his inventive power is most apparent. The rhythmic and melodic peculiarities of his motives explain the particular flavor of the Straussian style. Because of his re-interpretation of the melodic line as a dynamic power rather than a song-like melody, audiences found his music bold and daring, and some regarded it as the antithesis to music. The particular contour of his themes {{is one of the most}} important characteristics of his style because it determined the entire form of his composition. Themes such as these could be best exploited by the vast coloristic possibilities of the modern orchestra, and the poetic ideas which generated them found their logical means of expansion in the symphonic poem. As a result this instrumental form was recognized as a medium for expressing the utmost poetic power of music. The tone poem was established as an instrumental form capable of concise and exact definition of a poetic idea. Orchestral players were required to play in the capacity of virtuosos, and instruments like the bass clarinet and tuba assumed considerable importance in the exposition of the whole. Thus it may be stated that while there is much that is imitative in the writing of Strauss, his creativeness is most evident in the nature of his thematic ideas. His brilliant scoring represented new heights in the coloristic possibilities of the orchestra. Since these ideas reached their fulfillment through orchestral instruments, contributions to instrumental music have thus been realized. Advisor: Emanuel Wishno...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} recital was to represent the stylistic development of selected piano works from the Classic, Romantic, and Contemporary periods. Since the sonata form was a prominent genre of the Classic period, a Beethoven sonata was chosen {{for the opening of}} the recital. This sonata showed an inexhaustible wealth of ideas and refinement of thematic and harmonic treatment. Beethoven's Sonata in E-flat major, op. 31 no. 3 exhibited a typical four-movement sonata form, with four highly contrasting sections. These contrasts were even more remarkable in that not one of the sonata had a slow tempo. The first movement of the sonata opened in the sub-dominant, which was emphasized throughout the exposition. The tonic was hinted at only fleetingly. The entire exposition had a blurred tonality although the key signature indicated E-flat major. The second movement, a Scherzo with the tempo marked Allegro-Vivace, was different from others though named scherzo by Beethoven himself. while most scherzos were in triple meter and had a contrasting trio, this section was in 2 / 4 meter and in sonata form. The Menuet showed an interesting harmonic treatment of dominant ninth and diminished seventh chords. The last movement had a motoristic mono rhythm which gave contrast to the previous movement. The contemporary piece was Sonata para Piano, selected from the works of the Latin American composer, Albert Ginastera. This four movement piece showed a twentieth century treatment of harmony and style in the framework of the classical form. The first movement was in sonata allegro form; the second movement, rondo form; the third movement was improvisational, resembling a recitativo, and the last movement had a powerful ostinato bass, alternating consistently every other bar using 3 / 8 and 6 / 16 meters. Each movement had different moods, with typical dance rhythms of Latin America. The twelve-tone-row technique was seen in modified form in the second movement. Schumann's Symphonic Etudes was chosen as the final piece of the recital. this composition consisted of a theme and twelve variations. It was a good demonstration of variation technique and characteristic moods of each piece. From the theme, which was rather somber and slow, Schumann composed pieces of variety and profundity. Often he treated the theme of the descending arpeggio without any alteration, but more often he worked with new ideas which germinated from the theme. In some variations, a new theme was introduced and juxtaposed with the original theme, while in others there was some remoteness from the original theme. Chordal and <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>devices</b> were used individually or combined to make a chordal canon or chordal imitation. With the grandioso finale, this work served as a brilliant ending to the recital. The study of these works assisted the performer in reinforcing and developing technical skills and musical profundity.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 296 - 299). Faure's oeuvre presents one of {{the most}} outstanding accomplishments in the history of French music. His style, though showing the influence of late-Romantic music, is unique and comprises some of the most inventive harmonic language to be found in Western music. It is characterised by the complex integration of advanced tonal and modal procedures. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine certain aspects of Faure's style through an analysis of the composer's First Piano Quartet in C minor Op. 15. The study is divided into two sections: a structural analysis which examines the overall formal structure of the work, as well as the larger and smaller formal structures within each movement, and a harmonic analysis which examines how Faure uses certain chord structures and harmonic procedures. The main source used for the study was the score of the Piano Quartet itself. Other major sources which proved invaluable in terms of providing a background to the composer's life, work and style, include works by Charles Koechlin, Percy Suckling, Robert Orledge and Jean-Michel Nectoux. Other works by Faure as well as those of other late-Romantic composers are used to compare or establish common stylistic tendencies and to examine possible influences. The conclusions are drawn directly from the analysis and are supported by various source materials. Those on formal structure include observations on Faure's use of sonata form and ternary form, his approach to thematic development, motivic elaboration, phrasing and texture, and his use of <b>contrapuntal</b> and rhythmic <b>devices.</b> Those on harmony are primarily concerned with the influence of modality on Faure's approach to harmony and include observations on Faure's use of triads, quru 1 ads, quintads, sextads and ambiguous compounds, and of pedal points and other non-chord notes...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversitySince in {{the twentieth}} century the piano is no longer the {{important}} instrument that {{it had been in the}} nineteenth century, composers write less for it in any form, especially the sonata-form. The most prolific composers have been the Americans and the Russians with Scriabin, Prokofieff, Medtner and Miaskowski extremely active. Prokofieff, for example, wrote nine sonatas. Many of the most important artists of the century have completely ignored the form; Sibelius, Schoenberg, Debussy writing no piano sonatas whatsoever, and Strauss and Berg writing sonatas only in their youth. Bartok, Stravinsky and Ravel have each written only one work in this form. There is, nevertheless, a sizeable group of sonatas to be investigated as many composers have published works in this form. Sonatas from the following countries were examined: Germany, Austria, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Russia, France, Italy, Spain, Latin America, Great Britain, and the United States. In considering each country, a brief historical background of those composers writing piano sonatas was included. The sonatas were analyzed according to: (1) musical form, (2) melodic content, (3) rhythmic elements, (4) harmonic characteristics, (5) <b>contrapuntal</b> <b>devices,</b> (6) pianistic styles and devices, and (7) general characteristics and trends. Contrasts, similarities, influences were noted and an effort was made to ascertain the directions the sonata style was following in each of the countries. From the individual countries works of the following composers were examined: (Germany) Boris Blacher, Ferruccio Busoni, Helmut Degen, Wolfgang Fortner, Harald Genzmer, Paul Hindemith, Karel Husa, Phillip Jarnach, the Swiss Rolf Liebermann and the Finn Yrjo Kilpinen; (Austria) Alban Berg, Gottfried Einem, Berthold Goldschmidt, Otto Jokl, Ernst Krenek, Franz Salmhofer, Leopold Spinner, and Ernst Toch; (Poland) Alexander Transman; (Roumania) Karol Rathaus; (Czechoslovakia) Alois Haba, Emil Axman and Erwin Schulhoff; (Hungary) Bela Bartok and Alexander Jemnitz; (Russia) Anatol Alexandrov, V.

It was found that most of the composers have followed the traditional sonata-form. Usually, a sonata-allegro serves as first movement followed by a slow movement and one or more rapid movements. The fugue appears often enough to be a significant device in the modern sonata. The most noteworthy examples are the fugues by Barber, Hindemith, Carter and Dutilleux. There are fine sets of variations in the Sonatas of Fuleihan and Dutilleux (Choral and Variations). The later Sonatas (6 - 10) of Scriabin are exceptions to the usual form, consisting of but one movement with different metrical sections. There are distinguished one-movement Sonatas by Bax, Berg, Krein, Prokofieff in his First and Third, but the form, as devised by Liszt, has not attracted a wide following. Instances of this form among American composers are the works of Barth, Harrison, Josten, Turner and Steinert. Some few works are loosely constructed formally and suggest fantasies or rhapsodies rather than a traditional sonata-form. Such a work is the Sonata of Hovhaness which abounds in cadenzas and improvisatory effects. The Sonatas of Sorabji are likewise nebulous in structure and content. Greatest experimenting with rhythms is noticeable in works of the following composers: Scriabin who created complicated patterns involving binary and ternary rythms in unusual combinations, Stravinsky, Krein, Harris, Bartok, Antheil, Becker, Chavez, and Blacher, all of whom employ frequent metrical changes within a comparatively brief section. Ives and Sorabji, both highly daring, dispense with bar lines or metrical indications. Harmonically, there are a number of sonatas written in a conservative manner, even some of the more recent works. Instances of this conservatism are found in works of Campbell-Tipton, Maganini, MacFadyen, MacDowell, Converse, Powell, Shepherd, Steinert, Stockhoff, Collingwood, Jarvis-Read, Dukas, D'Indy, Genzmer, Degen, Raphael, Rathaus Axman, Schulhoff, Gretchaninoff, Alexandrov, Glazounoff, Medtner, E. Halffter, Turina, Bastianelli, Castlenuovo-Tedesco, Bucchi, Mainardi, and J. M. Castro. Highly individual are the harmonic idioms of Copland, Griffes, Ives, Milhaud, Ravel, Hindemith, Einem, Krenek, Husa, Bartok, Prokofieff, Kabalevsky, Scriabin, Slostakovitch, and Stravinsky. Free contrapuntal writing is responsible for some highly dissonant passages as, for example, a canon of three voices in the Bartok Sonata in which the three voices move at an interval of a ninth. Charles Griffes also achieved original effects from his use of dissonant contrapuntal voices. Stravinsky creates curious effects by the unusual contrapuntal arrangements of his voices. Likewise, Scriabin with his use of the chord built upon fourths and the manner in which the voices are arranged is responsible for unorthodox harmonies. The counterpoint of Milhaud forms unexpected harmonies. Atonality is the basis for the Sonatas of Ardevol, Chavez, Dallapiccola, Liebermann and Spinner vith Spinner being the only one to adopt the twelve-tone technique. Such composers as Rachmaninoff, Lopatnikoff, Miaskowski, Golubev, Frolov employ a form of contrapuntal writing which is more pianistic than intellectual. It is designed to bring out the richest possible sonorities from the piano. While there is considerable ingenuine and originality of style, the traditional idioms of Chopin, Schumann, Brahms appear in many of the works, even up to the present. In 1943, Lopatnikoff imitates the style of Chopin while at the same time Prokofieff in his Eighth Sonata writes in the manner of Schumann. Brahms' influence is selt in Arthur Shepherd, Medtner, Rathaus and Goldschmidt. The techniques of impressionism do not lend themselves to the formality of the classic sonata-form although Ravel, Ruyneman and Auric have composed sonatas in the idiom. There are instances of slow movements which are influenced by some of the impressionistic devices as, for example, the slow movement of the Elliot Griffis Sonata. Likewise, there appear brief passages which are reminiscent of impressionistic tone-painting in a number of different sonatas. The style of Scriabin is unique and may be termed a considerable contribution to piano technique. He employs widely-spaced figurations which cover the keyboard with their complexity. He seems to have had few imitators besides his immediate pupils, Polovinkin, Pavlov, Sabeneiev, Shapashinko, and Melkikh. Highly original styles occur in the writing of Charles Ives vho creates massive chords in complicated rhythmical patterns, in John Becker who experiments with percussive sounds in involved figurations often without any semblance to usual melodic lines. The Liebermann Sonata abounds in unusual effects. Bartok has utilized percussive chords as well as dissonant counterpoint and qy such unusual devices as broken chords in contrary motion, octave passages at the interval of a ninth has achieved unique sounds. Antheil attempts to depict the sounds of an airplane in his "Airplane" Sonata which he achieves qy a very free counterpoint and highly unorthodox harmonies. Among individual composers, Dutilleux, Medtner, Miaskowski, Rachmaninoff, Bax, Fuleihan, stravinsky have written distinguished works. Those sonatas that seem most successful are those of Charles Griffes, Bartok, Barber, Dukas, Hindemith, the mature works of Scriabin, Kabalevsky, and the later works of Prokofieff with particular emphasis upon his Seventh Sonata. The debt of the United States composers to European models is everywhere apparent from the works of the German-trained MacDowell to the present composers. MacDowell follows faithfully the traditional forms choosing, however, themes of a nationalistic nature which identity him with American folklore in the manner Grieg is identified with Norwegian idioms. Arthur Shepherd, John Powell and Roy Harris are strongly influenced by native American themes. With the advent of the 1920 's, however, composers adopted the cosmopolitan style of the neo-classicists and the nationalistic element faded. The Sonata of Copland, for example, does not reflect an American idiom even though he has used such themes to great success in such works as his ballets. In the distinguished and recent Sonata of Barber, there is no hint of any American influence insofar as melodic line is concerned...|$|R
