40|$|Investors face a {{long and}} {{uncertain}} journey to retirement and beyond, particularly when investing in new defined contribution schemes such as New Zealand's KiwiSaver. This paper seeks to provide positive insights into the design of KiwiSaver by assessing the recently announced move from 4 to 6 % minimum contribution rates using stochastic simulation. We consider retirement adequacy from two perspectives: (i) multiples of gross final earnings achieved during the accumulation phase; and (ii) replacement <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>salaries</b> during the decumulation phase. The findings reveal that {{an increase in the}} contribution rate from 4 to 6 % dramatically increases the probability of investors reaching a retirement target of eight (8) times final earnings, from 6 % to 40 %. However, despite the shift in lifetime contributions in the right direction, the simulation analysis suggests that, in the majority of scenarios, KiwiSaver investors will not achieve an adequate retirement target.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a collection}} of three essays on personnel economics. The first essay studies bonus payments in a hierarchical firm. A well-documented finding in the internal labor markets literature is that the size of bonus payments increases as one moves up the corporate ladder. Two existing theories {{that can be used to}} explain this finding cannot fully capture the empirical patterns of the size of bonus payments. I develop a unified framework that can better match the empirical findings. Using a dynamic tournament model augmented with an asymmetric learning structure in which the current employer has an informational advantage over its competitors regarding the worker's productivity, my model offers an economic rationale for the employer's decision on the size of bonus payments by identifying two counteracting mechanisms that determine bonuses. Specifically, the size of bonus payments increases with the level of effort the employer aims to induce, but decreases with the size of the worker's career-concern incentives. I test the model's predictions using data from the personnel records of a medium-sized firm in the financial services industry. The results provide direct evidence for the model's predictions. The second essay investigates how salaries and bonus payments are related to turnover. In contrast with the existing literature, this study treats bonus payments as a distinct type of compensation, rather than aggregating them with salaries. The first part of the empirical analysis focuses on data coming from the personnel records of a medium-sized U. S. firm. I find that earning a bonus in the current period, as well as the size of the bonus, is negatively related to the probability of turnover after controlling for the size <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> or the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>salary.</b> These results also indicate that the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> is negatively related to turnover, while results concerning the effect of the size <b>of</b> <b>salaries</b> are mixed. The second part of the empirical analysis uses a sample drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). The results show that salary, both in terms of size and growth rate, has a negative effect on the probabilities of quits and layoffs; whereas the negative effect of bonus payments is more evident in layoffs than quits. This third essay examines conditions under which employee referrals serve a screening function. Unlike the existing theoretical work, the possibility of a conflict of interest arising between the firm and current employees during the referral process is investigated. I consider two potential mechanisms that lead to a conflict of interest. First, I examine how the employee's social connections relate to his referral decision. I show that the employee finds it optimal to refer applicants with whom he has a strong social connection rather than applicants of high ability. Second, I examine how the employee's promotion prospects affect his referral decisions. Specifically, I posit that the current employee will have incentives to refer an applicant of lower ability if he faces any possibility of competition for promotions between himself and the newly hired worker. In either of these situations, employee referrals may not provide screening of more able workers. Finally, I show that the firm can make use of referral bonuses, which are contingent on the referral's performance, to align incentives of the employee with those of the firm...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has reported effects of networking, defined as building, maintaining, and using relationships, on career success. However, empirical studies have exclusively relied upon concurrent or retrospective designs that rest upon strong assumptions on the causal direction of this relation and also depict a static {{snapshot of the}} relation at a given point in time. This study provides a dynamic perspective {{of the effects of}} networking on career success and reports results of a longitudinal study. Networking was assessed by six subscales that result from combining the facets of 1) internal vs. external networking and 2) building vs. maintaining vs. using contacts. Objective (salary) and subjective (career satisfaction) measures of career success were obtained for three consecutive years. Multilevel analyses show that networking is related to concurrent salary and moreover, that it is related to the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> over time. Networking is also related to concurrent career satisfaction. As satisfaction remained stable over time, no effects of networking on the growth of career satisfaction were found.

Both academic and non-academic staff members were included in the survey. The study population comprised 121 employees at the Institute of Science and Technology for Research and Development, Mahidol University. The instrument for gathering data was in the form of a questionnaire consisting of 27 questions as well as 5 basic demographic questions determining sex, age, level <b>of</b> education, <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> and working duration. Employment satisfaction was measured on a five point scale in terms of career progression, employment stability, job characteristic, relationship with colleagues, relationship to immediate supervisor and the physical work environment. Data were analyzed in both univariate and multivariate analyses. From the 121 questionnaires given out, 105 completed questionnaires were returned (86. 78 %). The majorities of the study population were females, and aged between 31 - 40 years old. In terms of education, the majority of respondents had a Bachelor’s degree, earned between 10, 001 - 20, 000 Baht and had been employed for between 11 and 20 years.

In comparison to the older female worms, a greater proportion of mature young females were in the early phase of a reproductive cycle and fewer were actively reproducing. This difference was considered to be due to a greater access of males to older than to recently mature females.

In the case of Indonesia, despite {{of the fact that there}} are two official types of Islamic bank, as they are accommodated by Banking Act No. 7 1992, as well as Banking Act No. 10 1998, there is an additional type as what so-called Baitul Maal wat Tamwil, or abbreviated as BMT. BMTs have even attracted more attention. First, because they are generally unregistered under the normal practice rule such as Central Bank. Second, they have developed very significantly in quantity and spread in very wide areas of different provinces. Currently, there are about two thousand BMTs around the country. This indicates that BMTs have been contributing to the national economy. Third, although the country is hit by the crisis, many BMTs operate smoothly. This is contrary to what might be seen in the fact faced by many formal conventional banks. Based on the above factors, we are interested in investigating what the influencing factors are behind the good performance of BMTs in general. This is the main objective of this study. To answer the research problems, the data were collected from the best 47 BMTs in five different provinces, i. e., West Java, Jakarta Special Territory of Capital, Middle Java, Special Region of Yogyakarta, and East Java.

This relationship, however, is stronger for the liberal arts and master level universities, but noisier for the doctoral and research institutions. The labor market has priced college presidents in a similar way that professors are priced for bachelor (liberal arts colleges) and master institutions. However, presidents of doctoral institutions are priced differently from the faculty. Irrespective of college types, faculties are priced based upon the financial strength and the academic reputation of the institution.

The main analysis results can be summarized in two points: First, {{the level of the}} average effective tax rate is the main determinant of the income redistribution effects and progressive is secondary. Due to the reduction of the effective tax rate, the tax reform has weakened the redistribution effects of personal income tax which already very weak in the former tax system. Second, the overall progressivity index of personal income tax was inverted U-shaped with the improvement <b>of</b> deduction in <b>salary</b> income. Coincidentally, the deduction determined by this reform (RMB 3500 /month) happens to be at the maximum of the inverted U-shaped, so the higher deduction would weaken the progressive. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R
