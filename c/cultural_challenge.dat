The multiculturalist stance in cultural studies therefore presents camp as political and critical.|$|E

Liberal pro-homosexuality groups such as Changing Attitude have been particularly opposed to Anglican Mainstream, especially over their view that homosexual orientation is an unalterable fact of human nature.|$|E

Radical feminists inspired by the back-to-the-land initiative abandoned their traditional roles and migrated to rural areas to create female-only lesbian communes. [...] "Free Spaces" [...] are defined by Sociologist Francesca Polletta as [...] "small-scale settings within a community or movement that are removed from the direct control of dominant groups, are voluntarily participated in, and generate the <b>cultural</b> <b>challenge</b> that precedes or accompanies political mobilization. Women came together in Free Spaces like music festivals, activist groups and collectives to share ideas with like-minded people and to explore the idea of the lesbian land movement. The movement is closely tied to eco-feminism.|$|E

5000|$|The {{exploration}} {{on sexual}} fluidity initiated by Lisa M. Diamond presented a <b>cultural</b> <b>challenge</b> to the LGBT community; {{this is because}} although researchers usually emphasize that changes in sexual orientation are unlikely, despite conversion therapy attempts, sexual identity can change over time. That sexual orientation is not always stable challenges the views of many within the LGBT community, who believe that sexual orientation is fixed and immutable. For example, the public and media attention following Ruby Rose's debut on Orange Is the New Black largely concerned heterosexual women commenting on her physical appearance, and stating that they would [...] "go gay for her"; {{this resulted in a}} new, open discourse about sexual fluidity and whether or not sexual orientation can change, with some of the media, including lesbian critics, expressing disapproval toward heterosexual women declaring that they would be romantically or sexuality interested in Rose.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of King's culture is the annual House Music competition. This {{is divided into two}} parts: the Small House features a small group (usually no more than 15) of students from each House, who perform a vocal musical item, with optional instrumental accompaniment. The other part of the competition, Big House, requires each House to perform a musical item involving all of their students. The results are then added together, with the points going towards the <b>Cultural</b> <b>Challenge</b> Shield. The Big House Music night, now held at Auckland's Spark Arena, is {{one of the highlights of}} the school year and attracts large audiences of families and friends. Music is an important part of the College curriculum and not only is it taught as a core subject through to senior level but many students take advantage of the wide range of itinerant music teachers who are available to teach, on an individual basis, a great range of instruments. Piano, strings, brass and woodwind with classical guitar and percussion are the most popular chosen by students. The College is proud of its orchestra and bands which perform regularly at College functions and are frequent competitors in inter-school festivals.|$|E
50|$|Domestic {{abuse in}} El Salvador is {{prohibited}} {{under the law}} and sentencing can result in one {{to three years in}} prison, but the law is not always well enforced. In 2010, the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women reported that they had received 4,732 reports of domestic violence. The Office of the Attorney General investigated only 661 cases of domestic violence during the same year. The investigations led to only 3 convictions, with 71 cases resolved through mediation. Even though the number of official reports appears high, in reality cases are underreported to government entities. In a study done by the Pan-American Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2012, 26.3% of women in El Salvador reported that they had experienced some sort of physical or sexual violence from their partners. The underreporting of incidents {{may be due to the}} fact that in 2010 domestic violence was considered socially acceptable by a large portion of the population. One <b>cultural</b> <b>challenge</b> that El Salvador faces in moving towards gender equality in the home is that of machismo, which is strong, or aggressive masculine pride. The practice can take the form of husbands being overbearing or controlling and even extend to physical or verbal abuse.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} what {{governmental and}} <b>cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> Norwegian companies face when entering and {{doing business in}} China. In addition, this paper also discusses what strategies to implement to overcome these challenges. With China becoming a bigger player in the global marketplace, {{this is an important}} matter not only for companies across the world but also for Norwegian companies. Through a qualitative research method with semi-structured interviews, the research is conducted on four Norwegian companies who does business in China. The findings shows that there are many variables affecting the choice of entry mode to China and there exist governmental challenges affiliated with corruption, institutional voids. Moreover, this paper concludes that there exist <b>cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> when doing business in China such as communication and building networks, however the <b>cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> should not be seen as a bigger problem than what it is and believed to have less impact on business in the future. The research also found that building relationships and focusing on localization and training proves to be a competitive advantage and works as an effective tool to overcome several challenges.

40|$|Recently, many {{programs}} have been funded to tackle Indigenous Australian smoking. This study assessed what challenges and unexpected responses could occur when developing anti-tobacco messages for Indigenous communities. A cross-sectional telephone survey of organizations involved in making anti-tobacco messages for the target population was conducted in 2012 - 2013. Open-ended questions explored <b>cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> to message development and unexpected outcomes. Responses were noted and these qualitative data were independently coded by two researchers using an inductive analysis. Non-parametric tests explored associations between organization orientation, whether target group feedback about messages was sought (pre-tests) {{and the presence of}} the above factors. The 47 organizations represented included: 22 Aboriginal Medical Services (AMS), 13 government organizations (GO), eight non-government organizations (NGO) and four universities. The response rate was 83 %. <b>Cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> were reported equally by organizations oriented towards Aboriginal communities and those oriented towards the general population. Organizations conducting target group pre-tests of the messages {{were more likely to report}} <b>cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> (p[*]=[*] 0. 002). Four main themes were revealed: the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures; the selection of role models; conflicts and delays; and unexpected outcomes. Nearly 60 % of organizations reported better-than-expected outcomes e. g. community appreciation and pride. A further 40 % reported negative responses, e. g. messages being misunderstood or confronting. <b>Cultural</b> <b>challenges</b> and unexpected outcomes are reported by Australian organizations when developing anti-tobacco messages for Indigenous Australians warranting attention to improve the salience of anti-tobacco messages for Indigenous peoples. NB. In this paper, Indigenous Australians is a term used to refer to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the first inhabitants of Australia. No offence is intended.

5000|$|Africa {{is divided}} into {{a great number of}} ethnic cultures. The continent's {{cultural}} regeneration has also been an integral aspect of post-independence nation-building on the continent, with a recognition of the need to harness the cultural resources of Africa to enrich the process of education, requiring the creation of an enabling environment in a number of ways. In recent times, the call for a much greater emphasis on the cultural dimension in all aspects of development has become increasingly vocal. During the Roman colonization of North Africa,(parts of Algeria, Libya, Egypt and the whole of Tunisia) provinces such as Tripolitania became major producers of food for the republic and the empire, this generated much wealth in these places for their 400 years of occupation. During colonialism in Africa, Europeans possessed attitudes of superiority and a sense of mission. The French were able to accept an African as French if that person gave up their African culture and adopted French ways. Knowledge of the Portuguese language and culture and abandonment of traditional African ways defined one as civilized. Kenyan social commentator Mwiti Mugambi argues that the future of Africa can only be forged from accepting and mending the sociocultural present. For Mugambi, colonial cultural hangovers, pervasive Western cultural inundation, and aid-giving arm-twisting donors are, he argues, here to stay and no amount of looking into Africa's past will make them go away.
