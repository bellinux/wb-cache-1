40|$|A <b>calcareous</b> <b>rock</b> <b>slope</b> failed during {{excavation}} {{of the slope}} for construction of a tunnel entrance. The slope {{is located at the}} construction site for widening highway in Yeongwol, Korea. Field surveys, laboratory tests, and numerical analy-ses were performed to determine the reason for the slope failure. The numerical analysis revealed that the safety factor of the slope before construction of the entrance was less than 1, and that this decreased after construction. After construction of the entrance, the sliding zone of the slope increased and slope stability decreased because the shear strain and plastic zone in the slope over the tunnel entrance showed an increase relative to {{the lower part of the}} slope. To enhance the sta-bility of the slope for construction of the tunnel entrance, countermeasures such as rock bolts, rock anchors, and FRP (Fiber glass Reinforced Plastic) grouting were adopted in light of the field conditions. Serial field monitoring performed to confirm the reinforcing effects of the adopted countermeasures revealed a small amount of horizontal deformation of the slope soils, most of the elastic deformation that can regain its former value. In addition, the axial forces of the rock bolt and anchor were more strongly affected by slope excavation during construction of the tunnel entrance than by tun...|$|E

40|$|Anisotropy in compressional-wave {{velocities}} in {{sedimentary rocks}} recovered by DSDP {{has been recognized}} by several investigators (Boyce, 1976; Tucholke et al., 1976; Carlson and Christensen, 1977). The anisotropy is also observed at elevated pressures in laboratory experiments, and thus probably persists at depth in some <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> (Schreiber et al., 1972; Christensen et al., 1973; Carlson and Christensen, 1979). Carlson and Christensen (1979) suggested that the observed velocity anisotropy was produced not by the alignment of cracks but by the alignment of c axes of calcite perpendicular to bedding during compaction, diagenesis, and recrystallization.

30|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>slope</b> {{instability}} is major geohazards {{problems for}} both global and local. Geohazards phenomenon is the downward movement of rock blocks, debris or/and soil {{in response to}} gravitational stresses. The failures have classified according {{to the type of}} downslope movement either slides, rotational or flow [1]. One of the major causes of <b>rock</b> <b>slope</b> failure is the construction of the transportation system without a proper understanding of geological and geotechnical consideration of natural <b>rock</b> <b>slopes</b> [2, 3, 4, 5]. Furthermore, lack of continuous monitoring and investigations of <b>rock</b> <b>slope</b> throughout the year especially before and after the rainy season. In results, these types of geohazards have been experienced throughout history when human or nature has disturbed the delicate balance of natural <b>rock</b> <b>slopes</b> [6, 7, 8].|$|R
40|$|EnThe Monti di Palermo are a Sicilian Segment of the Appenninico-Maghrebide chain, where {{different}} tectonic units, primarily {{made up of}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> (Late Triassic-Early Oligocene) are present. These <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> {{are covered}} by clay deposits (Flysch Numidico, Late Oligocene-Early Miocene).

Particularly, the great karstic forms are located on tectonic or morphoselected depressions and along geostructural lines. The water chemical aspects reflect the aquifer rock characteristics (limestone and dolomitic limestone) and the actual hydrogeochemical processes (ionic exchange with argillitic minerals). The large amounts of karstic forms determine a very fast infiltration and groundwater flow. In the Monti di Palermo some hydrostructures are used intensively for the water supply of urban areas and agricultural use. The over exploitation of the hydrostructures has caused great seawater intrusion, present along the coastal zone, fault lines and associated karstic channels...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>slopes</b> {{form part}} of the {{components}} in many highway or roadway constructions in hilly terrain. The key question with regard to <b>rock</b> <b>slopes</b> along highways is their long-term stability since failure of a <b>rock</b> <b>slope</b> can have serious consequences. The stability of a particular <b>rock</b> <b>slope</b> is governed by three main engineering geologic factors, namely: lithology, structure and weathering grade.

Hence, for example, the stability of granitic <b>rock</b> <b>slopes</b> is controlled by-and-large by the major sets of joints in the rock mass, while bedding planes control the stability of shale slopes.
