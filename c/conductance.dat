40|$|Neurons {{can have}} widely differing {{intrinsic}} membrane properties, {{in particular the}} density of specific <b>conductances,</b> but how these contribute to characteristic neuronal activity or pattern formation is not well understood. To explore the relationship between <b>conductances,</b> and in particular how they influence the activity of motor neurons in the well characterized leech heartbeat system, we developed a new multi-compartmental Hodgkin-Huxley style leech heart motor neuron model. To do so, we evolved a population of model instances, which differed in the density of specific <b>conductances,</b> capable of achieving specific output activity targets given an associated input pattern. We then examined the sensitivity of measures of output activity to <b>conductances</b> and how the model instances responded to hyperpolarizing current injections. We found that the strengths of many <b>conductances,</b> including those with differing dynamics, had strong partial correlations and that these relationships appeared to be linked by their influence on heart motor neuron activity. <b>Conductances</b> that had positive correlations opposed one another and had the opposite effects on activity metrics when perturbed whereas <b>conductances</b> that had negative correlations could compensate for one another and had similar effects on activity metrics...|$|R
5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs. Unfortunately, taphonomical alterations (changes during the fossilization process) {{make it difficult to}} determine the original structure of the nest. Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell had a high rate of water vapor <b>conductance.</b> Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor <b>conductance.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas <b>conductance</b> values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density is much lower near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas <b>conductance</b> value.|$|E

40|$|Stomatal <b>conductances</b> of {{normally}} oriented and inverted {{leaves were}} measured as light levels (photosynthetic photon flux densities) were increased {{to determine whether}} abaxial stomata of Vicia faba leaves were more sensitive to light than adaxial stomata. Light levels were increased over uniform populations of leaves of plants grown in an environmental chamber. Adaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum water vapor <b>conductances</b> at a light level of 60 micromoles per square meter per second, the same light level at which abaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum <b>conductances.</b> Abaxial stomata of inverted leaves reached maximum <b>conductances</b> at a light level of 500 micromoles per square meter per second, the same light level at which adaxial stomata of normally oriented leaves reached maximum <b>conductances.</b> Maximum <b>conductances</b> in both normally oriented and inverted leaves were about 200 millimoles per square meter per second for adaxial stomata and 330 millimoles per square meter per second for abaxial stomata. Regardless of whether leaves were normally oriented or inverted, when light levels were increased to values high enough that upper leaf surfaces reached maximum <b>conductances</b> (about 500 micromoles per square meter per second), light levels incident on lower, shaded leaf surfaces were just sufficient (about 60 micromoles per square meter per second) for stomata of those surfaces to reach maximum <b>conductances.</b> This `coordinated' stomatal opening on the separate epidermes resulted in total leaf <b>conductances</b> for normally oriented and inverted leaves that were the same at any given light level. We conclude that stomata in abaxial epidermes of intact Vicia leaves are not more sensitive to light than those in adaxial epidermes, and that stomata in leaves of this plant {{do not respond to}} light alone. Additional factors in bulk leaf tissue probably produce coordinated stomatal opening on upper and lower leaf epidermes to optimally meet photosynthetic requirements of the whole leaf for CO 2...|$|R

In experiments, thus, caution has to be taken in eliminating part of the voltage traces, thus losing also part of the temporal information of both excitatory and inhibitory <b>conductances.</b> Our method is able to perform well in this regime. This information is highly valuable in problems (epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, etc.) where a debate on the balance of excitation and inhibition is open; see the introduction of [12] for a rather complete overview on this feature.|$|R
40|$|We study {{homogenization}} {{properties of}} the discrete Laplace operator with random <b>conductances</b> on a large domain in Z^d. More precisely, we prove almost-sure homogenization of the discrete Poisson equation and {{of the top of}} the Dirichlet spectrum. We assume that the <b>conductances</b> are stationary, ergodic and nearest-neighbor <b>conductances</b> are positive. In contrast to earlier results, we do not require uniform ellipticity but certain integrability conditions on the lower and upper tails of the <b>conductances.</b> We further allow jumps of arbitrary length. Without the long-range connections, the integrability condition on the lower tail is optimal for spectral homogenization. It coincides with a necessary condition for the validity of a local central limit theorem for the random walk among random <b>conductances.</b> As an application of spectral homogenization, we prove a quenched large deviation principle for the normalized and rescaled local times of the random walk in a growing box.

Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal <b>conductances</b> by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltagedependent membrane currents and uses three Ca 2 � sensors acting on different time scales.

The resulting plasticity of intrinsic characteristics has important implications for network behavior.
