In Asia (People's Republic of China, North Korea, Vietnam) the adoption of <b>collective</b> <b>farming</b> was also driven by communist government policies. In most communist countries, the transition to <b>collective</b> <b>farming</b> involved an element of compulsion, while the <b>collective</b> <b>farms</b> within these countries, lacked the principle of voluntary membership, is often regarded at best as being pseudo-cooperatives.|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a part of}} the intellectual legacy of the Chayanov’s school that is often con-sidered as consisting exclusively of the studies of peasant economy and its cooperative development. Such an interpretation overlooks the school’s contribution to the study of large-scale agrarian production within the establishing soviet system of <b>collective</b> <b>farms.</b> The authors provide another interpretation of the intellectual legacy of Chayanov and his colleagues, and focus on the works of A. N. Chelintsev (1874 - 1962) and N. P. Makarov (1888 - 1980), who survived the repressions of the 1930 s and since the 1940 s returned to the studies of economic organization of <b>collective</b> <b>farms,</b> which had become the main insti-tutional form of the soviet agrarian system. Chelintsev studied lagging <b>collective</b> <b>farms,</b> which were un-popular and even dangerous subject in the soviet agrarian science. Chelintsev’s recommendations were not followed in the collective farms’ economy of the 1950 s. However, today they help to understand some system features of weak <b>collective</b> <b>farms.</b> Makarov summarized the results of his <b>collective</b> <b>farms</b> studies at the rise of the Kosygin’s reforms in the monograph published in 1966; it emphasized both the importance of <b>collective</b> <b>farms</b> in the soviet agriculture and alternative strategies of <b>collective</b> <b>farms</b> develop-ment by granting them more independence and involving in inter-farm cooperation. With such works, Chelintsev and Makarov ensured the highest methodological level of social-economic research typical for the 1920 s’ soviet agrarian science, thus confirming that the Chayanov’s school introduced many original ideas in the study of peculiarities of the economic organization of both peasant households and large-scale <b>collective</b> <b>farms,</b> which determines the necessity of reevaluating the intellectual legacy of the organizational-production school to understand better the phenomenon of Russian <b>collective</b> <b>farming</b> in the XX century...|$|R

It can be both compared and contrasted with corporate farming; in the post-Soviet states, <b>collective</b> <b>farms</b> have generally been decollectivized either as family farms or as corporate farms, the latter being similar to the old <b>collective</b> <b>farms</b> but with stock ownership.|$|R

25|$|Identification of Soviet {{power with}} the Antichrist also {{decreased}} peasant support for the Soviet regime. Rumors about religious persecution spread mostly by word of mouth, but also through leaflets and proclamations. Priests preached that the Antichrist had come to place “the Devil’s mark” on the peasants. and that the Soviet state was promising the peasants a better life but was actually signing them up for Hell. Peasants feared that if they joined the <b>collective</b> <b>farm</b> they would be marked with the stamp of the Antichrist. They faced a choice between God and the Soviet <b>collective</b> <b>farm.</b> Choosing between salvation and damnation, peasants {{had no choice but}} to resist policies of the state. These rumors of the Soviet state as the Antichrist functioned to keep peasants from succumbing to the government. The attacks on religion and the Church affected women the most because they were upholders of religion within the villages.|$|E

25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} socialization of children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a <b>collective</b> <b>farm</b> in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the <b>collective</b> <b>farm</b> “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.|$|E
25|$|Rumors {{circulated}} {{in the villages}} warning the rural residents that collectivization would bring disorder, hunger, famine, {{and the destruction of}} crops and livestock. Readings and reinterpretations of Soviet newspapers labeled collectivization as a second serfdom. Villagers were afraid the old landowners/serf owners were coming back and that the villagers joining the <b>collective</b> <b>farm</b> would face starvation and famine. More reason for peasants to believe collectivization was a second serfdom was that entry into the kolkhoz had been forced. Farmers did {{not have the right to}} leave the collective without permission. The level of state procurements and prices on crops also enforced the serfdom analogy. The government would take a majority of the crops and pay extremely low prices. The serfs during the 1860s were paid nothing but collectivization still reminded the peasants of serfdom. To them, this “second serfdom” became code for the Communist betrayal of the revolution. To the peasants, the revolution was about giving more freedom and land to the peasants, but instead they had to give up their land and livestock to the <b>collective</b> <b>farm.</b>|$|E
