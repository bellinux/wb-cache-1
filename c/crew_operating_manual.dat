50|$|Airbus Industrie {{was aware}} of the {{automatic}} throttle system (ATS) malfunction. This defect could cause either the jamming of both throttles and ATS disconnection, or one throttle moving to idle while the other remained above climb power, without ATS disconnection. Investigators stated that the most probable cause of this malfunction was due to the excessive friction in the cinematic linkages between the throttle and the ATS coupling units. At the time of the accident, the Flight <b>Crew</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Manual</b> (FCOM) issued by Airbus Industrie didn't include the procedures to cope with the anomaly. However, the FCOM issued by TAROM and Swissair did include these procedures.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{application}} of artificial neural network approach for aircraft engine health monitoring. The Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR) has volumes of data which if mined appropriately can provide valuable information about the aircraft health. The Flight <b>Crew</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Manual</b> (FCOM) lays down operational profiles, which are recommended to be followed for efficient fuel usage and for minimizing maintenance effort. In the proposed system, the information from FCOM profiles and ‘known’ flight data has been fused to train a back propagation feed-forward neural network. The predictions made by the neural network regarding the expected data of required engine parameters {{have been used to}} monitor the flight data and diagnose the health of the aircraft engine in relevance to the FCOM profiles. A Matlab GUI has been developed to simulate the ‘unknown’ flight data through a Simulink model for the neural network. Data from the A 320 family of aircrafts has been used for training and simulating the model and preliminary results are detailed in the paper. The simulation results exhibit that the data used is fairly healthy and show a very low level of severity of degradation with respect to the profiles studied...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the aims}} of the DLR-project "Wetter und Fliegen" is to develop and analyse new flight control and {{guidance}} functions in order to avoid or to mitigate the impact of wake vortex encounters. Two strategies are addressed in the project: One is an automatic impact attenuation system detecting that the aircraft is flying through a wake vortex and counteracting the effects of the wake encounter by giving corresponding commands to the flight control system. The other system detects that the aircraft flight path will cross a wake vortex in the near future and calculates an evasion trajectory. The corresponding evasion manoeuvre to avoid wake vortex encounter may be flown manually by the pilot or automatically by the aircraft autopilot. A concept for the human machine interface is presented in this report for both system approaches. It deals also with the operational aspects of such systems from "a cockpit point of view". As flight tests within the project are planned with the A 320 -ATRA research aircraft future systems have to be integrated in an "Airbus-like" cockpit environment. Therefore it is assumed that the Wake Vortex Impact Attenuation and Evasion systems are additional functions of a conventional Airbus A 320 flight control and guidance system. Design of the human machine interface is influenced by existing systems like TCAS, wind shear protection function and flight envelope protections. A main source of information for this report was the A 320 Flight <b>Crew</b> <b>Operating</b> <b>Manual</b> and designs developed in the European project FLYSAFE. The report starts with a short overview of the conventional A 320 indicating displays in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 operational concept and displays of the Wake Impact Attenuation System are explained. This is followed by an operational description and indications of the Wake Avoidance System in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 draws some conclusions about the design concept presented in this report. Appendix A lists all sections of the Flight Crew Operations Manual affected by the intergration of a Wake Vortex Impact Attenuation and a Wake Avoidance System. An example of a lateral evasion manoeuvre activated by the Wake Avoidance System is illustrated and explained in Appendix B...|$|E
