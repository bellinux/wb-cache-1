That's probably where I would look.|$|E
5|$|As the {{composition}} is not precisely defined, some states {{which have a}} considerable division of executive power <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to decide who should attend the meetings. While an MEP, Alexander Stubb argued {{that there was no}} need for the President of Finland to attend Council meetings with or instead of the Prime Minister of Finland (who was head of European foreign policy). In 2008, having become Finnish Foreign Minister, Stubb was forced out of the Finnish delegation to the emergency council meeting on the Georgian crisis because the President wanted to attend the high-profile summit as well as the Prime Minister (only two people from each country could attend the meetings). This was despite Stubb being head of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the time which was heavily involved in the crisis. Problems also occurred in Poland where the President of Poland and the Prime Minister of Poland were of different parties and had a different foreign policy response to the crisis. A similar situation arose in Romania between President Traian Băsescu and Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu in 2007–2008 and again in 2012 with Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who both opposed the president.|$|E
25|$|Banks or governments relying {{heavily on}} {{seigniorage}} and fractional reserve sources of revenue <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> counterproductive. Rational expectations of inflation {{take into account}} a bank's seigniorage strategy, and inflationary expectations can maintain high inflation. Instead of accruing seigniorage from fiat money and credit, most governments opt to raise revenue primarily through formal taxation and other means.|$|E

25|$|Seesaw : In {{this pattern}} the planets form two groups on {{opposite}} sides of the chart, the groups no less than sixty degrees or two signs apart. As its name suggests, this produces a person who behaves like a 'seesaw', with their life following a pattern of two distinctly contrasting alternatives. The person <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to integrate these two sharply different parts of their life, which are often in competition with each other. However, success produces the increased sophistication and polished, knowing demeanour of a person who is able to deal with most of life's situations.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of group living can be decreased predation. If {{the number of}} predator attacks stays the same despite increasing prey group size, each prey may have a reduced risk of predator attacks through the dilution effect. Additionally, a predator that is confused by a mass of individuals <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> more difficult to single out one target. For this reason, the zebra's stripes offer not only camouflage in a habitat of tall grasses, but also the {{advantage of}} blending into a herd of other zebras. In groups, prey can also actively reduce their predation risk through more effective defence tactics, or through earlier detection of predators through increased vigilance.|$|E
25|$|The waiver, {{which can}} be granted after the {{completion}} of an eight-hour course, is required for outpatient treatment of opioid addiction with Subutex and Suboxone. Initially, the number of patients each approved physician could treat was limited to ten. This was eventually modified to allow approved physicians to treat up to a hundred patients with buprenorphine for opioid addiction in an outpatient setting. This limit was recently increased by the Obama administration, raising the number of patients to which doctors can prescribe to 275. Still, due to this patient limit and the requisite eight-hour training course, many continuing patients <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> very difficult to get a prescription, despite the drug's effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|Because Medicare offers statutorily {{determined}} benefits, {{its coverage}} policies and payment rates are publicly known, and all enrollees {{are entitled to}} the same coverage. In the private insurance market, plans can be tailored to offer different benefits to different customers, enabling individuals to reduce coverage costs while assuming risks for care that is not covered. Insurers, however, have far fewer disclosure requirements than Medicare, and studies show that customers {{in the private sector}} <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to know what their policy covers. and at what cost. Moreover, since Medicare collects data about utilization and costs for its enrollees—data that private insurers treat as trade secrets—it gives researchers key information about health care system performance.|$|E
25|$|The sweep {{method is}} quick {{and works in}} most cases, as the DV usually just drops down on the diver's right side. In this method the diver is usually face down to upright, and sweeps the right hand across the waist from left to right, around to the back, {{in contact with the}} body or scuba set, and round as far back as {{possible}} against the cylinder, the straightens the arm backwards and swings it around outwards and forwards in an arc until it is pointing forwards. This will normally capture the hose {{to the front of the}} arm, where the left hand <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> by sweeping along the arm from the right hand to the neck. This method will fail if the DV has been swept over to the left side of the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|Water: The water {{signs are}} Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces. A native with mainly water signs {{will be very}} {{emotional}} and {{find it hard to}} look at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

25|$|Air : The air {{signs are}} Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. A native with mainly air signs {{will be an}} {{excellent}} communicator, concerned with ideas and theories of all kinds. They are looking for answers to life's questions and make good teachers and writers. Air people are more tense than they appear at first sight and may live on their nerves. They have many friends and acquaintances but may not be particularly interested in family life. They {{are interested in the}} latest technologies and are able to do a number of things at once. Air subjects are also very imaginative and quick-witted, but may be sarcastic and rude. A subject lacking air signs will have little imagination and lightness of touch. They have an over-emphasis on practicalities and can lack a sense of humour, and be boring company. They <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to communicate or to assimilate and explain new ideas. Planets in the 3rd, 7th and 11th houses, and an emphasis on mutable signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|A {{tax haven}} is a state, country or {{territory}} where certain taxes are levied {{at a low}} rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion. Individuals and/or corporate entities <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions. Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. In its December 2008 report on the use of tax havens by American corporations, the U.S. Government Accountability Office was unable to provide a satisfactory definition of a tax haven, but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center.|$|E

500|$|In 1755, {{as part of}} the British {{military}} escalation, Major General Edward Braddock {{arrived in}} North America with a force of British Army regulars to head a major effort against the French in the Ohio Country. Washington wanted to serve on the expedition, but refused to do so as a provincial officer, since he would be outranked by even junior officers in the regular army establishment. [...] (Washington was said to [...] " [...] with fury when British regular officers expressed their disdain of provincial officers and soldiers", and at the realization that British officers were always senior to colonials regardless of rank.) Through negotiations mediated by Governor Dinwiddie, Washington was offered an unpaid volunteer position as one of Braddock's aides. [...] Washington accepted, writing to Braddock's principal aide, Captain Robert Orme, [...] "I wish for nothing more earnestly, than to attain a small degree of knowledge in the Military Art", and that the position would provide him [...] "a good opportunity ... of forming an acquaintance which may be serviceable hereafter, if I <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> worth while pushing my Fortune in the Military way." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reception}} of the album was positive. Speaking of second-generation artists emerging around the same time, Allmusic's Jason Ankeny wrote that Wainwright [...] "deserves to be heard regardless of his family tree". Furthermore, Ankeny complimented the musician for his songwriting abilities and his [...] "knack for elegantly rolling piano melodies and poignantly romantic lyrics". Music journalist Robert Christgau characterized Wainwright as a [...] "mind-boggling original" [...] whose talent is [...] "too big to let pass". One NME reviewer called the album [...] "floridly impersonal and [...] "grandiosely arranged", but also criticized Wainwright for being [...] "too overwrought and naff". Greenwald complimented Martha's backing vocals on the song [...] "In My Arms", as well as Parks' [...] "positively sterling" [...] string arrangement on [...] "Millbrook". Furthermore, he praised the vocal duet between Rufus and Martha on [...] "Sally Ann", claiming that a similar sibling performance had not been heard since The Everly Brothers. The album's cabaret elements and 1970s singer-songwriter style drew comparisons to Cole Porter and Joni Mitchell. Josh Kun of Salon.com wrote that Wainwright poetically incorporated [...] "foolish love and fantasy love, healing love and destructive love and love that {{makes you want to}} lose your sense of self just so you <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] Kun asserted that the songs were [...] "built on a similar set of angled melodies and hairpin turns of phrase", and that each [...] "succeeds as its own distinctly intimate portrait of emotion and desire." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} conquistador Tomás Verde in New Spain {{fighting}} {{a horde of}} Mayans to gain entry into a pyramid, where he is attacked by a Mayan priest with a flaming sword. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the conquistador has been commissioned by Queen Isabella of Spain {{to travel to the}} New World in search of the fountain of youth or Biblical Tree of Life and immortality. If Tomás <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> she is convinced that she can {{put an end to the}} struggle between herself and an influential cleric during the Spanish Inquisition who is attempting to stop her search and usurp the throne. Isabella vows to spend eternity with Tomás upon his return, citing a correlation with Adam and Eve. When Tomás arrives at his destination, he finds that his fellow knights are exhausted and refuse to continue searching for the Tree of Life. A Franciscan monk discovers the location of the temple, but is killed while Tomás represses the mutiny amongst his officers. As the priest dies, he gives Tomás a ceremonial dagger and directs him towards the pyramid. Once he arrives at the pyramid, Tomás and his men are ambushed and Tomás is captured. He is forcefully directed to the top of the pyramid, and engages in [...] combat with a Mayan priest wielding a flaming sword. Tomás is stabbed in the stomach, but just as the priest is about to kill him, future Tommy appears before the figurehead. The priest believes Tomás is the [...] "First Father", apologizes and asks Tomás to usher him down the path of awe by slitting his throat. Tomás sacrificially kills the priest and proceeds to a pool with a large tree; convinced this is the Tree of Life. Tomás applies some of its sap to his torso and is cured of his stab wound. He drinks the sap flowing from the bark. But in a reenactment of the Mayan creation myth told earlier in the film, flowers and grass burst forth from his body and he literally gives rise to new life.|$|E
