50|$|Species {{present in}} the area include the yabby (Cherax punctatus), swamp {{crayfish}} (Tenuibranchiurus glypticus), Richmond birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera richmondia), and the Australian fritillary (Argyreus hyoerbius inconstans). Both of these butterfly species are threatened, with Queensland <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses</b> listing them as vulnerable and endangered respectively.|$|R
5|$|All {{specimens}} {{from the}} NKMNP were caught {{above the ground}} in vegetation, suggesting that the species is arboreal like {{the other members of}} its genus. The chigger Eutrombicula batatas has been found on O.sydandersoni. Nothing else is known about ecology, behavior, diet, reproduction, or <b>conservation</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
5|$|Animal {{species in}} the park with special <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> are the {{northern}} spotted owl, California mountain kingsnake, tailed frog, Del Norte salamander, northern goshawk, olive-sided flycatcher, little willow flycatcher, Siskiyou gazelle beetle, and Pacific fisher. Five at-risk bat species {{are found in the}} cave: Townsend's big-eared bat, and the long-eared, fringed, long-legged, and Yuma myotis.|$|E
5|$|Each {{hartebeest}} subspecies {{is listed}} {{under a different}} <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> by the IUCN. The species {{as a whole is}} classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia.|$|E
50|$|A {{complete}} list of whale <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses</b> as listed by the IUCN is given below. Note that, {{in the case of}} the blue and gray whales, the IUCN distinguishes the statuses of various populations. These populations, while not regarded as separate species, are considered sufficiently important in terms of conservation.|$|R
2500|$|At global, {{national}} and regional government scales, many Helicia species have been threatened with extinction, as officially recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and by continental, {{national and}} local governments. Sixteen species have official IUCN global <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses</b> of either [...] "critically endangered", [...] "endangered", [...] "vulnerable" [...] or [...] "near threatened" [...] (in terms of global extinction).|$|R
50|$|The giant eland is {{native to}} Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and South Sudan. It is no longer present in The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Togo. Its {{presence}} is uncertain in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and Uganda due to over hunting by European colonialists. The subspecies have been listed with different <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses</b> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|R
5|$|Harmless to humans, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} is caught incidentally by bottom trawlers, recreational anglers, and rarely squid fishers. Though edible, {{it is not}} a valued catch and is usually discarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess its <b>conservation</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ironically, {{given its}} <b>conservation</b> <b>status,</b> Kingsley Dixon of Kings Park and Botanic Garden {{suggested}} {{that it may have}} weed potential: the species was trialled as a cut flower crop on land north of Moore River, and seedlings were noted afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Remaining {{sperm whale}} populations are large {{enough that the}} species' <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> is rated as {{vulnerable}} rather than endangered. However, the recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process, particularly in the South Pacific, where the toll on breeding-age males was severe.|$|E
50|$|A {{small amount}} of Yardley, called Old Yardley, was granted <b>conservation</b> area <b>status</b> in 1969, {{becoming}} Birmingham's first conservation area.|$|R
50|$|Thoroton and {{was granted}} <b>conservation</b> area <b>status</b> in 1974. It {{is served by}} St Helena's Church, which is a Grade I listed building.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Buckley et al. established, {{based on}} {{molecular}} phylogeny research and shell morphology research, {{that there are}} in fact no subspecies of Placostylus ambagiosus.However, in the past, what {{were thought to be}} eight extant subspecies and a number of undescribed but distinct populations were named; 6 of these [...] "subspecies" [...] are now extinct (marked with a â€ ); <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses</b> were given according to the New Zealand Threat Classification System for the extant taxa: [...] "nationally critical" [...] and [...] "nationally endangered": ...|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} found in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of South Africa, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The species has been {{captured}} from depths between 400 and 750 meters below sea level, and a 2009 study found the species most heavily concentrated between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. V. togatas <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> has not been assessed.|$|E
5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Brownell et al. reevaluated the <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> of the North Pacific {{right whale}} as a {{distinct}} species, and in 2002, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) accepted Rosenbaum's findings, and recommended that the Eubalaena nomenclature be retained for this genus. A 2007 study by Churchill provided further evidence to conclude the three living right whale species do comprise a phylogenetic lineage, distinct from the bowhead, and are rightly classified into two separate genera.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 2: Decisions {{regarding}} heritage <b>status,</b> <b>conservation</b> and demolition ...|$|R
25|$|Wildlife laws {{govern the}} {{potential}} impact of human activity on wild animals, whether directly on individuals or populations, or indirectly via habitat degradation. Similar laws may operate to protect plant species. Such laws may be enacted entirely to protect biodiversity, or as a means for protecting species deemed important for other reasons. Regulatory efforts may including the creation of special <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses,</b> prohibitions on killing, harming, or disturbing protected species, efforts to induce and support species recovery, establishment of wildlife refuges to support conservation, and prohibitions on trafficking in species or animal parts to combat poaching.|$|R
5|$|The Harbour {{porpoise}}, spectacled porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise, and Dall's porpoise are all {{listed on}} Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). In addition, the Harbour porpoise {{is covered by}} the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia. Their <b>conservation</b> <b>statuses</b> are either at least concern or data deficient.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) {{changed its}} {{assessment}} of the killer whale's <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more killer whale types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are currently the most significant worldwide threats.|$|E
5|$|It {{is listed}} on Appendix II {{as it has}} an {{unfavourable}} <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. In addition, the fin whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the smoothtooth blacktip shark's natural history; it likely inhabits shallow waters and feeds on small bony fishes. It is presumably {{viviparous}} like other members of its family. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) last assessed this species as Endangered. Although more specimens have since been discovered, the <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> of this species remains precarious due to heavy fishing and habitat degradation within its range.|$|E
50|$|The common {{house martin}} {{has a large}} range, with an {{estimated}} global extent of 10000000 km2. Its European population {{is estimated to be}} 20-48 million individuals. Global population trends have not been quantified, although there is evidence of population fluctuations. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and has no special status under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) which regulates international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants. In Europe and Britain however, population numbers indicate a declining trend, and leading conservation groups in Britain have updated the <b>conservations</b> <b>status</b> to amber indicating medium conservation concern there.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{the area}} around Thackley Road, Crag Hill Road, and Park Road was {{surveyed}} as the area was under consideration for <b>conservation</b> area <b>status</b> - but this was turned down due to the area's mixture of listed buildings with some modern features adjacent to modern buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Local and {{national}} government have recognised the city's architectural heritage through {{the designation of}} listed building and <b>conservation</b> area <b>status</b> to many developments. Since 1969, 34 conservation areas have been created, covering areas of various sizes and eras; and more than 1,200 structures have listed status based on their [...] "special architectural or historic interest".|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature {{currently}} {{assesses the}} orca's <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> as data deficient {{because of the}} likelihood that two or more killer whale types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the Southern Resident Killer Whales, the population that inhabits British Columbia and Washington state waters, {{were placed on the}} U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature last {{assessed}} the Borneo shark as Endangered, based on 2005 data {{that do not}} include the recent specimens from Mukah. Previously, several fishery surveys within its supposed historical range had failed to find it. The Borneo shark's <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> remains precarious given its very small range in waters subjected to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing. It is caught by line gear and used for meat, though it has minimal commercial significance.|$|E
5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its <b>conservation</b> <b>status</b> is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and {{to the destruction of}} nesting trees by logging.|$|E
50|$|The Pullens Buildings, {{also known}} as the Pullens Estate, are some of the last Victorian {{tenement}} buildings surviving in London, England. In the Walworth, Newington area, they are near Elephant and Castle and Kennington Underground stations. Located in Amelia Street, Crampton Street, Iliffe Street, Penton Place and Peacock Street, they are protected by <b>Conservation</b> Area <b>status</b> granted by Southwark Council.|$|R
50|$|In 2004 work {{commenced}} on the Academy of St. Francis of Assisi, {{a secondary}} school (11 - 16) under the UK Government's City Academy programme. The {{school is a}} modern four-storey building at {{the western end of}} the park, and its contemporary style caused some friction with local residents who felt that it was at odds with the park's <b>Conservation</b> Area <b>status.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{road and}} its {{vicinity}} is a conservation {{area known as}} Bukit Pasoh Conservation Area, which is bounded by New Bridge Road, Keong Saik Road, Kreta Ayer Road, Neil Road and Cantonment Road. This area was given the <b>conservation</b> area <b>status</b> on 7 July 1989. The shophouses mainly consist of two and three storey shophouses in transitional, late and art deco styles.|$|R
