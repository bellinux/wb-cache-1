5|$|I now intervened {{to settle}} this dispute, at one moment quite heated. I told the fire-brigade officer on my {{authority}} as Home Secretary {{that the house was}} to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to prevent the <b>conflagration</b> from spreading.|$|E
5|$|Working {{to a plan}} at last, James's firefighters {{had also}} created a large {{firebreak}} {{to the north of}} the <b>conflagration.</b> It contained the fire until late afternoon, when the flames leapt across and began to destroy the wide, affluent luxury shopping street of Cheapside.|$|E
5|$|During {{its early}} years, the Centre Democrats {{received}} extensive media attention on two occasions. The first {{occurred when the}} Centre Democrats and Centre Party met on 29 March 1986 in Kedichem. A group of anti-fascist activists believed that the two parties were planning to merge, and firebombed the hotel where the meeting was held. The venue was severely damaged, Janmaat narrowly escaped death and the party secretary Wil Schuurman had one leg amputated after jumping from a window to escape the <b>conflagration.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had {{turned it into a}} <b>conflagration.</b> It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E
5|$|Phoenixs {{first call}} to action came on April 2, 1955. A four-alarm blaze at the Ferry Building greatly damaged {{the north end of}} the building; losses came to $750,000. Other notable fires that Phoenix fought include Pier 70 burning in 1980, and a lengthy battle at Piers 30–32 {{throughout}} the night of May 9–10, 1984—a five-alarm explosive <b>conflagration</b> which destroyed the piers and caused an estimated $2.5million in damage.|$|E
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the <b>conflagration</b> from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames would cross London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E

5000|$|Demydivka's {{workers had}} to work hard even after the {{abolition}} of serfdom. Each able-bodied person had to cultivate 6 [...] "morgs" [...] (3.5 hectares) of land, that was almost unsuitable for the agricultural use. And farmers had to pay double the real cost for that land. Inhabitants of Demydivka did not suffer just from social oppression. In 1870 and 1873 there were two <b>conflagrations,</b> which burned 76 houses. Only 53 houses remained. Most of victims of the <b>conflagrations</b> was forced to leave their houses and had to seek livelihoods.|$|R

5|$|The Great Fire of London {{was a major}} <b>conflagration</b> {{that swept}} through the central parts of the English city of London from Sunday, 2 September to Wednesday, 5 September 1666. The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It {{threatened}} but did not reach the aristocratic district of Westminster, Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, {{and most of the}} suburban slums. It consumed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The Hotel Polen fire {{occurred}} on 9 May 1977 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The <b>conflagration</b> destroyed the Hotel Polen (Hotel Poland), a five-story {{hotel in the}} centre of the city which had been built in 1891, as well as the furniture store on the ground level and a nearby bookstore. Many of the tourists who stayed at the hotel (of whom the majority were Swedes) jumped to their deaths trying to escape the flames. Upon their arrival, the fire department used a life net to help people escape, but not everyone could be saved. The incident resulted in 33 deaths and 21 severe injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowstone {{fires of}} 1988 {{together}} formed the largest wildfire in the recorded history of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Starting as many smaller individual fires, the flames quickly spread {{out of control}} with increasing winds and drought and combined into one large <b>conflagration,</b> which burned for several months. The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and, on September 8, 1988, the entire park was closed to all non-emergency personnel {{for the first time}} in its history. Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end. A total of , or 36percent of the park was affected by the wildfires.|$|E

5|$|The {{resulting}} {{fire spread}} rapidly throughout {{the complex and}} developed into the biggest <b>conflagration</b> to occur in London between the Great Fire of 1666 and the Blitz of the Second World War; the event attracted large crowds which included several artists who provided pictorial records of the event. The fire lasted {{for most of the}} night and destroyed {{a large part of the}} palace, including the converted St Stephen's Chapel—the meeting place of the House of Commons—the Lords Chamber, the Painted Chamber and the official residences of the Speaker and the Clerk of the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|To Sukarno, {{this sort}} of {{operation}} {{had a number of}} merits. Starting a military operation against 'imperialists' would help to bind together the antagonistic forces of the army and the Communist Party (PKI) in supporting him, while not creating a fully escalated <b>conflagration</b> would prevent the militarily superior British and their Commonwealth allies from using their full force. Indonesia had also pulled off a successful operation using similar techniques in the West Irian campaign against the Dutch a decade previous, a raiding campaign into Western New Guinea had ended with the Dutch ceding that territory to prevent Indonesia from 'falling' to Communism.|$|E
5|$|Without the Austrian {{reinforcements}} {{the defenders}} of Toulon were outnumbered and outflanked, coming under sustained attack by French troops directed by 24-year-old artillery officer Captain Napoleon Bonaparte. On 17 December, French troops seized the high ground over {{the city and the}} allies were forced into a chaotic withdrawal. As Hood's ships removed the garrison and more than 14,000 refugees from the city, boat parties led by Sir Sidney Smith attempted to destroy the French fleet and dockyards with fireships. These efforts were only partially successful: fifteen ships of the line and five frigates survived the <b>conflagration</b> to form the nucleus of the French Mediterranean Fleet in the war to come. By the evening of 18 December Toulon was firmly in Republican hands.|$|E

5|$|Further controversies have {{occurred}} {{because of the}} company's involvement in the Middle East. The opening of a Burger King location in the Israeli-occupied territories led to a breach of contract dispute between Burger King and its Israeli franchise; the dispute eventually erupted into a geopolitical <b>conflagration</b> involving Muslim and Jewish groups on multiple continents over the application of and adherence to international law. The case eventually elicited reactions from {{the members of the}} 22-nation Arab League; the Islamic countries within the League made a joint threat to the company of legal sanctions including the revocation of Burger King's business licenses within the member states' territories. A second issue involving members of the Islamic faith over the interpretation of the Muslim version of Canon Law, Shariah, regarding the promotional artwork on a dessert package in the United Kingdom raised issues of cultural sensitivity, and, with the former example, posed a larger question about the lengths that companies must go to insure the smooth operation of their businesses in the communities they serve.|$|E
5|$|On August 16 the Swedes {{arrived at}} Helsingør, took {{shelter in the}} city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes {{returned}} the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a <b>conflagration.</b> Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Swedish commander Karl Gustav Wrangel resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.|$|E
5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when the fire started, they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the <b>conflagration,</b> only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E

5|$|Sherman {{settled into}} a siege of Atlanta, {{shelling}} the city and sending raids west {{and south of the}} city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids were defeated by superior southern horsemen. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. He swung his entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a <b>conflagration</b> watched by hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The Great Revolt and the {{subsequent}} sacking of Jerusalem in 70 CE brought about the destruction of Herod's Temple, including the Royal Stoa, {{by members of the}} Roman X Fretensis, XII Fulminata, XV Apollinaris and V Macedonica legions under the command of emperor Vespasian's son Titus. It is likely that the stoa was modified during the initial phases of the revolt when the Temple Mount was fortified, first by Simon Bar Giora and then by John of Gischala. The main entry at Robinson's Arch was destroyed and towers built. Excavated remains of the Stoa provide evidence of its demise in a great fire. Chemical analysis of the remains has shown that some of the materials underwent transformations requiring a minimum temperature of —a result of sustained, high-temperature burning consistent with Josephus's account of destruction in a large <b>conflagration.</b> Some remains also contain the mineral apatite, a component of bone, though its origins, human or animal, are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Mikhail Vorontsov's summer residence in Alupka so impressed Tsar Nicholas I {{that he decided}} to have his own family retreat built at neighbouring Oreanda. In September 1837, the Tsar and Tsarina visited the Crimea for the first time. The viceroy entertained them at his new residence in Alupka. Impressed with the palace and its setting, the Prussian-born Empress commissioned from Karl Friedrich Schinkel, a Berlin-based architect, a design for a new residence. His design called for a striking combination of Greek Revival and Egyptian Revival elements. The palace was to be perched on the craggy shore in Oreanda. The court architect Andrei Stackenschneider offered a less expensive design, which was adopted. The Tsarina's palace was built between 1843 and 1853 under the supervision of William Hunt and Combioggio, an architect from Odessa. This edifice was destroyed by a 1882 <b>conflagration,</b> with only a marble rotunda remaining. The next emperor, Alexander II, had the royal residence moved to Livadia.|$|E
