5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and <b>climatological</b> <b>data</b> in Earth system science.|$|E

Both simulations - those neglecting the day-night asymmetry, and those taking this asymmetry into account - showed the same Asia-America chimney ranking.

40|$|A new {{atmospheric}} humidity variable called the modified relative humidity (MRH) is proposed based on {{properties of the}} Johnson’s SB distribution function. The frequency distribution of MRH can be roughly approximated by the normal distribution, while other variables such as relative humidity and the water vapor mixing ratio cannot. This characteristic suggests that MRH is convenient for statistical variable controls such as <b>data</b> assimilation and <b>climatological</b> grid <b>data</b> controls. Super-saturation and negative water vapor states induced by positive and negative humidity increments are avoided by using MRH. Three types of MRH, Types-I, -II, and -III, were examined.
