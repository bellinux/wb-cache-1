40|$|ABSTRACT: Equine colic is an {{important}} and common cause of disease and death in horses. Gastric rupture has been extensively described in the literature, and is known to affect expressive numbers of horses. Gastric dilatation, which precedes rupture, may be observed when the animal consumes large amounts of recently harvested grass or drinks water too fast, though diagnosis criteria also include infestation with Gastherophilus {{and the presence of}} ileus and distal intestinal obstructions. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the resistance to rupture of the equine stomach to air (mm Hg) and water (L) injection. Forty stomachs of young horses (20 geldings and 20 mares) with no defined breed were analyzed. Total organ length (cm), weight (g), greater <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> (cm), lesser <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> (cm) and height (cm) were measured, with no statistical difference between males and females (p >. 05). However, stomachs of horses were larger than those of mares and therefore presented higher volumetric capacity (p< 0. 05). No difference between males and females was observed in the pressure assay (93 mmg Hg). Rupture occurred along the greater curvature (99 %) and on the visceral (80 %) and diaphragmatic (20 %) surfaces, across all layers of the gastric wall. Although the equine stomach is relatively small, the organ is considerably resistant to rupture, whether by injection of air or liquid. Horses and mares exhibit similar resistance values, although the stomach of females has smaller volumetric capacity...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{variability in}} the level of bifurcation relative to other anatomical landmarks on computed tomography (CT) and to develop an objective and reproducible technique for identifying patients with a high carotid bifurcation who might therefore be at greater risk of operative complications. MethodsThis was a retrospective cross-sectional, imaging study. A series of 86 nonselected consecutive CT carotid angiograms (172 arteries) were analysed. Using three-dimensional reconstructive software, the <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> (CL) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the straight-line distance (SLD) from the bifurcation to the base of skull was measured for 140 carotid arteries. The tortuosity index (TI) of each ICA was calculated by dividing CL by SLD. The relationship of the bifurcation to eight anatomical landmarks in the neck was assessed in order to identify a landmark that could act as a surrogate marker of high carotid bifurcation. The landmarks examined were the angle of mandible, greater horn of hyoid, body of hyoid, upper margin of thyroid cartilage, cervical vertebrae, mastoid process, sternoclavicular joint, and sternal notch. ResultsThe median <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> of the ICA was 80. 4  mm (range 58. 0 – 129. 0  mm). The median distance of bifurcation {{from the base of the}} skull was 72. 7  mm (range 58. 1 – 98. 1  mm). There was excellent interobserver agreement in measuring SLD, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 993 (p = . 00). The median tortuosity index was 1. 12 (range 1. 01 – 1. 64). Distance from the mastoid process had the greatest correlation with high bifurcation; Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0. 894 (two-tailed p = . 00).

The grinding process must satisfy the universal demands of the belt grinding technologies, and {{the most important thing is}} to make the contact wheel conform to the local geometrical features on the contact area. For the local surfaces with small curvature, the <b>curve</b> <b>length</b> between the neighboring cutting locations becomes longer to ensure processing efficiency.

40|$|Abstract. White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is a cutaneous {{fungal disease}} of hibernating bats {{associated with a}} novel Geomyces sp. fungus. Currently, confirmation of WNS requires histopathologic examination. Invasion of living tissue distinguishes this fungal infection from those caused by conventional transmissible dermatophytes. Although fungal hyphae penetrate the connective tissue of glabrous skin and muzzle, there is typically no cellular inflammatory response in hibernating bats. Preferred tissue samples to diagnose this fungal infection are rostral muzzle with nose and wing membrane fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. To optimize detection, the muzzle is trimmed longitudinally, the wing membrane is rolled, and multiple crosssections are embedded to increase the surface area examined. Periodic acid–Schiff stain is essential to discriminate the nonpigmented fungal hyphae and conidia. Fungal hyphae form cup-like epidermal erosions and ulcers in the wing membrane and pinna with involvement of underlying connective tissue. In addition, fungal hyphae are present in hair follicles and in sebaceous and apocrine glands of the muzzle with invasion of tissue surrounding adnexa. Fungal hyphae in tissues are branching and septate, but the diameter {{and shape of the}} hyphae may vary from parallel walls measuring 2 mm in diameter to irregular walls measuring 3 – 5 mm in diameter.

To investigate the spawning pattern of swordfish, we used data collected {{through a combination of}} two at sea sampling regimes. A total of 17 007 geo-located size data of swordfish were recorded during 8 years (1993 - 2001) and a total of 1727 (size range 75 – 289 cm, LJFL) swordfish gonads (1107 females and 620 males) were sampled from May 1998 to January 2001. The estimated batch fecundity ranged from 995 000 hydrated oocytes for the smallest ripe female to 4. 3 millions for the largest female sampled measuring respectively 127 to 225 cm in <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> (LJFL). The relative fecundity ranged from 25 to 72 hydrated oocytes per gram of body weight. We found that batch fecundity was positively correlated with fish length and that the older/larger females have earlier and longer spawning seasons than younger / smaller females. These findings suggested that older/larger females which are seasonally migrating in this spawning ground seem {{to play a major role}} in reproductive success of the species in producing significantly more offspring than younger females during an extended spawning season. Examination of the length-frequency date from the fishery indicated that the young fish are resident around Reunion and around the seamounts off Reunion Island.

The latter functional in turns is obtained from the corresponding 2 D functional for a fluid of hard discs of radius R {{on a flat surface}} with centers of mass confined onto a circumference of radius R_ 0. Thus the <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> of closest approach between two centers of mass of hard discs on this circumference is σ= 2 R_ 0 sin^- 1 (R/R_ 0), the length of the circular arcs. From the density functional of circular arcs, and by applying a dimensional expansion procedure to the spatial dimension orthogonal to the plane of the circumference, we finally obtain the density functional of curved rectangles of edge-lengths σ and L. The DF for curved rectangles can also be obtained by fixing the centers of mass of parallel hard cylinders of radius R and length L on a cylindrical surface of radius R_ 0. The phase behavior of a fluid of aligned curved rectangles is obtained by calculating the free-energy branches of smectic, columnar and crystalline phases for different values of the ratio R_ 0 /R in the range 1 <R_ 0 /R≤ 4; the smectic phase {{turns out to be the}} most stable except for R_ 0 /R= 4 where the crystalline phase becomes reentrant in a small range of packing fractions.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} sexual {{dimorphism}} and regional differences of the varied {{features of the}} sacrum in eastern India and record the significant anthropometric indices of the study. Background: In the determination of personal individuality from adult human skeletal remains, the pelvis affords the best marked and reliable characteristics for distinguishing sex in 90 - 95 % subjects. Since the sacrum is an integral element of the axial skeleton and contributes to the functional differences of the pelvic girdle between the two genders, it has a distinct medico-legal importance in ascertaining the sex {{by means of the}} anthropometric measurements observed upon it. Materials and Methods: 250 normal human adult sacra were acquired from the Departments of Anatomy and Anthropology under the different medical & science colleges in Kolkata, West Bengal, during the years 2004 - 2009 for the study of anthropometric measurements and sexual dimorphism. The measurements included length, width, <b>curved</b> <b>length</b> of the sacra, antero-posterior and transverse diameter of the first sacral vertebrae, sacral index, corporo-basal index etc. Demarking points [DP] for these parameters were used for identification of the sex of the sacrum.

The sacral index (44. 7 %) was found to be the most useful criterion metric data for identification of the female sacrum followed by curvature index (26. 8 %) while in case of the male sacrum, corporo-basal index (23. 6 %) was found to be most useful, followed by sacral index (9. 4 %) in this study.

We focus on the three-dimensional response of the system arising from the finite width of the imposed velocity discontinuity. In particular, we describe the complex structures that develop around the wedge and their interactions with the loading/unloading produced by the surface processes. We show that the pro- and retro-shear zones that develop in a doubly-vergent two-dimensional wedge curve {{around the end of}} the velocity line-discontinuity to merge into the strike-slip structure that naturally develop, i. e. {{as a consequence of the}} imposed boundary conditions, along the edge of the wedge. Along the retro-shear zone the stress orientation rotates along a vertical axis, which implies that the retro-shear zone is a pure thrust along all of its <b>curved</b> <b>length,</b> whereas, along the pro-shear zone stresses rotate along a horizontal axis, which, in turn, implies that the pro-shear zone progressively evolves towards an oblique thrust in its curved section. Furthermore, the outward motion (i. e. perpendicular to the direction of imposed shortening) along the curved section of the retro-shear zone is accommodated by oblique extension along a secondary, kinked structure antithetic to the retro-shear zone. We also show the complex evolution of the wedge when ductile flow and ductile strain softening is activated by increasing the imposed basal temperature. In this situation, the wedge is broader as structures develop at finite distances on either side of the line-discontinuity and its dynamics resembles more that of a ‘vise-like' orogen. At the surface, a flat plateau forms that accumulates sediment from the surrounding actively deforming mountain ranges until a channel breaks through one of the sides and flushes the inward-draining basin of its sedimentary content.

These characteristics make F 344 xGK crosses {{well suited for}} the identification of genes related to bone size and allow for future investigation on the association with type- 2 diabetes. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for bone size phenotypes measured by a new application of three-dimensional computed tomography (3 DCT) and to investigate the effects of sex- and reciprocal cross. Tibia from male and female GK and F 344 rats, representing the parental, F 1 and F 2 generations, were examined with 3 DCT and analyzed for: total and cortical volumetric BMD, straight and <b>curved</b> <b>length,</b> peri- and endosteal area at mid-shaft. F 2 progeny (108 male and 98 female) were genotyped with 192 genome-wide microsatellite markers (average distance 10 cM). Sex- and reciprocal cross-separated QTL analyses were performed for the identification of QTLs linked to 3 DCT phenotypes and true interactions were confirmed by likelihood ratio analysis in all F 2 animals. Several genome-wide significant QTLs were found in the sex- and reciprocal cross-separated progeny on chromosomes (chr) 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, and 17. Overlapping QTLs for both males and females in the (GKxF 344) F 2 progeny were located on chr 1 (39 - 67 cM). This region confirms previously reported pQCT QTLs and overlaps loci for fasting glucose. Sex separated linkage analysis confirmed a male specific QTL on chr 9 (67 - 82 cM) for endosteal area at the fibula site. Analyses separating the F 2 population both by sex and reciprocal cross identified cross specific QTLs on chr 14 (males) and chr 3 and 4 (females). Two loci, chr 4 and 6, are unique to 3 DCT and separate from pQCT generated loci. The 3 DCT method was highly reproducible and provided high precision measurements of bone size in the rat enabling identification of new sex- and cross-specific loci. The QTLs on chr 1 indicate potential genetic association between bone-related phenotypes and traits affecting type- 2 diabetes. The results illustrate the complexity of the genetic architecture of bone size phenotypes and demonstrate the importance of complementary methods for bone analysis...|$|E

Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were acquired from 38 young adults (18 men and 20 women; 22. 6 ± 3. 2 years) with normal occlusion. Thirty-five landmarks were digitized on the 3 D-rendered views. Several measurements were obtained for selected landmarks. Correlations among different variables were calculated by means of Pearson’s correlation coefficient values. Results: The body of the mandible had a longer <b>curve</b> <b>length</b> in men (102. 3 ± 4. 4 mm) than in women (94. 5 ± 4. 7 mm) (p < 0. 001), but there was no significant difference in the maxillary basal <b>curve</b> <b>length.</b> Men had significantly larger facial dimensions, whereas women had a larger gonial angle (117. 0 ± 4. 0 vs...|$|R

The fractal dimension of such curves is formally introduced, and two computer methods for approximating <b>curve</b> <b>length</b> at different scales [...] the structured walk and equipaced polygon methods [...] are outlined. Fractal dimensions can then be calculated by performing log-log regressions of <b>curve</b> <b>length</b> on various scales. These ideas are tested on the urban boundary of Cardiff, and this reveals that the fractal dimension lies between 1. 23 and 1. 29. The appropriateness of fractal geometry in describing man-made phenomena such as urban form is discussed {{in the light of}} these tests, but further research is obviously required into the robustness of the methods used, the relevance of self-similarity to urban development, and the variation in fractal dimension over time and space. ...|$|R
