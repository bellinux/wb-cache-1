5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E

5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence {{is being used to}} try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in {{the short-term}} management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not usually be given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|Boletus edulis is {{well suited}} to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its {{resulting}} texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E

It may be served hot or cold, and several recipes exist.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> either large or more compact plants.|$|E
