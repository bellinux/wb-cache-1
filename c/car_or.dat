5|$|As a hermit, Withers {{lives in}} solitude.

Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email.

5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the <b>car</b> <b>or</b> truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E

5|$|As on 31 March 2015, the Company has a {{total of}} 1306 coaches (220 trains). Apart from {{extensions}} on various existing lines, two new lines viz. Line 7 & 8 are proposed in Phase III. 486 coaches (81 six-car trains) being procured for these two new lines will have advance feature of Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Additional 258 Broad gauge (BG) coaches for Line 1 to 4 and 138 Standard Gauge (SG) coaches for Line 5 & 6 are proposed to be procured for augmentation/extensions to cater to the increased traffic. Resultantly, {{at the end of}} Phase III, there would be 2188 coaches (333 trains).

5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the <b>car,</b> <b>or</b> other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by <b>car</b> <b>or</b> van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and that they take place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E

5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any <b>car</b> <b>or</b> van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is no worse than killing over a <b>car</b> <b>or</b> woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessors, {{the game}} {{features}} some role-playing elements. Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points {{can then be}} spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a <b>car,</b> <b>or</b> witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up {{from members of the}} Golden Path. Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and prayer wheels. There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.|$|E
