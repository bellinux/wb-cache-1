50|$|A 6 bore <b>cartidge</b> rifle {{built by}} W.W. Greener in 1891 for a {{southern}} African trekker called Viljoen, fired 1750 gr g bullets at 1550 to 1600 ft/s. Three types of ammunition were supplied, hardened lead for elephants and rhinosaurus, slightly hardened lead for buffalo and pure lead with a copper tube hollow point for lion.|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} between OEM and compatible cartridges {{for a specific}} printer needs {{to take into account}} the above parameters. For example, a remanufactured cartridge may for example be purchased cheaper, but may not print out as many useful pages. Reliability and consistency associated with an OEM <b>cartidge</b> may be more important than price, for example, when printing output for important business.|$|E
50|$|A {{small number}} of {{caseless}} <b>cartidges</b> use no primer at all, but the primary propellant is ignited using an externally provided electric charge, such as with the Voere VEC-91 and the O'Dwyer VLe. This {{is not to be}} confused with an electrically ignited internal primer (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the {{development}} in 1898 of the revolutionary [...]450 Nitro Express by John Rigby & Company, achieved by loading the old [...]450 Black Powder Express with cordite, similar conversions were made to other blackpowder Express <b>cartidges,</b> including the [...]577 Black Powder Express in its various case lengths.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Express" [...] {{was coined}} by James Purdey the younger in 1856, {{derived from the}} express train, to {{publicise}} the bullet velocity of his double rifles and became common parlance for many rifle cartridges. The addition of the word “Nitro” stemmed from the propellant used in these <b>cartidges,</b> cordite, which is composed of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine.|$|R
5000|$|... 1,000 {{units of}} the Beryl M762 (wz. 96C version in 7.62×39mm <b>cartidge)</b> were {{delivered}} to the Nigerian Armed Forces in 2014, 500 in 2015. Fabryka Broni Łucznik is expecting a delivery contract exceeding 6000 units in the following years, should the Nigerian Army decide to fully adopt the weapon. At this moment (July 2017) Nigerian Army has 2,000 units of this weapon.|$|E
50|$|By 1880 {{conventional}} wisdom was the smaller 8 bore {{was a more}} practical caliber for hunting elephant, as rifles could be produced in more practical weights with more manageable recoil than the giant 4 or 6 bores. Despite this, 6 bore <b>cartidge</b> rifles and cartidges could still be purchased. The 6 bore was only made obsolete {{by the introduction of}} Nitro Express cartridges in 1898.|$|E
50|$|By 1850 {{the ivory}} trade was well {{developed}} in Africa and India, and muzzle loaded 6 bores were relatively popular, particularly for rifled weapons {{as opposed to}} smoothbores. As breech loaders and <b>cartidge</b> rifles came into vogue, the 6 bore's popularity faded in favour of the larger 4 bore, which became something of an industry standard, {{as it was a}} very popular choice of caliber for punt guns.|$|E
5000|$|No {{weapons were}} found when police raided {{his home in}} 2013. [...] From 1997 to 2000, Monis held a {{security}} guard licence, which would have let him carry a pistol between March and June 1997. The weapon that Monis used, a sawn-off French made Manufrance La Salle pump-action shotgun, was more than 50 years old. Police believe the weapon was imported in the 1950s, when no registration was required. Monis had 23 shotgun <b>cartidges</b> of different brands on him, between 15 and 20 years old.|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the metric}} {{cartridge}} designation system, a capitalized [...] "R" [...] added {{at the end}} of the designation denotes a rimmed cartridge. For example, [...] "7.62×54mmR" [...] is a rimmed cartridge, while [...] "7.62×51mm" [...] is a rimless cartridge. Under Imperial designations, there is typically no distinction between rimmed and unrimmed <b>cartidges,</b> unless one is referring to a rimmed version of a cartridge which is typically rimless, such as the [...]45 Auto Rim, a special rimmed version of the [...]45 ACP (aka [...] ".45 Auto"), intended for use in M1917 service revolvers.|$|R
5000|$|Optical Disc Archive is {{a storage}} {{technology}} that {{was introduced by}} the Sony Corporation. It uses removable cartridges, where each cartridge holds 12 optical discs. Each of the internal optical discs is similar to, but not compatible with, a Blu-ray disc.

Aqueous [18 F]fluoride was loaded onto a QMA vac 1 cc <b>cartidge</b> from the male side, the cartridge was rinsed by 1.5 mL of i-PrOH and dried with helium. 18 F was eluted {{in the opposite}} direction using a solution of 12.5 μmol of TBAOTf in 0.6 mL i-PrOH directly to a solution of 7.5 μmol of Cu(OTf) 2 Py 4, 15 μmol of I in 0.3 mL DMA. The mixture was heated in a sealed vial at 110 °C for 20 min under air. 1.0 mL of 12 M HCl was added and the reaction mixture was heated (100 oC, 10 min) furnishing the crude 6 -[18 F]FMT which was purified by HPLC using 2 % EtOH in 0.1 % AcOH as eluent. The product fraction was additionally purified using a SepPak Alumina N light cartridge.|$|E
40|$|The general aim of {{this work}} was a {{development}} of methodology and instrumentation for speciation analysis based on {{the combination of the}} selective generation of substituted hydrides with atomic absorption or atomic fluorescence spectrometry detection. The first topic of this work was the development of methodology and instrumentation for arsenic speciation analysis based on selective generation of substituted arsines with trapping in the cryogenic trap (U-tube packed with chromosorb) with AAS detection (HG- CT-AAS). The conditions of the selective hydride generation approach as well as working procedure of the cryogenic trap were optimized (appropriate approach for hydride generation, set up of heating program of cryogenic trap, new dryer - <b>cartidge</b> with NaOH, elimination of unspecific absorption, decreasing of the detection limits). The second important part of the work lay in applying of the developed method for arsenic speciation analysis in a homogenized mouse liver tissue. The direct slurry sampling to hydride generator was develop. Moreover the information about oxidation state (iAsIII,V, MAsIII,V a DMAsIII,V) was obtain. The effect of relevant experimental parameters such as tetrahydroborate concentration, TRIS buffer concentration and time of pre-reduction of the samples by L-cysteine [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{members of}} the Committee for Public Safety could not agree on a common plan, let alone control the various groups {{taking part in the}} uprising. The awakened working classes were {{pursuing}} their goals with single-minded determination. Citizen-military forces (paramilitary) organized to support the uprising. Military leaders of these forces included August Willich and Feliks Trociński and Captain Christian Zinn. On May 17 through 18, 1849, a group of workers and democrats from Trier and neighboring townships stormed the arsenal at Prüm to obtain arms for the insurgents. [...] Workers from Solingen stormed the arsenal at Gräfrath and obtained arms and <b>cartidges</b> for the insurgents. (As noted above under the heading on [...] "The Palatinate") Frederick Engels was active in the uprising in Elberfeld from May 11, 1849 {{until the end of the}} revolt. On May 10, 1849, he was in Solingen and making his way toward Elberfeld. He obtained two cases of cartridges from the arsenal at Gräfrath and carried them to Elberfeld.|$|R
5000|$|The Mauser-inspired, {{non-rotating}} claw extractor (incompatible with a {{fully enclosed}} bolt head) was eliminated, {{and replaced with}} a small wedge-shaped extractor located within a lug of the bolt head. This type of extractor does not engage the cartridge rim as it rises from the magazine into the action, but rather clips over the cartridge rim after the cartridge has been pushed into the chamber and the bolt handle is turned down. This system is more vulnerable than the old system to jamming or being inadvertently closed on an empty breech (i.e., failing to load a new round) if operated under duress, especially if the rifle is held upside-down or on its side. In addition, the old extractor design served to stabilize the bolt while the action was open; without it, the new bolt {{did not have any}} such stabilization, and wobbled while fully open. This has since been fixed in later rifles, but it was nevertheless an obvious departure and certainly less elegant in function than the earlier models, which allowed the rifle to chamber <b>cartidges</b> smoothly from any position.|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} an {{application}} pilot {{in which the}} objectives was to develop an advanced application of telecommunications in the cultural field. A full digital multimedia alpha-system was developed based on an Apple Macintosh IIfx platform and following the client-server concept. It was installed in 8 museums, their staff built a common multimedia data pool of 800 museum objects, each of them representing a multimedia data-document including {{a great number of}} related multimedia documents. One application is an authoring tool allowing the museum staff to edit and compose their own multimedia documents. The second application is a presentation system for lay museum visitors which allows them to navigate from object led by keywords representing the visitors individual associations and impressions. Experiments with 2 Mbit/s links have been conducted successfully, but because of high telecommunication cost, data updating is organised through dispatching storage media (re-writable magneto-op tical <b>cartidges).</b> Affordable telecommunication links are urgently needed to support this service. The project shows that new telecommunications technologies can contribute to cultural integration amongst European Countries. A novel kind of service to the museum world has been developed...|$|R
40|$|Counting the {{different}} subpopulations of cells in a fingerprick of human blood {{is important for}} a number of clinical Point of Care applications. It is a challenge to demonstrate the integration of sample preparation and detection techniques in a single platform. In this article we review the applications for PoC haematology and the current solutions that are available. We demonstrate a generic microfluidic platform that combines sample processing and characterisation and enumeration in a single, integrated system. Results on microfluidic 3 -part differential (granulocyte, lymphocyte, monocytes) together with erythrocyte and thrombocyte (platelet) counts on human blood are shown and corroborated with results from hospital clinical laboratory analysis. Conclusions: Identifying and counting {{the different}} subpopulations of human bloodcells is both clinically useful and technologically challenging. It provides a useful target application {{for the creation of a}} generic microfluidic platform technology in a single, hybrid <b>cartidge.</b> The prinicpal demand is to combine sample sample preparation with impedance cytometery to cover the large dynamic range in cell number, size and morphology. In particular, the ability to count both the relatively abundant, but small platelets at the same time as counting the relatively rare, but large monocytes, is a challenge. The technologies require good control of chemistry, accurate timming and control of flow, and precise control of concentrations, all of which are delivered through a well designed microfluidic sample preparation. The system described in this paper perform cell analysis and enumeration copuled with sample preprocessing and dilution. Using clinical blood, it has demonstrated good concordance with large scale hospital analysers. Beyond blood cell counting, the microfluidic platform technology will be useful in a range of applications in the future, including subtyping of blood cells, counting rare cells, cell assays and other matrices...|$|E
40|$|X. campestris pv. campestris 會引起十字花科蔬菜的黑腐病, 且會產 生大量的胞外多醣 (exopoly-saccharide, 簡稱 EPS), 又稱黃原膠 (xanthan gum) 。 為了研究黃原膠合成的基因, 選擇 p 3 DA 01 B 片段上的 pSR 3, pRR 4 與其下游片段的 pHN 4, 利用標誌基因互換, 分離乾菌落突變 株。結果只有送進 pSR 3 片段所得到的菌落為乾菌落, 此突變株命名為 XKSR。在 pSR 3 片段上帶有一 484 個胺基酸 之 ORF, 相似於 GumD, 但 與 GumD 有 5 個胺基酸序列不同的差異, 推測其功能為轉移第一個 glucose 至 lipid carrier 之 glucosyl transferase。此外, 在 pSR 3 片段上帶有 gumE 基因產物 399 個胺基酸中的 304 個胺基酸。 ORF 484 與 Rhizobium legusarum 胞外多醣調節基因產物 Pss 2 有 42. 2 ％ 的同 質性。XKSR 之 EPS產量 為野生型菌株 Xc 17 的 3. 7 ％, 而 XKSR(pP 2201) 僅達 Xc 17 之 27 ％, 此可能是因 gumD (orf 484) 基因之破壞, 影響其下游基因的表現所造成 polar effect 的影響。而相同 gumD基因 被破壞的突變株之互補株 P 22 (pP 2201), 其 EPS 產量可達野生型菌株 Xc 11 之 64 ％, 可見 P 22 突變株 gumD 基因之破壞,影響其下游基因的表 現所造成 polar effect 的影響較小。純化突變株 XKSR 之 EPS 進行 HPLC 分析, 發現與野生型株 Xc 17 之 EPS 組成不同, 可能為其它種類 之 EPS。關於突變株 XKSR 與 XKSR(pP 2201) 對小白菜、青花菜與蕪菁之 致病力測試, 結果顯示突變株 XKSR 與互補株 XKSR(pP 2201) 之 EPS 產 量減少則毒性降低, 但其致病力仍在。 The gram-negative {{bacterium}} Xanthomas campestris pv. campestris (Xc) is phytopathogenic causing black rot in cruciferous plants. It produces extracellular polysaccharide called xanthan. Some n p 3 DA 01 B have been studied, which ionvolved in xanthan gum biosynthesis. Two plasmids,pSR 3 and pRR 4,were constructed which contained inserts from the downsteram of p 3 DA 01 B,and a plasmid,pHN 4, which contained insert {{from the region}} downstream to 3 DA 01 B. A Km-resistance gene was inserted into the SacI site of these fragments and isolated non-mucoid mutants by marker exchange. A non-mucoid mutant,XKSR, was thus obtained by disruption of the pSR 3 insert. Sequence analysis and computer search revealed a ORF 484 similar to gumD, an incomplete ORF contain 304 amino acids which is 100 % identity to GumE. The ORF 484 have 5 amino acids residue {{different from that of}} GumD. GumD has been proposed to be a glucosyl transferase which transfer a glucose residue from UDP-glucose to a lipid carrier. Homology comparision of the amino acids sequence of ORF- 484 showed 42. 2 % identity to that of the R. leguminosarum Pss 2 which is a regulatory gene for polysaccharide synthesis and required for nodulation in peas. The amount of EPS produced by XKSR and XKSR(pP 2201) were about 3. 7 %, 27 % of the amount produced by Xc 17. These suggest that insertion of the <b>cartidge</b> might have a polar effect on the genes downstream to ORF 484. The amount of EPS produced by gumD mutant P 22 containing pP 2201 is about 64 % of the amount produced by Xc 11, show the polar effect is not as strong as that in XKSR. Analysis of the EPS produced by XKSR using HPLC, indicated that the EPS composition is different from that from the wild type Xc 17,suggesting that maybe there is an- other kind of EPS produced by XKSR. About the pathogenicity test for XKSR and XKSR(pP 2201), showed that both XKSR and XKSR(pP 2201) are pathogenic, but the mutant possessed reduced virulence...|$|E
40|$|A {{multi-analyte method}} for the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric {{determination}} of mycotoxins in food supplements is presented. The analytes included A and B trichothecenes (nivalenol, deoxynivalenol, 3 -acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15 -acetyldeoxyvalenol, neosolaniol, fusarenon-X, diacetoxyscirpenol, HT- 2 toxin and T- 2 toxin), aflatoxins (aflatoxin-B- 1, aflaxoin-G(1) and aflatoxin-G(2)). Alternaria toxins (alternariol, alternariol methyl ether and altenuene), fumonisins (fumonisin-B- 1, fumonisin-B- 2 and fumonisin-B- 3), ochratoxin A, zearalenone, beauvericin and sterigmatocystin. Optimization of the stimulataneous extraction of these toxins and the sample pretreatment procedure, {{as well as}} method validation were performed on maca (Lepidium meyenii) food supplements. The {{results indicated that the}} solvent mixture ethyl acetate/formic acid (95 : 5, v/v) n-hexane was applied as partial clean-up step to remove excess of co-extracted non-polar components. Further clean-up was performed on Oasis HLB(TM) <b>cartidges.</b> Samples were analysed using an Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Micromass Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface operated in the positive-ion mode. Limits of detection and quantification were in the range of 0. 3 - 30 ng g(- 1) and 1 - 100 ng g(- 1), respectively. Recovery yields were above 60 % for most of the analytes, except for different food supplements such as soy (Glycine max) isoflavones, St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), garlic (Allium sativum), Ginkgo biloba, and black radish (Raphanus niger) demonstrated the general applicability of the method. Due to different matrix effects observed in different food supplement samples, the standard addition approach was applied to perform correct quantitative analysis. In 56 out of 62 samples analysed, none of the 23 mycotoxins investigated was detected.
