5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in cytokinesis. This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid.

40|$|Introduction After {{detecting}} {{erythema multiforme}} due to contact with weeds, dandelion (Taraxacum offwinale, Compositae) and common chickweed (Stellaria media, Caryophyllaceae), which are ubiquitous plants in Vojvodina, and concerning properties of commercial screening allergens in detection of allergy to plants, we investigated contact allergy to <b>dandelion</b> and to <b>common</b> chick-weed, using their extracts. Material and methods Epicutaneous tests were performed using originally prepared ether extracts of these plants, 0. 1 % and 3 % pet., in 263 individuals: 43 with extrinsic atopic dermatitis, 55 with allergic contact dermatitis, 118 with non-allergic chronic inflammatory skin diseases and 47 healthy adults. Results Our results {{have shown that}} testing with both extracts (both concentrations) represents a safe method, since no irritation or sensibilization occurred. The overall prevalence of allergy to dandelion extract was 1. 14 %, and for common chickweed extract 2. 28 %. Discussion Plant allergies (especially Compositae) cannot always be detected by standard screening allergens. Additional testing with dandelion extract can detect most cases, which is in agreement with our results. Isolation of essential oil from common chick-weed proved the allergenic potential of this plant. The prevalence of detected allergy to dandelion {{as well as to}} common chickweed was higher than 1 %. Conclusion These ubiquitous weeds and high prevalence of detected allergies have included Vojvodina into a risk zone for getting contact sensitivity to <b>dandelion</b> and <b>common</b> chickweed. <b>Dandelion</b> extract should be considered for Compositae screening series and common chickweed extract for specific plant series in Vojvodina. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A four part {{dissection}} and rearrangement {{provides a}} new {{proof of the}} isoperimetric inequality in the plane {{as well as a}} new ap-proach to Bonnesen-type error estimates for the isoperimetric deficit of compact convex sets and of star bodies that are centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. An isoperimetric inequality in R 2 bounds the area (or related functional) of a compact set by some function of the perimeter (or related functional) of that same set. The classical isoperimetric inequality asserts that, for any compact subset S ⊆ R 2 having well-defined perimeter, (1) P (S) 2 ≥ 4 piA(S), where A(S) and P (S) respectively denote the area and perimeter of the set S. Equality holds in (1) if and only if S is a disk. In other words, the largest planar region one can enclose with a string of length ` is the disk of radius `/ 2 pi. Proofs of (1) are as <b>common</b> as <b>dandelions.</b> See, for example, any of [2], [4], [5], [6], [10], [17], [19], [20]. A proof of (1) using cyclic rearrangement is described in Section 3 of this article. In Section 1 we introduce cyclic rearrangement, a four part dissection and rearrangement that preserves much of the boundary structure of a planar star body (including its perimeter), while potentially increasing the area of the region enclosed by the boundary (itself a simple closed curve). A Bonnesen-type inequality is an isoperimetric inequality together with an error estimate, usually involving radii or widths of the original set, or of sets that inscribe and circumscribe the original set. Bonnesen-type inequalities are surveyed in [15] and are also treated in [16], [17]. In Section 2 we give a new method of proof for some of these error estimates. Although these method...|$|R
40|$|Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a pest of onion {{crops and}} other Allium spp. {{worldwide}} {{and is the}} only known vector of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) (Bunyaviridae: Tospovirus), a yieldreducing pathogen infecting onion. IYSV was first detected in New York onion fields in 2006 and has since been found throughout all of the major onion producing regions in the state. Recent studies in New York have shown that IYSV can reduce bulb size, suggesting that this disease may cause serious economic losses for the onion industry. Sources of IYSV in New York onion fields have only recently become better understood. IYSV may be annually introduced via transplanted onions imported from AZ, where the virus is established. IYSV also may be established in New York and bridge seasons through volunteer onion p lants and winter-annual, biennial and perennial weeds near onion fields. However, weed species that may be important in the epidemiology of IYSV in onion fields are not known. T. tabaci can only acquire IYSV as first instars. Therefore, a weed can only be a source for IYSV if it is also a host for immature T. tabaci. Because weed hosts that would support larval populations of T. tabaci were not known for the Great Lakes region of North America including New York, the main purpose of this research was to identify weed species that supported populations of T. tabaci larvae. In 2008 and 2009, common weed species and T. tabaci larvae were sampled from spring through early fall in the Elba Muck onion-growing region in western New York, the second largest onion growing region in the state. Ninety-eight weed species were sampled and 30 had at least one T. tabaci larva. A total of 2, 121 T. tabaci larvae were found on weeds sampled in 2008 and 2009; 17 % of the weed species were members of Asteraceae and 20 % were in the Brassicaceae. Most of the larvae (90 %) were found on species of these two families. Because IYSV is thought to be non-transmissible by seed, winterannual, biennial and perennial weed species have the ability to act as overwintering reservoirs for IYSV in onion cropping systems. Thus, these types of weed species may likely be the most important sources for this virus. Of the 30 weed species hosting T. tabaci larvae, 25 were winter-annual, biennial and perennial weeds. Of these, only four are confirmed hosts of IYSV: common burdock, Arctium minus, chicory, Cichorium intybus, curly dock, Rumex crispus, and dandelion, Taraxacum officinale. Among these four species, plant densities and populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on <b>common</b> burdock and <b>dandelion,</b> suggesting that these weed species may have the greatest potential to impact the epidemiology of IYSV in New York onion fields. Densities of T. tabaci larvae were estimated to be 3, 536 and 3, 851 larvae per hectare on common burdock in 2008 and 2009, respectively, whereas densities were estimated to be 4, 720 and 24, 964 larvae per hectare on dandelion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Larvae were only observed on curly dock in 2008 (3 larvae per hectare) and on chicory in 2009 (143 larvae per hectare). In a separate field survey in the fall of 2009, populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on <b>common</b> burdock and <b>dandelion</b> plants adjacent to onion fields (0 - 50 m), whereas no larvae were observed on these weed species farther than 5 km from onion fields. Samples of <b>common</b> burdock and <b>dandelion</b> did not test positive for IYSV; however, the relative localization of T. tabaci populations suggests that management of these weed species near onion fields in an effort {{to reduce the number of}} viruliferous T. tabaci that may colonize onion fields warrants further investigation. In addition to IYSV, there are other important viruses of vegetable crops grown in muck soils.

40|$|Bacterial canker of kiwifruit is {{the most}} {{destructive}} disease of cultivated Actinidia spp. The causal agent is the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae. Several surveys {{have been carried out}} in kiwi orchards in Romagna (northern Italy) and proved that Psa may have a significant epiphytic life, mainly on flowers, pollen and leaves. On the fruits of affected orchards Psa was detectable until early August. In Romagna, kiwifruit is cultivated in areas where also other fruit crops are grown, often side by side. A two-year survey confirmed that Psa is present as a leaf epiphyte in neighbouring stone fruit orchards (apricot and plum), when an affected kiwi orchard is nearby. Several other spontaneous plants and weeds present in kiwifruit orchards have been checked for the epiphytic presence of Psa. Stinging nettle was constantly associated with the epiphytic presence of Psa, thus providing good conditions for bacterial growth and survival. Psa was also detected on, or isolated from other weeds, like amaranth, <b>common</b> mallow, purslane, <b>dandelion</b> and smartweed. The time range during which Psa was detected/isolated on other plants was the same as Psa could be traced on kiwi plants. These results suggest that Psa, like other pathogenic and non pathogenic pseudomonads, might spend a significant lapse of time on non-host plants. The role in the epidemiology of the bacterial canker of kiwifruit of such epiphytic population is not known. As a good practice for kiwifruit orchards, control of weeds, especially in case of Psa presence, is particularly advised...|$|R
40|$|The Dance of the Spiral” is the {{original}} methodology consisting of physical exercises that based on ancient health and longevity practices. A {{research has been done}} in which this methodology has been applied to plants. Eight plants were chosen including common yarrow, wood violet, <b>dandelion,</b> <b>common</b> chicory, shepherd’s purse, cranesbill, broadleaf plantain and snowdrop, each of them grows the best in one of the eight directions. The planting was performed in eight directions, since each exercise supposedly has an effect on the state of health. Two circles were empirically defined – the Spiral and the Antispiral. Further clinical trials with 20 volunteers suffered from neurological, gastro-intestinal, cardio-vascular, and articular conditions and diseases, who stayed consecutively in the Antispiral and Spiral plant circles for 6 min in each circle were performed based on their subjective assessment of their state of health and their experience after their being stayed in the Antispiral and Spiral circles as a relaxing effect (the Antispiral circle) and a stimulating effect (the Spiral circle). The research involves the composition of essential oil extracts by 1 H NMR, gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as the spectral analysis by the methods of NES and DNES of water extracts from the common plant (Achillea millefolium) from the control group growing in its natural habitat and from the plants grown correspondingly in the Spiral and Antispiral circles. The result in the sample of common yarrow from the Spiral circle is an increase of the average energy of hydrogen bonds between H 2 O molecules. The result in the sample of common yarrow from the Antispiral circle is a decrease of the average energy of hydrogen bonds between H 2 O molecules. The essential oil composition of the samples planted in the Spiral and Antispiral circles is not identical in the quantitative and qualitative composition regarding the 83 components detected in them. The amount of chamazulene in the control group sample was 5. 41 %; in the Spiral sample – 4. 32 %; in the Antispiral sample – 10. 25 %; i. e. the amount of chamazulene in the essential oil from the Antispiral sample is almost twice of that in the control group and Spiral samples...|$|R
