5000|$|The ways {{in which}} options and {{attributes}} are grouped influence the choices that are made. Examples of such partitioning of options include the division of a household budget into categories (e.g. rent, food, utilities, transportation etc.), or <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> within a portfolio (e.g. real estate, stocks, bonds, etc.), while examples of partitioning attributes include {{the manner in which}} attributes are grouped together for example a label may group several related attributes together (e.g. convenient) or list them individually (e.g. short running time, little cleanup, low maintenance). The number and type of these categories is important because individuals have a tendency to allocate scarce resources equally across them. People tend to divide investments over the options listed in 401K plans they favor equal allocation of resources and costs across individuals (all else being equal), and are biased to assign equal probabilities to all events that could occur. As a result, aggregate consumption can be changed by the number and types of categorizations. For instance, car buyers can be nudged toward more responsible purchases by itemizing practical attributes (gas mileage, safety, warranty etc.) and aggregating less practical attributes (i.e. speed, radio, and design are grouped together as [...] "stylishness").|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} {{processes by which}} firms make capital investment decisions {{that are associated with}} developing organizational capabilities. It argues that there can be an investment in an organizational capability embedded in a capital investment in a physical asset, and asks if and how the organizational process of investment varies with characteristics of the capability. The study builds on and extends previous research by investigating the investment process as a decision-level rather than a firm-level construct, and introducing a resource-based lens to the issue. A framework was developed to classify investments in capabilities in terms of the uncertainty, organizational complexity, and competitive context associated with the investment. The research question was empirically investigated through a 29 -case, in-depth, field study of investments in six divisions of a Fortune 500 paper company. The process used to make each investment decision was retrospectively reconstructed based on document analysis and interviews. Evidence was found to support a contingency model of the capital investment process based on the degree of uncertainty associated with the investment. There were too few observations of some <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>investments</b> to draw strong conclusions about the effects of organizational complexity or competitive context on the investment process. Investments in new capabilities which are associated {{with a high degree of}} uncertainty, were found to follow a markedly different decision process than investments in existing capabilities which are associated with less uncertainty. The finding of multiple processes in the same firm supports the notion of the capital investment process as a decision-level, not a firm-level, construct and suggests that existing investment process models are incomplete. The results also provide insights into capital investment as a mechanism by which operating-level capabilities are developed, and suggest that the capital investment process itself may be developed as a higher-level organizational capability. ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{decades of}} neglect {{threaten}} 21 st century economy by Dean Baker Over {{the past two}} decades, federal support for virtually all <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> public <b>investment</b> has declined significantly. Since its peak in the late 1970 s, federal spending on public investment, measured {{as a share of}} total economic output, has fallen by more than a third, and it will fall another 35 % over the next 10 years on the current spending path. These projected spending declines—in education, infrastructure, research and development, and other areas—could significantly impede economic growth in the next century. The primary factor behind these cuts has been pressure on the overall budget. The efforts to pare back the Reagan-era deficits has required significant constraints on spending, and investment expendi-tures, which often bear no return until far in the future, have been vulnerable targets. As a result, most <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> public <b>investment</b> have seen proportionately larger cutbacks {{than the rest of the}} federal budget.

However, most of the innovations and projects presented in that field are stopped or reduced because of a common constraint that becomes its worst enemy: the financing mechanisms.
