5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a <b>cross-hatched</b> wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|Where battle {{could not}} be avoided, the late army broadly {{followed}} traditional practice as regards array. Heavy infantry would be drawn up in a main line, normally straight and several ranks deep. Mounted archers were stationed, together with light-armed slingers, {{in front of the}} main infantry line. Cavalry would be posted on the wings (light cavalry on the outside). Foot archers would form the rear rank(s) of the main infantry line. There would be a reserve line of infantry and cavalry of variable strength, {{to the rear of the}} main line, in order to deal with breaches in the main line and to exploit opportunities. At a distance of a mile or so to the rear of the army, its fortified camp of the previous night would contain its assistants and baggage, guarded by a small garrison. The camp could act as a refuge if the army was put to flight. Roman armies in the field never camped overnight without constructing defences. A ditch would be dug around the perimeter of the camp, and the spoil used to erect a rampart, which would then be topped with a palisade of sharpened wooden stakes arranged <b>cross-hatched</b> to form an impenetrable screen. Such defences, systematically patrolled, effectively precluded surprise attacks and enabled the troops to get a good night's sleep.|$|E

SEMS, when unexpanded, are small enough to fit through the channel of an endoscope, which is meant for delivery of devices for therapeutic endoscopy.

25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. The really new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the <b>cross-hatched</b> grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|Seurat {{described}} {{one of the}} brush-stroke techniques {{he developed}} on this canvas as the balayé technique, wherein a flat brush is used to apply matte colours using strokes in a criss-crossing formation. These strokes become smaller as they approach the horizon. The balayé technique is not rolled out in a consistent manner across the painting, but is adapted where Seurat thought it appropriate. The foreground—for example—consists of a balayé network of strokes atop a more solid layer of underpaint, suggesting the flickering play of sunlight over the blades of grass. This chunky, <b>cross-hatched</b> brushstroke pattern is {{in contrast with the}} nearly horizontal, much thinner strokes that are used to depict the water, and is in even greater contrast with the smoothly rendered skin of the figures.|$|E
60|$|This being {{perfectly}} good wood-cutting, notice especially its deliberation. No scrawling or scratching, or <b>cross-hatching,</b> or 'free' work of any sort.

40|$|Zinc-blende {{semiconductor}} heterostructures {{grown in}} the [001] direction with a small lattice mismatch accommodate stress by developing a <b>cross-hatch</b> dislocation pattern. In GaAs based planar microcavitiesgrown by molecular beam epitaxy, this pattern creates a potential landscape for exciton-polaritons, causing scattering and localization. We report here on suppressing the <b>cross-hatch</b> by introducing strain-compensating AlP layers {{into the center of}} the low index AlAs layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors. We observe a reduction of the <b>cross-hatch</b> dislocation density by at least one order of magnitude for 1. 1 [*]nm thick AlP layers, which correspond to an effective AlAs 0. 985 P 0. 015 low index layer.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of microdamage in bone {{may contribute to}} loss of bone quality in osteoporosis, {{and the role of}} microdamage in the etiology of fatigue fractures is unknown. Microdamage created during testing, ex vivo, can increase the fragility of bone by decreasing the load necessary to cause fracture. Microdamage can also accumulate in vivo, but its influence on bone fragility is unknown. To date, stained microcracks are the only criteria to have been correlated with bone mechanics, leaving the influence of ultrastructural damage on bone fragility open for scrutiny. Staining en bloc has identified three morphological features in the tissue, discrete microcracks, <b>cross-hatch</b> staining, and diffuse staining. The relationship between these features and their identification as microdamage remains equivocal. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the three-dimensional nature of microdamage in cancellous bone and also to describe stained microcracks, <b>cross-hatch</b> staining, and diffuse staining and to determine whether they all relate to microdamage in bone. Laser scanning confocal microscopy that provides improved spatial resolution over bright-field microscopy was used to visualize bone damage. It was found that crack surface density was highly correlated with crack density (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 0001), suggesting that the crack surface of preexisting cracks increases as new cracks are formed or submicroscopic cracks become visible under bright-field microscopy. <b>Cross-hatch</b> staining and diffuse staining included ultra-microcracks about 10 μm in length. The ultra-microcracks in <b>cross-hatch</b> staining were organized in bands and surrounded by diffuse staining. This study demonstrates that damage in bone occurs over a wide range and that discrete microcracks, <b>cross-hatch</b> staining, and diffuse staining are all indicative of bone damage. The diffuse staining still evident in association with the ultra-microcracks seen in <b>cross-hatch</b> staining and diffuse staining is probably due to damage at a still smaller scale than we have been able to investigate.

2500|$|The {{vehicles}} were {{delivered by the}} factory painted in the standard grey colour used by the Artillery Arm and other branches {{of the army and}} that was often called [...] "artillery grey". It was a rather light pearl grey shade. At first, by the Section Camouflage in the field a specially designed complex striped flame pattern was added consisting of narrow vertical red brown, dark green and yellow ochre patches, delineated in black. This was intended to break the contours of the vehicles. To some observers, it made them seem strikingly colourful. [...] The original grey paint was perhaps only partly covered, including it in the ensemble; an alternative interpretation of the lightest patches seen in black-and-white photographs is that it represents a light green hue. Later, when the appliqué armour was added a much simpler scheme was used where the same hues were shown in large irregular areas, again demarcated in black. [...] In the first combat actions, it became clear that German machine gunners concentrated their fire on the vision slits. To confuse them, in the summer of 1917 a <b>cross-hatched</b> scheme of narrow vertical and horizontal dark grey stripes was applied on top of the original patches. The stripes continued over the side machine gun ball mounts but a round area remained untouched to suggest a false position. The individual Schneider CA tanks had serial numbers ranging from 61001 to 61399. [...] The first tactical markings consisted of simple numbers, to distinguish the individual tanks within a training unit. [...] Early 1917 the combat units used small inconspicuous playing-card symbols, each symbol indicating one of four batteries within a groupe. [...] These were sprayed in white on the tank side, often combined with an individual tank number, depending on the style each groupe preferred. The tank number could also be indicated on the tank spur, by horizontal stripes.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of surface channel MOS devices depends on gate oxide interface quality. Carrier transport is enhanced in strained Si, thus its use for MOSFET channels can increase device performance. Thermal oxidation produces {{the highest quality}} Si 02. This paper compares thermal oxidation of strained Si with unstrained Si. Strained Si is achieved by epitaxial growth on relazed SiGe. The impact of large-scale <b>cross-hatching</b> roughness inherent in relaxed SiGe alloys on strained Si oxidation is investigated. The nanoscale oxide interface roughness and oxidation rate of strained Si are found to correlate with the undulating <b>cross-hatch</b> period, increasing and decreasing, respectively, with the degree of surface vicinality. Further, analysis suggests strained Si oxidation kinetics arise primarily from local variations in the SiGe substrate orientation due to <b>cross-hatching,</b> rather than strain. Devices fabricated on relatively smooth SiGe material exhibit electrical performance enhancements exceeding 75 % compared with devices fabricated on material with severe <b>cross-hatching.</b> Likely causes for the dependence of strained Si oxidation kinetics on surface morphology and the impact on MOS devices are discussed. The enhanced {{performance of}} strained Si/SiGe MOSFETs over Si control devices with equivalent oxide interface roughness is also presented. Strained Si devices exhibit mobility gains greater than 100 % and significant increases in transconductance compared with control devices. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
