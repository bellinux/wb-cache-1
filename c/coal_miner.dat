50|$|People {{have worked}} as <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> for centuries, but they became {{increasingly}} important during the Industrial revolution when coal was burnt {{on a large}} scale to fuel stationary and locomotive engines and heat buildings. Owing to coal's strategic role as a primary fuel, <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> have figured strongly in labour and political movements since that time. After the late 19th century <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> in many countries were a frequent presence in industrial disputes with both the management and government. Coal miners' politics, while complex, have occasionally been radical, with a frequent leaning towards far-left political views. A number of far-left political movements have had the support of both <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> themselves and their trade unions, particularly in Great Britain. In France, on the other hand, <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> have been much more conservative.|$|R

5000|$|The Affordable Care Act is {{a federal}} {{government}} health care law; it includes provisions that amend the Black Lung Benefits program. The Black Lung Benefits program details {{the extent to which}} <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> have their medical coverage compensated by the federal government. The ACA provisions that amend the Black Lung Benefits program are commonly known as the Byrd Amendments taking its name from the late West Virginia Congressman Robert Byrd. The Byrd Amendments are found in Section 1556 of the ACA. Among the many protections the Byrd Amendments provides <b>coal</b> <b>miners,</b> it covers medical expenses for <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> who worked at least 15 years underground (or comparable surface mining) and who have a totally disabling respiratory impairment. Further, it shifts the burden of proof of disability due to [...] "Black Lung Disease" [...] from these <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> back to the coal companies. Pneumoconiosis or [...] "Black Lung Disease" [...] can be a common health problem faced by retired <b>coal</b> <b>miners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century onward, <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> have often built strong {{connections}} with the organized labour movement, and sometimes as well with radical political movements. <b>Coal</b> <b>miners</b> {{were among the first}} groups of industrial workers to collectively organise in protection of both working and social conditions in their communities. Beginning in the 19th Century, and continuing through the 20th <b>Coal</b> <b>Miners</b> unions became powerful in many countries, the miners becoming leaders of Left or Socialist movements (as in Britain, Poland, Japan, Canada, Chile and (in the 1930s) in the U.S.) [...] Historians report that, [...] "From the 1880's {{through the end of the}} twentieth century, <b>coal</b> <b>miners</b> across the world became one of the most militant segments of the working class in the industrialized world." ...|$|R

5|$|Robson {{was born}} in Sacriston, County Durham, the fourth of five sons of Philip and Lilian Robson (née Watt). When he was a few months old, Robson's family moved to the nearby village of Langley Park where {{his father was a}} <b>coal</b> <b>miner.</b> Their two-bedroom house had no bath and an outside toilet. As a boy, he was often taken by his father to watch Newcastle United play at St James' Park on Saturday afternoons, {{requiring}} a 34-mile round trip.

Both played for Newcastle in the inside-forward position, the position Robson would later assume during his playing career.|$|E
5|$|Born in Townhill, near Dunfermline, Liddell was {{the eldest}} of <b>coal</b> <b>miner</b> James and wife Montgomery's six children. During his childhood, Liddell {{experienced}} austerity and poverty, with his family often having to subsist on bread, kail, and salt porridge. His parents became determined {{that he would not}} become a miner and helped him to decide a future career. He did not originally consider football as a viable profession, eventually choosing accountancy in preference to the civil service and church. His interest in football developed at a young age, which persuaded his parents, despite financial difficulties, to buy him a pair of football boots as a Christmas present when he asked for them aged seven. Liddell's participation in organised football began at age eight when he joined his school team, which had an average age of ten.|$|E
5|$|David Watts Morgan {{was born}} in Skewen, Wales, in 1867 to Thomas and Margaret Morgan. He was educated at Skewen Elementary School {{until the age of}} eleven, when he began work as a pit boy, helping miners with the less strenuous work such as manning {{ventilation}} doors. At the age of seventeen he was employed as a <b>coal</b> <b>miner</b> in Ynyshir in the Rhondda. In 1880 Watts Morgan became a checkweighman at the newly opened National Colliery in Wattstown, a responsible position that involved tallying the weight of coal extracted by each miner when it reached the surface. During his time at Wattstown he took evening classes to become a mining engineer. He never practised once qualified, but the knowledge he gained was useful to him in his role as the leader of several mine rescues, and gave him a practical knowledge that informed his later political life.|$|E

5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to <b>coal</b> <b>miner,</b> claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea who he was.|$|E
5|$|Horsfield {{was born}} in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. His father, Terry, was a <b>coal</b> <b>miner,</b> as was his grandfather. While still a schoolboy he started playing {{football}} for a men's team, Athersley Recreation, in the Barnsley Sunday League, and had an unsuccessful trial with home-town club Barnsley F.C. On leaving school, Horsfield took a college course in bricklaying. He continued playing football part-time, with Athersley, with Worsbrough Bridge in the Northern Counties East League, and with Football League club Scarborough, where he turned professional in July 1992. Given his league debut in March 1993 by manager Ray McHale, he was released after playing 12 league matches and returned to bricklaying and part-time football. After a nine-game spell with Halifax Town in 1994, he rejoined manager McHale at Guiseley, where his 36 goals helped the club to reach third place in the Northern Premier League Premier Division in the 1994–95 season. He moved on to Witton Albion, where he sustained a potentially career-threatening knee injury; after making a full recovery he returned to Halifax for a fee reported as £4,000.|$|E
5|$|Raised a Catholic, Antoine {{worked as}} a <b>coal</b> <b>miner</b> in his youth, then as a steelworker, before {{performing}} his military service in 1866. After marrying Catherine in 1873, he moved several times for professional reasons. Deeply impressed by Allan Kardec's writings, he organized a spiritualist group in the 1890s. In 1893, {{the death of his}} son marked the definitive loss of his faith in Catholicism. In 1896, he explained his Spiritist views in a book, then discovered the gifts of healing. Quickly known as a healer, he gathered many followers, mainly among workers disappointed by Catholicism or medicine. In 1906, he broke with Spiritism and started a religion, then published three books outlining his doctrine and consecrated the first Antoinist temple. After his death in 1912, Catherine ensured the continuity of the religion, promoting a centralized worship around the person of her husband and providing additional rules in the organization. When she died in 1940, some differences happened between the French and the Belgian temples.|$|E

5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} <b>coal</b> <b>miner</b> who owned a small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E
5|$|Warhop {{was born}} in Hinton, West Virginia. He spent his early life working as a <b>coal</b> <b>miner</b> for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Warhop played for local semi-professional teams {{sponsored}} by the railway company. He drew the attention of several minor league teams, and in 1906, Warhop signed with the Class-D Freeport Pretzels of the Wisconsin–Illinois League in 1906 to start his professional career. His debut campaign included a no-hitter on Independence Day against the La Crosse Pinks. From 1906 to 1908, Warhop had an 82–20 win–lost record and 330 strikeouts, with a career high 30 wins in 1907. After pitching to a 29–7 record for the Williamsport Millionaires in 1909, people throughout both the National and American League started to take notice of his ability. As many as a dozen teams were interested in Warhop, and he signed a $1,000 contract ($ in today's dollars) with the Detroit Tigers. However, they soon sold Warhop to the Highlanders without appearing in a single game with the Tigers.|$|E
