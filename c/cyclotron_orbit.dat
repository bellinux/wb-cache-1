50|$|Observation of the dHvA and SdH {{oscillations}} requires {{magnetic fields}} large {{enough that the}} circumference of the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit</b> is smaller than a mean free path. Therefore, dHvA and SdH experiments are usually performed at high-field facilities like the High Field Magnet Laboratory in Netherlands, Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France, the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory in Japan or the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|FRCs {{contain an}} {{important}} and uncommon feature: a [...] "magnetic null," [...] or circular line on which the magnetic field is zero. This is necessarily the case, as inside the null the magnetic field points one direction and outside the null the magnetic field points the opposite direction. Particles far from the null trace closed <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbits</b> as in other magnetic fusion geometries. Particles which cross the null, however, trace not <b>cyclotron</b> or circular <b>orbits</b> but betatron or figure-eight-like orbits, as the orbit's curvature changes direction when it crosses the magnetic null.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{magnetic}} field is moved further away from , quantum oscillations are observed that are periodic in [...] These are Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations of composite fermions. These oscillations arise from the quantization of the semiclassical <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbits</b> of composite fermions into composite fermion Landau levels.

50|$|However, for {{particles}} which mirror at safe altitudes, (in yet {{a further}} level of approximation) {{the fact that}} the field generally increases towards the center of the Earth means that the curvature {{on the side of the}} orbit nearest the Earth is somewhat greater than on the opposite side, so that the orbit has a slightly non-circular, with a (prolate) cycloidal shape, and the guiding center slowly moves perpendicular both to the field line and to the radial direction. The guiding center of the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit,</b> instead of moving exactly along the field line, therefore drifts slowly east or west (depending on the sign of the charge of the particle), and the local field line connecting the two mirror points at any moment, slowly sweeps out a surface connecting them as it moves in longitude. Eventually the particle will drift entirely around the Earth, and the surface will be closed upon itself. These drift surfaces, nested like the skin of an onion, are the surfaces of constant L in the McIlwain coordinate system. They apply not only for a perfect dipole field, but also for fields that are approximately dipolar. For a given particle, as long as only the Lorentz force is involved, B and L remain constant and particles can be trapped indefinitely. Use of (B,L) coordinates provides us with a way of mapping the real, non-dipolar terrestrial or planetary field into coordinates that behave essentially like those of a perfect dipole. The L parameter is traditionally labeled in Earth-radii, of the point where the shell crosses the magnetic Equator, of the equivalent dipole. B is measured in gauss.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} fluctuation spectrum in a magnetoplasma containing energetic electrons {{is observed}} to exhibit many {{lines at the}} cyclotron harmonics. It is shown that these fluctuations are neither due to cyclotron radiation nor due to velocity-space instabilities but due to coherent solenoidal fields produced by electron <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbits</b> and excited by thermal fluctuations. Such line spectra, observed in discharges and beam-plasma systems, may be useful for precise magnetic field diagnostics in plasmas...|$|R

40|$|We study a bilayer GaAs hole {{system that}} hosts two {{distinct}} many-body phases at low temperatures and high perpendicular magnetic fields. The higher-density (top) layer develops a Fermi sea of composite fermions (CFs) in its half-filled lowest Landau level, while the lower-density (bottom) layer forms a Wigner crystal (WC) as its filling becomes very small. Owing to the inter-layer interaction, the CFs in the top-layer feel the periodic Coulomb {{potential of the}} WC in the bottom-layer. We measure the magnetoresistance of the top-layer while changing the bottom-layer density. As the WC layer density increases, the resistance peaks separating the adjacent fractional quantum Hall states in the top-layer change nonmonotonically and attain maximum values when the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit</b> of the CFs encloses one WC lattice point. These features disappear at T = 275 mK when the WC melts. The observation of such geometric resonance features is unprecedented and surprising as it implies that the CFs retain a well-defined <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit</b> and Fermi wave vector even deep in the fractional quantum Hall regime, far from half-filling.

They are only present in high mobility samples when an initial light pulse {{has created a}} persistent photoconductive channel in the adjacent donor layer. The oscillations manifest a geometric commensurability between the electron <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit</b> and a steady-state periodic density modulation.

40|$|The {{magnetoresistance}} of a magnetically modulated two-dimensional {{electron gas}} (2 DEG) shows a positive magnetoresistance at low fields, which can be ascribed to snake orbits,́ traveling along contours of vanishing magnetic field. At slightly higher fields anomalies in the resistance result from the commensurability of the classical <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit</b> of the electrons at the Fermi energy and {{the period of the}} magnetic modulation.

40|$|We {{consider}} Schrödinger equation in external uniform magnetic field. There is no Galilean boost {{with constant}} velocity. Instead any solution can be boosted to move along a <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit.</b> This symmetry is generalized {{so that it}} maps solutions in uniform magnetic field into solutions {{of the problem with}} both uniform magnetic and uniform electric fields. The same symmetry is valid in an effective Ginzburg-Landau model of the quantum Hall effect and in the Jackiw-Pi model.

As a result, the charged particles can only occupy orbits with discrete energy values, called Landau levels. The Landau levels are degenerate, {{with the number of}} electrons per level directly proportional to the strength of the applied magnetic field.

In particular, we consider scattering on a magnetic field inhomogeneity which models scatterers in the composite-fermion theory of the half-filled Landau level. The calculated non-adiabatic shift of the guiding center is exponentially small and exhibits an oscillatory behavior related to the "self-commensurability" of the drifting <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit.</b> The analytical results are complemented with a numerical simulation.

Such a system exhibits novel magnetoresistance oscillations that we unambiguously identify as due to a commensurability effect between the period of the magnetic field and the diameter of the <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbit.</b> We find that a semiclassical picture of electron motion can quantitatively describe all of the observed experimental features.

As a result of coupling of the in-plane field component and the confining potential in the finite-width quantum well, the originally circular <b>cyclotron</b> <b>orbits</b> become anisotropic and tilted out of the sample plane.
