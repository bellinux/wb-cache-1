5000|$|An <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of 10.7 to 15.25 {{kilometers}} (35,000 to 50,000 feet).|$|R

50|$|Thermal {{stress is}} also caused by cold temperatures. When {{military}} pilots <b>operate</b> at high <b>altitude</b> with low airspeed, the temperature inside the cockpit falls. This affects both health and performance quality. In addition, thermal stress intensifies {{as the temperature}} difference between the departing airport and <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> increases. For instance, if a military pilot climbs from a 45-degree Celsius departing airport to a -60-degree Celsius <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of 40,000 feet, the rapid change creates thermal stress and hinders pilot performance.|$|R

50|$|Stretched and {{improved}} 70-78 passenger version that entered service in 2000. Its 360 knot (667 km/h) cruise speed is 60-90 knots (111-166 km/h) higher than its competitors and predecessors. Powered by PW150A engines rated at 5,071 shp (3,781 kW) at maximum power (4,850 shp or 3,620 kW maximum continuous rated). The maximum <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> is 25,000 ft (7,600 m) {{for the standard}} version, although a version with drop-down oxygen masks is offered, which increases maximum <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> to 27,000 ft (8,200 m).

5000|$|Using commercially {{available}} off-the-shelf solar cells producing only 10% efficiency, Boucher calculated that his project {{would need to}} be able to fly on about [...] The aircraft was envisioned as an unmanned sailplane that would have an <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of 73000 ft, powered by a single Samarium-cobalt magnet electric motor, the first motor of its kind in the world. The aircraft would use no batteries and, instead, would descend at night from its <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> to about 10000 ft at dawn, before solar energy was once again available for climb.|$|R
50|$|The Cirrus SR22T {{is powered}} by a Continental TSIO-550-K {{turbocharged}} engine. Turbocharging allows the engine to maintain maximum power at higher altitudes while increasing the maximum <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> to 25000 ft.|$|R

40|$|Design {{concepts}} and mission applications for unmanned high-altitude powered platforms (HAPPs) are discussed. A chemically powered HAPP (<b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> 18 - 21 km, wingspan 26 m, payload 91 kg, endurance 2 - 3 days) would use current turboprop technology. A microwave-powered HAPP (<b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> around 21 km, wingspan 57. 9 m, payload 500 kg, endurance weeks or months) would circle within or perform boost-glide maneuvers around a microwave beam of density 1. 1 kw/sq m. Of two solar-powered-HAPP designs presented, the more promising uses five vertical solar-panel-bearing fins, {{two of which}} can be made horizontal at night, (wingspan 57. 8 / 98. 3 m, payload 113 kg, endurance weeks or months). The <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> depends on the latitude and season: this HAPP design is shown to be capable of year-round 20 -km-altitude flights over the San Joaquin Valley in California, where an agricultural-monitoring mission using Landsat-like remote sensors is proposed. Other applications may be better served by the characteristics of the other HAPPs. The primary advantage of HAPPs over satellites is found to be their ability to provide rapidly available high-resolution continuous or repetitive coverage of specific areas at relatively low cost...|$|R

40|$|Human {{exposures}} to ionizing radiation have been vastly altered by developing {{technology in the}} last century. This has been most obvious {{in the development of}} radiation generating devices and the utilization of nuclear energy. But even air travel has had its impact on human exposure. Human exposure increases with advancing aircraft technology {{as a result of the}} higher <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> reducing the protective cover provided by Earth's atmosphere from extraterrestrial radiations. This increase in <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> is taken to a limit by human operations in space. Less obvious is the changing character of the radiations at higher altitudes. The associated health risks are less understood with increasing altitude due to the increasing complexity and new field components found in high-altitude and space operations...|$|R
50|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> are {{expected}} to be in the tropopause—at approximately 65,000 feet—where winds are generally less than 5 knots and clouds do not block sunlight. It is desirable in the United States to operate above 60,000 feet, above which the Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate the airspace.|$|R
40|$|The continual {{increase}} in <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> of jetpowered aircraft {{has resulted in}} meteorological requirements for successively higher levels.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} uses two 2439 KW Allison AE 2100C turboprop engines. It {{is able to}} {{fly with}} a maximum speed of 610 km/h (330 m/ph) and cruising speed of 555 km/h, making it the fastest plane of its class at the time.

50|$|The first police {{aviation}} {{department was}} established in New York City in 1919 with two fixed-wing aircraft. Fixed-wing aircraft have generally been replaced by more versatile rotary-wing aircraft since the late 1940s. However, fixed-wing aircraft are still used in some missions, such as border patrol, as their higher speed and greater <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> allow larger areas to be covered.|$|R
50|$|Normalair's high altititude {{laboratory}} {{included a}} chamber {{large enough to}} accommodate a full size mock-up of the Concorde fuselage. This was used for trials simulating the effects of supersonic cruise at up to 60,000 ft - nearly twice the <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of contemporary airliners. As well as these tests, Normalair developed the cabin pressure control equipment providing a comfortable environment for passengers.|$|R

50|$|The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is {{a heavily}} armed, long-endurance ground-attack {{variant of the}} C-130 Hercules {{transport}} fixed-wing aircraft. It carries {{a wide array of}} anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting. Because its large profile and low <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night.|$|R
5000|$|Aerial survey {{unmanned}} blimps are {{the first}} derivatives of the basic version unmanned blimps developed by Fangzhou.

50|$|Compared to the QianWei 1, {{the minimum}} <b>{{operating}}</b> <b>altitude</b> of the QianWei 2 {{has been reduced}} from 30m to 10m; the operating range has been increased from 5 km to 6 km; and the missile’s reaction time {{has been reduced to}} below 5 seconds. The QianWei 2 features a newly developed dual-band passive IR seeker with strong resistance to heat flares dispensed by the target and solar/ground heat, thus improving the missile’s performance in day/night, all-weather conditions.|$|R
50|$|In the UK the RFC Home Establishment was {{not only}} {{responsible}} for training air and ground crews and preparing squadrons to deploy to France, but providing squadrons for home defence, countering the German Zeppelin raids and later Gotha raids. The RFC (and the Royal Naval Air Service) initially had limited success against the German raids, largely through the problem of locating the attackers and having aircraft of sufficient performance to reach the <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of the German raiders.|$|R
