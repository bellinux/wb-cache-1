50|$|Acentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> {{may arise}} {{in a variety}} of ways. One way is that {{disrepair}} of DNA double-strand breaks can lead to symmetrical or asymmetrical chromatid and chromosome exchanges as well as chromatid and <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> If DNA damage exceeds the repair capacity of the cell, unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks may also result in acentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> Another way eccentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> may arise is when defects in genes related to homologous recombinational repair (ex: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51) result in a dysfunctional error-free homologous recombinational DNA repair pathway and causes the cell to resort to the error-prone non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, increasing the likelihood of incorrect repair of DNA breaks, formation of dicentric chromosomes, and acentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> If enzymes in the NHEJ repair pathway are defective as well, DNA breaks may not be repaired at all. Additionally, simultaneous excision repair of damaged or inappropriate bases incorporated in DNA that are in proximity and on opposite complementary DNA strands may lead to DNA double-stranded breaks and micronucleus formation, especially if the gap-filling step of the repair pathway is not completed.|$|R

40|$|Distributive {{disjunction}} {{is defined}} as the first division meiotic segregation of either nonhomologous chromosomes that lack homologs or homologous chromosomes that have not recombined. To determine if chromosomes from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were capable of distributive disjunction, we constructed a strain that was monosomic for both chromosome I and chromosome III and analyzed the meiotic segregation of the two monosomic chromosomes. In addition, we bisected chromosome I into two functional <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments,</b> constructed strains that were monosomic for both <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> and examined meiotic segregation of the <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> in the monosomic strains. The two nonhomologous <b>chromosomes</b> or <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> appeared to segregate from each other in approximately 90 % of the asci analyzed, indicating that yeast chromosomes were capable of distributive disjunction. We also examined the ability of a small nonhomologous centromere containing plasmid to participate in distributive disjunction with the two nonhomologous monosomic chromosomes. The plasmid appeared to efficiently participate with the two full length chromosomes suggesting that distributive disjunction in yeast is not dependent on chromosome size. Thus, distributive disjunction in S. cerevisiae appears to be different from Drosophila melanogaster where a different sized chromosome is excluded from distributive disjunction when two similar size nonhomologous chromosomes are present...|$|R
50|$|For Class I, the {{proposed}} mechanism is that chromatid breakage occurs during mitosis, {{resulting in a}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> That acentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> may segregate with the intact chromatid and result in partial tetrasomy; or, it may segregate with the complementary broken chromatid and result in partial trisomy because the broken chromatid may be saved by telomere restitution. In both cases, the inverted duplicated marker forms only after cell division and replication by rejoining the broken, replicated ends of the fragment. It is also suggested that U-type exchange during meiosis I may lead to partial tetrasomy.|$|E
50|$|Merodiploid is a {{partially}} diploid bacterium, {{which has its}} own chromosome complement and a <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> introduced by conjugation, transformation or transduction.

Over time the usage has tended to confine the term to descriptions of stable genetic states.|$|E
40|$|An optical scalpel {{and optical}} tweezer have been {{combined}} to perform intracellular microsurgery and micromanipulation in vivo. When only laser microsurgery {{was performed on}} metaphase chromosomes, the dissected sister chromatid fragments drifted off to either {{the side of the}} spindle or completely off the spindle. At anaphase the fragments separated and the two arms generally moved to their respective daughter cells. When the chromosome arm was cut during anaphase A and B, the distal <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> separated {{from the rest of the}} chromosome and moved toward the pole, following the proximal <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> Distal chromosome fragments laser-dissected during metaphase were held together throughout anaphase using the optical trap. Optical trapping of dissected chromosome fragments during anaphase A and B inhibited movement of the <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> to its pole. As a result, the trapped chromosome fragments were (1) incorporated into the opposite daughter cell, (2) lost in the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, or (3) eventually incorporated into the correct daughter cell. These results indicate that optical traps are effective in holding laser-dissected chromosome fragments throughout mitosis. This new tool should be useful for studies on chromosome movement and cell genetics. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc...|$|E

In addition to entire chromosomes, most hybrids were found to contain {{one or a few}} <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments,</b> as a result of rearrangements that had occurred in vitro. Forty additional primary hybrids, in which conventional cytogenetic analysis failed to reveal any complete human chromosome, contained many human <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments.</b> More than 300 <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> were scored and their precise chromosomal location recorded.

40|$|In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell {{division}} cycle (CDC) genes {{have been identified}} whose products are required for the execution of different steps in the cell cycle. In this study, the fidelity of transmission of a 14 -kb circular minichromosome and a 155 -kb linear <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> was examined in {{cell division}}s where specific CDC products were temporarily inactivated with either inhibitors, or temperature sensitive mutations in the appropriate CDC gene. All of the cdc mutants previously shown to induce loss of endogenous linear chromosomes also induced loss of a circular minichromosome and a large linear <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> in our study (either 1 : 0 or 2 : 0 loss events). Therefore, the efficient transmission of these artificial chromosomes depends upon the same trans factors that are required for the efficient transmission of endogenous chromosomes. In a subset of cdc mutants (cdc 6, cdc 7 and cdc 16), the rate of minichromosome loss was significantly greater than the rate of loss of the linear <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment,</b> suggesting that a structural feature of the minichromosome (nucleotide content, length or topology) makes the minichromosome hypersensitive {{to the level of}} function of these CDC gene products. In another subset of cdc mutants (cdc 7 and cdc 17), the relative rate of 1 : 0 events to 2 : 0 events differed for the minichromosome and <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment,</b> suggesting that the type of chromosome loss event observed in these mutants was dependent upon chromosome structure. Finally, we show that 2 : 0 events for the minichromosome can occur by both a RAD 52 dependent and RAD 52 independent mechanism. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} molecular functions of the CDC products...|$|E

40|$|A {{chromosome}} fragmentation assay {{was used}} to measure the efficiency and genetic control of break-induced replication (BIR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Formation of a <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> by de novo telomere generation {{at one end of the}} linear vector and recombination-dependent replication of 100 kb of chromosomal sequences at the other end of the vector occurred at high frequency in wild-type strains. RAD 51 was required for more than 95 % of BIR events involving a single-end invasion and was essential when two BIR events were required for generation of a <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> The similar genetic requirements for BIR and gene conversion suggest a common strand invasion intermediate in these two recombinational repair processes. Mutation of RAD 50 or RAD 59 conferred no significant defect in BIR in either RAD 51 or rad 51 strains. RAD 52 was shown to be essential for BIR at unique chromosomal sequences, although rare recombination events were detected between the subtelomeric Y′ repeats...|$|E

Only a few micronuclei in onion and many in bean roots synthesize nucleic acid simultaneously with their main nuclei. A few micronuclei labeled with H 3 -thymidine undergo mitotic chromosome condensation along with the main nuclei, while the unlabeled ones never do so. The onset of nucleic acid synthesis as well as mitosis in micronuclei appears to be under generalized cellular control. Although all <b>chromosomes</b> and <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> at telophase give a positive reaction for a silver stainable nucleolar fraction, in the subsequent interphase only some micronuclei, derived from such <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments,</b> are found to maintain nucleoli; others lose them with time.

40|$|The cytological and {{breeding}} behavior of barley with 8 pairs of chromosomes, of which 2 pairs are interdependent were evaluated.

Chromosome interdependence was established after a naturally occurring reciprocal translocation between the normal chromosome 5 {{and the extra}} interchanged 57 a chromosome. The interdependent <b>chromosomes</b> are <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> A Male Sterile Facilitated Recurrent Selection Population (MSFRSP) of 8 II plants was developed. Eight chromosome paired plants were crossed onto male sterile plants from barley Composite Cross XXXII. The F₁ plants from the 7 II x 8 II crosses carried a characteristic 15 -chromosome cytotype. In the F₂ of this cross, 5 different cytotype classes of progeny were isolated by root-tip chromosome and microsporocyte analyses: 7 II, F₁, 8 II, tertiary trisomic where the extra <b>chromosome</b> is a <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosome</b> and a Unique- 16 chromosome cytotype which consisted of 6 normal pairs, one pair of <b>fragments,</b> one normal <b>chromosome</b> 5 and one <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosome</b> from the other pair of fragments. The F₂ population was approximately 30 % 7 II, 50 % F₁ and 20 % 8 II cytotype progeny. Microsporocytes observed from F₂ cytotype plants indicated that the 7 II and 8 II progeny went through normal meiosis. The F₁ cytotypes produced functional gametes with 7 normal chromosomes, 8 chromosomes equivalent to gametes produced by 8 II plants and gametes with 7 normal <b>chromosomes</b> plus a <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The tertiary trisomic progeny produced functional gametes with 7 normal chromosomes and gametes with 7 normal <b>chromosomes</b> plus a <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The Unique- 16 cytotype produced functional gametes with 7 normal chromosomes, 8 chromosomes equivalent to gametes produced by 8 II plants, 7 <b>chromosomes</b> plus a <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosome</b> and 9 -chromosome gametes with 6 normal <b>chromosomes</b> plus 3 <b>fragment</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> {{two of which are}} a pair.

40|$|Trypanosomiasis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} diseases in African cattle. About 3 million cattle die every year by this disease. However, about 5 percent of the total African cattle have a natural resistance against trypanosomiasis. In a preliminary study markers linked to trypanotolerance have been identified on different chromosomes. The use of these information in breeding programs needs a close linkage of DNA markers to the trait. Therefore, a goal of the research on domestic cattle in Africa is the generation of a high resolution marker map for QTL regions significantly affecting trypanotolerance. An experimental approach for the direct analysis of chromosome regions correlated to economically important traits is microdissection. The <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> BTA 7 q 14 - q 22 which corresponds to the QTL linked to parasitaemia was isolated several times and used for the generation of chromosomal libraries.

Irradiated (cobalt 60, 100 krad) kanamycinresistant Petunia hybrida mesophyll protoplasts were chemically fused with wild-type mesophyll protoplasts of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia. Eighty-six hybrid colonies were selected on kanamycin-containing medium, and twenty-four of these could be induced to regenerate numerous shoots. Cytological analysis of the regenerants showed {{the presence of a}} few <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> in some lines, and even a metacentric chromosome in yet another line. Besides additional <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> some lines only possessed typical Nicotiana chromosomes, and this at the diploid (2 n = 2 X = 20) as well as the tetraploid (2 n = 2 X = 40) level. Biochemical analysis showed that all regenerants had neomycin phosphotransferase activity (NPTII), which suggests that intergenomic recombination and or translocation events took place at least in those lines where no additional <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> could be detected. The presence of the NPTII gene was shown by Southern hybridization. All regenerants tested were fertile, and the segregation ratios for the kanamycin gene (for self and backcross pollinations to the recipient partner) for some of the regenerants correspond with Mendelian rules for a monogenic dominant marker. Most of the regenerants showed abnormal segregation ratios; in this case, no correlation could be made between segregation ratio and chromosome composition.

This behavior of acentric <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragments</b> on anastral plant spindles differs from that reported for the astral spindles of vertebrate cells, and demonstrates that in forming plant spindles, a force for poleward chromosome motion is generated independent of the kinetochore. The data further suggest that the three stages of non- kinetochore chromosome transport we observed are all mediated by the spindle microtubules. Finally, our findings reveal that there are fundamental differences between the transport properties of forming mitotic spindles in plants and vertebrates...|$|R

We have developed a rapid and simple method for the generation of chromosome-specific DNA sequences that relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a single flow-sorted chromosome or <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> Previously reported methods {{for the development of}} chromosome libraries require larger numbers of chromosomes, with preparation of pure chromosomes sorted by flow cytometry, generation of somatic cell hybrids containing targeted chromosomes, or a combination of both procedures. These procedures are labor intensive, especially when hybrid cell lines are not already available, and this has limited the generation of chromosome-specific DNA libraries from nonhuman species. In contrast, a single sorted chromosome is a pure source of DNA for library production even when flow cytometric resolution of chromosome populations is poor. Furthermore, any sorting cytometer may be used with this technique. Using this approach, we demonstrate the generation of PCR libraries suitable for both molecular and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies from individual baboon and canine chromosomes, separate human homologues, and a rearranged marker chromosome from a transformed cell line. PCR libraries specific to subchromosomal regions have also been produced by sorting a small <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> This simple and rapid technique will allow generation of nonhuman linkage maps and probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization and the characterization of marker chromosomes from solid tumors.

The s 138 mutation is a missense mutation in the second of four conserved cysteine residues positioned similarly to those of zinc finger proteins, and we henceforth refer to the mutation of spt 4 - 138. Both spt 4 - 138 and spt 4 delta strains missegregate a <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment</b> at the permissive temperature, are temperature sensitive for growth at 37 degrees C, and upon a shift to the nonpermissive temperature show an accumulation of large budded cells, each with a nucleus. Previous studies suggest that Spt 4 p functions in a complex with Spt 5 p and Spt 6 p, and we determined that spt 6 - 140 also causes missegregation of a <b>chromosome</b> <b>fragment.</b> Double mutants carrying spt 4 delta 2 ::HIS 3 and kinetochore mutation ndc 10 - 42 or ctf 13 - 30 show a synthetic conditional phenotype.
