Breathing gases included air, 100 % oxygen, and other nitrogen-oxygen combinations. Exposure to the pressure sequences was continuous, beginning {{on the third day}} after tlJllilOr inoculation and <b>continUing</b> until planned necropsy at 1, 2, or 3 weeks.

40|$|Spiral {{concentrators}} {{are used}} globally {{in the fine}} coal processing industIy to segregate particles, by grnvitation, {{on the basis of}} density and size. Consisting of an open trough that twists vertically downwards about a centrnl axis, a sluny mix of particles and water is fed {{to the top of the}} concentrator. Particles are then separnted radially as they grnvitate downward. Since their introduction to Australia in the 19402 ̆ 7 s, the generic design has evolved largely by laboratory trial-and-error investigations of different prototypes. However, this approach has proven expensive and optimal designs have not been necessarily developed. Accordingly, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis has been used recently as an alternative method of investigation, to assume as is envisaged, a role in the design process. To date, CFD models have progressed to simulations of turbulent fluid flow on current production spiral designs, and are <b>continUing</b> to be adapted for inclusion of particles at realistic feed concentrations. To be able to use the models confidently however, laboratory experiments must also be performed to validate the predictions during the development stage. This paper reports the current findings of an ongoing CFD and experimental program applied to one spiral unit Satisfactory quantitative agreement has been achieved for the fluid and particulate flow characteristics, and although further validations are appropriate, the model already possesses significant potential for use as a reliable predictive design tool...|$|R

This was known generically as CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System), but the Paris version was called CAC (Cotation Assistée en <b>Continu).</b> By 1989, quotations were fully automated. The Palais Brongniart hosted the French financial derivatives exchanges MATIF and MONEP, until they were fully automated in 1998.

Because of difficult research conditions in Tokyo, Yuasa moved to Paris in 1940, even though the Second World War had just begun in Europe. She worked under Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the Collège de France, where she researched the alpha and beta particles emitted by artificial radioactive nuclei and the energy spectrum of beta particles. With her thesis, titled [...] "Contribution à l'étude du spectre <b>continu</b> des rayons β− émis par les corps radioactifs artificiels" [...] (Continuous beta-ray spectrum generated by artificial radioactivity), she earned a doctorate in science in 1943.|$|E
50|$|CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System) was an {{automated}} exchange system {{developed by the}} Toronto Stock Exchange. It went live on November 18, 1977, with 90 stocks. CATS was introduced, piloted and developed by Harold B. Hofmann, then the Vice President of Operations at the Toronto Stock Exchange. CATS {{was one of the}} first technologies allowing for a full automation of the price-setting process in a stock exchange. This technology was implemented in several other stock exchanges in the 1980s. In some cases, it was used as an assistance to open-outcry, but in others it allowed for a full dismantlement of the open-outcry institution. The Paris Bourse purchased this system in the early 1980s and implemented it as CAC (Cotation Assistée en <b>Continu).</b>|$|E

Carnaud et Forges de Basse-Indre.Production began on 23 December 1949 in a continuous-strip steel mill at Sérémange near to Hayange.In 1950 the company formed an association with Continental Foundry and Machines for manufacture of pilger rolls for continuous mills.|$|E
5000|$|Cotation Assistée en <b>Continu</b> (CAC) was an {{electronic}} trading system {{used at the}} Paris Bourse, the French stock exchange, in the 1980s and 1990s. It was introduced in 1986 for trading less liquid equities, and in 1989 it was operational for all listed stocks. The acronym {{is also used to}} refer to the CAC 40, a stock index provided by the Paris Bourse. Curiously, the acronym also fits the name of the early Parisian stockbrokers' association, the [...] "Compagnie des Agents de Change". The CAC system was a version of an earlier system developed by the Toronto Stock Exchange in the mid-1970s: CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System). In the early 1990s the Paris Bourse developed an upgraded technology known as NSC (Nouveau Système de Cotation), which served as a technological platform for the Euronext initiative. The Paris Bourse became Euronext Paris in 2000.|$|E
