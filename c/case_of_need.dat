25|$|In 1968, he {{published}} two novels, Easy Go and A <b>Case</b> <b>of</b> <b>Need,</b> {{the second of}} which was re-published in 1993, under his real name. Easy Go relates the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant Egyptologist, who discovers a concealed message while translating hieroglyphics, informing him of an unnamed Pharaoh whose tomb {{is yet to be}} discovered. A <b>Case</b> <b>of</b> <b>Need,</b> on the other hand, was a medical thriller in which a Boston pathologist, Dr. John Berry, investigates an apparent illegal abortion conducted by an obstetrician friend, which caused the early demise of a young woman. The novel would prove a turning point in Crichton's future novels, in which technology is important in the subject matter, although this novel was as much about medical practice. The novel earned him an Edgar Award in 1969.|$|E

25|$|The use {{of author}} {{surrogate}} was {{a feature of}} Crichton's writings {{from the beginning of}} his career. In A <b>Case</b> <b>of</b> <b>Need,</b> one of his pseudonymous whodunit stories, Crichton used first-person narrative to portray the hero, a Bostonian pathologist, who is running against the clock to clear a friend's name from medical malpractice in a girl's death from a hack-job abortion.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the Ottomans embarked on an ambitious project: the construction of a railway connecting Istanbul, the capital of the Ottoman Empire and the seat of the Islamic Caliphate, and Hejaz with its holiest shrines of Islam which are the yearly pilgrimage destination of the Hajj. Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>need.</b>|$|E

Gustavus Adolphus pledged to assist Denmark with a fleet in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>need,</b> and shortly afterwards a Swedo-Danish army and fleet compelled Wallenstein to raise the siege of Stralsund. Thus {{with the help of}} Sweden, the superior sea-power enabled Denmark to tide over her worst difficulties, and in May 1629 Christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the Treaty of Lübeck, without any diminution of territory. However, the treaty bound Christian not to interfere in the Thirty Years' War any further, removing any Danish obstacles when Gustavus Adolphus entered the war in 1630.|$|E

However, in case of emergencies or natural disasters, the Sometent (an alarm) is called and all able-bodied men between 21 and 60 of Andorran nationality must serve. This is why all Andorrans, and especially the head of each house (usually the eldest able-bodied man of a house) should, by law, keep a rifle, even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>need.</b> Andorra is a full member of the United Nations (UN), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and has a special agreement with the European Union (EU).|$|E

25|$|Of more {{importance}} was the grandiose complex {{of the two}} Belvedere palaces in Vienna. The single-storey Lower Belvedere, with its exotic gardens and zoo, was completed in 1716. The Upper Belvedere, completed between 1720 and 1722, is a more substantial building; with sparkling white stucco walls and copper roof it became a wonder of Europe. Eugene and Hildebrandt also converted an existing structure on his Marchfeld estate into a country seat, the Schlosshof, situated between the Rivers Danube and Morava. The building, completed in 1729, was far less elaborate than his other projects but it {{was strong enough to}} serve as a fortress in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>need.</b> Eugene spent much of his spare time there in his last years accommodating large hunting parties.|$|E

The film was commercially and critically well-received, winning a BAFTA award. In the same year the couple wrote for an adaptation of the novel The Bank Robber, released as The Spikes Gang. Around this time, Frank also wrote two novels, Single: a novel (1977), and Special Effects (1979).|$|E

500|$|The bridge {{crosses the}} Alakır Çayı stream, whose ancient name is unknown, [...] {{east of the}} ruins of Limyra (distance {{measured}} from the city's theatre) and [...] north of the modern coastline, close to the modern road from Turunçova to Kumluca. The local topography {{is dominated by the}} foothills of the Toçak Dağı mountains, which blend here with the alluvial bottomlands of the Bay of Finike. In this transitional area, the bridge was built immediately above the point where the narrow river valley opens into the wide estuary plain, and where the crossing of the river during the rain period would be obstructed by high water. While the eastern end of the bridge levels off at the gravel plain, the western end abuts directly to the rising rock wall of the mountain, presumably for protection against floods. The resulting sharp bend {{in the course of the}} road could also be exploited in <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>need</b> to block the road. A modern dam, Alakır Barajı, was constructed upstream for irrigation purposes and flood protection.|$|E
