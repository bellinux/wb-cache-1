40|$|A {{key issue}} in the {{realization}} of nano- and molecular-scale electronics {{is the development of}} strategies for making devices that can be assembled into circuits. 1 - 5 In the case of transistor-based circuits, useful architectures allow each <b>component</b> <b>device</b> to be individually gated. 2 - 5 Logic circuits and nonvolatile memory have now been assembled from carbon nanotubes 3 and semiconductor nanowires. 4 - 6 In the latter case, field-effect transistors (FETs) are made from cross-point nanowire junctions 4 or core-multishell nanowire structures. 5 The crossing nanowire or metal contact evaporated on the outer shell acts as the local gate contact. An important potential advantage of multishell-nanowire-based FETs is that they already embody the “wrap-around gate ” projected for future scaling of conventional silicon transistors. 7, 8 This paper demonstrates a “wrap-around gate ” approach to nanoscale thin-film transistors (TFTs).

40|$|A new random drift {{model and}} the {{measured}} angular rate model of MEMS gyro are presented. Based on such models, signal processing techniques are used to decrease gyro drift. Kalman filtering equations have been built for static measurement and dynamic measurement of the gyro array, which combines N individual gyros into a single rate estimate. By selecting the favorable cross correlation coefficient between individual gyros in the noise correlation matrix, the gyro array performance can be significantly improved over that of any individual <b>component</b> <b>device.</b> A new gyro array dynamic measurement procession is also presented. Data fusion {{of the difference between}} individual gyro dynamic measurements can identify every gyro real-time drift out and get its noisy test. Based on the laws of the gyro curve motion, the tested dynamic signal is filtered to improve the gyro accuracy. All these processings have been implemented by digital signal processor. Simulation results show that the static drift can decrease from 22. 1 °/h to 0. 184 °/h and the dynamic drift can decrease from 22. 1 °/h to 8. 98 °/h...|$|E

40|$|El pdf del artículo es la versión post-print. [...] et al. New {{luminescent}} polymers containing two individual emission species-poly(fluorene-alt-phenylene) as a blue {{host and}} variable amounts of 1, 8 -naphthalimide as red dopant {{have been designed}} and synthesized. Optical studies (optical absorption (OA) and steady-state photoluminescence emission (PL)) in diluted solutions and thin solid films reveal that the emission spectrum can be tuned by varying the content of 1, 8 -naphthalimide moieties. Although no significant interaction can be observed between both moieties in the ground state, after photoexcitation an efficient energy transfer takes place from the PFP backbone to the red chromophore, indeed, by adjusting the polymer/naphthalimide ratio {{it is possible to}} obtain single polymers which emit white light to the human eye in solid state. Energy transfer is more effective in the co-polymers than in physical mixtures of the two chromophores. We prepared single-layer electroluminescent simple devices with structure: ITO/poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) /poly(4 -styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) /active layer/Ba/Al. With this single layer-single <b>component</b> <b>device</b> structure, white light with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates (0. 3, 0. 42) is obtained for the electroluminescence (EL) emission with an efficiency of 22. 62 Cd/A. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The present {{work is in}} {{the area}} of Reliability Analysis. It is widely {{regarded}} that this is among the important areas of Modern Applied Probability and Statistics. Rel,iability theory involves a comprehensive analysis of classes of distributions describing the random time of proper functioning before the failure of a <b>component,</b> <b>device,</b> etc. This theory is known as Sur~ival Analysis in biomedical studies and Duration Analysis in economics. It has been also used in demography, queuing theory, actuarial sciences, engineering maintenance and replacement policies. Our research is focused on classes of continuous and discrete life distributions defined in terms of functions which are the main characteristics, namely, the failure rate, the mean residual lifetime, and the variance residual lifetime. Recent studies showed how important is to work with the residual variance. We study in detail models with specific shape of variance. vVe also give characterisations for aging classes consisting of log-concave life distributions. We study also different classes of discrete life distributions. V'le provide fur- ' ther properties for the geometric distribution based on constant variance residual lifetimes. Another object of recent interest is the reversed residual lifetime. The properties of the reversed failure rate have become a topic of interest not only in reliability, but also in other fields. vVe focus on properties of the reversed variance -. residual lifetime and the interrelations among reversed ageing classes. Life testing problems are central in Reliability theory because of their importance for practice. Testing exponentiality versus some ageing classes is discussed from a new point of view. We consider two types of test statistics: the empirical test statistic, and tests based on moment inequalities. Some sort of V-statistics is proposed in both cases. During this study, some new results have been obtained. They are included with all the details and illustrations. Our results are well comparable with existing results in the literature. Some of our tests for exponentiality are better than widely used tests. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
