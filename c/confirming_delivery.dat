5000|$|The use of text {{messaging}} for workplace purposes has grown significantly during the mid-2000s (decade). As companies seek competitive advantages, many employees are using new technology, collaborative applications, and real-time messaging such as SMS, instant messaging, and mobile communications {{to connect with}} teammates and customers. Some practical uses of {{text messaging}} {{include the use of}} SMS for <b>confirming</b> <b>delivery</b> or other tasks, for instant communication between a service provider and a client (e.g., stock broker and investor), and for sending alerts. Several universities have implemented a system of texting students and faculties campus alerts. One such example is Penn State. As text messaging has proliferated in business, so too have regulations governing its use. One regulation specifically governing the use of text messaging in financial-services firms engaged in stocks, equities, and securities trading is Regulatory Notice 07-59, Supervision of Electronic Communications, December 2007, issued to member firms by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In 07-59, FINRA noted that [...] "electronic communications", [...] "e-mail", and [...] "electronic correspondence" [...] may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging. Industry has had to develop new technology to allow companies to archive their employees' text messages.|$|E
40|$|Endothelin- 1 is {{a potent}} {{vasoconstrictor}} and mitogenic peptide involved in the regulation of vasomotor tone and maintenance of blood pressure. Oxidative stress activates the endothelin system, and is implicated in pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and atherosclerosis. Superoxide dismutase mimetics designed {{with the aim of}} treating diseases that involve reactive oxygen species in their pathophysiology may exert a hypotensive effect, but effects on the endothelin system are unknown. Our objective was to determine the effect of the superoxide dismutase mimetic AEOL 10150 on the basal endothelin system in vivo. Male Fischer- 344 rats were injected subcutaneously with 0, 2 or 5 mg/kg body weight of AEOL 10150 in saline. Plasma oxidative stress markers and endothelins (bigET- 1, ET- 1, ET- 2, ET- 3) as well as lung and heart endothelin/nitric oxide system gene expressions were measured using HPLC-Coularray, HPLC-Fluorescence and RT-PCR respectively. AEOL 10150 reduced (p< 0. 05) the circulating levels of isoprostane (- 25 %) and 3 -nitrotyrosine (- 50 %) measured in plasma 2 h and 24 h after treatment, <b>confirming</b> <b>delivery</b> of a physiologically-relevant dose and the potent antioxidant activity of the drug. The reduction in markers of oxidative stress coincided with sustained 24 h decrease (p< 0. 05) of plasma levels of ET- 1 (- 50 %) and ET- 3 (- 10 %). Expression of preproET- 1 and endothelin converting enzyme- 1 mRNA were not altered significantly in the lungs. However preproET- 1 (not significant) and ECE- 1 mRNA (p< 0. 05) were increased (10 - 25 %) in the heart. Changes in the lungs included decrease (p< 0. 05) of mRNA for the ET- 1 clearance receptor ETB and the vasoconstriction-signaling ETA receptor (- 30 %), and an early surge of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression followed by sustained decrease (- 40 % after 24 hours). The results indicate that interception of the endogenous physiological flux of reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species in rats impacts the endothelin/nitric oxide system, supporting a homeostatic relationship between those systems...|$|E

In both sets of calls customers telephone to <b>confirm</b> <b>delivery</b> of a service for which there has been some delay. In particular, this study investigates the strategies employed by service representatives to apologize for a perceived company's shortfall. The findings show similarities in the overall organization of both sets of calls {{as well as in the}} type of apologizing sub-strategy deployed. Service representatives in both companies coincided in choosing explanations as an expression of remedial work. Although explanations figured in both sets of calls, those given by the call-takers of one of the companies consisted of justifications for the service shortfall and contained explicit expressions of apology, while those of the other company comprised excuses and expressions of evasion of responsibility. The choice of apologizing sub-strategy is explained by the fact that the offence was regarded as non-severe and by the state of consumer rights in the country. The variation observed in the way the explanations were constructed is attributed to the different micro cultures of the companies...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION:: The {{effects of}} {{exogenous}} B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) on postmyocardial infarction (MI) are not known. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} in vivo infusion of BNP would improve cardiac function and affect left ventricular (LV) remodeling in an experimental model of MI. METHODS:: MI was induced by coronary ligation in rats and confirmed by echocardiography. 19 rats were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: sham (n = 7), MI + saline (n = 5), MI + BNP (400 ng•kg•minute) (n = 7). Infusions were delivered for 7 days via venous catheters tunneled to an infusion pump. Rats were followed for 8 weeks. Echocardiography, hemodynamics, histology, and in vivo and ex vivo pressure-volume relationships were examined. RESULTS:: LV systolic pressure, LV dP/dtmax, and infarct size improved with BNP treatment versus control MI group (132 ± 4 vs. 110 ± 2 mm Hg, 8097 ± 317 vs. 5816 ± 378 mm Hg/s, 19. 3 % ± 1. 6 % vs. 23. 3 % ± 1. 9 %, respectively; all P < 0. 05). Ex vivo end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship demonstrated reduced diastolic dysfunction after BNP therapy (P < 0. 05 vs. control MI). Serum BNP levels <b>confirmed</b> <b>delivery</b> of BNP. CONCLUSIONS:: We demonstrate beneficial effects on LV function and decreased LV remodeling with BNP infusion in an experimental model of acute MI.

A plasmid vector (pGM 169) that generates persistent expression and reduced host inflammatory responses in mice has raised prospects for translation to the clinic. The UK CF Gene Therapy Consortium is currently evaluating long-term repeated delivery of pGM 169 complexed with the cationic lipid GL 67 A in a large Multidose Trial. This regulatory-compliant evaluation of aerosol administration of nine doses of pGM 169 /GL 67 A at monthly intervals, to the sheep lung, was performed {{in preparation for the}} Multidose Trial. All sheep tolerated treatment well with no adverse effects on haematology, serum chemistry, lung function or histopathology. Acute responses were observed in relation to bronchoalveolar cellularity comprising increased neutrophils and macrophage numbers 1 day post-delivery but these increases were transient and returned to baseline. Importantly there was no cumulative inflammatory effect or lung remodelling with successive doses. Molecular analysis <b>confirmed</b> <b>delivery</b> of pGM 169 DNA to the airways and pGM 169 -specific mRNA was detected in bronchial brushing samples at day 1 following doses 1, 5 and 9. In conclusion, nine doses of pGM 169 /GL 67 A were well tolerated with no significant evidence of toxicity that would preclude adoption of a similar strategy in CF patients. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|To address {{complications}} of pathogenic antibody or life-threatening anaphylactic reactions in {{protein replacement therapy}} for patients with hemophilia or other inherited protein deficiencies, we have developed a prophylactic protocol using a murine hemophilia B model. Oral delivery of coagulation factor IX fused with cholera toxin β-subunit (with or without a furin cleavage site; CTB-FFIX or CTB-FIX), expressed in chloroplasts (up to 3. 8 % soluble protein or 0. 4 mg/g leaf tissue), bioencapsulated in plant cells, effectively blocked formation of inhibitory antibodies (undetectable or up to 100 -fold less than controls). Moreover, this treatment eliminated fatal anaphylactic reactions that occurred after four to six exposures to intravenous F. IX. Whereas only 20 – 25 % of control animals survived after six to eight F. IX doses, 90 – 93 % of F. IX-fed mice survived 12 injections without signs of allergy or anaphylaxis. Immunostaining <b>confirmed</b> <b>delivery</b> of F. IX to Peyer's patches in the ileum. Within 2 – 5 h, feeding of CTB-FFIX additionally resulted in systemic delivery of F. IX antigen. This high-responder strain of hemophilia B mice represents a new animal model to study anaphylactic reactions. The protocol was effective over a range of oral antigen doses (equivalent to 5 – 80 μg recombinant F. IX/kg), and controlled inhibitor formation and anaphylaxis long-term, up to 7 months (∼ 40 % life span of this mouse strain). Oral antigen administration caused a deviant immune response that suppressed formation of IgE and inhibitory antibodies. This cost-effective and efficient approach of antigen delivery to the gut should be applicable to several genetic diseases that are prone to pathogenic antibody responses during treatment...|$|R
