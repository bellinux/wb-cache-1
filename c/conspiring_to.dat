LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.|$|E
5|$|In 2001 RIRA members {{travelled}} to Slovakia {{to procure}} arms, and {{were caught in}} a sting operation by the British security agency MI5.

5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> lower us {{in the eyes of}} Europe.|$|E

5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002 Yaakov Abergil, {{the eldest}} of the {{brothers}} was murdered {{in front of his}} family. After his death, the leadership passed on to his brother Itzhak, who has accumulated a number of powerful enemies and survived several assassination attempts. In December 2002, one of Abergil's main rivals, underworld kingpin Ze'ev Rosenstein, was arrested on suspicion of <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> assassinate both Abergils. In 2007, Police learned that at least two contract killers, believed to be from the Commonwealth of Independent States, had come to Israel at the behest of a rival crime family embroiled in a vendetta with the Abergil crime syndicate. The police believed the two hit men to be hired by the competing Alperon crime family.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) is {{examining}} evidence relating to Johnston's murder; she discovers that Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) had suppressed infrared post-mortem photographs. Learning of this, the Elder (Philip Baker Hall)—a high-ranking Group official—demands an explanation; Watts divulges that the murdered {{man had been}} <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> pit conflicting faction within the Group against each other. Watts had found evidence {{in one of the}} photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known. The Elder agrees, and similarly decides to hold off on testing which would reveal if an artefact in Johnston's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempt to}} have Spofford tried {{was not the}} end of the dispute. In October 1878 Eddy's husband and another student, Edward Arens, were charged with <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> murder Spofford. A barman said they had offered him $500 to do it; after a complex series of claims and counter-claims, the charges were dropped when a witness {{retracted}} his statement. Eddy attributed the allegation to a plot by former students to undermine sales of the second edition of Science and Health, just published. Her lawyer had to apply for an attachment order against her house to collect his fee.|$|E

5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E
5|$|The company {{restructured}} {{itself in}} 2002, 2004 and 2006.

During the period between 2008 and 2012, Germany, Brazil, and the United States began a series of investigations into the use of Credit Suisse accounts for tax evasion. In May 2014, the company pleaded guilty to decades of <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> help US citizens avoid taxes, and agreed to pay $2.6 billion in fines.|$|E

Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee turns the men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E
5|$|Debegri {{attempts}} to subdue Tlanth under {{the pretense of}} unpaid taxes and for <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> break the Covenant. Mel and Bran and their small group of forces – mostly farmers and tradespeople – initially succeed at foiling Debegari with guerilla tactics, such as blockading a stream to flood the enemy's camp. However, the war changes for the worse when the capable Marquis of Shevraeth (25), {{the heir to the}} nearby principality of Renselaeus, takes command from Debegari. Shevraeth soon captures Mel and takes her to the capitol of Remalna-city, imprisoning her. Shevraeth tells her that the king orders her to surrender Tlanth's forces or face execution. Mel refuses, and soon escapes imprisonment with the help of their family spy, Azmus.|$|E
5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of <b>conspiring</b> <b>to</b> commit a crime and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem {{where one of the}} suspects' parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with bullet holes in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E
