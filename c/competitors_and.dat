5|$|Falafel stands or kiosks {{are common}} in every neighborhood.

5|$|A {{total of}} 32 wrestlers hold the 24 officially CMLL {{promoted}} championships, with one championship currently vacant.

The oldest CMLL championship is the Mexican National Welterweight Championship, created on June 17, 1934, {{which is also the}} oldest championship in professional wrestling still active.|$|E

Overall he finished 62nd of 97 <b>competitors</b> <b>and</b> did not qualify for the semi-finals.|$|E
5|$|At the 2009 US World Championship Trials in Indianapolis, Cielo swam {{a time of}} 21.14 {{seconds in}} the B final of the 50-metre {{freestyle}} (the A final was limited to Americans).

5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass {{to serve as a}} food resource for their young and build a brood chamber around it. The parents prepare the carcass and protect it from <b>competitors</b> <b>and</b> from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of Gagak Item the Wongs, Saeroen, Roekiah, and Mochtar {{continued}} to work with Tan's Film. Their next production, Siti Akbari (1940), was similarly successful, although again not as profitable as Terang Boelan or Fatima. Saeroen, Joshua Wong, and Mochtar left the company in 1940: Wong and Mochtar after payment disputes, and Saeroen to return to journalism. Through 1941 Tan's Film produced fewer movies than its <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> was ultimately shut down following the Japanese occupation in early 1942.|$|E
5|$|McKinney Creek Stadium {{was built}} to host all of the {{cross-country}} races, which included the biathlon and {{a portion of the}} Nordic combined competition. It consisted of a timing building, two Quonset huts for <b>competitors</b> <b>and</b> course workers, a scoreboard, and bleachers to accommodate 1,200 people. Shooting ranges were interspersed throughout the biathlon course, and were supervised by non-commissioned officers of the United States military.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{sporting}} events held on the island is the Malta Marathon.

In 2009, the full marathon winner, a Belgian, recorded a time of 2:25:59. In 2010, approximately 1,400 entrants participated.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Chauzje Choosha {{made her}} first {{appearance}} in the Olympic Games. She {{took part in the}} women's 100 meters in the preliminary round on 3 August and was drawn in heat one, finishing fourth out of eight athletes, with a time of 12:29 seconds. As of 2016, the time is her personal best. She ranked ahead of Afa Ismail from the Maldivies (12.52 seconds) and Jordan's Rima Taha (12.66 seconds) in a heat led by Feta Ahamada of the Comoros (11.81 seconds). Overall she finished 57th out of 78 <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> did not advance into the first round because her fastest time was 0.05 seconds slower than the slowest athlete who progressed.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so {{woodpeckers}} face {{competition for the}} nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E

5|$|Development for {{multiple}} platforms is profitable, but difficult. Optimizations needed for one platform architecture {{do not necessarily}} translate to others. Individual platforms such as the Sega Genesis and PlayStation 3 are seen as difficult to develop for compared to their <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> developers are not yet fully accustomed to new technologies such as multi-core processors and hyper-threading. Multi-platform releases are increasingly common, but not all differences between editions on multiple platforms can be fully explained by hardware alone, and there remain franchise stalwarts that exist solely on one system. Developers for new platforms such as handheld and mobile systems {{do not have to}} operate under the pressure of $20 million budgets and the scrutiny of publishers' marketing experts.|$|E
5|$|During the race, nine riders were {{excluded}} because of, among other actions, illegal use of cars or trains. The Tour organizers were {{happy with the}} result, but the Union Vélocipédique Française (UVF) started an investigation after complaints from other cyclists. Their investigative committee heard testimony from dozens of <b>competitors</b> <b>and</b> witnesses, and, in December 1904, disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers (Maurice Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Aucouturier). Ten of those disqualified were banned for one year, Maurice Garin {{for two years and}} the remaining two for life. In total, 29 riders were punished.|$|E
5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, {{and then up}} to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There he learned the bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, {{was not interested in}} taking up the hatchet. Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover {{may not be in}} the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail {{has a low}} basal {{metabolic}} rate (BMR), measured in 1989 at around 60–68% the rate expected for a bird of its weight. The scientists responsible for the study speculated that the low BMR was not {{as a result of}} flightlessness, which does not have this effect in other bird species, but was instead the result of the rail's island lifestyle. The island lacks predators and other <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> as such can be expected to be at full carrying capacity for rails. This in turn would favour energy conservation by the rails, resulting in small body size, low BMR and flightlessness. A comparison of flighted and flightless rails, including the Inaccessible Island rail, found that rails that lose the ability to fly also have low BMRs.|$|E
5|$|Although HTC has {{developed}} several notable Android devices, {{such as the}} Dream—the first publicly released Android device, it failed {{to capitalize on the}} first-mover advantage, and has struggled financially in recent years due to the increasing market share captured by other vendors such as Samsung and Apple. In some markets, HTC released numerous carrier-specific phones and relied heavily on wireless providers to promote its products, a strategy that was unsuccessful in the face of Samsung and Apple’s strong marketing efforts. The company’s flagship phone in 2012, the One X, received critical acclaim from reviewers, but was commercially unsuccessful {{in the wake of the}} Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. In response, the company planned to take bigger risks with their next flagship device to make it stand out among its <b>competitors,</b> <b>and</b> also planned to take a more direct role in promoting its products—doubling its marketing budget for 2013.|$|E
