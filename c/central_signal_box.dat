These will be controlled from a new signal box on site sourced from [...] on the former King's Lynn line. This project has also made the commissioning of the dormant Dereham <b>Central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> a priority for the company. As of 29 January 2009, over £25,000 has been raised towards the new works taking the appeal over half way.|$|E

50|$|The station, and all trains serving it, are {{operated}} by Northern. The manually operated level crossing gates {{seen in the}} photo and the wooden Great <b>Central</b> Railway <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> that operated them have both since {{been replaced by a}} modern brick structure and lifting barriers respectively - the new <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> is on northside of the line, and is one of a few little boxes to be built in recent years. The station building is a private house now, but there are shelters on both platforms.|$|R
50|$|In late 2013, {{work began}} to {{decommission}} the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and move Petone and Melling branch signalling to the National Train Control Centre in <b>central</b> Wellington. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> closed on 24 December 2013, allowing {{a block of}} line to take place and the signals switched over during the quiet Christmas/New Year period. The new signals came into use on 6 January 2014.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} a <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> of the Sp Dr S60 class, {{which was built}} in 1965. Apart from Neunkirchen station, it {{controls}} the stations on the Sulzbach line (Dudweiler, Sulzbach, Friedrichsthal, Landsweiler-Reden) as well as Bexbach station {{on the line to}} Homburg and its long-distance signals.|$|E
5000|$|An [...] {{must have}} at least one turnout. On double tracked routes, single and double {{crossovers}} are common, each one consisting of two turnouts and an intermediate section. Very often - but not mandatory - the turnouts and block signals at an [...] are remotely controlled or set from a <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Leipzig-Wahren station did {{not receive}} a <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> only a signal box at its exit with a track-diagram relay {{interlocking}} of the GS II DR type. Also, colour-light signals were not installed throughout the station and were essentially only used as entry signals and on the passenger tracks. Electrodynamic track brakes were installed on the marshalling-yard hump.|$|E
50|$|Habrough {{railway station}} serves {{the village of}} Habrough {{and the town of}} Immingham in North East Lincolnshire, England. It was built by the Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway in 1848. Up until 1988 there was a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> at the station {{on the south side of}} the track and east side of the road with {{manually-operated}} gates. It was of typical Great <b>Central</b> Railway <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> design. The main buildings were located on the eastbound platform and were linked to the westbound one via a footbridge, but both have also been demolished and the crossing is now automatic.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} built by the Wakefield, Pontefract and Goole Railway, a {{constituent}} company of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway; the route through here opening to traffic in 1848. Later in its history the station was absorbed into the LMSR London Midland and Scottish Railway before it {{became part of the}} British Railways network in 1948. Today the station is operated by Northern. The station was until 2014 home to one of the last sets of electrical wheel boom level crossing gates in the world; Castleford Cutsyke Junction, Urlay Nook (near Darlington) and Hensall were the final serving gates after the removal of the gates at Brough and Redcar <b>Central.</b> Hensall <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> (located adjacent the south platform) has recently been awarded grade II listing status along with 25 other historical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> The list, announced by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, includes <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> dating from late-Victorian times. Despite its listed status, it was taken out of operational use in May 2014, when control of signalling in the area passed to the signalling centre at Ferrybridge. The boom gates were also replaced by standard automatic lifting barriers as part of the project.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, about 500 metres {{before the}} concourse, an {{imposing}} six-storey concrete cube {{arose in the}} station yard. It was designed by SBB architect , {{and it has been}} the home of the Zentralstellwerk Zürich (<b>central</b> <b>signalling</b> control) since 1966. The then state-of-the-art relay-controlled interlocking system replaced the decentralised mechanical and electro-mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in the station throat, including the Stellwerk «Seufzerbrücke» ("Bridge of Sighs" [...] <b>signal</b> <b>box),</b> which had spanned the entire station throat just east of the Langstrasse.|$|R
50|$|Signalling on the {{two lines}} of Athens Metro is {{centered}} on an Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system, type LZB 700, compatible with the ISAP ATP system. An Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system has also been installed and is under evaluation. In the short section between Larissa station and Sepolia Depot an Indusi system was installed initially, so that the section {{could be used by}} ISAP trains, however this was later removed. The network is controlled by operators stationed in a <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> located at Syntagma station.|$|E
5000|$|A direct {{approach}} from Leipzig Hauptbahnhof {{has not been}} possible since the upgrade of the line to Dresden. It is possible for trains to run towards Dresden from the middle and {{the eastern end of}} the marshalling yard. In addition, a third track runs directly from the freight yard parallel to the line to Dresden as far as Borsdorf. As a result of upgrade of the Leipzig-Dresden railway, mainline tracks 1 and 2 and the third track to Borsdorf are no longer controlled by <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> 8, but are instead controlled by the electronic control centre in Wurzen.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, {{the track}} was rebuilt with continuously-welded rail. The {{platforms}} between Eidelstedt and Kaltenkirchen were raised to a uniform height of 76 cm and extedended to {{a length of}} 100 metres. Crossings were abolished or secured with half-barriers. This allowed the travel time between Kaltenkirchen and Eidelstedt to be reduced to between 38 and 44 minutes. A <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was put into operation in Ulzburg Süd in 1976 and signal boxes were also installed in Quickborn, Hamburg-Schnelsen and Kaltenkirchen (from 1982). Since 1983, they work with microprocessors instead of relay technology. Signalling on the line began to be controlled from an electronic interlocking in Kaltenkirchen from 2002. The entire route was converted by 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Glasgow <b>Central</b> <b>Signalling</b> Centre, {{located in}} the [...] "vee" [...] of Bridge Street Junction, opened on 2 January 1961. It {{replaced}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at <b>Central</b> Station, Bridge Street Junction, Eglinton Street Junction and Eglinton Street Station. When initially opened it was capable of handling 1,000 routes.|$|R
5000|$|Euskirchen {{station is}} a major railway junction, and its lines have {{had to cope with}} a high volume of {{commuter}} traffic with heavy overcrowding of trains. In order to handle traffic a new <b>central</b> railway station <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was built for the equivalent of about € 2.9 million. This was put into operation on 12 December 1973, after three years of planning and construction. Since the 90s, large central bus station, which was built by the city, has been located directly on the station forecourt. This has two fully covered walkways, which are served on both sides and a less protected platform for school buses. There is also an information point for travellers, electronic information displays, and an integrated taxi parking area. The station building houses lockers, vending machines, a ticket office, a bookstore, a bakery and a McDonald's restaurant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>central</b> <b>signalling</b> centre {{was brought}} into {{operation}} on 11 October 1964 at 4 AM. The new <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> controlled 295 sets of points and 446 signals and detected occupancy on 300 sections of track and seven automatic block sections. In the signalling centre there were four interlockings, one controlling the Holzkirchen wing station, two controlling the tracks of the main hall {{and the other one}} controlling the Starnberg wing station. The new interlockings needed only 38 staff for operations and 12 for maintaining the signal technology, saving 93 jobs.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{total length}} of over 1¼ miles, between Wath Central railway station and Elsecar Junction, and with over 36 miles of track this was two yards in one: Eastbound traffic was {{received}} in 8 reception sidings feeding 31 departure sidings {{and controlled by}} [...] "B" [...] Box, whilst for westbound traffic there was a fan of 9 reception sidings, again feeding 31 departure sidings and controlled by [...] "A" [...] Box. The western entry/exit to the yard was {{under the control of}} Elsecar Junction signal box whilst the eastern end was controlled by Moor Road signal box, with additional control from the Wath <b>Central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> which controlled the main lines through the yard and was situated by the station. The yard could handle as many as 5,000 wagons per day.|$|E
50|$|At {{the eastern}} side, {{the station was}} still as high above street level, however, the four {{platforms}} and many sidings contained within the station narrow to cross Easter Road on a four-track bridge. Before crossing Easter Road, the train sheds finished just before the platform ends, around 45 yd from Easter Road. Between the glass panelled gable end of the train shed and the Easter Road bridge was located Leith <b>Central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> controlling the approach to the station, most notably the three scissors crossings at the station mouth.Also provided at the Easter Road end of the station was an additional entrance. From almost underneath the Easter Road bridge, access was gained to the platforms by way of two stairways, meaning passengers {{did not have to}} make the long trip from the bottom of Easter Road to the foot of Leith Walk to catch their train.|$|E
5000|$|The railway {{junction}} {{was destroyed in}} an air raid on 22 February 1945. This failed, however, to damage the station area, except for {{an apartment in the}} station building, the [...] "Lm" [...] signal box and the building of the track master (Bahnmeisterei); these were later rebuilt. However, houses were hit near the station. The air raid killed about 150 people in Ludwigslust. [...] The station’s <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> [...] "B 1" [...] was opened in 1957. Deutsche Post opened a packet handling facility at the station on 27 May 1962 and, from 31 May 1964, all parcels between the three northern districts of German Democratic Republic, Neubrandenburg, Rostock and Schwerin and the Federal Republic of Germany were handled here. The facility, which had its own railway sidings, operated until 1993. The station post office, established in 1913, was later closed. The second mainline track between Wittenberg and Schwerin was rebuilt after 1980.|$|E
50|$|The station building, {{the nearby}} level {{crossing}} <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and footbridge are each listed buildings. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was the prototype for the Airfix kit <b>signal</b> <b>box.</b>|$|R
50|$|The station {{also had}} three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes.</b> <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> I (Stellwerk I) {{was in the}} {{northern}} part of the station, <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> II was in the middle of the platform. <b>Signal</b> <b>box</b> III was in the southern part of the station. Since the 1980s, however, they have been out of operation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> - 1880 timber <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on Gainsthorpe Road.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{operating}} concept adopted {{the tracks of}} the new line and the North-South line run parallel {{in the same direction}} {{on either side of the}} station platforms, allowing easy transfers between the two lines. The tracks of the new line were built in the middle of the tracks through the existing through station, on either sides are the tracks of the north-south line. All existing tracks had to be rebuilt for this work, including the bridges of intersecting roads and water systems. Overall, between 1984 and 1991 (according to a planning document in about 1988), there would be 89 construction stages with 28 intermediate track layouts, during which the operation of passenger and freight through the station was to be fully maintained. In 1985 a new <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> went into operation. The relocated tracks on the north-south line towards Frankfurt went into operation in December 1986; the tracks towards Göttingen followed in October 1987. At the end of 1987, railway construction began on the new line to Kassel.|$|E
5000|$|Full {{signalling}} will {{be included}} {{as part of the}} final project including five semaphore and two colour light signals along with two point motors to operate the turnouts. These will be controlled from a new signal box on site sourced from [...] on the former King's Lynn line. This project has also made the commissioning of the dormant Dereham <b>Central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> a priority for the company. As of 29 January 2009, over £25,000 has been raised towards the new works taking the appeal over half way.Since becoming operational in September 2010, work has continued on the signalling, the signal box became operational during summer 2015 allowing the temporary ground frame and shed to be removed. A Trap point will be fitted to the exit of the siding south of Thuxton station, as well as additional signals including signals allowing bi-directional movements in the down platform and a ground frame at Garvestone crossing with associated gate locks and distant signals interlocked with Thuxton signal box. The completed scheme will allow the train from Wymondham to arrive before the train from Dereham when two trains are operating, this isn't currently possible. Locomotives will also be able to run round their trains in the station.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} November 1988 a new <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{went into}} service at Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof. At {{each end of the}} station there is a train {{dispatcher}} (Fahrdienstleiter) and assistant (Fahrdiensthelfer) to control the western and eastern approaches, supported by a train monitor (Zugmelder), a train announcer (Zugansager) and a pointsman (Wärter) for the adjoining coach works. Its area of operations extends as far as Fürth and the station at Schweinau to the west, to Eibach station to the south and the stations of Dutzendteich and Mögeldorf to the east. In all, 38.3 million deutschmarks were invested. 800 train movements and 2,900 shunting movements are handled per day in the Hauptbahnhof area. Planning began in the 1970s, not just for rationalisation, but also to set out the requirements for the planned high-speed railway to Munich. Shortly before the signal box was opened, a new, million deutschmark, departure board went into service in the Mittelhalle, that was controlled by the new signal box using computers. The new signal box replaced ten old ones that were about 70 years old; three more followed suit as part of the S-Bahn extension in the early 1990s. After the removal of these unfavourably sited, old signal boxes, which were not capable of expansion, five groups of storage sidings could be merged into one.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{extension}} of the Süderelbe junction interlocking zone, which is now remotely controlled from the modernised <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> in Hamburg-Harburg (and the dismantling of Sf <b>signal</b> <b>box).</b> Veddel Vf, Hob and Wr IV (in the former Hamburg main freight yard) <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> are now also controlled from Hamburg-Harburg and Hob and Wr IV <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> have been dismantled.|$|R
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} signalled by {{a mixture of}} semaphore signals and colour lights by several <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> over the years. Almost every station had a <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> Lewes even had five <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> controlling the area including the goods yard. Polegate had three <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> and other <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> at Willingdon and Stone Cross junctions and at Pevensey Bay and Cooden Beach There were also crossing boxes at Ripe, between Glynde and Berwick, and at Wilmington, between Berwick and Polegate.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2013 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was repainted externally. In June 2016 the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{frame and}} point {{connecting}} rods were renewed increasing {{the life expectancy}} of the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> and reducing the chance of failure ...|$|R
5000|$|... 14 {{mechanical}} signal boxes were {{built for the}} operation of the freight yard, mainly of the Bruchsal G design. Over the years, signal boxes B and D were abolished during the replacement of sets of points and in 1974 signal boxes 5, 7, 8 (old), 10 and 11 were replaced during the commissioning of the new <b>central</b> <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> B8. Signal box 4 was destroyed in an air raid during the Second World War and reconstructed in 1947 in a different style with yellow clinker brickwork and a lever frame of the Jüdel design from old spare parts. In the 1960s, an electro-mechanical lever frame of a 1907 design was installed in the previously {{mechanical signal}} box A and, in addition, the approach track received three beam retarders. In 1971, colour light signals were installed on the western hump. These are operated centrally by the dispatcher at the western hump, who was moved from signal box 2 to exit signal box 1 at the same time. During the construction of the Engelsdorf crossing structure, which took the Leipzig-Geithain railway under the exit from the yard, exit signal boxes A and 3 were remodelled. Both were equipped with electro-mechanical lever frames of 1912 design with lamp monitoring and signal box A was relocated from its old position on the crossing structure to the already prepared Bremsturm (brake signal box). In 1988, the sorting tracks were equipped with screw-type track brakes so that since then no riders have been required to retard wagons.|$|E
50|$|Bidston {{had four}} <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> in 1899. These <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{situated}} alongside the Dee, West, East and North junctions. The nearest {{to the station}} was the Bidston Dee Junction box. The second Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{was built in the}} 1930s by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway, and was much larger than the earlier <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> which had been built by the Wirral Railway. This <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> had a 65-lever frame and also took over the operation of Bidston North Junction, when built. Bidston Dee Junction <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was closed on 17 September 1994, and demolished two months later on 20 November.|$|R
50|$|The {{dismantling}} of the Rhenish line between Steinfurt and St. Arnold started on 30 September 2005. Of the four former <b>signal</b> <b>boxes,</b> two have already been demolished, the Bn <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> on the Rhenish line and the Bmf <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> which was located on the former middle platform. The two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> on the Enschede line (the Bf <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the south and}} the Bw <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> {{to the north of the}} station) are still standing, but are out of service. Since 26 October 2008, signalling and points at the station have been remotely controlled from the electronic signalling centre at Coesfeld (Westf) station.|$|R
50|$|The station did {{not have}} a passing loop being only a block post {{splitting}} the line into two sections. It had a goods yard, <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> goods shed, and a level crossing with gates. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> near the level crossing was replaced by a <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> located on the platform in 1915. The <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> was renamed Dousland from Dousland Barn.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station has}} been {{controlled}} by an electronic interlocking at Jena-Göschwitz and built by Siemens since 27 November 2011. One day before, the dispatchers <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jm", {{was taken out}} of operation. The guard <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Js", was also closed. Until September 2006, there was another <b>signal</b> <b>box,</b> [...] "Jn". All were mechanical <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> of the Jüdel type.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>signal</b> <b>boxes</b> {{were opened}} in 1889, the 13-lever North <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Torquay Road level crossing, the 17-lever South <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> by Sands Road level crossing. Both were {{replaced}} in 1924 by two new boxes. The North box closed on 26 March 1988 when control of trains {{was transferred to}} the Panel <b>Signal</b> <b>Box</b> at Exeter but the South box was retained to monitor the two level crossings. In 1990 this function was transferred to a panel in the station buildings and the <b>signal</b> <b>box</b> closed.|$|R
