40|$|Diffusion Is slower in phenylsilicones In {{proportion}} to the exponent of the phenyl content and in all silicones is slower in {{proportion to}} the exponent of the density. Diffusion is anomalous in cold chromatographic grade silicones, especially with long-chain n-alkanes, yeilding skewed peaks and, in the methyl-sillcones, high diffusion coefficients. The anomaly is less apparent above 150 Â°C and with low mole-cular weight methylsilicones. Butler and Hawkes (1) reported that diffusion of /i-alkanes in the polydimethylsilicone SE- 30 (mol. wt. 4 x 10 s) is faster than in the lower molecular weight polydimethylsilicone SF- 96 - 200 (mol. wt. 1. 1 x 104). The investigation of diffusion coefficients of /i-alkanes and other organic compounds in polydimethysilicones has been continued with commercial polydimethylsilicones of intermediate molecular weights, along with three phenylmethylsilicones of varying phenyl content and molecular weights, two fluoropropylsilicones of different molecular weights and a <b>cyanosilicone.</b> The gas chromatographic system for measuring diffusion coefficients is exactly the same as in (1). During this investiga-tion it was realized that data obtained from the gas chromato-graph for very volatile samples are unreliable because of blow-back of volatile samples from the injection system into the carrier gas feed stream. The extra dispersion is unaccounted for in the determination of diffusion coefficients. Therefore, data obtained in this work and in the previous work for samples with partition coefficients less than thirty are disregarded. Data on the silicones, obtained from the suppliers, are listed in Table I and the silicone structures are illustrated in Figure 1. The diffusion coefficients are listed in Tables II-X and the rt-alkane diffusion coefficients are plotted against their parti-tion coefficients in Figures 2 - 9...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{study of}} {{diffusion}} coefficients of n-alkanes and {{other organic compounds}} in silicones is undertaken by gas-liquid chromatography. About 0. 3 % of stationary phase is coated on glass bead support so that the only significant source of peak spreading is due to slow liquid phase mass transfer. Diffusion coefficients are higher in higher molecular weight methylsilicones than in lower molecular weight. The anomaly is partially explained by the increase of free volume with increasing molecular weight. Partition coefficients of n-alkanes in the methylsilicones are independent of the molecular weights of the silicones. Chromatographic peaks for n-alkanes in methylsilicones become increasingly skewed as the molecular weight of the n-alkane increases. Diffusion coefficients in phenyl, fluoro and <b>cyanosilicones</b> are strongly dependent on the steric hindrance of the substituent groups of the silicones and the molecular {{size and shape of}} the penetrants. Three equations for the dependence of the diffusion coefficients of n-alkanes on the physical properties of the penetrant-polymer system are investigated by linear regression. It is found that the best fit through the 158 data points is obtained when the densities and the percent phenyl content of silicones are included in the regression equation. It suggests the diffusion process is dependent on the free volume and steric hindrance of the silicones studied, and is independent of intermolecular attraction between the polymer and the penetrant...|$|R
