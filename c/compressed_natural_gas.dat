5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel vehicle) is an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, <b>compressed</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E

The fatigue life prediction is performed using Brown-Miller algorithm with Morrow mean stress correction method. Results show that the stress is concentrated {{in the vicinity of the}} contact region between the guide plate and the polymer guide ball. The highest stress in the wobble plate and the polymer guide ball is 160. 4 MPa and 127. 8 MPa respectively. The corresponding predicted fatigue life of the wobble plate is 8 x 108 cycles. A higher stress gradient in the guide ball (max von Mises stress is 3. 3 GPa) is predicted when a harder steel ball is employed. This is due to high stiffness of the mating plate/ball surfaces...|$|R
