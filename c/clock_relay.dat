2500|$|On 17 August 1985, Reyat {{became a}} third suspect once the receipt for the tuner {{was found with}} his name. On 6 November 1985, the RCMP raided the homes of {{suspected}} Sikh separatists Parmar, Reyat, Gill and Johal. [...] In a 4 1/2-hour interview, Reyat denied all knowledge of the test blast or even Parmar. After he was told the CSIS had seen both of them, he changed his story that Parmar really {{wanted to build a}} device powerful enough so that he could take the device back to India to destroy a bridge. He explained that the gunpowder in the test was a failure as the device fizzled. The search of Reyat's house produced a carton with an unusual green tape also found in the Narita blast and a can of Liquid Fire-brand starting fluid matching fragments found at the blast site, along with blasting caps and dynamite, including a pound of dynamite in a bag taken out its original tube casing, though none was consistent with blast residue. Reyat insisted only the <b>clock,</b> <b>relays</b> and tuner had been purchased for other than [...] "benign purposes". There was insufficient evidence to hold Parmar as charges were dropped days later.|$|R

40|$|All cells {{possess a}} {{molecular}} circadian &# 147;clock&# 148; thought to coordinate {{various aspects of}} the physiology and behaviour of an animal with the light/dark cycle of the external world. Light is the principle cue entraining molecular clocks via the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain. Recent evidence however, has also implicated food-borne signals as external stimuli capable of resetting clocks in the periphery. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the impact of aberrant feeding on circadian energy metabolism in the rat by feeding a high fat diet and restricting feeding to the daylight hours (rats normally feed only at night). Rats on the daylight feeding schedule displayed various differences in metabolism. In the liver the circadian expression pattern of molecular clock genes was completely reversed in response to the new feeding schedule. In contrast, circadian gene expression in muscle remained similar to an animal feeding ad libitum. This asynchrony in circadian gene expression in two metabolically relevant tissues was accompanied by loss of diurnal variation and a reduction in energy expenditure, and increased muscle glycogen in the day-fed rats. The second aim of this thesis was to determine how the core molecular <b>clock</b> <b>relays</b> temporal regulation to downstream functional genes in tissues. In vivo electroporation and hydrodynamic tail vein injection were employed to overexpress the clock output factor DBP in muscle and liver respectively. Using microarray and gene enrichment analysis the data shows that DBP regulates genes of cholesterol efflux which remove excess lipid in muscle and in the liver DBP upregulates genes of bile acid synthesis for the conversion of cholesterol for its elimination. Somewhat surprisingly, the specific genes upregulated by DBP in the two tissues were different. This suggested that DBP has tissue-specific targets but with an overall conserved role to regulate the removal of excess lipids. The data in this thesis confirms the involvement of the circadian system in the regulation of important metabolic pathways and highlights the potential impact on metabolism if the tissue circadian rhythms become misaligned with the light/dark cycle...|$|R

Lester learns Marlo's cellphone is transmitting pictures of clocks and tries to break the code. When management provides more money for the fake serial-killer investigation, which McNulty redirects to the Stanfield investigation, more surveillance officers are added and Sydnor works out that the <b>clock</b> code is <b>relaying</b> location information for face-to-face meetings.

40|$|Context {{consistency}} checking, the checking of specified {{constraint on}} properties of contexts, {{is essential to}} context-aware applications. In order to delineate and adapt to dynamic changes in the pervasive computing environment, context-aware applications often need to specify and check behavioral consistency constraints over the contexts. This problem is challenging mainly due to the distributed and asynchronous nature of pervasive computing environments. Specifically, the critical issue in checking behavioral constraints is the temporal ordering of contextual activities. The contextual activities usually involve multiple context collecting devices, which are fully-decentralized and interact in an asynchronous manner. However, existing context consistency checking schemes do not work in asynchronous environments, since they implicitly assume {{the availability of a}} global <b>clock</b> or <b>relay</b> on synchronized interactions. To this end, we propose the Ordering Global Activity (OGA) algorithm, which detects the ordering of the global activities based on predicate detection in asynchronous environments. The essence of our approach is the message causality and its on-the-fly coding as logic vector clocks in asynchronous environments. We implement the Middleware Infrastructure for Predicate detection in Asynchronous environments (MIPA), over which the OGA algorithm is implemented and evaluated. The evaluation results show the impact of asynchrony on the checking of behavioral consistency constraints, which justifies the primary motivation of our work. They also show that OGA can achieve accurate checking of behavioral consistency constraints in dynamic pervasive computing environments. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
50|$|Weir {{started out}} his 2013 {{season with a}} victory of 20.11 seconds in the Adidas Grand Prix in New York City. In June, he {{registered}} a 10.02 100m run, a massive personal best from his previous record of 10.51 seconds in 2008. Later in the 2013 Jamaican National Championships, Weir cruised {{to the finish line}} in the 200m final in 19.79 seconds, tying Bolt's world leading mark at that point. Having won the first two of his diamond league 200m races (in the Golden Grand Prix and the Adidas Grand Prix), Weir finished second to Bolt at the Meeting Areva, where Bolt set a world lead and meeting record of 19.73. Despite the clear loss to Bolt in Paris, Weir looked to be the closest to a challenger for Bolt at the World Championships that year. At the London Anniversary Games Weir clocked an impressive 19.89 and followed this up with a meeting record in the <b>relay,</b> <b>clocking</b> 37.75.|$|R
50|$|At {{the club}} itself, a {{semi-automatic}} control {{system based on}} telephone relays was installed by the mid-1950s. It was called the ARRC (Automatic Railroad Running Computer). It could run a train over the entire set of track, in both directions, without manual intervention, throwing switches and powering tracks ahead of the train. A mainframe program was used to compute the path, and all modifications to the layout had to be compatible with this ability. It was sometimes used to clean the tracks with a track scraper car. Sometime around 1964, this {{was replaced by a}} second system built around the Number 5 Crossbar telephone switch; the lead designer for this project was Alan Kotok, by then a rising star on the design staff at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Equipment for this effort was donated by the telephone company via the Western Electric College Gift Plan. An extension to the basic control system allowed TMRC engineers to control switches on the layout. There was also a digital <b>clock</b> display with <b>relay</b> switching, and an internal telephone system with external tie-lines, all built from telephone stepping switches and relays.|$|R
40|$|In certain {{states like}} Karnataka and Gujarat of India, farmers are {{provided}} with free 3 -phase power supply to run their irrigation pump-sets under schemes like Niranthara Jyothi Yojana (NJY). Under this scheme, the rural feeders were bifurcated into agricultural feeders and non-agricultural feeders {{in order to facilitate}} 24 hours Supply for Non-agricultural Consumers and 8 - 10 Hrs Supply for Agricultural Consumers. Due to power shortage, the 3 -phase supply at the agricultural feeder is given only during the off-peak hours. Rest of the time, the supply is either 2 -phase or the feeder is under Load Shedding. 2 -phase supply at the station is given exclusively for lighting purpose at Farm houses. But, this 2 -phase supply is being illegally tapped and converted to 3 -phase by using condensers. Although, this is reflected in the sub-station load curve, it often takes time to detect such misuses. The conventional Overcurrent relay fails to respond to this misuse, unless the set points or pick up values are changed appropriately by human intervention, often the locals influence the substation personnel to keep the set points {{in such a way that}} the misuse is not reported. This, at times, may cause cascading disasters in the power system. The proposed relay would not only act as a protective element at the feeder, but also detect the misuse and trip the respective feeder by changing the set points appropriately without involving any human activity, eventually increasing the security of the system. Proposed relay has two working states namely active state and the event log state. The Event log keeps record of the events with real time and date by making use of Real time <b>clock</b> (RTC). This <b>relay</b> also consists of a GSM module which sends SMS to farmers and utility heads regarding the supply status...|$|R
