5|$|The TuđmanĆosić {{agreement}} on the pullout of JNA troops from Konavle provoked an emotional response in Yugoslavia, where it was interpreted as a defeat and betrayal.

The resolution placed the peninsula {{under the control of}} UNPROFOR. The UN Security <b>Council</b> <b>Resolution</b> 981 transferred control to the newly established United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia on 31 March 1995, and then to UNMOP through the UN Security <b>Council</b> <b>Resolution</b> 1038 of 15 January 1996. The UN mission there expired two months later. , the Prevlaka Peninsula remains demilitarized, with Croatian and Montenegrin police jointly patrolling the sea.

5|$|Negotiations {{over the}} Security <b>Council</b> <b>resolution</b> were {{initially}} contentious, as the U.S., the UK, and France submitted a draft resolution that included automatic invocation of Chapter VII, sanctioning {{use of military}} force if Syria did not fulfill its commitments under the agreement. Russia and China were opposed to any resolution that authorized enforcement under Chapter VII without a second vote of the Security Council. After further negotiations, on 26 September the five permanent members of the UN Security Council reached agreement on an implementation and enforcement draft resolution.

5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war.

In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
