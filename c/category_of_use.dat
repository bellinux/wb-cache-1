And the article does not specify armed force, and {{there is the question of}} if it can be read as any kind of force, even economic force such as through violative economic coercion. The idea is that any use of force not authorized within the Charter is wrongful. In practice though, it is necessary to have a degree of flexibility. There are situations, such as those of decolonization and humanitarian intervention, that a strict following of this rule might not aligned with community interests. And the law regarding use of force needs to adapt and evolve to new situations and circumstances, such as those of cyber-warfare. It would be difficult to classify every CNA as a use of force, considering for example that some might not even cause any direct physical damage. To make use of the established law that has dealt with armed forces, Schmitt proposed comparing the characteristics and consequences of CNAs. This goal of this case-by-case approach is to properly classify with CNAs fall into the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> of force and which do not.|$|E

These data can provide an informative basis to identify emerging problems, support development of preventive and regulatory measures and evaluate their impact. In Italy, surveillance of acute PPP-related poisonings (SAPReP), based on Poison Control Centre data, has been implemented since 2001 by the Italian National Institute of Health and the National Poison Control Centre in Milan. The present contribution is aimed at characterizing PPP-related poisonings identified in Italy. Methods: Information on cases notified to SAPReP during 2007 – 2012 were reviewed and classified according to standard rules: the reported exposures were grouped according to main <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and chemical class, as indicated by Regulation (EC) No 1185 / 2009 concerning statistics on pesticides.

Aims of our study were (a) to compare the ethnoveterinary practices of two culturally and sociodemographically different regions of Switzerland, (b) to compare results with earlier ethnoveterinary studies conducted in Switzerland and in adjacent Italian regions and, (c) to evaluate possible reasons for regional differences in European ethnoveterinary medicine. Methods 25 interviews were conducted in 2014 in all Italian speaking regions (ItR) of Switzerland, and 31 interviews were held in five north-western German speaking Cantons (GeC). Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect detailed information regarding plant species, mode of preparation, dosage, route of administration, <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> origin of knowledge, frequency of use, and satisfaction with outcomes of the treatments. Results A total of 162 homemade remedies in ItR and 219 in GeC were reported, out of which 125 and 145, respectively, were reported to contain only one plant species (homemade single species herbal remedy report, HSHR). 44 ItR and 43 GeC plant species were reported to treat livestock, of which only a half were used in both regions.

40|$|Abstract. Regardless {{of farming}} systems practiced, fertility, {{inherent}} agricultural land, {{is the core}} of these systems. The quality of soils, seen as a measure of their fertility, presents regional differences. The main objectives of this study are, on the one hand, spatial representation of soil quality and analysis of eroded soil quality and on the other hand, show the influence of culture on the development of quantitative of surface erosion. Cartographic materials used were obtained using ArcGIS software and based on topographic maps, vector map of soil and erosion vector map. Determining the average amount lost by erosion at the surface is based on the relation derived from the Universal Soil Erosion Equation, which sets the contribution of each factor. For each soil unit affected by erosion processes was calculated average annual soil loss in two types of crops (wheat and maize) at different values of the slope and slope length. For each soil unit, using ArcGIS software, the average slope was calculated, value being subsequently introduced into the relation computing. Soils in the territory Traian Vuia falls a large percentage in classes III and IV quality. The quality of eroded soils, at the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> "arable", corresponds also mostly the classes III and IV quality. Under the wheat crop, the average annual amount lost through erosion at the surface is significantly lower than under the maize.

For {{the purpose of the}} survey methodology was developed, which in short terms, is as follows: for each parking place by pre-defined parking area can be determined the nature, frequency and duration of use. During the survey, one or more counters for several times, consistent and walk a predetermined route on foot. The counter recognize site of parking place on a map and record the registration number of all vehicles parked. If necessary, you can distinguish the category of car parking (free, paid per hour, service subscription). Also, erroneous and/or illegally parked vehicles may be registered separately. Methodology was created and then applied in GIS and database for automated mapping of results and generate a series of reports from analysis.

However, little information is available on the association between water-pipe use and heart disease (HD). Therefore, we investigated the association of smoking water-pipe and chewing nass (a mixture of tobacco, lime and ash) with prevalent HD. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Baseline data (collected in 2004 - 2008) from a prospective population-based study in Golestan Province, Iran. Participants 50 045 residents of Golestan (40 - 75 years old; 42. 4 men). Main outcome measures ORs and 95 CIs from multivariate logistic regression models for the association of water-pipe and nass use with HD prevalence. Results A total of 3051 (6. 1) participants reported a history of HD, and 525 (1. 1) and 3726 (7. 5) reported ever water-pipe or nass use, respectively. Heavy water-pipe smoking was significantly associated with HD prevalence (highest level of cumulative use vs never use, OR= 3. 75; 95 CI 1. 52 to 9. 22; p for trend= 0. 04). This association persisted when using different cut-off points, when restricting HD to those taking nitrate compound medications, and among never cigarette smokers. There was no significant association between nass use and HD prevalence (highest <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> vs never use, OR= 0. 91; 95 CI 0. 69 to 1. 20). Conclusions Our study suggests a significant association between HD and heavy water-pipe smoking. Although the existing evidence suggesting similar biological consequences of water-pipe and cigarette smoking make this association plausible, results of our study were based on a modest number of water-pipe users and need to be replicated in further studies...|$|E

To date, very few studies have investigated farmers’ local knowledge on plants used in managing {{animal health and welfare}} in Angolan Mopane woodland. This is a very dry ecosystem where animal husbandry (mostly cattle and goats breeding) is highly widespread and is often the main form of subsidence, greatly contributing to local communities food security, especially in periods of resources shortage. An ethnobotanical research project was carried out in Bibala (Namibe province – Angola) in 2010 – 2012, in order to collect information on different traditional uses of plants, involving an interviewed sample of 66 informants. Fifty-eight of them (87. 9 %) listed a total of 39 species used as ethno-veterinary and/or fodder plants. Ten ethno-veterinary species (28 citations) were reported by 20 informants as used to treat diseases commonly affecting animals in the studied area, namely respiratory tract problems (Laphangium luteoalbum, Gyrocarpus americanus, Craibia brevicaudata subsp. baptistarum, Lepisanthes senegalensis, Ptaeroxylon obliquum, Ximenia americana) and skin diseases and wounds (Aloe littoralis, Blepharis sp., Ficus thonningii), or acting as a general tonic (Faidherbia albida). Thirty-four plants (235 citations) were cited by 58 informants as fodder. In this <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> the most cited species were Terminalia prunioides (30 citations), Faidherbia albida (28 citations) and Spirostachys africana (21 citations).
