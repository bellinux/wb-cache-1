5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, shortness of breath, and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nitrazepam}} on ventilatory capacity and arterial blood gas tensions was studied in a double-blind controlled crossover trial in six patients with <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>bronchitis</b> in ventilatory failure (raised Paco 2).

5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 1960s, Cameron and her {{daughter}} moved to the pueblos of Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she developed a friendship with the sculptor John Chamberlain and appeared in his art movie, Thumb Suck, which was never released. It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a collapsed lung and required hospitalization. Her wider health was poor, as she suffered from <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> and emphysema—which were both exacerbated by her chain smoking—while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.|$|E

25|$|Bronchitis is {{inflammation}} of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs. Symptoms include coughing up mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort.

40|$|The {{effect of}} low {{frequency}} breathing compared with spontaneous breathing was examined at rest and during exercise (40 watts) in 12 patients suffering from severe <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>bronchitis.</b> At rest low frequency breathing improved significantly the alveolar ventilation and the tensions of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood. There was no significant change in ventilation minute volume. During exercise low frequency breathing significantly decreased ventilation minute volume, and there was no significant improvement in gas exchange. The decrease in ventilation during low frequency breathing at 40 watts compared with spontaneous breathing at the same lung volume was due to expiratory flow limitation. The findings suggest that this technique may impair exercise tolerance in patients with severe <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>bronchitis...</b>|$|R
5|$|Asthma, <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|For the 1955–56 season, Plante was the unchallenged {{starting}} goaltender of the Canadiens; Gerry McNeil had {{not played}} the previous season {{and was sent}} to the Montreal Royals. Charlie Hodge, Plante's backup the previous season, was sent to a Canadiens' farm team in Seattle. Later that season, Montreal won the Stanley Cup—the first of what would be five consecutive Stanley Cup championship seasons. The next season, Plante missed most of November because of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis,</b> a consequence of the asthma that had affected him since childhood. During the 1957–58 NHL season, the Canadiens won their third straight Stanley Cup despite injuries to Plante {{and other members of the}} team. Plante's asthma was getting worse. He sustained a concussion with just a few weeks left in the season and missed three games of the playoffs. In the sixth game of the Stanley Cup finals, Plante's asthma was making him dizzy, and he was having difficulty concentrating; he collapsed at the end of the game after teammate Doug Harvey scored the series-winning goal. The Canadiens went on to win the Stanley Cup again at the close of the 1958–59 season.|$|E

25|$|<b>Chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> {{is defined}} as a {{productive}} cough that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years. Most people with <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Protracted bacterial bronchitis {{is defined as}} a chronic productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics. Symptoms of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> may include wheezing and shortness of breath, especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations. The cough is often worse soon after awakening and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be streaked with specks of blood.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> {{are caused by}} smoking {{cigarettes}} {{or other forms of}} tobacco. Additionally, chronic inhalation of air pollution or irritating fumes or dust from hazardous exposures in occupations such as coal mining, grain handling, textile manufacturing, livestock farming, and metal moulding may also be a risk factor for the development of <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis.</b> Protracted bacterial bronchitis is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Non-typable Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.|$|E

To determine whether xanthine oxidase activity increased in the airspaces of COPD patients, we examined bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) from COPD patients recruited during a 2 -year clinical study. Filtered BAL supernatant from COPD patients and healthy nonsmoking controls was examined by fluorometric analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU) and spectrophotometric assays (cytochrome c reduction kinetics and uric acid kinetics). Compared to controls, filtered BAL supernatant of subjects with COPD exhibited a detectable clastogenic activity probably related to superoxide production.

40|$|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Oisease (COPO) is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality throughout the world. Approximately 6 % of deaths in men and 4 % of deaths in women are due to COP 01. COPO currently ranks as number six in the global impact of disease scale and is expected to rise to number three by the year 20202. In the Netherlands it already is the third cause of death 3. The major cause of COPO is cigarette smoking. The percentage of smokers in the Netherlands is among the highest in Europe 4. COPO is defined physiologically as chronic airflow obstruction and may be due to a mixture of emphysema and peripheral airway obstruction from <b>chronic</b> obstructive <b>bronchitis.</b> Emphysema is a pathological diagnosis characterised by destruction of alveolar walls resulting in abnormal and permanent enlargement of airspaces and loss of lung elasticity, with consequent obstruction of peripheral airways 1. <b>Chronic</b> obstructive <b>bronchitis</b> is due to obstruction of peripheral airways {{as a result of an}} inflammatory response 1.
