40|$|ABSTRACT. With {{the rise}} of value–added grains and oilseeds, many {{elevators}} need to segregate their incoming products into batches of different end–use quality (for example, high oil corn, genetically modified soybeans, high protein wheat), but often they are not designed to handle this task efficiently.

This study utilized a system simulation model to investigate how queue management could help to improve {{the performance of a}} <b>country</b> <b>elevator</b> receiving multiple grain streams with a single unloading pit. In order to maintain the speed of the unloading operation, two queuing methods were investigated: the segregated BATCH versus the traditional FIFO (first–in, first–out) queue service method.

The simulation results showed that the BATCH queue management strategy reduced average waiting times per customer by up to 27 % compared to the traditional FIFO queue management strategy when the daily grain receipt was near the maximum receiving capacity of the facility.

These elevators stored approximately 31 million bushels of wheat, which is approximately 1. 2 % of the annual national production. Stored wheat was followed as it moved from farm to the <b>country</b> <b>elevator</b> and finally to the terminal elevator. During this study, thousands of grain samples were taken in concrete elevator silos. Wheat stored at elevators was frequently infested by several insect species, which sometimes reached high numbers and damaged the grain.

Fumigation decisions tended to be based on past experience with controlling stored-grain insects, or were calendar based. Integrated pest management (IPM) requires sampling and risk benefit analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Wheat is {{the primary}} field crop in Oregon. Selection of time of sale {{is one of the}} most {{important}} marketing problems facing grain producers. The objectives of the study deal with economic considerations involved in a wheat producer's marketing process including factors motivating the time of sale, price analysis, availability and use of market information, the role of country grain handlers, and the use of marketing alternatives to improve net income. The study area consisted of wheat-fallow farms in the Columbia Basin in north central Oregon. Included are specialized wheat units in Umatilla, Gilliam, Morrow, Sherman, and Wasco Counties. Data were obtained through a mail survey of a selected sample of farms and through personal interviews with <b>country</b> <b>elevator</b> managers. The most frequently used alternatives for marketing wheat are selling the grain all at one time (34 percent), selling at more than one time (23 percent), and placing all or part of the wheat under government loan (43 percent). The time of marketing wheat varied from year to year for 70 percent of the growers. Eighty-five percent of the growers who varied the time of sale did so to sell at a better price. Barley sales were much more concentrated in the late summer and early fall months than were wheat sales. Wheat is held longer than barley before selling because of greater fluctuations of wheat prices during the marketing year. The months were ranked from high to low according to an adjusted seasonal price index. Grower estimates of the high and low months of wheat and barley prices ranged throughout the adjusted seasonal price index. Growers have a greater awareness of the months of low prices than the months of high prices for both wheat and barley. In basing their selling decision growers place more importance on unofficial market information than on official reports. Grain handlers, newsletters, magazines, and past experience were the most important unofficial information sources. The weekly grain market report issued at Portland was the most important official source of market information. Even though farmers have ready access to general market and price information, they expressed a need for more specific information on the demand and supply outlook in foreign countries and government grain marketing operations. <b>Country</b> <b>elevator</b> managers stressed the point they do not offer advice on when to market. They only present the market information they have available, and all marketing decisions rest with the grower. The price growers receive equals coastal price minus transportation, wheat commission, and elevator charges. Characteristics of a producer's marketing environment are price uncertainty, scarcity of relevant market information, and the oligopsonistic market structure a producer faces in the sale of his grain. The following marketing plan was profitable from 1955 - 56 through 1964 - 65. If the domestic cash price minus the effective support rate for wheat is greater than or equal to 0. 10 per bushel during August then August sale of the grain is recommended. If the difference is less than 0. 10 per bushel, the sale is made in November or December. The net income received from using this alternative for marketing wheat is 0. 035 per bushel more than a straight August sale and more than 0. 015 per bushel greater than a straight November or December sale. Barley sales in October and November during the same time period returned about 1. 25 per ton more than an August sale. All calculations include storage charges and the opportunity cost of not having sold the grain in August, freeing the producer's capital for other uses...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture is {{undergoing}} extreme change. The {{introduction of new}} generation agricultural products has generated an increased need for efficient and accurate product segregation across a number of Canadian agricultural sectors. In particular, monitoring, controlling and preventing commingling of various wheat grades is critical to continued agri-food safety and quality assurance in the Canadian grain handling system. The Canadian grain handling industry is a vast regional supply chain with many participants. Grading of grain for blending had historically been accomplished by the method of Kernel Visual Distinguishability (KVD). KVD allowed a trained grain grader to distinguish the class of a registered variety of wheat solely by visual inspection. While KVD enabled rapid, dependable, and low-cost segregation of wheat into functionally different classes or quality types, it also put constraints {{on the development of}} novel traits in wheat. To facilitate the introduction of new classes of wheat to enable additional export sales in new markets, the federal government announced that KVD was to be eliminated from all primary classes of wheat as of August 1, 2008. As an alternative, the Canadian Grain Commission has implemented a system called Variety Eligibility Declaration (VED) to replace KVD. As a system based on self-declaration, the VED system may create moral hazard for misrepresentation. This system is problematic in that incentives exist for farmers to misrepresent their grain. Similarly, primary elevators have an incentive to commingle wheat classes in a profitable manner. Clearly, the VED system will only work as desired for the grain industry when supported by a credible monitoring system. That is, to ensure the security of the wheat supply chain, sampling and testing at some specific critical points along the supply chain is needed. While the current technology allows the identification of visually indistinguishable grain varieties with enough precision for most modern segregation requirements, this technology is relatively slow and expensive. With the potential costs of monitoring VED through the current wheat supply chain, there is a fundamental tradeoff confronting grain handlers, and effective handling strategies will be needed to maintain historical wheat uniformity and consistency while keeping monitoring costs down. There are important operational issues to efficiently testing grain within the supply chain, including the choice of the optimal location to test and how intensively to test. The testing protocols for grain deliveries as well as maintaining effective responsiveness to information feedback among farmers will certainly become a strategic emphasis for wheat handlers in the future. In light of this, my research attempts to identify the risks, incentives and costs associated with a functional declaration system. This research tests a series of incentives designed to generate truthful behavior within the new policy environment. In this manner, I examine potential and easy to implement testing strategies designed to maintain integrity and efficiency in this agricultural supply chain. This study is developed in the first instance by using an analytic model to explore the economic incentives for motivating farmer’s risk control efforts and handlers’ optimal handling strategies with respect to testing cost, penalty level, contamination risks and risk control efforts. We solve for optimal behavior in the supply chain assuming cost minimization among the participants, under several simplifying assumptions. In reality, the Canadian grain supply chain is composed of heterogeneous, boundedly rational and dynamically interacting individuals, and none of these characteristics fit the standard optimization framework used to solve these problems. Given this complex agent behavior, the grain supply chain is characterized by a set of non-linear relationships between individual participants, coupled with out of equilibrium dynamics, meaning that analytic solutions will not always identify or validate the set of optimized strategies that would evolve in the real world. To account for this inherent complexity, I develop an agent-based (farmers and elevators) model to simulate behaviour in a more realistic but virtual grain supply chain. After characterizing the basic analytics of the problem, the grain supply chain participants are represented as autonomous economic agents with a certain level of programmed behavioral heterogeneity. The agents interact via a set of heuristics governing their actions and decisions. The operation of a major portion of the Canadian grain handling system is simulated in this manner, moving from the individual farm up through to the <b>country</b> <b>elevator</b> level. My simulation results suggest testing strategies to alleviate misrepresentation (moral hazard) in this supply chain are more efficient for society when they are flexible and can be easily adjusted to react to situational change within the supply chain. While the idea of using software agents for modeling and understanding the dynamics of the supply chain under consideration is somewhat novel, I consider this exercise a first step to a broader modeling representation of modern agricultural supply chains. The agent-based simulation methodology developed in my dissertation can be extended to other economic systems or chains in order to examine risk management and control costs. These include food safety and quality assurance network systems as well as natural-resource management systems. Furthermore, to my knowledge there are no existing studies that develop and compare both analytic and agent-based simulation approaches for this type of complex economic situation. In the dissertation, I conduct explicit comparisons between the analytic and agent-based simulation solutions where applicable. While the two approaches generated somewhat different solutions, in many respects they led to similar overall conclusions regarding this particular agricultural policy issue...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that <b>country</b> <b>elevators</b> that are the fIrSt in their area to grade wheat and pay quality-adjusted prices would receive above-nonnal profits at the expense of their competitors. These early-adopting elevators would pass on to producers 70 % of the quality-based price differentials received from next-in-Iine buyers. If competing elevators also adopt these practices, profits for all elevators would return to near nonnal, and elevators would pass on to producers nearly all price differentials received from next-in-Iine buyers. However, that research could not explain why more elevators were not becoming "early adopters " by paying quality-adjusted prices. An additional explanation for <b>country</b> <b>elevators</b> failing to pass on to producers quality-adjusted prices is risk aversion. If producers are risk averse, an elevator that imposes discounts for lower quality wheat, even while paying a higher price for high quality wheat, risks losing business if producers believe that a competing elevator {{may be more likely to}} pay them a higher price net of discounts. Producers likely are uncertain about the quality of their grain before they deliver it to an elevator, and thus are uncertain about the net price they will receive. Risk-averse producers would prefer a certain price to a quality-adjusted price that is equally likely to be higher (because of a premium) or lower (because of a discount). A simulation model is used to measure the effects ofrisk-averse producers and limited quality information on profits that can be earned by an elevator that pays quality-adjusted prices. Results suggest that while risk aversion is important, the amount of information producers have about the quality of their wheat is even more important...|$|R

50|$|The {{marketing}} of wheat was modernized as well, {{as the cost}} of transportation steadily fell and more and more distant markets opened up. Before 1850, the crop was sacked, shipped by wagon or canal boat, and stored in warehouses. With the rapid growth of the nation's railroad network in the 1850s-1870s, farmers took their harvest by wagon for sale to the nearest <b>country</b> <b>elevators.</b> The wheat moved to terminal elevators, where it was sold through grain exchanges to flour millers and exporters. Since the elevators and railroads generally had a local monopoly, farmers soon had targets besides the weather for their complaints. They sometimes accused the elevator men of undergrading, shortweighting, and excessive dockage. Scandinavian immigrants in the Midwest took control over marketing through the organization of cooperatives.|$|R
