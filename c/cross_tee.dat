50|$|Sweeping {{is allowed}} {{anywhere}} on the ice up to the tee line, {{as long as it}} is only for one's own team stones. Once the leading edge of a team stone <b>crosses</b> the <b>tee</b> line only one player may sweep it. Additionally, when a stone <b>crosses</b> the <b>tee</b> line, one player from the other team is allowed to sweep it. This is the only case that a stone may be swept by an opposing team member. In international rules, this player must be the skip; or if the skip is throwing, then the sweeping player must be the third.|$|R

Through a successful electromagnetic approach, lumped element models for interacting and noninteracting step discontinuities have been created and tested. An alternative model is also proposed to account for shunt connected double and single stubs in <b>cross</b> and <b>tee</b> junction with the main line, respectively. The different models have been tested on the same structure to demonstrate their congruenc...|$|R

Features in holes 5 and 6 {{on the golf}} course, and is <b>crossed</b> by the <b>tee</b> shot on hole 6.

50|$|Mustamäe is {{connected}} to the rest of Tallinn via three main streets:Mustamäe tee and Sõpruse puiestee lead to the centre of Tallinn, and Ehitajate <b>tee</b> <b>crosses</b> Mustamäe while connecting Nõmme and Õismäe. Other major streets include: A. H. Tammsaare tee, Kadaka tee, Ed. Vilde tee, and Akadeemia tee. Most of the public transportation operates on these streets. Mustamäe is serviced by buses and trolleybuses. Out the 8 trolleybus linesof Tallinn, 6 operate (partly) in Mustamäe.|$|R
40|$|Network {{simulation}} models for water distribution systems typically assume the mixing at pipe intersections is complete and instantaneous. More accurate characterizations of {{chemical or biological}} agent transport {{may be required to}} efficiently identify, control and mitigate the spread of harmful agents and to protect critical components within the network. Recent experimental data have shown that mixing is incomplete at pipe junctions (pipe <b>crosses</b> and <b>tees).</b> Numerical simulations of these experiments have been performed using simplified turbulence methods. In the present study, simulations of mixing in pipe junctions are performed using the high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach to fully resolve the mixing behavior. Simulation results show unsteady mixing behavior at the fluid interface due to shear layer instabilities. These high-fidelity results will be used to develop a lower fidelity model for mixing at pipe junctions...|$|R
40|$|Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) {{is used to}} {{visualize}} ultrasound heart images for diagnosis or surgery monitoring. The existing TEE is operator dependent and does not provide sufficient safety features to localize the TEE probe tip inside the human body. In order to improve safety in the usage of TEE, a novel technique for TEE probe tip localization has been developed. This technique is based on feature comparison between online TEE images retrieved from the TEE machine and an additional image database. The here presented technique includes image enhancement, segmentation, feature extraction and finally <b>cross</b> correlation. <b>TEE</b> images in a database were used as the reference for cross correlation. Test {{results show that the}} technique is able to localize the probe tip position from depth of 20 cm to 50 cm, with an accuracy of 93. 2 %. This result is an approach towards the improvement of TEE safety without using additional sensors...|$|R
40|$|The turbulent-flow {{throttles}} {{are used}} in pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones to restrict or measure gas mass flow. It is customary to install the throttles in joints of pipelines (in teejoints and <b>cross</b> <b>tees)</b> or in joints of pipelines with pneumatic automation devices Presently, in designing the pneumatic systems and gas-supply ones a gas mass flow through a throttle is calculated by a known equation derived from the Saint-Venant-Vantсel formula for the adiabatic flow of ideal gas through a nozzle from an unrestrictedly high capacity tank. Neglect of gas velocity at the throttle inlet {{is one of the}} assumptions taken {{in the development of the}} above equation. As may be seen in practice, in actual systems the diameters of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted can be commensurable. Neglect of the inlet velocity therewith can result in an error when determining the required throttle diameter in design calculation and a flow rate in checking calculation, as well as when measuring a flow rate in the course of the test. The theoretical study has revealed that the flow velocity at the throttle inlet is responsible for two parameter values: the outlet flow velocity and the critical pressure ratio, which in turn determine the gas mass flow value. To calculate the gas mass flow, the dependencies are given in the paper, which allow taking into account the flow rate at the throttle inlet. The analysis of obtained dependencies has revealed that the degree of influence of inlet flow rate upon the mass flow is defined by two parameters: pressure ratio at the throttle and open area ratio of the throttle and the pipe wherein it is mounted. An analytical investigation has been pursued to evaluate the extent to which the gas mass flow through the throttle is affected by the inlet flow rate. The findings of the investigation and the indications for using the present dependencies are given in this paper. By and large the investigation allowed the conclusion that the inlet flow rate must be taken into account when calculating the gas mass flow through the throttles of pneumatic systems and gas supply systems...|$|R
40|$|Energy losses {{occurring}} in pipe junctions {{have been studied}} for many years. Head loss coefficients (KK) are commonly used to characterize losses across elbows, <b>tees,</b> <b>crosses,</b> valves, and other pipe fittings. When accurate values of KK are used, the flow rate and corresponding total head at any location in a pipe network can be calculated. While KK is well defined for most pipe junctions and fittings, the literature has limited documentations of KK for crosses. This study was commissioned to determine KK {{for a wide range}} of flow combinations in a pipe cross with equal diameter pipes and varied flow combinations. This study provides and innovatively presents over 1, 000 experimental values of KK for designing and analyzing equal diameter pipe crosses...|$|R
40|$|Solving {{for energy}} losses in pipe {{junctions}} {{has been a}} focus of study for many years. Although pipe junctions and fittings are at times considered 2 ̆ 2 minor losses 2 ̆ 2 {{in relation to other}} energy losses in a pipe network, there are cases where disregarding such losses in flow calculations will lead to errors. To facilitate these calculations, energy loss coefficients (K-factors) are commonly used to obtain energy losses for elbows, <b>tees,</b> <b>crosses,</b> valves, and other pipe fittings. When accurate K-factors are used, the flow rate and corresponding energy at any location in a pipe network can be calculated. K-factors are well defined for most pipe junctions and fittings; however, the literature documents no complete listings of K-factors for crosses. This study was commissioned to determine the K-factors {{for a wide range of}} flow combinations in a single pipe cross and the results provide information previously unavailable to compute energy losses associated with crosses. To obtain the loss coefficients, experimental data were collected in which the flow distribution in each of the four cross legs was varied to quantify the influence of velocity and flow distribution on head loss. For each data point the appropriate K-factors were calculated, resulting in over one thousand experimental K-factors that can be used in the design and analysis of piping systems containing crosses...|$|R
