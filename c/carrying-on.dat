60|$|Their {{houses were}} earthen-walled and straw-thatched. Under the floors ran flues {{through which the}} kitchen smoke escaped, warming the sleeping- room in its passage. Here we lay and rested for days, {{soothing}} ourselves with their mild and tasteless tobacco, which we smoked in tiny bowls {{at the end of}} yard-long pipes. Also, there was a warm, sourish, milky-looking drink, heady only when taken in enormous doses. After guzzling I swear gallons of it, I got singing drunk, which is the way of sea-cunies the world over. Encouraged by my success, the others persisted, and soon we were all a-roaring, little reeking of the fresh snow gale piping up outside, and little worrying that we were cast away in an uncharted, God-forgotten land. Old Johannes Maartens laughed and trumpeted and slapped his thighs with the best of us. Hendrik Hamel, a cold-blooded, chilly-poised dark brunette of a Dutchman with beady black eyes, was as rarely devilish as the rest of us, and shelled out silver like any drunken sailor for the purchase of more of the milky brew. Our <b>carrying-on</b> was a scandal; but the women fetched the drink while all the village that could crowd in jammed the room to witness our antics.|$|E
60|$|Lemuel sat {{looking after}} them, his {{satisfaction}} in the affair alloyed by dislike of the haste with which it had been transacted. His rustic mind worked slowly; it was not wholly content even with a result in its own favour, where the process had been so rapid; he was scarcely able to fix {{the point at which}} the talk ceased to be a warning against beats and became his opportunity for speculation. He did not feel quite right at having taken the fellow's half-dollar; and yet a bargain was a bargain. Nevertheless, if the fellow wanted to rue it, Lemuel would give him fifteen minutes to come back and get his money; and he sat for that space of time where the others had left him. He was not going to be mean; and he might have waited a little longer if it had not been for the behaviour of two girls who came up and sat down on the same bench with him. They could not have been above fifteen or sixteen years old, and Lemuel thought they were very pretty, but they talked so, and laughed so loud, and scuffled with each other for the paper of chocolate which one of them took out of her pocket, that Lemuel, after first being abashed by the fact that they were city girls, became disgusted with them. He was a stickler for propriety of behaviour among girls; his mother had taught him to despise anything like <b>carrying-on</b> among them, and at twenty he was as severely virginal in his morality as if he had been twelve.|$|E

[Footnote 1: Mr. Coleridge visited Cambridge {{upon the}} {{occasion}} of the scientific meeting there in June, 1833.--"My emotions," [...] he said, [...] "at revisiting the university were at first, overwhelming. I could not speak for an hour; yet my feelings were upon the whole very pleasurable, and I have not passed, of late years at least, three days of such great enjoyment and healthful excitement of mind and body. The bed on which I slept--and slept soundly too--was, as near as I can describe it, a couple of sacks full of potatoes tied together. I understand the young men think it hardens them. Truly I lay down at night a man, and arose in the morning a bruise." [...] He told me [...] "that the men were much amused at his saying that the fine old Quaker philosopher Dalton's face was like All Souls' College." [...] The two persons of whom he spoke with the greatest interest were Mr. Faraday and Mr. Thirlwall; saying of the former, [...] "that he seemed to have the true temperament of genius, that <b>carrying-on</b> of the spring and freshness of youthful, nay, boyish feelings, into the matured strength of manhood!" [...] For, as Mr. Coleridge had long before expressed the same thought,--"To find no contradiction in the union of old and new; to contemplate the Ancient of Days and all his works with feelings as fresh as if all had then sprung forth at the first creative fiat, this characterizes the mind that feels the riddle of the world, and may help to unravel it. To carry on the feelings of childhood into the powers of manhood; to combine the child's sense of wonder and novelty with the appearances which everyday for perhaps forty years had rendered familiar; ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{expansion}} {{which no one}} else ventured, or, perhaps, wished to set bounds to, she came under the criticism of her younger brother, who, upon the rare occasions when he deigned to mingle in the family affairs, drew their mother's notice to his sister's excesses in <b>carrying-on,</b> and required some action that should keep her from bringing the name, of Kenton to disgrace. From being himself a boy of very slovenly and lawless life he had suddenly, {{at the age of}} fourteen, caught himself up from the street, reformed his dress and conduct, and confined himself in his large room {{at the top of the}} house, where, on the pursuits to which he gave his spare time, the friends who frequented his society, and the literature which nourished his darkling spirit, might fitly have been written Mystery. The sister whom he reprobated was only two years his elder, but since that difference in a girl accounts for a great deal, it apparently authorized her to take him more lightly than he was able to take himself. She said that he was in love, and she achieved an importance with him through his speechless rage and scorn which none of the rest of his family enjoyed. With his father and mother he had a bearing of repressed superiority which a strenuous conscience kept from unmasking itself in open contempt when they failed to make his sister promise to behave herself. Sometimes he had lapses from his dignified gloom with his mother, when, for no reason that could be given, he fell from his habitual majesty to the tender dependence of a little boy, just as his voice broke from its nascent base to its earlier treble at moments when he least expected or wished such a thing to happen. His stately but vague ideal of himself was supported by a stature beyond his years, but this rendered it the more difficult for him to bear the humiliation of his sudden collapses, and made him at other times the easier prey of Lottie's ridicule. He got on best, or at least most evenly, with his eldest sister. She took him seriously, perhaps because she took all life so; and she was able to interpret him to his father when his intolerable dignity forbade a common understanding between them. When he got so far beyond his depth that he did not know what he meant himself, as sometimes happened, she gently found him a safe footing nearer shore.|$|E

Recognizing his abilities, he invited Bishop Mateus to be his private secretary. Oliveira Xavier accepted the position and left for Portuguese India on 11 January 1884, arriving on 5 March in Goa. On 7 November D. Mateus Xavier was named missionary for the Patriarchy of India. He landed in Cochim on 18 February 1894 and visited the suffragan diocese, then governed by D.

5000|$|In {{a letter}} written in 1899 by Mrs C. I. W. Morgan, wife of Mr Charles Morgan (the last male of his line), she states that, on looking through some old papers, she found a legal {{permission}} to Mr John Morgan of Furnace House, Carmarthen, to start a bank in that town, but the letter contains no other details of this document, or its date. [...] The proceedings of the Great Sessions held at Glamorganshire on 22 March 1796, indicate that a man named John Watkins, employed as a guard on the Cardiff mail coach to Swansea, was charged and convicted of grand larceny. Messrs. Morgan, bankers at Carmarthen, gave evidence that they sent to London for a remittance in cash which was packed in a box and sent down in the mail coach. It was proved that the box {{was put on the}} coach at Cardiff but was missing at Swansea. John Watkins denied the theft, but on a constable saying that ‘he must have been the man for that basket in which the money was packed was found in his house’, he gave himself away by replying ’No, that cannot be true , for there was no basket about the money.’ This evidences the fact that the Bank was <b>carrying-on</b> business, and was established before, 1796.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA set of {{questionnaire}} {{is designed}} to investigate the panic related psychology and behaviors of evacuation crowds in subway emergencies. Field survey at a subway station in Nanjing, China is conducted. Based on 141 valid questionnaire samples, the correlations between some personnel characteristics and the evacuation panic are investigated. It is found that the gender, the education level and <b>carrying-on</b> luggage have strong correlation with the panic related psychology and behaviors, while the age and the safety knowledge do not have so strong correlativity as previous work indicated. Besides, different opinions of this work and previous work {{about the influence of}} education level on the evacuation panic are also compared...|$|E
40|$|In the {{introductory}} part, the authors remind {{of the character}} of the aggressive war, imposed to Republic of Croatia in l 99 l by the rebelled Serbs in Croatia and the Yugoslav Army. Since, among the war victims, the major part is constituted of civilians, primary health care, local as well as statal, soon acquires a new regime of organization, adjusted to war conditions. In the second pan of the paper, new problems of the health care service in Lika are described. This service already was insufficient before the war, and the status worsened (especially the hospital care) also due to the flight of a major number of specialists to the other side. Still, the functioning of the hospitals in Gospi 6 and Otoiac continued thanks to the engagement of the personell of the fujeka Clinical Center (KBC RijekaJ, while the <b>carrying-on</b> of the increased specific needs of primary health care was helped by volonteers of the Rijeka Health Center (Dom zdravlja Rijeka). In {{the last part of the}} paper, the authors, volonteers themselves and active participants of the described events, present the engagement of the personell of the fujeka Health Center (primarily of the physicians and nurses, but also of psychologists, psychiatrists, stomatologists and technical personell) in the Lika region in the period from October 1991 until 1993. kada je uslijedio preustroj cjelokupnog vojnog saniteta pa posao nastavljaju mobilizirani zdravstveni radnici- In described period, numerous cquipes volontarily were offering complete primary health care to the civil population and refugees.

40|$|To {{say that}} Professor Marc Galanter 2 ̆ 7 s {{scholarship}} is diverse {{would be a}} woeful understatement. In his over forty years of writing, Galanter 2 ̆ 7 s work has covered topics including (but not limited to) torts, contracts, constitutional law, comparative law, empirical legal studies, the legal profession, legal anthropology, and South Asian studies. With Galanter 2 ̆ 7 s scholarship so heavily cited and respected, {{we see it as}} only fitting, particularly upon his recently turning seventy-five, to acknowledge his achievements in a symposium that reflects back on the years of his work. Serving as special editors to an issue forthcoming in the Duke Law School journal, Law and Contemporary Problems, we offer here a short essay that briefly summarizes the various works of the contributors participating in this dedication. Our authors provide a set of papers that cover a range of disciplines: law, sociology, political science, anthropology, history, and philosophy. The works embody Galanter 2 ̆ 7 s long-held belief that not only should law be studied in an interdisciplinary manner but that it can be instrumentally used by both elites and grassroots activists to effectuate social change. The symposium-contributors also share another connection. Each views her or himself to be a student of Galanter 2 ̆ 7 s. Some of these students have been directly mentored by Galanter while at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and have since gone on to academic posts at other institutions. Others are more distance-students who have been influenced either while studying elsewhere or while working as academics at different universities. The common link though is that this cohort is part of the next generation of Galanter-influenced scholars who will be <b>carrying-on</b> the lessons of Galanter 2 ̆ 7 s vast scholarship for decades to come...|$|E
