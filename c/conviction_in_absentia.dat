50|$|One of {{the most}} lurid {{allegations}} against Bokassa was the charge of cannibalism. In the Central African Republic, statutes forbidding cannibalism classified any crime of eating human remains as a misdemeanour. Upon seizing power from David Dacko in 1981, the current President André Kolingba had declared amnesty for all misdemeanours committed during the tenure of his predecessors. Bokassa could not be charged or convicted with the crime, {{even if there was}} evidence of guilt. The cannibalism charges against him were brought from old indictments in 1980 that resulted in his <b>conviction</b> <b>in</b> <b>absentia,</b> a year before Kolingba's amnesty, so the anthropophagy charge remained listed among Bokassa's crimes.|$|E

40|$|In the Judgment of 4 December 2009, No. 317, F. V.

The Court of Cassation doubted the constitutionality of art. 175 (2) C. p. p. {{on the assumption that}} it violated art. 24 (right to be heard in court), art. 111 (1) (right to a fair trial), and art. 117 (1) (which establishes the principle that internal legislation must conform to international obligations of the Italian State) of the Italian Constitution, as well as art. 6 (right to a fair trial) of the ECHR. The Constitutional Court declared the question of constitutionality partially well-founded. The decision is of particular interest because of the views elaborated by the Constitutional Court on the legal status enjoyed by the ECHR in the Italian legal order. In particular, the Court addressed two important issues. The first concerns the mutual impact of the ECHR and the Italian Constitution in respect of their interpretation (in particular whether and under which conditions the Italian Constitution must be interpreted in accordance with the ECHR). The second issue relates to the binding effect of the ECtHR case law within the Italian legal order (in particular, whether the ECtHR has exclusive competence in interpreting the ECHR) ...|$|E

Tommaso Buscetta was given a thirteen-year sentence for kidnapping the men but his <b>conviction</b> was <b>in</b> <b>absentia</b> because he was not present at the trial.

50|$|During the Thirty Years' War, the Valtellina was {{a theater}} of intense {{military}} and diplomatic struggle among France, the Habsburg powers {{and the local}} authorities. Control over the routes through the Valtellina to the passes between Lombardy and the Danube watershed was at stake. The anti-Habsburg forces in the Three Leagues put together a court that between 1618 and 1620 handed down a number of <b>convictions</b> (often <b>in</b> <b>absentia)</b> against Catholics <b>in</b> the Leagues and Valtellina. The harsh judgments of the anti-Habsburg Thusis court led to a conspiracy to drive the Protestants out of the valley. The leader of the conspiracy, Giacomo Robustelli of the Planta family, had ties to Madrid, Rome and Paris. On the evening of 18/19 July 1620, a force of Valtellina rebels supported by Austrian and Italian troops marched into Tirano and began killing Protestants. When they finished in Tirano, they marched to Teglio, Sondrio and further down the valley killing every Protestant that they found. Between 500 and 600 people were killed on that night and in the following four days. The attack drove nearly all the Protestants out of the valley, prevented further Protestant incursions and took the Valtellina out of the Three Leagues. The killings in Valtellina {{were part of the}} conflicts in Graubünden known as the Bündner Wirren or Confusion of the Leagues.|$|R
