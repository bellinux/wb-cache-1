The Port of San Diego was ranked by the United States' Bureau of Transportation Statistics as one of America's top 30 U.S. container ship ports in 2007. The Port also serves as the primary port of entry for larger car corporations including Honda, Volkswagen, and Nissan into the United States of America. The nearby Port of Ensenada also serves as a transport point where cruise ships arrive and depart from Southern Californian, European, and Central American ports. Cargo arriving at the Port of Ensenada is also transported to the metropolitan region via the Tijuana-Ensenada Freeway.|$|E
25|$|The Wayne County Airport Authority saw the {{potential}} for growth in the air transportation sector almost a decade ago and began a capital improvement plan for the airport. The three original terminals from the 1950s were replaced by two new state-of-the-art terminals that opened in 2002 and 2008, respectively. Other major infrastructure improvements {{have been made to}} the runways, <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities,</b> and the terminals themselves with an eye toward increasing the airport’s capacity. At the time, the FAA forecasted a 15.2% growth in passenger travel from 2005 to 2010, and another 12.8% increase from 2010 to 2015. It was projected that the construction projects themselves would create 4,470 jobs, with an additional 21,500 jobs statewide due to increased passenger traffic.|$|E

The TRAX Green Line connects the airport {{with the rest of}} UTA's rail system, including the FrontRunner (a commuter rail train that connects Salt Lake City with Ogden on the north and Provo on the south). In addition to the rail network itself, the TRAX line also connects with Park and Ride lots of both TRAX and FrontRunner, which allow transit patrons to avoid having to pay for parking at the airport.|$|E
25|$|In July 2003, former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin {{announced}} a new terminal to be named for Maynard H. Jackson, Jr.. The new international terminal would be built {{on the east side}} of the airport near International Concourse E, on a site that had been occupied by air <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities</b> and the midfield control tower. It has added twelve new gates able to hold wide-body jets, which can be converted to sixteen narrow-body gates, as well as check-in desks and a baggage claim area solely for international carriers. Additionally, the international terminal has its own parking lot just for international passengers with over 1,100 spaces. Arriving international passengers whose final destination is Atlanta can keep their luggage as they proceed to exit the airport. The new terminal is connected to Concourse E by the tram and also has ground transportation access via I-75.|$|E
25|$|Laredo {{is served}} by the Laredo International Airport. Daily flights are {{available}} to Houston (George Bush Intercontinental Airport) and to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Tri-weekly flights to Las Vegas, Nevada are available. After Laredo Air Force Base closed in the mid-1970s, the federal government handed over the old air force base and property to the City of Laredo for a new municipal airport. From the mid-1970s until the mid-1990s, the airport utilized a small terminal for passenger airline service and several old hangars for air cargo and private aircraft. A new state-of-the art passenger terminal was built along the then newly constructed Loop 20 to accommodate larger jets and to increase passenger air travel through Laredo. Expansion of air <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities,</b> taxiways and aprons, air cargo carriers such as DHL, FedEx, UPS, BAX, and others have responded by adding commercial air cargo jet services. Laredo also has two medical helipads, at Laredo Medical Center and Doctor's Hospital.|$|E

500|$|The Port of Albany {{is roughly}} [...] east of Buffalo, [...] south of Montreal, [...] west of Boston, and [...] {{north of the}} city of New York which makes it a {{location}} for regional distribution in the Northeastern United States and parts of Canada. As part of the Inland Distribution Network, the Port of Albany has a twice-weekly barge service to and from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey terminals. Shipments into the port can leave through many modes of transportation, including by truck and rail. Albany International Airport is 15minutes away with <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities.</b> Canals allow for further water transportation on barges further into the interior of North America. The port also handles commodities that are not carried on ships. Grain, molasses, animal feed, wood pulp, and steel often go from inbound trains to outbound trucks.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, the Parliament of Norway {{announced}} a {{competition for the}} redesign of the station since it had been decided that the Dovre Line would be built to Trondheim, including the line from Støren to Trondheim being converted to standard gauge. On 18 August 1913 {{construction of a new}} station and port was started. Traffic had increased to the limits of capacity; there were too few tracks and too small cargo buildings. By 1912 some freight cars were stopping at Hommelvik and Storlien; a counting showed 900 cars at the station. The construction removed a gap filled by the canal between the two stations—filling up the canal in the process. Instead the [...] Skansen Bridge was built {{on the west side of}} the station, along with a double track to Marienborg where the new depot would be located. The main station building designed by Lange remained the passenger and administration building, with the conversion of the smaller, western one into <b>cargo</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

The Air Cargo Complex provided a 21-acre facility for Federal Express, UPS and Airborne Express. Buildings were {{designed to meet the}} carriers' needs. 90 percent of the total air cargo operations at the Airport are operated by UPS and Federal Express. Cost of the project was estimated at $9.3 million. The new air <b>cargo</b> <b>facility</b> is {{on the north side of}} the airport.|$|R

50|$|There is a {{proposal}} of starting <b>cargo</b> <b>facility</b> from this airport. International <b>cargo</b> <b>facility</b> {{is vital for}} Pune as many airlines want to start cargo flights to/from Pune. This project will enable foreign cargo operators to operate to Pune. Pune was declared as customs airport on 17 January 1997, primary for exporting perishable agricultural products, i.e. flowers, fruits, vegetable and processed food. This project will also help to attract of foreign airlines to operate to Pune. For instance Silk Air {{a subsidiary of the}} Singapore Airlines wants to operate non-stop from Singapore to Pune. This 600 square metre terminal will be located adjacent to the new arrival terminal.|$|R

50|$|The terminal's design {{allows for}} {{transforming}} the operation {{system to a}} fully automatic system equipped with multi-level racks and a container stacking system.

50|$|In 1951 the United States Air Force built several {{facilities}} on {{the field}} and a 7500 ft runway. The Federal aviation administration (FAA) added an Instrument Landing System to runways 5L and 23R in 1959. In 1961, with financing by the Tennessee Air National Guard, the runway reached its current length of 9000 ft. In 1968 McGhee Tyson built a new air <b>cargo</b> <b>facility.</b> Almost a decade after the new air <b>cargo</b> <b>facility</b> was built one of the first major construction projects was completed with a new passenger terminal in 1974. Four years later the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority (MKAA) was established, and in 1985 the airport authority had the two parallel runways redesignated as 5L/23R and 5R/23L.|$|R
