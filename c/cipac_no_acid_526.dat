40|$|Dengue {{virus is}} the most {{prevalent}} mosquito transmitted infectious disease in humans and is responsible for febrile disease such as dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. Dengue non-structural protein 3 (NS 3) is an essential, multifunctional, viral enzyme with two distinct domains; a protease domain required for processing of the viral polyprotein, and a helicase domain required for replication of the viral genome. In this study ten unique human antibody fragments (Fab) that specifically bind dengue NS 3 were isolated from a diverse library of Fab clones using phage display technology. The binding site {{of one of these}} antibodies, Fab 3 F 8, has been precisely mapped to the third α-helix within subdomain III of the helicase domain (amino <b>acids</b> <b>526</b> – 531). The antibody inhibits the helicase activity of NS 3 in biochemical assays and reduces DENV replication in human embryonic kidney cells. The antibody is a valuable tool for studying dengue replication mechanisms...|$|R

30|$|The {{components}} of the essential oils from seeds of Azadirachta indica, Azadirachta siamensis, and Azadi-rachta excelsa were studied by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The main {{components of}} A. indica oil were hexadecanoic acid (34.0 %), oleic acid (15.7 %), 5, 6 -dihydro- 2, 4, 6 -triethyl-(4 H)- 1, 3, 5 -dithiazine (11.7 %), methyl oleate (3.8 %), and eudesm- 7 (11)-en- 4 -ol (2.7 %). The major components of A. siamensis oil were hexadecanoic acid (52.2 %), tricosane (10.5 %), tetradecanoic acid (6.8 %), oleic acid (4.9 %), and pentacosane (4.9 %). Azadirachta excelsa oil contained oleic acid (31.3 %), hexadecanoic acid (14.2 %), octadecanoic acid (13.0 %), 4 -octylphenol (9.7 %), and O-methyloximedecanal (6.8 %) as the main constituents. The essential oils from A. indica, A. siamensis, and A. excelsa were found to contain fatty <b>acids</b> (<b>52.6</b> %– 72.3 %) as major components. The minor {{components of the}} oils were n-alkanes, aromatics, esters, sulfur and nitrogen compounds, and terpenoids. Differences in oil composition were observed between the three species.|$|R

According to my theory, {{an element}} or a {{substance}} not decomposable {{under the circumstances}} of the experiment, (as for instance, a dilute acid or alkali,) should not be transferred, or pass from pole to pole, unless it be in chemical relation to some other element or substance tending to pass in the opposite direction, for the effect is considered as essentially due to the mutual relation of such particles. But the theories attributing the determination of the elements to the attractions and repulsions of the poles require no such condition, i.e. there is no reason apparent why the attraction of the positive pole, and the repulsion of the negative pole, upon a particle of free acid, placed in water between them, should not (with equal currents of electricity) be as strong as if that particle were previously combined with alkali; but, on the contrary, as they have not a powerful chemical affinity to overcome, {{there is every reason to}} suppose they would be stronger, and would sooner bring the acid to rest at the positive pole[A]. Yet such is not the case, as has been shown by the experiments on free and combined <b>acid</b> (<b>526.</b> 528.).|$|R

40|$|We {{characterized}} a consanguineous Turkish family {{suffering from}} von Willebrand disease (VWD) with significant mucocutaneous and joint bleeding. The relative reduction of large plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers and the absent VWF triplet structure {{was consistent with}} type 2 A (phenotype IIC) VWD. Surprisingly, platelet VWF was completely deficient of multimers beyond the VWF protomer, suggesting defective α-granular storage of larger multimers. Patients were nearly unresponsive to desmopressin acetate, consistent {{with a lack of}} regulated VWF release from endothelial cell Weibel-Palade bodies, suggesting defective storage also in endothelial cells. We identified an N 528 S homozygous mutation in the VWF propeptide D 2 domain, predicting the introduction of an additional N-glycosylation site at amino <b>acid</b> <b>526</b> in close vicinity to a “CGLC” disulphide isomerase consensus sequence. Expression studies in mammalian cells demonstrated that N 528 S-VWF was neither normally multimerized nor trafficked to storage granules. However, propeptide containing the N 528 S mutation trafficked normally to storage granules. Our data indicate that the patients' phenotype is the result of defective multimerization, storage, and secretion. In addition, we have identified a potentially novel pathogenic mechanism of VWD, namely a transportation and storage defect of mature VWF due to defective interaction with its transporter, the mutant propeptide...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the 58 -kDa inner ear protein against which the sera of some patients with idiopathic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease strongly react. BACKGROUND: We and other groups have previously demonstrated that a 58 -kDa protein extracted from guinea pig or bovine inner ear tissue is a target of antibodies in serum samples from some patients with autoimmune inner ear diseases. METHODS: After separation of inner ear proteins by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the bands corresponding to 58 kDa were localized and excised from the gel. The concentrated protein was then digested with trypsin, and the peptide fragments were separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Three fractions were subjected to amino acid sequencing by the classic Edman degradation. RESULTS: The sequence of a stretch of 14 amino acids of the first fragment was identical to that of amino <b>acids</b> <b>526</b> to 539 of the COCH 5 B 2 protein. The sequences of 11 and 10 amino acids of the second and third fragments, respectively, also were identical to residues 417 to 427 and 396 to 405 of the COCH 5 B 2 protein. These data, together with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot experiments, confirmed that the 58 -kDa inner ear protein is the COCH 5 B 2 protein. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the 58 -kDa target protein of antibodies in serum samples of patients with autoimmune inner ear diseases is the COCH 5 B 2 protein, a molecule that is highly and specifically expressed in the cochlea and vestibule...|$|R

50|$|After failed {{attempts}} to infect piglets in 1984, Marshall, {{after having a}} baseline endoscopy done, drank a Petri dish containing cultured H. pylori, expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer. He was surprised when, only three days later, he developed vague nausea and halitosis (due to the achlorhydria, there was <b>no</b> <b>acid</b> to kill bacteria in the stomach, and their waste products manifested as bad breath), noticed only by his mother. On days 5-8, he developed achlorydric (<b>no</b> <b>acid)</b> vomiting.

Interestingly, Marshall did not develop antibodies to H. pylori, suggesting that innate immunity can sometimes eradicate acute H. pylori infection.

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of cheddar cheese is greatly dependent on bacterial growth for acid production. The quality of cheese {{depends upon the}} type and extent of microbial activity. An important function of the lactic fermenting bacteria is the production of acid resulting from cellular metabolism. If little or <b>no</b> <b>acid</b> is production of acid resulting from cellular metabolism. If little or <b>no</b> <b>acid</b> is produced the resulting cheese will have an inferior body, flavor, and texture and may even cause the cheese {{to be used as}} grinders. The major causes for inhibited lactic bacterial growth are poor starter handling procedures, antibiotic in mild coming from cows treated for mastitis, quaternary ammonium compounds used in plant sanitation, and bacteriophage. The occurrence of bacteriophage contamination and the increased use of quaternary ammonium compounds and antibiotics have caused a serious problem in cheese manufacturing. Purpose of project. The purpose of this project is to determine if cheddar cheese, comparable to normal cheese, can be made from slow or non-acid milk with the use of added lactic acid.
