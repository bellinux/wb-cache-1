Although not scientifically verified, this allegation has resulted in a cultivation ban in several countries. In this article we report an integrated series of observations and experimental findings from invasiveness research in Zambia. We studied the impacts of J. curcas plantations on adjacent land use systems focusing on spontaneous occurrence of seedlings, seed dispersal mechanisms, seed predation by animals, and germination success of dispersed seeds. No spontaneous regeneration was observed in land use systems adjacent to J. <b>curcas</b> plantations. Primary <b>seed</b> dispersal was limited, predominantly under the canopy of the mother plant. Rodents and shrews dispersed and predated J. <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> and fruits. They transported the seeds up to 23 Â m from the sources and repositioned them in their burrows up to 0. 7 Â m deep, but none of these seeds could establish. Germination experiments in adjacent land use systems revealed 4 % germination success at the soil surface, and 65 % if buried artificially at 1 - 2 Â cm depth, yet the latter is unlikely to occur under natural conditions. These findings show that J. <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> may be dispersed by animals to adjacent land use systems, but no natural recruitment was observed given low germination on the surface and none in burrows.

40|$|Findings from a {{preliminary}} lab-scale study show strong potentials of phytodisinfectants as a low-cost, appropriate and ecological alternative technology in purifying water in rural Cameroon. A survey of plants used in water purification in Bamenda, Cameroon, {{indicated that there}} are many plants used in water treatment. A rapid screening on the coagulative and disinfection potential of four most frequently used plants was carried out on; Moringa oleifera, Jatropha curcas, calyx of Hibiscus sabdarifa, sclerotium of Pleurotus tuberregium against their crude methanol extracts, aluminum sulphate and sodium hypochlorite controls on turbid surface water samples. A beaker experiment with varying weights (0. 5 to 5 g) of dried pulverized plant materials and alum (control) were placed in 200 ml each of the three-turbid water samples and left for thirty minutes retention time. A 95 % reduction in bacterial loads of the water samples by M. oleifera in fifteen minutes residence time was observed. J. <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds,</b> as well as H. sabdarifa calyx also reduced the bacterial loads between 75 to 90 %. All the plant extracts except P. tuberregium inhibited an Escherichia coli isolate from the turbid water with highest zone of inhibition (15 mm) recorded for M. oleifera seed extract. The inhibition zones produced by three of the plant extracts were comparable to aluminum sulphate (6 mm) and sodium hypochlorite (17 mm). Crude methanol extracts from M. oleifera <b>seeds,</b> J. <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> and H. sabdariffa calyx used directly on turbid water drastically reduced the total aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts far more than the unextracted plant powders. The turbidity of both phytodisinfectant and alum treated water samples drastically reduced while no turbidity reduction was observed with sodium hypochlorite treated water samples. The pH of alum treated water was observed to decrease from neutral to 5. 0 while pH of phytocoagulant treated water was 7. 0. This report suggest that M. oleifera <b>seeds,</b> J. <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> and calyx of Hibiscus sabdariffa posses both phytodisinfectant and phytocoagulant property in water purification. Scerotium of P. tuberregium poses only phytocoagulant (mycocoagulant) activity. Plant materials can be used as phytocoagulants and phytodisinfectants in treating turbid water and can be applied in wastewater treatment. Further studies on the application of Phytodisinfectants in domestic water purification, especially the phytodisinfection potentials of M. oleifera are exigent. K. A. Yongabi, D. M. Lewis and P. L.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{deals with}} the characterisation of Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> and the oil obtained hereof. The analyzed seeds have been harvested from hedges and plantations in the regions of Teriya Bugu and Bla in Mali in the years 2009 and 2010. The oil is obtained through solvent extraction. Parameters analyzed are those which are relevant for processing of the oil into fatty acid methyl ester (FAME, biodiesel), and include acid value, fatty acid profile and contents of S, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg. All oil samples are suitable for processing into biodiesel, {{but some of them}} require pre-treatment because of high contents of free fatty acids and phosphorous. The margin of deviation of acid value and element contents throughout the oil samples depends on the way of cultivation, harvest and storage of the Jatropha <b>curcas</b> plants and <b>seeds.</b> Despite high acid values, all oil samples show high oxidation stability.

In this study, it was developed a microbiological anaerobic process to produce hydrogen by a strain of bacterium Enterobacter aerogenes using as a substrate, Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> cake. In this context, the effects of the application of a thermal pretreatment and the increase of residue initial concentration on the process yields were studied. Therefore, batch assays were performed using Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> cake (2, 5 gVSsubstrate/Lfermentation medium) submitted to thermal treatment in an autoclave during 15 and 30 minutes and the results obtained were compared with the same when the substrate was added without pretreatment. The best results were obtained in absence of pretreatment (68, 2 mLH 2 /gVSsubstrate; 169 mLH 2 /Lfermentation medium), while the 30 minutes exposure time at 121 °C led to lower yields (60, 0 mLH 2 /gVSsubstrate; 149 mLH 2 /Lfermentation medium), indicating inhibitory effects caused by the application of pretreatment. In the best established conditions, it was verified that the increase of the Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> cake initial concentration from 2, 5 to 10 gVSsubstrate/Lfermentation medium led to a increase of bioH 2 production volume of about 32 %, although it was followed by a specific yield decrease from 68, 2 to 23, 5 mLH 2 /gVSsubstrate.

40|$|In a {{study to}} detoxify Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> four {{potential}} detoxification methods were tested for their effectiveness. The first method entailed oil expulsion from unshelled Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> using a Sunhdra industrial oil expeller. The second method involved laboratory-based petroleum-ether solvent extraction of shelled and minced kernels. Thirdly, shelled kernels were subjected to industrial detoxification that involved double solvent extraction with the hexane-ethanol system accompanied by moist-heat treatment at 90 °C for 30 min. The fourth method was {{an extension of the}} third whereby the meal generated was wet extruded (126 °C, 2 atmospheres, 10 min contact time) followed by re-extraction with hexane and moist heat treatment (121 °C for 30 min). The detoxification methods had significant (P< 0. 0001) effect on both the anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) and the proximate composition of the meals. Oil expulsion left the phorbol esters (PEs) of the unshelled seed at 0. 70 mg g 1, laboratory petroleum-ether extraction reduced the PEs content by 67. 69 % from 6. 5 mg g 1 in the raw shelled kernels to 2. 10 mg g 1, double solvent extraction followed by moist-heat treatment reduced PEs by 70. 77 % to 1. 90 mg g 1. Double solvent extraction accompanied with wet extrusion, re-extraction with hexane and moist-heat treatment reduced PEs content to 0. 80 mg g 1, an 87. 69 % decrease. All the methods except laboratory petroleum-ether solvent extraction managed to completely inactivate trypsin inhibitors in the meals. Total phenolics (TPs) content was lowest (P< 0. 0001) in the oil-expulsion produced meal (8. 50 g Kg 1) while the laboratory petroleum-ether produced meal contained 64. 57 g Kg 1 TPs. Oil-expulsion and double solvent extraction accompanied with wet extrusion, re-extraction and moist-heat treatment completely inactivated lectins in the meals. The high chemical nutrient potential of Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> (crude protein, calcium and phosphorus) is only realised with shelling and extraction of most of the oil. None of the tried methods managed to completely detoxify the Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed.</b> The two most ‘effective methods’ reduced the PEs to 0. 70 and 0. 80 mg g 1, respectively compared to the non-toxic variety with 0. 11 mg g 1 PEs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Thevetia peruviana and Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> oils were {{investigated}} as feed stocks for grease production. Seven different blends of Thevetia peruviana and Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> oil {{were used for}} this research. The seeds were obtained locally and oven dried until a constant weight was obtained, Thevetia peruviana seeds had 3. 91 % moisture content while Jatropha curcas seeds had 2. 93 % moisture content. The oils were thereafter extracted. Thevetia peruviana seeds {{were found to have}} 58. 5 % oil content while Jatropha curcas seeds had 54. 6 % oil content. The Chemo-physical tests of the oils indicated that the density of the oils were the same (908. 7 kg/m 3), and the flash point of Thevetia peruviana seed oil was 168 o C while that of Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seed</b> oil was 122 o C; the viscosity at 100 o C for both oils fell within the range of 7. 2 - 7. 9 cSt for 400 pale oil 400 p, which is of petroleum origin. The viscosity index values for both oils were very high, hence very stable. Jatropha curcas oil had a viscosity index of 214 and Thevetia peruviana oil had 202. The grease was produced by cooking a calculated quantity of base oil and lithium stearate in a pot at 200 o C with continuous stirring for 30 minutes, the reaction was allowed to cool to 85 o C before sodium thiosulphate and calcium sulphonate additives were added to the reactor; further milling was maintained to yield a homogeneous product (lithium stearate grease) which were taken for analysis. Five classes of grease were produced from each oil blend; all the grease samples produced...|$|E

Natural coagulants have attracted more attention due to their eco-friendliness. Natural coagulants are considered safe for human health, because they are biodegradable, natural, nontoxic, and renewable (Zhao et al. 2012; Rajab et al. 2013).These natural coagulants of plant origin include, {{but are not limited}} to, Moringa oleifera, Maize, Nirmali (Strychnos potatorum) seed, Plantago psyllium, Plantago ovata, Hibiscus esculentus seed pods, Chestnut, Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> (Sen and Bulusu 1962; Tripathi et al. 1976; Raghuwanshi et al. 2002; Oluwalana et al. 2004; Mei Fong et al. 2014; Sciban et al. 2009).

Biological processes to produce hydrogen are very attractive due to less energy expenditures and the possibility to use organic wastes as substrate. In this work, Jatropha <b>curcas</b> L. <b>seed</b> cake (JSC), a solid residue remaining after oil extraction from J. <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> for biodiesel production, was used as substrate in a dark fermentation process by a pure strain of the bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes. Batch assays were performed using the substrate (2. 5 gVolatile Solid/LFermentation Medium) submitted to thermal pretreatment in an autoclave for two different exposure times (15 and 30 min) {{and the results were}} compared with the ones obtained when the JSC was used without pretreatment. The best specific biohydrogen production (68. 2 mL H 2 /gVSiJSC) was attained for the conditions of no substrate pretreatment, which is an advantage from the view point of energy saving. In the best conditions, the increase of the initial JSC concentration from 2. 5 to 10 gVS/LFM led to the increase of the cumulative hydrogen production and to higher bioH 2 production rates. However a decrease on the specific H 2 production from 68. 2 to 23. 5 mL H 2 /gVSiJSC was observed...|$|R
40|$|Actually, the {{germplasm}} of Jatropha spp. is conserved {{as whole}} plants in field collections. Under this storage method, the genetic resources {{are exposed to}} disease, pest and natural hazards such as human error, drought and weather damage. Besides, field genebanks are costly to maintain and with important requirements of trained personnel. Thus, the development of efficient techniques to ensure its safe conservation and regeneration is therefore of paramount importance. In this work we describe a method for Jatropha <b>curcas</b> <b>seeds</b> cryoexposure and seedling recovery after thawed. In a first experiment, an efficient protocol for in vitro plant recovery was carried out using zygotic embryo or seeds with or without coat. In a second experiment, desiccated seeds with or without coat were exposed to liquid nitrogen and evaluated after cryoexposure. Germination percentages were variable among treatments, and seeds demonstrated tolerance to liquid nitrogen exposure under certain conditions. <b>Seeds</b> of J. <b>curcas</b> presented up to 99. 6 % germination after seed coat removal. Seeds with coat cultured in vitro did not germinate, and were 60 % contaminated. The germination of the zygotic embryos was significantly higher in the ½ MS medium (93. 1 %) than in WPM medium (76. 2 %), but from zygotic embryo, abnormal seedlings reached up to 99 %. Seeds with coat exposed to liquid nitrogen showed 60 % germination in culture after coat removal with good plant growth, and seeds cryopreserved without coat presented 82 % germination, but seedlings showed a reduced vigor and {{a significant increase in}} abnormal plants. Seeds cultured in vitro with coat did not germinate, independently of cryoexposure or not.
