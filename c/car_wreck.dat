This coincided with sponsor Smithfield Foods stepping up to fund 29 races in each the next three seasons with brands Smithfield, Farmland, Eckrich, and Gwaltney. Almirola had a rather slow start to 2014, being involved in a 12 <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> in the 2014 Daytona 500. At Bristol, Almirola posted his best career finish to date of 3rd, only behind winner Carl Edwards and Ricky Stenhouse Jr.|$|E
25|$|Governor Jon Corzine {{was nearly}} {{killed in a}} <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> on the Garden State Parkway in Galloway Township in 2007, as he was {{traveling}} to a meeting between a Rutgers sports team and radio personality Don Imus. Imus had infamously called the Rutgers University women's basketball team nappy-headed hos, leading to his firing by two communications networks. Imus met with the team at Drumthwacket to apologize, and Governor Corzine attempted to arrive at that meeting from Atlantic City, reaching speeds of at least 91mph (146km/h), without wearing a seatbelt. His chauffeur, a New Jersey State Police officer, {{lost control of the}} vehicle, seriously injuring the Governor and leading to a new period of acting governorship by Richard Codey while Corzine recuperated.|$|E

25|$|At Kentucky, brief {{controversy}} hit Busch as on lap 48, he {{was responsible}} for causing a seven <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> that was instigated when he went down on the apron, then came back up the track and turned Brad Keselowski approaching turn 1, causing Keselowski to shoot up the track and collect several more cars including Greg Biffle, Travis Kvapil and Dave Blaney. Busch finished sixth, and followed this up with another sixth-place finish at the Coke Zero 400. This finish gave Furniture Row Racing their first ever streak of three straight top-ten finishes, and also moved Busch up to ninth in the points. However the next week at Loudon, Busch started second and led 102 laps before he was turned and wrecked by Matt Kenseth and finished 31st.|$|E
25|$|From {{one of his}} {{experiments}} emerged the Cyber Series – artificial humanoids possessing superhuman {{strength and}} agility. But something was amiss: The 5000 original Cybers, engineered {{to be the perfect}} servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they disobey orders from Reichter, he orders all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. After Cyber-29 died falling from a cliff, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther and names him Data-7. Cyber-6 was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping {{with the help of a}} black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When Reichter interrogates to kill the slave, Cybersix arrives at the city of Meridiana, where she battles Reichter and his minions, and disguises herself as fellow teacher Adrian Seidelman after the real one is killed in a <b>car</b> <b>wreck.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ambrose {{announced}} on 17 August 2010 that {{he signed a}} multi-year deal with Richard Petty Motorsports to drive the #9 Stanley/DeWalt Power Tools Ford Fusion. He finished 37th in his first race with the team at the Daytona 500, after being crashed out of contention in a 15 <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> in turn 3 on lap 29. He did finish the race. He went on to have an impressive race at Phoenix running in the top 10 {{for most of the}} day. In August, Ambrose won the rain delayed Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips at The Glen on 15 August to rack up his first career Sprint Cup Series win by passing Brad Keselowski and Kyle Busch with two laps to go. Ambrose further vindicated his road course abilities, backing up under a week later by taking an emotional victory at Montreal in the Nationwide Series, during the NAPA Auto Parts 200. The 2011 season continued to be his career best as he recorded 5 top 5 and 12 top 10 finishes. Ambrose finished the 2011 season 19th in the final point standings.|$|E

25|$|Fully {{aware of}} the dangers of his condition, Vysotsky made several {{attempts}} to cure himself of his addiction. He underwent an experimental (and ultimately discredited) blood purification procedure offered by a leading drug rehabilitation specialist in Moscow. He also went to an isolated retreat in France with his wife Marina in the spring of 1980 as a way of forcefully depriving himself of any access to drugs. After these attempts failed, Vysotsky returned to Moscow to find his life in an increasingly stressful state of disarray. He had been a defendant in two criminal trials, one for a <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> he had caused some months earlier, and one for an alleged conspiracy to sell unauthorized concert tickets (he eventually received a suspended sentence and a probation in the first case, and the charges in the second were dismissed, although several of his co-defendants were found guilty). He also unsuccessfully fought the film studio authorities for the rights to direct a movie called The Green Phaeton. Relations with his wife Marina were deteriorating, and he was torn between his loyalty to her and his love for his mistress Oksana Afanasyeva. He had also developed a severe inflammation in one of his legs, making his concert performances extremely challenging.|$|E

500|$|Wanderone {{was known}} for ostentation, self-aggrandizement, tall tales, fast-talk, and {{entertaining}} banter. He was even publicly recognized by famed boaster Muhammad Ali as better at boasting. His critical biographer, R.A. Dyer, documents that Wanderone completely fabricated a [...] "here-by-fate" [...] tale about a <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> which brought the player to Little Egypt; it was a tale that Wanderone encouraged to spread and further embellished in his autobiography, to lend an air of the mystical to his public persona. He made false claims about beating Willie Mosconi so frequently that Mosconi filed a slander lawsuit, to little avail.|$|E
500|$|Writer Mary D. Dutta {{believed}} that OLTL, {{in order to}} [...] "assuage the moral qualms associated with a sympathetic rapist", added [...] "mitigating reasons for Todd's sexual abuse of Marty"; namely, that he was raped {{at the age of}} fourteen by his adoptive father, Peter Manning, though {{whether or not he was}} raped is disputed. Dutta feels that the gang rape storyline invokes many of the rape myths that have appeared in literature since the 18th century, which includes [...] "only bad girls get raped," [...] "women ask for it," [...] and [...] "women 'cry rape' only when they've been jilted or have something to cover up". Dutta also includes the myth of the [...] "reformed rake", or [...] "the rapist redeemed by the woman who loves him, not uncommonly the same woman he raped", which [...] "deny or reduce perceived injury, or... blame the victims for their own victimization". Dutta states, [...] "Todd's redemption begins with his rescue of Marty and two children from a <b>car</b> <b>wreck</b> and ends with the discovery that he is the rightful heir to a huge fortune." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 <b>car</b> <b>wreck,</b> and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like what they like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E

Keller thought the Styles versus Waltman bout was a [...] "very good match, the best from Waltman in years". James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch, published a review of the show.

Regarding the X Division Championship bout, Caldwell thought that [...] "both men worked a solid match". [...] "A good wrestling match that showed Waltman still has it.", said Caldwell as he commented on the Styles versus Waltman encounter.

500|$|Director Greg Beeman found {{shooting}} the episode difficult {{because he had}} recently lost his father; he noted, [...] "I left from his funeral to go to Vancouver to direct the episode, so the emotions were very poignant for me." [...] Souders stated that the production staff wanted the climactic scene of Lana's death to be a [...] "big event". Originally, the show's producers wanted the car accident {{to be caused by}} a train. However, the show was not able to afford the special effects to pull the scene off, and so, the sequence was re-written to feature a bus crash. Souders noted that if the show had been unable to afford the bus wreck, it would have been re-written into a [...] "little car wreck". The Lana's entire sequence death was choreographed by Christopher Sayour—series stunt coordinator and Welling's stunt double. Sayour described the scene as [...] "important to me and important to a lot of people". The car crash sequence itself was actually a collage of several different shots. First, Kreuk was filmed driving a car on a process trailer with a mounted camera. A separate shot was filmed with a stunt double driving a lead car that was attached to a dummy car driving down a road at high speed. A bus was then driven in a perpendicular direction. The dummy car was attached with a detonator so that when the bus hit it, it would detach and not pull the lead car with it, and the timing for the crash was practiced several times during rehearsals. Finally, after the car was smashed by the bus, Kreuk was positioned on the ground to give the effect that she was actually in the <b>car</b> <b>wreck.</b>|$|E
