All subjects were asymptomatic and non-contact lens wearers. The tests used for tear stability were the tear break-up time (TBUT) test and a non-invasive tear break-up time (NITBUT) test; for tear quantity, the Schirmer test (ST) and a modified cotton thread test (CTT) were used. Measurements were taken before and after various periods of <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear.</b> Inconsistent changes in the pre-lens tear film (PLTF) stability were observed. There was no association between corneal staining and low PLTF stability. Soft <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> caused a significant initial transient decrease in the tear stability but no changes in tear quantity. The median NITBUT and TBUT before soft <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> were 9. 7 s and 4. 0 s respectively. After 28 weeks of daily soft <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear,</b> the median NITBUT was 5. 6 s and TBUT was 6. 2 s.

50|$|A slight variant has {{multiple}} contacts designed {{to engage in}} rapid succession. The first to make contact and last to break will experience the greatest <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> and will form a high-resistance connection that would cause excessive heating inside the contactor. However, in doing so, it will protect the primary contact from arcing, so a low contact resistance will be established a millisecond later.|$|E
50|$|Every {{time the}} {{contacts}} of an electromechanical relay or contactor are opened or closed, {{there is a}} certain amount of <b>contact</b> <b>wear.</b> An electric arc occurs between the contact points (electrodes) both during the transition from closed to open (break) or from open to closed (make).

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} effects of first and second {{generation}} silicone hydrogel (SiH) <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> on tear film osmolarity. METHODS: The healthy subjects who have never used contact lenses before {{were enrolled in the}} study. Tear film osmolarity values of 16 eyes (group 1) who wore first generation SiH contact lenses were compared with those of 18 eyes (group 2) who wore second generation SiH contact lenses after three months follow-up. RESULTS: Before <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear,</b> tear film osmolarity of groups 1 and 2 were 305. 02 ± 49. 08 milliosmole (mOsm) and 284. 66 ± 30. 18 mOsm, respectively. After three months of <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear,</b> osmolarity values were found 317. 74 ± 60. 23 mOsm in group 1 and 298. 40 ± 37. 77 mOsm in group 2. Although osmolarity values for both groups of SiH <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> after three months periods were slightly higher than before the <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear,</b> the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: <b>Contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> may cause evaporation from the tear film and can increase tear film osmolarity leading to symptoms of dry eye disease. In the current study, {{there is a tendency to}} increase tear film osmolarity for both groups of SiH <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear,</b> but the difference is not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> on straylight in rigid and soft contact lens wearers and (2) to relate findings to morphological changes and subjective complaints. Methods: Straylight was measured using the Oculus C-Quant during <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> and after <b>contact</b> lens removal in 30 rigid contact lens wearers and 30 soft contact lens wearers. Semi-quantitative (0 - 4) slit-lamp grading of anterior segment changes using Efron grading scales and contact lens characteristics were performed. Subjects answered a straylight questionnaire. Results: Soft contact lens wearers had a mean straylight of logarithmic value of the straylight parameter [log(s) ] = 0. 934 during <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> and after <b>contact</b> lens removal [comparable to log(s) = 0. 938 of age-matched normal eyes]. Rigid contact lens wearers had a mean straylight during <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> of log(s) = 1. 167. After contact lens removal, log(s) significantly decreased to 0. 997 (P < 0. 01). Straylight values with rigid contact lenses were strongly increased (P < 0. 001) compared with age-matched normal eyes; after contact lens removal, these values decreased but remained elevated. Straylight in rigid contact lens wearers correlated {{with the amount of}} deposits on the contact lens (P < 0. 01) but not with other variables of the contact lens score. The questionnaire showed more straylight complaints in rigid contact lens wearers than in soft contact lens wearers (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Rigid <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> leads to increased straylight during <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> and after <b>contact</b> lens removal. This may be because of subclinical effects of <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> on the cornea and is not seen in soft <b>contact</b> lens <b>wearer...</b>|$|R
50|$|Crucial to {{this system}} were the commutating reactors, {{inductors}} that ensured the contacts closed when the voltage across them was small, and opened {{when the current}} was small. Without these, <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> would have been intolerably heavy. These were series inductors that operated {{for most of the}} cycle with saturated cores. When the current decreased below that for saturation, their inductances reduced the current considerably. Contact switching was timed to occur while their cores were un-saturated.|$|E
5000|$|Contacts {{are rated}} {{for the current}} {{carrying}} capacity while closed and the voltage breaking capacity when opening (due to arcing) or while open. Opening voltage rating may be an A.C. voltage rating, D.C. voltage rating or both. [...] Some manufacturers offer guaranteed minimum operation counts based on accelerated testing. If contact life is specified, it is usually a number of operations at a specific electrical load.

50|$|Some {{designs of}} vacuum {{interrupter}} have simple butt contacts, but generally the contacts are shaped {{to improve their}} ability to break very heavy currents. Slots, ridges, or grooves are formed in the contacts. Arc current flowing through the shaped contacts generate magnetic forces on the arc column which cause the arc contact spot to move rapidly {{over the surface of}} the contact. This reduces <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> due to erosion by the arc, which melts the contact metal at the point of contact.|$|E

50|$|Corneal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} found to be significantly diminished following long-term <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear.</b> However, this difference in sensitivity is not correlated with a change in the number of nerve fiber bundles in the subbasal plexus of the cornea, suggesting that diminished corneal sensitivity following extended periods of <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> is not caused by a reduction in nerve fiber bundles but possibly a change in functionality. One or two years of hard <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear</b> has not been shown to affect corneal sensitivity, but real changes are observed following five years of hard <b>contact</b> lens <b>wear.</b> However, this significant decrease in corneal sensitivity appears to be reversible. Following cessation of hard contact lens usage, corneal sensitivity has been shown to be fully regained after several months: patients who had <b>worn</b> hard <b>contact</b> lenses for a decade or longer were able to regain normal corneal sensitivity after four months of not <b>wearing</b> <b>contact</b> lenses at all.|$|R

This allows continuous plastic deformation, plastic flow, and accumulation of energy and temperature.The prevention of adhesive material-transfer is accomplished by the following or similar approaches: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} design {{did not have}} an exposure control in the viewfinder. The camera had to be taken away from the eye view, to observe the needle on the light meter. (This in fact wasn't a real disadvantage, because to focus the user also had to take the camera to the same position. In normal lighting conditions, the exposure settings of a manual camera really only have to be changed after ten minutes or so, or when changing location. Nevertheless, an exposure control display in the viewfinder was considered very early at Rollei, but an analog display was discarded for limited space reasons, and light emitting diodes were not available at the time.) So not until summer of 1979 were the Rollei 35 TE and Rollei 35 SE released to the market. As the electronic exposure meter needed more power, a larger battery, of type PX-27 with 5.6 volts, was placed where the former instrument movement was mounted, The electronic circuit was built into the former battery compartment. Unlike the Rollei 35 LED theshutter position and aperture control settings were transferred, without any electrical <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> and tear, using a differential gear turning a variable density filter in front of the CdS light sensor. The release button activated the light meter, when slightly depressed. Three LEDs in the viewfinder indicate the correct exposure. This system worked perfectly, yet earlier models are more in demand today.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Rolling bearing {{operation}} {{is affected by}} friction, wear and lubrication mechanisms, fluid dynamics and lubricant rheology, material properties, and contact mechanics. Changes in rolling surfaces occur due to plastic deformation, rolling <b>contact</b> <b>wear,</b> and rolling contact fatigue. Wear particles can be formed and mixed into the lubricant. Increased levels of vibra-tions due to surface degradation can be monitored by sensors. Rolling <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> and rolling contact fatigue during rolling bearing operation can be diagnosed by combining measured and interpreted condition monitoring data with theory, and conclusions drawn thereof can support a continuous prognosis for the remaining bearing life.

40|$|The {{potential}} for significant performance increases, using ceramic materials in un-lubricated {{rolling element bearing}} applications, {{has been the subject}} of research over the past two decades. Practical advantages over steel include increased ability to withstand high loads, severe environments and high speeds. However, widespread acceptance has been limited by the inability to predict wear life for ceramic bearing applications. In this thesis, the rolling <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> of 52100 bearing steel and Over-aged Magnesia-Partially-Stabilised Zirconia (OA-Mg-PSZ) ceramic are examined using a newly developed rolling <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> test rig. The new wear test rig simulates the system geometry of an un-lubricated hybrid (ceramic and steel) ball bearing. The new wear test rig is versatile in that it allows low cost samples to be utilised resulting in a larger number of samples that can be tested. Wear samples of 52100 bearing steel and OA-Mg-PSZ produced by the new wear test rig were examined for mass loss and wear depth. The wear behavior of both the steel and ceramic material showed a dependence on operating variables time and load. Load was varied between 300 N to 790 N. Typical mass loss after 1 hour of testing 52100 bearing steel at 790 N was 0. 03 grams as compared to OA-Mg-PSZ which was 0. 001 grams. The rolling <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> of the OA-Mg-PSZ was an order of magnitude lower than that of the 52100 bearing steel. The wear mechanism for 52100 bearing steel was typical of plastic deformation and shearing near and below the surface of rolling contact. Once cracks extend to reach the surface, thin flat like sheets are produced. In OA-Mg-PSZ the wear mechanism initially is that of plastic deformation on the scale of the surface asperities with asperity polishing occurring followed by lateral cracks and fatigue spallation. Results obtained using the new rolling <b>contact</b> <b>wear</b> test rig led to the establishment of a new equation for wear modeling of 52100 bearing steel and OA-Mg-PSZ ceramic materials...|$|E
