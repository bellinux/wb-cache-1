Traditionally, the Mongols tended to see outside parties as either subjects or enemies, with little room in the middle for a concept such as an ally.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the game was mixed, with many reviewers opining that the game recycled elements from its PlayStation predecessors with minimal innovation. The PlayStation 2 edition sold nearly two million copies in North America, and the game qualified for various best-seller ranges, including the Platinum Range for PlayStation 2, Xbox Classics, and Player's <b>Choice</b> <b>on</b> GameCube. It was released as a launch title for the Xbox Originals line of downloadable original-Xbox games for the Xbox 360's Live Marketplace service in December 2007.|$|E

5|$|Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He {{objected to}} the king's <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> the grounds that Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's choice. When the newly elected {{archbishop}} {{was presented to the}} court before his consecration, Foliot remarked that the king had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, or it may have been that the king and the new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> women's rights and abortion.|$|E

30|$|For example, {{on level}} 4, the probability, by random chance, {{of solving the}} first three easy {{problems}} in one try is 1 / 3 (only one option with three choices). The probability of solving the last five problems is 1 / 60 (five <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the first card, four <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the second card, and three <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the third card). The calculation (3 × 1 / 3 + 5 × 1 / 60)/ 8 gives us the probability of solving a problem in level 4 in one try, by random chance. We can use a similar logic to calculate {{the average number of}} attempts.|$|R
5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. In the opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{spent the}} second half of the 1932–33 season as an amateur with Darlington in the Third Division North. He then {{returned}} to his home town where he turned professional with York City. He played six league matches for each club. In 1934, he joined another Third Division club, Hartlepools United, where he established himself as the regular selection at outside-left and scored at better than a goal every two games in his first season. Less prolific in his second year, he was sold to Chesterfield, newly promoted to the Second Division for 1936–37. Again, he was first <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> the left wing and productive in front of goal during his first season, less so in the next, in which he helped the team reach the fifth round of the 1937–38 FA Cup. In 1938–39, he fell out of favour, and requested a transfer. He joined Queens Park Rangers, but his career was cut short by the outbreak of war.|$|E
5|$|Hugh of Avalon died on 16 November 1200, but no new bishop {{was elected}} {{for over two}} years. King John first tried to impose his own appointee, {{but was unable to}} force his <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> the cathedral chapter, who were {{responsible}} for electing a new bishop. John then left the see vacant, and some contemporaries accused the king of doing so to secure the revenues of the see for himself because of the regalian right English kings had to receive all the income from a vacant bishopric. Eventually the cathedral chapter was allowed to perform an election, and Blois was elected about 6 July 1203 and consecrated on 24 August 1203 at Canterbury. The consecration was performed by William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, the Bishop of London, because Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury was ill and unable to perform the service which would normally have been his right.|$|E

5|$|Ladas {{was sent}} to Doncaster for the St Leger on 12 September {{in an attempt to}} win the Triple Crown. Ridden by Tommy Loates, Ladas started at odds of 10/11 (0.9/1) in a field of eight, with Matchbox (ridden by Watts) the second <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> 2/1 and the filly Throstle ignored on 50/1. As usual, Ladas was held up {{at the back of the}} field as, at first Throstle, then a horse named Legal Tender, then Matchbox made the running. Ladas moved {{steadily}} closer and turned into the straight in second, before overtaking Matchbox and going into a clear lead. In the final furlong, however, he was challenged by Throstle, and in the closing stages the latter pulled ahead to win by three quarters of a length. According to The Sportsman, the cheers of the crowd were replaced by those of the bookmakers as the outsider overhauled the favourite.|$|E
5|$|Mating is {{initiated}} when {{up to five}} males follow closely {{behind a}} female and bite at her fins and body, possibly cued by pheromones indicating the female's readiness. Each male attempts to seize the female by engulfing one of her pectoral fins; at times two males might grasp a female on both sides simultaneously. Once engaged, the sharks sink to the bottom, whereupon the male (or males) rotates one of his claspers forward, inflates the associated siphon sac (a subcutaneous abdominal organ that takes in seawater {{that is used to}} flush sperm into the female), and attempts to make contact with the female's vent. In many cases, the female resists by pressing her belly against the bottom and arching her tail; this may reflect mate <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> her part. The male has a limited time in which to achieve copulation, as while he is holding the female's pectoral fin in his mouth he is being deprived of oxygen. On the other hand, if the female is willing, the pair settles side-by-side with their heads pressed against the bottom and their bodies at an upward angle.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{gained the}} time and the {{opportunity}} to start hostilities with the Filipinos at the place and time of their <b>choice.</b> <b>On</b> the night of 4 February 1899, when most of the Filipino generals were at a ball in Malolos to celebrate the success of the American anti-imperialists delaying the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, the Americans staged an incident along the concrete blockhouses in Santa Mesa near the Balsahan Bridge. An American patrol fired on Filipino troops, claiming afterwards that the Filipinos had started shooting first. The whole Filipino line from Pasay to Caloocan returned fire and the first battle of the Filipino-American War ensued. Two days later, in response to the incident, the US Senate voted for annexation. In doing so, the conflict became the war of conquest, occupation and annexation that Luna, Mabini, and others had predicted and about which they had warned Aguinaldo and his generals previously.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{military}} {{continued to}} consider options to acquire heavy-lift helicopters throughout the 1960s, and a formal program {{to do so}} was launched in 1969 by the RAAF. Another team of RAAF officers travelled to the United States, and evaluated the Sikorsky CH-53 and the Chinook. The team leader, Group Captain Peter Raw, ultimately recommended that CH-53s be ordered. Senior RAAF officers and the Army were not pleased with this outcome, and the Air Board rejected Raw's report. Read, who was now an air vice-marshal and deputy chief of the air staff, was directed to review the choice of helicopters, and again recommended that Chinooks be acquired. He justified this <b>choice</b> <b>on</b> {{the grounds that the}} Chinook could carry more cargo than the CH-53 and was better suited for operations in the mountains of the Australian-administered Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Read's recommendation was accepted by the government, and an order for twelve CH-47C Chinooks was placed in August 1970. It was planned to rotate the helicopters in and out of service, six being available at any time. The order was suspended later in 1970 when a series of engine problems affected the United States Army's CH-47Cs, but was reinstated in March 1972 after these issues were resolved. The total cost of the purchase was $A37 million. The order made Australia the first export customer for the CH-47.|$|E
