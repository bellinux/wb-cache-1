5000|$|In 1862, Gault and the American {{population}} {{were faced}} with a shortage of coins. The government reacted first to this problem by passing a law on July 17, 1862 that allowed postage stamps {{to be used to}} pay off debts to the government {{as long as they were}} under $5. Stamps were accepted as having value across the US because they were evidence of having paid for postage. This remedial law was only a temporary solution due to the fragile nature of a thin, paper postage stamp. [...] Postage stamps were easily torn and damaged when constantly handled. Gault proposed a solution to this problem in August of that year when he patented his idea of the encased postage stamp. He advertised his invention in the local newspapers as “New Metallic Currency.” His ingenuity was simple and his invention was based on the familiar roundness of coins. As suggested by its name, the encased postage stamp consisted of a postage stamp encased, or sandwiched between two covers made out of brass. Gault constructed the original postage cases out of silver in order for them to more closely resemble real coins. However, Gault found that silver encased postage stamps were too expensive for him to manufacture and the case quickly lost its silver coloring because of <b>continuous</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how pregnancy is constructed as risky in media content from three Danish newspapers and online news sources {{as well as}} in narratives constructed by first-time pregnant women upon reading examples of media content. In doing so it employs a combination of methods for data production and analysis to facilitate a two-legged analytical design spanning media content as well as reception. The first part of the analysis identifies quantitative and qualitative patterns in media content on risks during pregnancy. Using media items from Danish news media Politiken, BT and Dr. dk as an empirical basis, it outlines four commonly used issue-specific media frames about risks during pregnancy. The second part {{examines how}} first-time pregnant women make sense of media content in constructing understandings of risk and responsible risk handling during pregnancy. This is carried out by analyzing interviews with seven first-time pregnant Danish women. Applying sociocultural theory on risk from the governmentality literature and Mary Douglas’ writings on danger and purity, a social constructivist version of framing theory and a collection of concepts useful to the specific empirical context of pregnancy and risk information, the analysis aims to understand the different media text readings constructed by the interviewees. It shows how the pregnant women negotiate the constructedness of media content and scrutinize the specific scientific research projects underlying the news articles. However, it also shows how they frequently construct understandings of risk and the individual responsibility of pregnant women regarding the <b>continuous</b> <b>handling</b> of risks that can be said to mirror the framing of the media messages but also in a much broader sense shared sociocultural discourses of individualization and a view of pregnancy as a vulnerable state. In this way, the analysis demonstrates that the pregnant women can neither simply be said to fully reproduce or challenge media messages, but often rather seem to be located in a position where practical usage of media content on risks is somewhat pessimistically experienced as hard to attain. As a final point, an ideal typology of three different ways of viewing and handling mediated risk messages among the first-time pregnant women is presented to recognize the differences in the perspectives offered by the interviewees...|$|E

We aim to further the insight into the characteristics of participatory policy development by comparing it to expert-based policy development for the same case. We describe the process of problem framing and analysis, as well as the knowledge base used. We apply an uncertainty perspective to reveal differences between the approaches and speculate about possible explanations. We view policy development as a <b>continuous</b> <b>handling</b> of substantive uncertainty and process uncertainty, and investigate how the methods of handling uncertainty of actors influence the policy development. Our findings suggest that the wider frame that was adopted in the participatory approach {{was the result of a}} more active handling of process uncertainty. The stakeholders handled institutional uncertainty by broadening the problem frame, and they handled strategic uncertainty by negotiating commitment and by including all important stakeholder criteria in the frame. In the expert-based approach, we observed a more passive handling of uncertainty, apparently to avoid complexity. The experts handled institutional uncertainty by reducing the scope and by anticipating windows of opportunity in other policy arenas. Strategic uncertainty was handled by assuming stakeholders' acceptance of noncontroversial measures that balanced benefits and sacrifices. Three other observations are of interest to the scientific debate on participatory policy processes. Firstly, the participatory policy was less adaptive than the expert-based policy. The observed low tolerance for process uncertainty of participants made them opt for a rigorous "once and for all" settling of the conflict. Secondly, in the participatory approach, actors preferred procedures of traceable knowledge acquisition over controversial topics to handle substantive uncertainty. This excluded the use of expert judgment only, whereas the experts relied on their judgment in the absence of a satisfactory model. Thirdly, our study provides empirical evidence for the frequent claim that stakeholder involvement increases the quality of the knowledge base for a policy development process. Because these findings were obtained in a case that featured good process management and a guiding general policy framework from higher authorities, they may not generalize beyond such conditions...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{concepts}} for breeding blanket of fusion reactors, self-cooled Li/V blanket, in which vanadium alloy acts as structural material and liquid lithium as both tritium breeder and coolant, {{is thought to}} be particularly attractive. Lithium has high tritium breeding capability, good heat transfer and negligible neutron damage. In addition vanadium alloys have low induced radioactivity, good compatibility with lithium, good resistance to neutron damage and high strength at high temperature. These advantages lead to a simple structural design, no use of neutron multiplier beryllium with enough tritium breeding rate, and <b>continuous</b> <b>handling</b> of chemistry for the breeder. 　　One of the critical issues for liquid Li/V-alloy blanket concept is large magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) pressure drop against pumping system while liquid lithium flows in blanket ducts in a strong magnetic field. A promising way to mitigate the pressure drop is to apply electrically insulating coating (oxide or nitride ceramics) onto inner wall of the structural ducts. 　　In-situ formation of oxide coating onto vanadium alloys in liquid lithium is quite attractive because the process will make it possible to deposit coatings onto complex surfaces after fabrication of the components, and it offers the possibility to heal cracks of coatings without disassembling the components. In this method, the vanadium alloy substrate pre-charged with oxygen is exposed in liquid lithium doped with metal, where the oxygen reacts with the metal to form an insulating oxide coating on the vanadium alloys. 　　Among candidate coating materials, Er 2 O 3 ceramics showed good compatibility with liquid Li, a high electrical resistivity, and a high stability in air with moisture, and thus is regarded as a promising candidate material for the insulating coating. 　　The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop an in-situ Er 2 O 3 insulating coating method to V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti (NIFS-HEAT- 2) that is one of the reference vanadium alloys. 　　For this purpose, the first step is to pre-charge oxygen with proper level and to distribute in the limited depth of V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti, without degrading mechanical property of the substrate. In the present study, the oxygen behavior in V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti during oxidation and subsequent annealing were investigated first at all. V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloy was oxidized in flowing Ar with impurity of oxygen, nitrogen and moisture for 0. 5 - 8 h and subsequently annealed in vacuum for 16 h at 700 ℃. By oxidation for supplying enough oxygen, the oxygen of 1000 - 9000 ppm was introduced into V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti with little nitrogen, where oxygen was concentrated in a region near the surface. The weight gain obeyed a parabolic law indicating that the oxidation process was controlled by thermo-diffusion rate of oxygen in V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti. During the annealing for keeping the oxygen in the substrate, oxygen was homogeneously diffused into depth of 150 μm. The diffusion depth of oxygen in V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti is limited because of Ti-O net precipitates formed as oxygen trap. Ti-O is expected to dissolve supplying free oxygen for forming the coating during the subsequent exposure to liquid Li. The study indicated feasibility to control the level and distribution of oxygen in the surface region of V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti. The optimized parameters of pre-charging oxygen into V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti for forming in-situ oxide coating are oxidation in Ar (700 ℃, 6 h) followed by annealing in vacuum (700 ℃, 16 h). 　　The second step is chemical formation of Er 2 O 3 coating on V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti during exposure in liquid Li doped with Er. In the present study, V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti were oxidized at 700 ℃ for 1 - 8 h, annealed at 700 ℃ for 16 h, and finally exposed for 100 h at 600 ℃. By the exposure, the Er 2 O 3 layer was formed on V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti oxidized plus annealed, but was not formed on those either as-received or oxidized only. The resistivity of V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti with Er 2 O 3 coating is ~ 10 6 Ωm 2 which is much larger than the minimum requirement (~ 10 - 2 Ωm 2). The results indicate that the in-situ formation of Er 2 O 3 coating is viable, the oxygen source to form coating is the pre-charged oxygen in V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti, and that the annealing after oxidation to homogenize oxygen distribution in substrate is necessary for the formation of the coating. 　　The third step is to characterize and investigate the potential long-term stability of the Er 2 O 3 coating. V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti substrate was oxidized in flowing Ar at 700 ℃, annealed in vacuum at 700 ℃, and finally exposed to liquid Li doped with Er from 500 ℃ to 700 ℃. The oxygen charged and homogenized in limited depth of the substrate was stored as Ti-O net precipitates. It was verified that Ti-O dissolved to release oxygen at high temperature acting as an oxygen source. The surface layer formed on V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti consists of double sub-layers, namely an insulating coating of Er 2 O 3 and an intermediate layer of mixed ErN and V-compounds. The Er 2 O 3 coating was found to be stable up to 750 h of exposure time in liquid lithium doped with erbium at 600 ℃ with its saturated thickness of ~ 0. 1 μm, stable up to 300 h at 650 ℃ with saturated thickness of ~ 0. 6 μm, and stable up to 300 h at 700 ℃ with saturated thickness of ~ 1. 3 μm. Cracking of coating can be avoided during the Li cleanout process after exposure by using weak lotion (liquid NH 3) at low temperature (- 33. 5 ℃). Thus it is inferred that no cracks were formed during the exposure in liquid Li. By re-exposure of intentionally cracked coating in liquid Li doped with erbium, the potentiality of self-healing to cracks was shown. The coating once formed in Li doped with erbium at 700 ℃ was stable in pure Li at 700 ℃, thus demonstrating the stability of Er 2 O 3 coating in liquid Li. The lower limits of the Er doping level to form Er 2 O 3 coating were experimentally gotten to be in the range of 1 - 2. 5 wt%(0. 04 - 1 at%) and at exposure temperature higher than 500 ℃. The limit is expected to be much lower with reduced level of the dissolving oxygen in liquid Li. The in-situ measurement of resistivity during heating in vacuum showed that the coating had resistivity over minimum requirement (10 - 2 Ωm 2) up to 550 ℃. The resistivity satisfying the requirement to higher temperature is expected to show with improved measurement apparatus. 　　Finally, the mechanisms for nucleation and growth of the coating were investigated. By oxidation and annealing, the oxygen was charged into substrate to form Ti-O net phase as oxygen source to the coating. The surface layer formed on V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti consists of two sub-layers, insulating Er 2 O 3 coating and intermediate layer of mixed ErN and Er-V-O. The durations of nucleation at 600, 650 and 700 ℃ are experimentally proved to be quite short. The measured growth rate showed the kinetics of logarithmic law with high exponent (n〓 3 or 4) at 600 ℃ and 650 ℃, suggesting that the rate of growth to Er 2 O 3 coating should be very low. The growth was expedited suddenly at 700 ℃ resulting in low exponent (n〓 2) that almost obeys parabolic law. A phenomenological model was proposed for mechanism of the coating kinetics, which showed growth of Er 2 O 3 coating is controlled by diffusion of oxygen and delivery of erbium to interface between the vanadium alloy substrate and the liquid lithium. The model also showed impurity transport across the interface and formation mechanism of the resulting intermediate layer. 　　In summary, this study has demonstrated that in-situ Er 2 O 3 coating on V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti in liquid Li doped with erbium is a viable technology. Coating was stable at 600 ℃ to 750 h and at 700 ℃ to 300 h. Coating showed satisfactory resistivity to minimum requirement for reducing MHD pressure drop. Coating showed self-healing potentiality. The kinetics of the coating showed quick nucleation followed by growth with logarithmic law. The phenomenological modeling showed formation mechanism of the observed intermediate layer...|$|E
