50|$|The {{vegetation}} of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island is {{a mixture}} of rush/grass, forb, <b>cryptogam</b> tundra, <b>cryptogam</b> herb barren, and sedge/grass,moss wetland. The rush/grass, forb, <b>cryptogam</b> tundra covers the bulk of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. It consists mostly of very low-growing grasses, rushes, forbs, mosses, lichens, and liverworts. These plants typically cover about 40-80 percent of the surface of the ground. The soils are typically moist, fine-grained, and often hummocky. The <b>cryptogam</b> herb barren consists of dry to wet barren landscapes with scattered, herbs, lichens, mosses, and liverworts. Sedges, dwarf shrubs, and peaty mires are normally absent. These plants form a sparse (2-40%) and low-growing plant cover that often occurs as dark streaks on the otherwise barren lands, composed largely of bryophytes and cryptogamic crusts. Sedge/grass,moss wetlands, which occur on the northwest and southeast ends of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, consist of wetland complexes dominated by sedges, grasses, and mosses. These wetlands occupy low, perennially wet parts of the landscape.|$|E
