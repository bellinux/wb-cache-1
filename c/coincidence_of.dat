5|$|It was Daniel Craig's {{performance}} in Our Friends in the North that first {{brought him to}} the attention of producer Barbara Broccoli, who later cast him in the role of secret agent James Bond in the long-running film series. Christopher Eccleston also later went on to achieve notoriety in a cult screen role when he appeared as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the <b>coincidence</b> <b>of</b> the future James Bond and Doctor Who leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} <b>coincidence</b> <b>of</b> the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually interchangeable.|$|E

25|$|Yeh Rastey Hain Pyar Ke, a 1963 {{suspense}} thriller starring Sunil Dutt, Leela Naidu and Rehman, was {{the first}} Bollywood film which seemed to exploit the case. It flopped at the box office. The film began with a disclaimer that all people and incidents were fictitious, and altered the case's outcome. Leela Naidu's 2010 book with Jerry Pinto indicates that the movie screenplay was written before the Nanavati case. It was a <b>coincidence</b> <b>of</b> the real-life case events with a similar movie storyline that led to similarities while the movie was being made.|$|E
25|$|The Reform Party {{was plagued}} by an influx of {{intolerant}} people who supported the party's opposition to government-funded multicultural programs and bilingual programs. Some have claimed that the large problem of intolerance in the Reform Party was not a mere <b>coincidence</b> <b>of</b> its policies of opposing government-sponsored multicultural programs but a deliberate intention by the Reform Party to rally such intolerant people and to push an intolerant agenda. The Reform Party's troubles involving intolerant people within the party were focused on by the media which made the party appear to support such intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{focus on}} narrow {{debates about the}} true nature of {{mathematical}} truth, or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the proof, a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one right answer to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was Eugene Wigner's famous 1960 paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, in which he argued that the happy <b>coincidence</b> <b>of</b> mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.|$|E
