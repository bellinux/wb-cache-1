5|$|As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{seems to}} be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence provides an example showing that double-exponential growth {{is not enough to}} <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence.|$|E
5|$|As the {{reinforcements}} solemnly {{leave the}} mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns, but Mulan cleverly uses a cannon to <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> avalanche, which buries {{most of the}} invaders. An enraged Shan Yu slashes her in the chest, and her deception is revealed when the wound is bandaged.|$|E
50|$|Considerable {{force is}} needed to <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> {{cervical}} fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common <b>causes.</b> <b>A</b> severe, sudden twist to the neck or a severe {{blow to the head}} or neck area can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> cervical fracture.|$|R
50|$|Impaired venous outflow {{is often}} <b>caused</b> by <b>a</b> hypoplastic jugular foramen. This <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in the intracranial blood volume, thereby <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> increase in intracranial pressure.|$|R

5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a previous section. Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
5|$|Flights from London City Airport and London Stansted Airport will {{switch to}} buy on {{board in the}} summer of 2017. Passengers may also use Frequent Flyer Avios points to buy items. Simon Calder of The Independent stated that this may <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in terminal-based food establishments at London Heathrow Terminal 5.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large bowel. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E
50|$|The anti-RhE {{antibody}} {{is quite}} common especially in the Rh genotype CDe/CDe; It usually only <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> mild hemolytic disease, but can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe condition in the newborn. It can occur with other antibodies, usually the anti-Rhc antibody, which can also <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe hemolytic disease.|$|R

50|$|Alkalis {{added to}} indium sulfate {{solutions}} precipitate basic salts. For example, potassium hydroxide produces either a basic sulfate, 2 In2O3.SO3•nH2O, or KIn3(OH)6(SO4)2 depending on pH. Sodium pyrophosphate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slimy precipitate of indium pyrophosphate, In4(P2O7)3•3H2O. Potassium periodate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of a basic indium periodate, 2 InO5•In(OH)3•6 H2O. Oxalic acid <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of indium oxalate, In2(C2O4)3•10 H2O. Alkali oxalates <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of the alkali dioxalatoindate to form: MIn(C2O4)2•3 H2O where M=Na, K or NH4.|$|R
5|$|Insurance {{coverage}} helps save lives, {{by encouraging}} {{early detection and}} prevention of dangerous medical conditions. According to a 2014 study, the ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013. City University public health professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a rollback of the ACA's Medicaid expansion alone would <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> estimated 43,956 deaths annually.|$|E
5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from clogging up with snow.|$|E
5|$|Paleoclimatology, {{although}} sometimes {{treated as}} part of paleoecology, focuses more {{on the history of}} Earth's climate and the mechanisms that have changed it – which have sometimes included evolutionary developments, for example the rapid expansion of land plants in the Devonian period removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the greenhouse effect and thus helping to <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> ice age in the Carboniferous period.|$|E

5|$|The CBO in June 2015 {{forecasted}} that {{repeal of}} ACA {{would increase the}} deficit between $137 billion and $353 billion over the 2016–2025 period, depending {{on the impact of}} macroeconomic feedback effects. The CBO also forecasted that repeal of ACA would likely <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2015, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of epilepsy is typically made based on {{observation of the}} seizure onset and the underlying <b>cause.</b> <b>An</b> electroencephalogram (EEG) to look for abnormal patterns of brain waves and neuroimaging (CT scan or MRI) {{to look at the}} structure of the brain are also usually part of the workup. While figuring out a specific epileptic syndrome is often attempted, it is not always possible. Video and EEG monitoring may be useful in difficult cases.|$|E

5|$|When {{people with}} active {{pulmonary}} TB cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or spit, they expel infectious aerosol droplets 0.5 to 5.0 µm in diameter. A single sneeze can release up to 40,000 droplets. Each {{one of these}} droplets may transmit the disease, since the infectious dose of tuberculosis is very small (the inhalation of fewer than 10 bacteria may <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> infection).|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
40|$|Rats {{and mice}} were given {{antibiotics}} orally and by subcutaneous injection {{and the effects}} on tissue levels of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and intestinal bacteria were studied. In mice {{it was found that}} antibiotics which <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> large reduction in the bacterial flora of the intestine when given orally also <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> significant increase in intestinal 5 -hydroxytryptamine. In rats, neomycin <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> reduction in the urinary excretion of 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. In both rats and mice, many antibiotics <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> significant reduction in the weight of the spleen...|$|R

5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> extremely dangerous condition, a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
