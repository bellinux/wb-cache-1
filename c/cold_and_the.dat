5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|From July 717 to August 718, {{the city}} was besieged by land and sea by the Muslims, who built an {{extensive}} double line of circumvallation and contravallation on the landward side, isolating the capital. Their attempt to complete the blockade by sea however failed when the Byzantine navy employed Greek fire against them; the Arab fleet kept well off the city walls, leaving Constantinople's supply routes open. Forced to extend the siege into winter, the besieging army suffered horrendous casualties from the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of provisions.|$|E
5|$|Ledbury {{was engaged}} in escorting major {{warships}} and Fleet auxiliaries in the North Sea until late June 1942, when she {{was attached to the}} ocean escort of the convoy PQ17. Mariners that took part in convoys delivering supplies to Russia remember vividly the biting <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> continual fear of attack by air or sea. The supplies were vital in that they were needed to keep Russia in the war following her invasion by German forces in 1941. The PQ17 convoy, which left Iceland at the end of June 1942, is known particularly for the tremendous losses among the merchant ships.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the {{temperatures}} peaked at around −22°F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°. The stuntmen, dressed in woolen costumes, {{were in danger}} of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to do the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{examples}} of English food include the Sunday roast, featuring a roasted joint (usually beef, lamb, chicken or pork) served with assorted vegetables, Yorkshire pudding, and gravy. Other prominent meals include {{fish and chips}} and the full English breakfast (generally consisting of bacon, sausages, grilled tomatoes, fried bread, black pudding, baked beans, mushrooms, and eggs). Various meat pies are consumed such as steak and kidney pie, steak and ale pie, cottage pie, pork pie (the latter usually eaten <b>cold)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cornish Pasty.|$|E

25|$|But {{the miners}} were {{worse off than}} the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was {{particularly}} <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.|$|E

25|$|In {{spring and}} autumn the islands are quieter and more pleasant, {{although}} the sea can be rough in spring, autumn and winter, and the islands are sometimes {{cut off from}} the outside world when the ferry services are cancelled due to storms and high waves. During winter, with the addition of the biting <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> strong winds and the resulting ferry cancellations, the islands become almost deserted. As for cultural tourism, Büyükada happens to have the first and only city museum in İstanbul, the Museum of the Princes' Islands in Aya Nikola Bay.|$|E

25|$|In April 1616, Öküz Mehmed Pasha marched from Aleppo towards Kars, {{reinforced}} the castle and sent two forces to Yerevan and Nihavand which {{was taken by}} the Safavids in 1603 soon after the fall of Tabriz. Soon afterwards, he led his armies to Yeravan, defeated a small Safavid force and laid siege to the city. The Ottomans lacked adequate siege weapons and the defenders fought well. The Ottomans suffered major casualties from both the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Safavid forces. Öküz Mehmed Pasha lifted the unsuccessful siege and withdrew to Erzurum. Due to his failure, he was dismissed and was replaced by Damat Halil Pasha on 17 November 1616 who was sent to lead the armies in the eastern front.|$|E
25|$|By 1837 pewter had {{replaced}} copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce, 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking {{to be carried}} out <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very {{little is known about the}} practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums. By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.|$|E
25|$|In each parcel stood about 30 cabins; {{there were}} 382 cabins altogether. This {{particular}} type of cabin had been invented for the French army during the First World War; they had been built close to the front but outside {{the range of the}} enemy artillery, and they served to accommodate soldiers during the few days when the soldiers arrived at their barracks and awaited their trench assignment. They were assembled from thin planks of wood and covered with tarred fabric, all identical in construction and size. They were not provided with windows or other insulation. They did not offer protection from the <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tarred fabric soon began to deteriorate, allowing rainwater to enter the cabins. Closets were nonexistent, and residents slept on sacks of straw placed on the floor. Despite the fact that each cabin had an area of only 25square metres, each cabin had to lodge up to 60 people during times of peak occupancy.|$|E

25|$|Shooting {{began in}} August 1959 and lasted until January 15, 1960. Antonioni began filming the island {{sequence}} with the scenes immediately after Anna disappears. The majority of shooting {{on the island}} was filmed on the island Lisca Bianca (white fish bone) with a cast and crew of 50 people. Other locations for the island sequence included Panarea (which was also the production's headquarters), Mondello and Palermo. Filming the island sequence was intended to take three weeks, but ended up lasting for four months. Difficulties included the islands being infested with rats, mosquitoes and reptiles; also, the weather was unexpectedly <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Navy ship hired to transport {{the cast and crew}} to the island every day never appeared. In order to carry personal items and equipment to the island, the crew had to personally build small rafts out of empty gas canisters and wooden planks; these were towed by a launching tug every morning.|$|E
25|$|There were 36 {{people from}} North Albania who {{traveled}} from Shkodër to Vlorë {{carried in a}} closed van to Dhërmi. Each of them had paid 1500 euros to the traffickers in order to pass illegally to Italy's southern coasts. They embarked with two dinghy drivers and one trafficker, setting out at around 17:30 from the northern coasts of Dhërmi village on the stormy afternoon of 9 January, after it became completely dark. Half an hour after their departure both of the boat's motors stopped, possibly because of the over-load of passengers, {{as well as the}} difficult sea conditions. Returning was impossible. They were trapped by the sea that had a force of 6 on the Beaufort scale, despite being just 3 miles from Karaburun Peninsula's western shores. One of the motors started leaking fuel, burning some passengers. The people on board tried desperately to call their relatives and the police for help, and at 21:30 one of the dinghy drivers called Top-Channel TV. The boat filled with water but did not sink. Some passengers could not endure the <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> burns and eventually died.|$|E
25|$|However, {{infrared}} telescopes have an Achilles heelthey {{need to stay}} extremely <b>cold,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{longer the}} wavelength of infrared, the colder they need to be. If not, the background heat of the device itself overwhelms the detectors, making it effectively blind. This can be overcome by careful spacecraft design, in particular by placing the telescope in dewar with an extremely cold substance, such as liquid helium. This has meant most infrared telescopes have a lifespan limited by their coolant, as short as a few months, maybe a few years at most. It has been possible to maintain a temperature low enough through {{the design of the}} spacecraft to enable near-infrared observations without a supply of coolant, such as the extended missions of Spitzer or NEOWISE. Another example is Hubble's NICMOS instrument, which started out using a block of nitrogen ice that depleted after a couple years, but was then converted to a cryocooler that worked continuously. The James Webb Space Telescope is designed to cool itself without a dewar, using a combination of sun-shield and radiators with the mid-infrared instrument using an additional cryocooler.|$|E
