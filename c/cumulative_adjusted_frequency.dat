Optimal mathematical models were established aiming at the least daily operation cost for pumping station system, which includes main pump units, inlet and outlet passages and their accessories, forebay and outlet pond, auxiliary equipment, power transmission and transformation equipment, other electromechanical equipments and lightings. Also, head varying, time-varying electrical price, and blade <b>adjusting</b> <b>frequency</b> are all taken into account. Meanwhile, the influences of the blade <b>adjusting</b> <b>frequency</b> on operation cost are researched. The results indicate that the operation cost is reduced by 5. 64 %∼ 12. 13 % by the optimal schemes considering time-varying electrical price and adjusting pump blade angles than that of conventional schemes, taking Jiangdu Forth Pumping Station in China as a case. The more the blade <b>adjusting</b> <b>frequency,</b> the less the operation cost. Also, if the blade <b>adjusting</b> <b>frequency</b> exceeds eight times, the optimum operation cost is close to be a const. Therefore, it is advisable to adjust blade angles four to six times a day to save operation cost and guarantee the reliability of pump units...|$|R

I then exemplified this measure on the basis of word frequency data on co-occurrence data of words and construction/patterns. However, in spite of the advantages of DP and in spite of its relevance for virtually all corpus-linguistic work, dispersion is still a very much under-researched topic: to the best of my knowledge, there is not a single study investigating how different measures compare to each other when applied to large datasets. The present article therefore is largely programmatic and exploratory: it sketches out a research program for the investigation of measures of dispersion and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequencies</b> and takes some initial steps itself. More specifically, this paper addresses the issues of the integration of frequencies and dispersion measures and the quantitative comparison of dispersion measures and <b>adjusted</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Finally, the paper makes available a few online resources that will hopefully stimulate more research in this central area of corpus-linguistic methodology and help other researchers go beyond the first programmatic steps taken here.

40|$|Abstract — An on-chip {{communication}} network is most power efficient when it operates {{just below the}} saturation point. For any given traffic load the network can be operated in this region by <b>adjusting</b> <b>frequency</b> and voltage. For a deflective routing network we propose {{the design of a}} central controller for dynamic frequency and voltage scaling. Given history information including the load and frequency in the network, the controller <b>adjusts</b> the <b>frequency</b> and voltage such that the network operates just below the saturation point. We provide control mechanisms for continuous and discrete frequency ranges. With a discrete frequency range and taking into account voltage switching delays, we evaluate the control mechanism under stochastic, smoothly varying and very bursty traffic. Experiments demonstrate that adaptive control is very effective in minimizing power consumption at reasonable performance. Compared with a fixed high frequency network, the adaptively controlled network is significantly more power efficient. We compare it to fixed frequency networks, which are either too slow exhibiting unbounded delays, or are dimensioned for the worst case with very high frequency and are very power hungry. I...|$|R

Our results suggest that network structure has a fundamental impact. Thus, while airlines operating fully-connected configurations reduce frequencies in response to more frequent delays, airlines operating hub-and-spoke structures increase frequencies. Therefore, network airlines have incentives to keep frequencies high even if this is at the expense of a greater congestion at their hub airports.
