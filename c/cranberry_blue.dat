30|$|In general, {{competitive}} advantage is {{often based on}} cost leadership or (product) differentiation. There {{is good reason to}} assume farmer cooperatives struggle with both strategies. First, farmer cooperatives have several disadvantages in terms of supply and quality control, which is why non-cooperatives are expected to be more competitive in the differentiated market (Hovelaque et al. 2009; Mérel et al. 2009). Open membership cooperatives face uneven supply, while closed or defined cooperatives do not always have enough producer interest. Many of the original NGCs formed during the 1990 s in the Upper Midwest operated below plant capacity and failed (Grashuis and Cook 2018). Second, most farmer cooperatives have an upstream bias or user-orientation and therefore do not make large investments in branding or marketing (Hardesty 2005; Beverland 2007; Kontogeorgos 2012; Grashuis 2017). Land O’Lakes (butter), Ocean Spray (<b>cranberries),</b> <b>Blue</b> Diamond (almonds), and Organic Valley (organic milk) are some examples of the few farmer cooperatives for which differentiation is the source of {{competitive advantage}}. The general lack of differentiation by farmer cooperatives is problematic as market orientation is more likely than ownership or governance to positively impact performance (Benos et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 In {{cranberry}} (Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton) cultivation, farmers typically rent {{colonies of}} honey bee (Apis mellifera) for pollination. However, {{the efficiency of}} this bee at pollinating cranberries in Oregon, as in other regions, is questionable. Bumble bees (Bombus sp.) are reportedly effective in other regions, but their impact in Oregon is unknown. My objectives were to: (i) Compare bumble bee and honey bee pollination efficiencies under caged conditions; (ii) Estimate the abundance of bumble bees, honey bees, and other pollinators on an Oregon cranberry farm; and iii) Analyze and compare sources of pollen collected by bumble bees and honey bees in Oregon cranberries. In comparing pollination efficiencies of bumble bees and honey bees under caged conditions, the analysis of variance of data from the cage study indicated that bumble bee and honey bee pollinated plants yielded statistically equivalent average numbers of cranberries (1421 ± 302. 5 and 1405 ± 347. 6 berries/m², respectively) and weight of berries (11. 5 ± 2. 42 and 11. 5 ± 2. 77 g/m²). However, bumble bees may have increased fruit set in honey bee treatments. On one occasion, bumble bees {{were found in the}} honey bee treatment, and {{may have contributed to the}} pollination of flowers in these plots. To estimate the abundance of pollinators, visual observations and were blue vane traps were utilized. Thirty-four timed visual observations in transects of cranberry beds were performed over on four dates during <b>cranberry</b> bloom. <b>Blue</b> vane traps were set-up on five occasions during bloom for two day periods. In the visual observations, honey bees (3. 5 ± 0. 58 /min) were observed more frequently than bumble bees (1. 2 ± 0. 20 /min). Bumble bees of four species made up 69. 1...|$|R
5000|$|After {{building}} a frame house and preparing {{to move in}} Lorenzo Carter’s new home was burned down by children playing with wood shavings and only in 1803 was a two-room log cabin home finished for the family. In 1802 he also built the Carter Tavern which became a somewhat informal town hall, hotel, and religious meeting house. In 1804 the state of Ohio promoted Carter to Major and {{he was given the}} responsibility of the Cleaveland battalion. In 1808 he built a trading vessel 30 ton schooner called the Zephyr that traded furs for goods like salt. Carter was also {{an active member of the}} first library association in Cleveland which was formed in 1811 but quickly dissolved under the pressures of the War of 1812.Lorenzo's father, Lt. Elazer Carter handed down to him and the generations that followed the flag he carried during The Revolutionary War. The flag passed to Lorenzo's grand daughter, Selena Silsby Brockway who inturn passed it to her grand daughter Alice Henderson. The flag eventually ended up being passed to her grandson John (Jack) Penty Jr. The flag is one of the original flags made when there were still 13 British colonies. The Revolutionaries determined the stars and stripes would signify the Republic they were fighting to form. It is made of homespun linen and handstitched. The red stripes were dyed with <b>cranberries</b> and the <b>blue</b> with elderberries. Thirteen stars are scattered across a light blue background. This flag is about 8' by 10'. This flag was made during the Revolution before this country was even formed. It was 1775 and emotions ran high, many of them caught and spurred higher by the word [...] "LIBERTY" [...] sewn onto the flag. The flag now resides with The Western Reserve Historical Society.|$|R
