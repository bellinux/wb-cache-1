25|$|In his {{original}} 1972/73 deep ecology paper, Arne Næss claims the deep ecology movement arose from scientists – ecologists who {{were out in}} the field studying the biodiversity and wild ecosystems throughout the world. They were also doing the work of philosophers, laying the foundations for the Age of Ecology and a new ecological worldview to replace the anthropocentric, mastery of Nature, and modernist worldview arising in the 17th and 18th centuries. Three of the most influential ecological spokespersons of the 1960s were Rachel Carson, David Brower, and Paul R. Ehrlich. Some consider the publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring (1962) as the beginning of the contemporary, long-range deep ecology movement. When her book appeared there was a long-standing movement for <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> and resources, as well as support for creating parks and other areas devoted to preserving wilderness and spectacular nature. Carson's writings were especially influential because they clearly showed how human well-being depends on the condition of whole biotic communities. She explained in practical terms how living beings are interrelated within ecosystems. She explained how pesticides used to control mosquitoes and other insects led to declines in some bird populations. Silent Spring helped show how complex food webs and networks of biotic relationships function. Since humans are at the top of many food chains, exposure to chemicals becomes more concentrated as these move up the chains. The chemicals also can be stored in human tissues and gradually accumulate over time, adversely affecting health. Carson showed the need for deep changes in human practices and ways of living.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} the close {{integration}} between agriculture and the raising of livestock occurs in the Kano Close-Settled Zone of Nigeria. This account is significant due to the scale and length of time over which the region has carried out intensive farming. With a population of approximately five million in the region excluding the more than {{one and a half}} million living in Kano city, the challenges facing the people of the area, in terms of meeting their growing needs, are great. More than eighty-five percent of the surface land in this area is dedicated to farmland, and the farmers themselves are strongly oriented towards the <b>conservation</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> resources. They pay particular attention to the protection of organic matter in the soil. This is demonstrated by their management of animals and their wastes. During the dry season animals are only penned at night and are left free to roam the fields by day. Although they are confined to their pens and fed on cut fodder during the growing season, their bedding and manure are mixed and returned to the fields. In addition to this, crop residue, tree browse, and weeds are fed to the animals thereby recycling the nutrients.|$|E
