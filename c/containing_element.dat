Meanwhile, Richtofen's crew arrive at a Soviet Cosmodrome site, where Richtofen intends to travel to Group 935's moon base, Griffin Station. The crew is contacted by Gersh, a member of the Ascension Group who requests to be freed from Samantha's grip. After freeing Gersh, the four of them are teleported further in time, and arrive at a Siberian lighthouse sometime in 2011, once used by Richtofen as a secret lab. However, they are trapped within a locked room, and forced to rely on four movie actors: Sarah Michelle Gellar, Danny Trejo, Robert Englund, and Michael Rooker, who are filming a zombie movie on-site along with director George A. Romero, who had been infected as well. Richtofen requests the four celebrities to find a golden rod, which is a Vril generator device, which he then uses to fix the teleporter. He transports himself and the other three soldiers back to Shangri-La, leaving the celebrities behind to continue fighting Romero and the horde. At Shangri-La, the group discovers two explorers, Gary and Brock, who died trapped within a time loop while trying to discover the secrets of the mythical Agartha realm.

40|$|A simple yet {{robust and}} {{accurate}} approach for capturing shock waves using a high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is presented. The method uses the physical viscous {{terms of the}} Navier-Stokes equations as suggested by others; however, the proposed formulation of the numerical viscosity is continuous and compact by construction, and {{does not require the}} solution of an auxiliary diffusion equation. This work also presents two analyses that guided the formulation of the numerical viscosity and certain aspects of the DG implementation. A local eigenvalue analysis of the DG discretization applied to a shock <b>containing</b> <b>element</b> is used to evaluate the robustness of several Riemann flux functions, and to evaluate algorithm choices that exist within the underlying DG discretization. A second analysis examines exact solutions to the DG discretization in a shock <b>containing</b> <b>element,</b> and identifies a "model" instability that will inevitably arise when solving the Euler equations using the DG method. This analysis identifies the minimum viscosity required for stability. The shock capturing method is demonstrated for high-speed flow over an inviscid cylinder and for an unsteady disturbance in a hypersonic boundary layer. Numerical tests are presented that evaluate several aspects of the shock detection terms. The sensitivity of the results to model parameters is examined with grid and order refinement studies...|$|E

30|$|TGA {{proteins}} {{are members}} of the group D basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) (Jakoby et al. 2002), which recognize the TGACG motif (also known as activation sequence 1; as- 1) in the promoter region (Gatz 2013). With the identification of as- 1 elements in promoters of a number of genes, the crucial roles TGA TFs played in gene expression regulation were unveiled. Mutagenesis of LS 7 element, which contained a TGA-binding site, resulted in complete abolishment of PR 1 expression. On the contrary, mutation of LS 5, another TGACG motif <b>containing</b> <b>element,</b> augmented PR 1 expression (Kesarwani et al. 2007). The opposite effects exerted by these two TGACG motifs to PR 1 expression implied that transcription of genes containing as- 1 elements in the adjacent promoter, might subject to complex regulation by different TGAs in the genome.|$|E

We present an algorithm to executee a sequence of O(n) of these instrucitions on-line in time O(nloglogn) on a Random Access Machine. The instruction repertoire can be extended by instructions like allmin(i) (delete all elements not greater than i), extract max, or predecessor (i) (find the largest element less than i), without disturbing the O(loglogn) processing time per item. Whereas the off-line insert-extract min problem {{is known to be}} reducible to the on-line union-find problem, we prove that the off-line insert-allmin problem is equivalent to the off-line union-find problem, hence the off-line problems have faster algorithms. As an application we show that our algorithm can be used to process a sequence of O(n) instructions of the types: "split an interval", "unite two adjacent intervals", and "find the interval currently <b>containing</b> <b>element</b> j", on-line in time O(nloglogn).

A broken circuit clutter is the {{collection}} of broken circuits of a fixed element. Seymour [The matroids with the max-flow min-cut property, J. Combinatorial Theory B 23 (1977) 189 – 222] proved that a broken circuit clutter of a binary matroid has the max-flow min-cut property {{if and only if}} it does not contain a minor isomorphic to Q 6. We shall present an analogue of this result in affine convex geometries. Precisely, we shall show that a broken circuit clutter of an element e in a convex geometry arising from two-dimensional point configuration has the max-flow min-cut property if and only if the configuration has no subset forming a ‘Pentagon’ configuration with center e. Firstly we introduce the notion of closed set systems. This leads to a common generalization of rooted circuits both of matroids and convex geometries (antimatroids). We further study some properties of affine convex geometries and their broken circuit clutters...|$|E

The optimization process is performed by using Response Surface Method to optimize factors that affected quality of the activated carbon using Box-Behnken design. The factors used were carbonation temperature (T) with a level of 400 oC, 500 oC and 600 °C; concentration of ZnCl 2 (K) with a level of 30 %, 40 %, 50 %; and mass ratio of ZnCl 2 to activated carbon with level of 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1.

40|$|A classic {{result in}} the {{analysis}} of data structures is that path compression with linking by rank solves the dis-joint set union problem in almost-constant amortized time per operation. Recent experiments suggest that in practice, a näıve linking method works just as well if not better than linking by rank, in spite of being theo-retically inferior. How can this be? We prove that ran-domized linking is asymptotically as efficient as linking by rank. This result provides theory that matches the experiments, which implicitly do randomized linking {{as a result of the}} way the input instances are generated. 1 Disjoint Set Union via Compressed Trees The disjoint set union problem, also called the union-find problem, is to maintain a collection of disjoint sets, each with a distinguished root element, under an intermixed sequence of the following two kinds of operations: Find (x) : Return the root of the set <b>containing</b> <b>element</b> x. Unite (x, y) : If elements x and y are in the same set, return false; otherwise, form the union of the sets containing x and y (destroying the old sets), choose a root for the new set, and return true. Initially each set is a singleton, whose only element is its root. In each Unite, the implementation is free to choose the root of the new set. Information associated with a set can be stored in its root. The compressed tree solution to this problem [6] represents each set by a rooted tree whose nodes are the elements of the set and whose root is the root o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{finite element}} code is {{developed}} for analyzing the free vibration {{characteristics of a}} stiffened conoidal shell by combining an eight noded curved shell element with a three noded curved beam element. The code is validated by solving problems available in the literature and comparing the present results with established ones. A number of problems are further solved where {{the size of the}} cutouts and their positions with respect to the shell centre are varied for different edge constraints of full and truncated conoids. The effects of these parametric variations on the fundamental frequencies are studied and discussed in details. The results are furnished as figures and tables, which may be readily used by practicing engineers dealing with stiffened conoids with cutouts central or eccentric.
