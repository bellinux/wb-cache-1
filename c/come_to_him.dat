5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes around their necks. When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
5|$|The {{laws are}} {{concerned}} with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions {{at all levels of}} society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim. The king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control. Æthelberht's laws are mentioned by Alfred the Great, who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by Æthelberht, {{as well as those of}} Offa of Mercia and Ine of Wessex.|$|E

5|$|When Harding {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1920 he was considered a long shot until after the convention began. Then the leading candidates, such as General Leonard Wood, could not gain the needed majority, and the convention deadlocked. Harding's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot. He conducted a front porch campaign, remaining {{for the most part}} in Marion and allowing the people to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He won in a landslide over Democrat James M. Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs, running on a theme of return to normalcy and becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president.|$|E

25|$|On 6 March 1995, Robert Hughes {{resigned}} as Minister {{responsible for the}} Citizen's Charter over {{an affair with a}} constituency worker who had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for help from an abusive relationship. Hughes confessed the affair and resigned when he believed that the liaison was about to be exposed in a Sunday newspaper.|$|E

25|$|Michael is then {{thrown into}} doubt by lies told {{to him in}} a vain attempt at {{blackmail}} by Greeba's avaricious brothers. Believing that Greeba loved Jason and had only <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for his wealth and position, he resigns from his post in government. However, before this can come into effect, Danish soldiers storm the meeting, arrest the ministers and claim Iceland again as under Danish rule.|$|E
25|$|Al-Zahawi {{began the}} process of his art through musings and pencil sketches. He notes that often these ideas <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in his dreams, forcing him to wake up late at night to put the designs to paper so as to capture them in their most {{accurate}} and vivid form. Often these sketches, each unique in their own right, are combined and refined to eventually come to life through his art.|$|E
25|$|He {{said that}} the {{violence}} {{was due to the}} hostile attitude of whites, who had ravaged Paiute women and killed their men without cause. He disclaimed responsibility for the Williams Station incident, which he blamed on a group of Bannocks over whom he had no authority. However, he said that if the whites had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> afterwards to discuss the problem, as had been agreed by treaty, {{there would have been no}} need for fighting.|$|E

25|$|In 1688, the Habsburg army took Belgrade {{and entered}} the {{territory}} of present-day Central Serbia. Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden called Serbian Patriarch Arsenije III Čarnojević to raise arms against the Turks; the Patriarch accepted {{and returned to the}} liberated Peć. As Serbia fell under Habsburg control, Leopold I granted Arsenije nobility and the title of duke. In early November, Arsenije III met with Habsburg commander-in-chief, General Enea Silvio Piccolomini in Prizren; after this talk he sent a note to all Serb bishops to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and collaborate only with Habsburg forces.|$|E
25|$|On January 3, 1753, Timothy was {{appointed}} as {{guardian of the}} Mohawk children at the boarding school. In February, the boarding school mysteriously burnt down, and Hawley lost everything. It was widely believed that the Williams/Dwight/Kellogg faction had set the fire, although this was never proven. As a result, {{it was decided that}} Hawley might be more successful if he lived among the Mohawks, instead of having them <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> So, on May 22, 1753, Timothy and Gideon took a trip to Onaquaga, in Iroquois territory. The British were especially motivated to establish a relationship with the Six Nations as they foresaw the onset of the French and Indian War.|$|E
25|$|Although Gravano evaded {{criminal}} charges, he incurred Castellano's wrath {{over the}} unsanctioned killing. Gravano attempted to lie low {{for nearly three}} weeks afterwards, during which time he called his crew together and {{made the decision to}} kill Castellano if necessary. Gravano and Milito were then summoned to a meeting with Castellano at a Manhattan restaurant. Castellano had been given the details of what Fiala had done, but he was still livid that Gravano had not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for permission to kill Fiala first. Gravano, however, was spared execution when he convinced Castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 {{that was}} also changed by Prabhupada, and even the {{function}} of the second initiation was delegated to a few selected disciples. In the middle of May 1977, while in Hrishikesh, his health had turned for the worse and Prabhupada called all his GBC members to Vrindavana for instruction. The discussion of May 28 was recorded. There was a backlog of candidates and on 9 July a letter by his secretary, Tamal Krishna Goswami, was sent out, and that named eleven senior disciples who would now be responsible for giving initiations to the new candidates. At this point the new candidates need no longer write to him and the recommendations don’t have to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for confirmation.|$|E
25|$|The {{band had}} been {{listening}} to Martha Wainwright's Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole during the sessions and were fans of it. Towards {{the end of the}} recording sessions, Lightbody wrote a duet with her in mind, hoping to get her to sing it. She liked the song and agreed to record it. Eugene Kelly and a few members from The Reindeer Section also appear as choir in various songs throughout the album. Simpson credited Lee for being supportive of the band, {{and at the same time}} critical, when necessary. Each band member used to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for opinion on work they were doing. Morale during the sessions was high, with the band feeling a sense of togetherness seeing the hard work everyone was doing.|$|E
25|$|In the Underworld, {{the clock}} hand ticks again, {{signifying}} that yet another soul had moved on, while Hades {{reflects on the}} page depicting him with Zelena. At this point, 12 souls had moved on from the Underworld (since the clock in the Underworld had shifted from 8:15 to 8:27). Inside Hades' lair, Hades is furious that Gold is taking his time to create a portal to Storybrooke in order to transport Zelena’s baby daughter to him, telling him {{that the success of}} this plan will be the difference in whether or not Gold's secrets are revealed to Belle and if Gold's debt to Hades will be cancelled, unless he finishes the job quickly. Meanwhile, Snow and David discover that they can use a special phone to contact their son Neal through the process of haunting. At the loft, Henry is still feeling less useful even as he shows them illustrated drawings that seems to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> but can't explain it.|$|E

25|$|According to tradition, when Muhammad {{was either}} nine or twelve years old, {{he went with}} his uncle Abu Talib on a {{business}} journey to Syria. There he met Bahira {{in the town of}} Bosra. When the caravan was passing by his cell, the monk invited the merchants to a feast. They accepted the invitation, leaving the boy to guard the camel. Bahira, however, insisted that everyone in the caravan should <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Then a miraculous occurrence indicated to the monk that Muhammad was to become a prophet. According to one version, those were the stigmata that Bahira found on young Muhammad. Other variants of the story say that it was a miraculous movement of a cloud or an unusual behavior of a branch that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's companion, warning him to preserve the child from the Jews (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the Byzantines (in al-Tabari's version).|$|E
25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath is {{not known}} to have made any formal disciples {{although}} {{he is said to}} have spiritually initiated a few seekers that would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> seeking his spiritual tutelage. His method of initiation involved sharing his pipe or by transfixing his gaze on them (called drishtipat). He would rarely initiate anyone by word of mouth although that {{is believed to be the}} commonly invoked method of initiation in Hinduism. He is known to have guided seekers based on their spiritual aptitude and receptivity in worshipping either saguna Brahman (God with form) or nirguna Brahman (God without form) and sometimes also help them choose their ideal of worship or veer them towards worshipping guru as Parabrahma (the ultimate reality). Though he would recommend saguna upasana for the beginners, he would eventually veer them towards nirguna upasana. Once in response to a question by his devotee as to whether saints should render help to people in spiritual and temporal spheres, he is known to have remarked that unlike a muscular animal who can easily swim across the river, a small insect would drown without help so they have to be helped. As such, his devotees gave him the epithet Jagadguru (spiritual guide of humanity).|$|E
25|$|Sir Launfal {{has gone}} to his room, but his faerie {{mistress}} does not appear and Sir Launfal soon realises why. Tryamour will no longer <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> when he wishes for her since he has given away her existence. Soon, her gifts have disappeared or changed. Now he is brought to trial. Since the jury of his peers all know that the Queen {{is more likely to}} have propositioned Launfal than the other way around, they believe Launfal's version of the encounter. However, for his insult he is given a year and a fortnight to produce the beautiful lady as proof of his boast; Guenevere says she is willing to be blinded if he manages to produce such a woman. As the day of the proof progresses, the Queen presses for him to be executed while others express doubt, particularly when two parties of gorgeous women ride up. Finally Tryamour arrives and exculpates Launfal on both counts. She breathes on Guenevere and blinds her. Gyfre, now visible, brings his horse Blaunchard, and Tryamour, Launfal, and her ladies ride away to the island of Olyroun, which in Marie de France's twelfth-century version of the tale is Avalon. Once a year, on a certain day, Sir Launfal returns and his horse may be heard neighing and a knight may joust with him, although he was never seen again in Arthur's land.|$|E
