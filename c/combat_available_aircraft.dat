50|$|Following the {{completion}} of a pair of prototypes, during February 1940, the French government issued an order authorising the bulk upgrading of 500 M.S.406 fighters to the more capable M.S.410 configuration. As it was a 15-day process to convert each fighter, all conversion efforts were stopped in May 1940 in response to the urgent need for every <b>available</b> <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> to be put into action during the Battle of France against invading German forces. Only five complete production M.S.410 aircraft, along with 150 sets of the revised wings, had been completed by this point.|$|R

5000|$|Eurofighter {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying that although they are disappointed, they respect the decision: [...] "India took the decision to select our competitor as the preferred bidder in the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) tender.

With the Eurofighter Typhoon, we offered the Indian Air Force the most modern <b>combat</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>available.</b> Based on the Indian Government feedback, we will now carefully analyze and evaluate this situation together with our European Partner Companies and their respective Governments." [...] Officials at the British High Commission in Delhi also said they were disappointed with the decision but added that it was expressly said this was about the cost of the contract, not a reflection on the health of bilateral relations between India and the countries.|$|R
