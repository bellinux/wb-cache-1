50|$|The {{two halves}} of the arch were cast using similar {{climbing}} formwork, with concrete provided via a <b>cable</b> <b>conveyor.</b> The construction system had an hydraulic self climbing casting mould which was anchored to themost recently completed arch segment, and segments were added {{at a rate of}} about 1 per week (illustration showing process). Each segment used about 60 cubic meters of k70 class concrete, and there were about 50 segments per side. The arch itself is hollow, and has been provided with heating coils to keep it free from ice and snow build up as well as navigation lights and interior maintenance pathways (info taken from this PDF at the joint bridge info site).|$|E
40|$|Back {{injuries}} from handling materials in underground mines {{continue to be}} a major safety problem. In spite of the ingenuity of many people and the development of numerous mechanized aids, the number of materials-handling injuries remains second only to the number of roof fall injuries in underground coalmines. Relocation and repositioning of electrical <b>cable,</b> <b>conveyor</b> belt parts, and roof bolt sup-plies in particular are the sources of significant numbers of back injuries. To help reduce such injuries, researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are examining Mine Safety and Health Administration accident data to determine correlations between materials-handling tasks and the number of back injuries. Also being investigated are new technologies used in underground mines in the United States. Equipment is being developed or modified that would replace the necessity of doing lifting tasks manually. A Coleman manipulator was tested, and modifications were made to make it more suitable for underground mine use. To reduce or eliminate the need to manually clean off materials that commonly plug grizzly openings, a track-guided pincher arm device was developed. Oversized rock can be broken with the pincher arms in the up position, and the arms can be lowered to grab and remove debris. The arm can also be used in a sweeping action to remove cohesive fines that may bridge grizzly openings...|$|E
50|$|Once {{the arch}} was in place, the stays, {{temporary}} concrete stay towers and <b>cable</b> <b>conveyors</b> were removed, and the roadway segments added. Some were added in place, but the centre roadway section under the arch was floated in on barges, {{as a complete}} section, and raised into place.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{describe}} a finite element model which {{will be used to}} investigate the stress distribution and reaction loads in fabric reinforced conveyor belt using the finite element analysis technique. These stress distributions will then be compared with a similarly proportioned finite element model of a <b>cable</b> reinforced <b>conveyor</b> belt. The finite element analysis results indicate that the stress levels in the bottom cover of a fabric reinforced conveyor belt increase with an increasing number of fabric plies and that the peak stresses in <b>cable</b> reinforced <b>conveyor</b> belt are greater than those found in fabric reinforced conveyor belt...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{materials}} {{are used for}} making blasting mats and new materials with different properties are constantly being introduced into this field. The most common materials are strips of old tires held together by steel cables, mats woven from manila rope or wire <b>cables,</b> logs or <b>conveyor</b> belts. Layers of wire netting can also be used. Several methods of assembling a blasting mat are patented.|$|R
40|$|Transporting coal {{by means}} of {{conveyor}} belts is common in Australian underground coal mines. Major conveyor belt–related mining incidents are now relatively infrequent {{as a result of}} recent improvements in engineering standards and the use of fire-resistant materials. However, conveyor belts are still a potential cause of personal and structural damage. In addition, any unexpected breakdown of rolling components or failure of belts creates a significant interruption to production, which is a major concern for operators, who are responsible for achieving optimum mining production. This project aimed to develop a fibre optic–based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system to monitor the temperature change of malfunction idlers for heavy-duty conveyor belts in underground coal mines. Specifically, the objective of the project was to investigate various installation options for fibre-optic <b>cable</b> along the <b>conveyor</b> belt in order to identify the most effective design. The project was consisted of site trials and laboratory experiments to examine the performance of the DTS system for different cable installation designs and to characterise the behaviour of the DTS system...|$|R
40|$|The {{monitoring}} information {{is used for}} variety of crucial functions including safety control, evaluation of current mining plans and future slope design. It provides an active input into mine planning. The early identification of movement zones allows steps {{to be taken to}} minimize the impact of mining on stability by the implementation of corrective measures. The main objective of slope monitoring study is to detect any instability well in advance so that any damage to men and machineries can be avoided. If any instability is detected in the early stage then it can be stabilized by applying the suitable remedial measure. The slope materials are inherently weak in the mine. Slope stability monitoring was done in NALCO mine. There were many cut slope areas most of them for the passage of the <b>cable</b> belt <b>conveyor.</b> In order to check the stability of those cut slopes it was proposed the approach of numerical modelling and graphical analysis. The numerical modelling was done in OASYS software and the stability of the sites area checked and factor of safety (FOS) is found in the stable region. On the basis of Numerical Modelling for the geo-mining condition of cut slope surrounding NALCO mine, the factor of safety for the Cut slope I, (near deep cut area), Cut slope II, (near drive house area of height 32 m), Cut slope III, (near drive house area of height 24 m), and Cut slope IV, (near part II mine area) are respectively 1. 335, 1. 332, 1. 324 and 1. 224 with corresponding cut slope height of 20 m, 32 m, 24 m and 35 m. Field observation through total station indicated maximum horizontal displacement of 4. 3 cm, 3. 5 cm, 4. 5 cm and - 5 cm at cut I, II, III and IV respectively indicating stability of slope. Except at few places with local slope failure due to rainfall, all other cut slope are observed to be stable, therefore it is recommended to improve garland drainage and stabilization through geotextile...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLine type heat {{detectors}} (LTHD) {{are important for}} temperature based fire detection in applications {{with a large number}} of detection points. Preferably they are used in aggressive environments showing extreme temperatures, high humidity, dust exposure, aggressive gases, or others. Typical applications are in traffic tunnels, <b>cable</b> channels, or <b>conveyor</b> belts. Europe is actually preparing the new EN 54 - 22 standard for resettable line type {{heat detectors}} (LTHD). This new standard includes a classification of the various types of detectors, reaction classes, and test procedures. It will allow more adequate testing compared to the actual procedure based on EN 54 - 5 for point detectors. It will cover all types of resettable LTHD as semiconductor cables, fiber optic cables, pneumatic systems, and analog cables. The paper presents an overview on the actual draft of the standard. During the last years, Metaphysics has developed a new semiconductor sensor based LTHD. In contrary to other types of LTHD it is using discrete semiconductor temperature sensors such allowing an exact localization of the fire and highly flexible programming of the alarm functionality. Due to a special, patented high-speed bus system it has been shown in several public tests that this system is significantly faster than other LTHD systems. After first experience in the field, more features like loop setups with increased availability and network solutions have been added recently. The paper shows the physical principle of this approach and its system design completed by test reports and application examples...|$|R
