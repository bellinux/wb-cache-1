25|$|If a tagged item is {{paid for}} by credit card or in {{conjunction}} with use of a loyalty card, {{then it would be}} possible to indirectly deduce the identity of the purchaser by reading the globally unique ID of that item (contained in the RFID tag). This is only true if the person doing the watching also had access to the loyalty <b>card</b> <b>data</b> and the credit <b>card</b> <b>data,</b> and the person with the equipment knows where you are going to be.|$|E

25|$|Assuming sorted data, L-estimators {{involving}} only a {{few points}} can be calculated with far fewer mathematical operations than efficient estimates. Before the advent of electronic calculators and computers, these provided a useful way to extract {{much of the information}} from a sample with minimal labour. These remained in practical use through the early and mid 20th century, when automated sorting of punch <b>card</b> <b>data</b> was possible, but computation remained difficult, and is still of use today, for estimates given a list of numerical values in non-machine-readable form, where data input is more costly than manual sorting. They also allow rapid estimation.|$|E
25|$|Hollerith {{initially}} {{did business}} {{under his own}} name, as The Hollerith Electric Tabulating System, specializing in punched <b>card</b> <b>data</b> processing equipment. He provided tabulators and other machines under contract for the Census Office, which used them for the 1890 census. The net effect of the many changes from the 1880 census: the larger population, the data items to be collected, the Census Bureau headcount, the scheduled publications, {{and the use of}} Hollerith's electromechanical tabulators, was to reduce the time required to process the census from eight years for the 1880 census to six years for the 1890 census.|$|E
40|$|With the {{generation}} of massive data from bus IC cards, how to effectively and efficiently recommend comfortable bus routes to bus passengers is a challenging and complex task. In this paper, waiting time, crowded time, and driving time between different bus stations on different bus routes {{at different times of}} the day are calculated from bus IC <b>cards</b> <b>data</b> history. Then, a multi-objective program with various constraints is suggested to recommend comfortable bus routes for bus passengers, and a genetic algorithm is developed to search for expected solutions. The proposed method is implemented using bus IC <b>cards</b> <b>data</b> from Chongqing, China and will be a promising tool for bus passengers when choosing comfortable bus routes...|$|R

The company has found success as a cheap-chic player in the industry. The parent company was renamed the Target Corporation in 2000 and divested itself of its last department store chains in 2004. It suffered from a massive and highly publicized security breach of customer credit <b>card</b> <b>data</b> {{and the failure of}} its short-lived Canadian subsidiary in the early 2010s but experienced revitalized success with its expansion in urban markets within the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{host device}} can lock an SD card using a {{password}} {{of up to}} 16bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands {{to read and write}} data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except <b>card</b> <b>data</b> under DRM), but {{there is no way to}} gain access to the existing data.|$|E
25|$|Internet fraud may be by {{claiming}} a chargeback {{which is not}} justified ("friendly fraud"), or {{carried out by the}} use of credit card information which can be stolen in many ways, the simplest being copying information from retailers, either online or offline. Despite efforts to improve security for remote purchases using credit cards, security breaches are usually the result of poor practice by merchants. For example, a website that safely uses SSL to encrypt <b>card</b> <b>data</b> from a client may then email the data, unencrypted, from the webserver to the merchant; or the merchant may store unencrypted details in a way that allows them to be accessed over the Internet or by a rogue employee; unencrypted card details are always a security risk. Even encrypted data may be cracked.|$|E

500|$|Einhänder was {{the first}} 3D shooter {{developed}} by Square, a company otherwise mostly known for their role-playing video games. The developers used German terms extensively for naming things in the game, {{in addition to a}} number of references from Greek mythology and the Bible. According to the gaming website IGN, a lot of the effects Square learned from creating Final Fantasy VII were also put in use in Einhänder. The game was showcased at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1997 and was initially planned for a Japanese release on October 16, 1997, but was eventually released five weeks later on November 20. Square released an unrelated game the following month, Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon, which came with a bonus [...] "Mysterious Data Disc" [...] featuring memory <b>card</b> <b>data</b> for various Square games including Einhänder.|$|E

2500|$|On April 20, 2011, Sony {{shut down}} the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a {{prolonged}} interval, revealing on April 23 that {{this was due to}} [...] "an external intrusion on our system". Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs. It also stated that it was possible that users' profile data, including purchase history and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. There was no evidence that any credit <b>card</b> <b>data</b> had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit <b>card</b> <b>data</b> may have been obtained. Additionally, the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number {{from the back of the}} credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions. In response to the incident, Sony announced a [...] "Welcome Back" [...] program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the Second World War, the IRS was {{handling}} sixty million tax returns each year, using a combination of mechanical desk calculators, accounting machines and pencil and paper forms. In 1948 punch card equipment was used. The first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955, when an IBM 650 installed at Kansas City processed 1.1 million returns. The IRS was authorized to proceed with computerization in 1959, [...] and purchased IBM 1401 and IBM 7070 systems for local and regional data processing centers. The Social Security Number was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965. By 1967, all returns were processed by computer and punched <b>card</b> <b>data</b> entry was phased out.|$|E
