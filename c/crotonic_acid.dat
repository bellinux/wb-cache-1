The role of dienes in Diels-Alder reactions has also been investigated. A new 4 C + 2 C annulation reaction has been developed based on the propensity of dienes to undergo Michael reaction with $ alpha$,$ beta$-unsaturated ketones under Lewis-acid catalysed conditions. These Michael adducts in turn were cyclized either with potassium tert-butoxide or with lithium thiophenoxide.

40|$|Two {{reactions}} in the catabolism of catechol by meta-fission, namely, hydration of 2 -oxopent- 4 -enoate (vinylpyruvate) and aldol fission of the product, are catalyzed by stereospecific enzymes. The absolute configuration of this hydration product {{was shown to}} be l(S) - 4 -hydroxy- 2 -oxopentanoate. Vinylpyruvate hydratase, purified almost to homogeneity, had a molecular weight of about 287, 000 and was dissociated in sodium dodecyl sulfate, without prior treatment with mercaptoethanol, into a species with an approximate molecular weight of 28, 000. The hydratase was highly specific for its substrates; thus, although 2 -oxo-cis-hex- 4 -enoate was also hydrated, structurally similar compounds such as the trans isomer, vinylacetic and <b>crotonic</b> <b>acids,</b> and the ring-fission products of catechol and methylcatechols were not attacked. Vinylpyruvate hydratase was activated by Mn 2 + ions. On {{the basis of these}} observations, a mechanism is proposed which closely resembles that for 4 -hydroxy- 2 -oxopentanoate aldolase. A possible evolutionary connection between functionally related, divalent cation-activated hydro-lyases and aldolases is discussed.

40|$|As fossil {{resources}} constantly decrease, {{the concept of}} bioefinery is a most attractive approach to generate chemicals from renewable resources. In this context, unsaturated fatty acids derived from the hydrolysis of crops extracted-triglycerides are a major class of substrates. These must be converted to high added-value derivatives: catalytic transformations can {{play a key role}} in this, by converting such compounds into other functionalised derivatives. A most attractive reaction to meet this challenge is olefin metathesis. Based on product/catalyst separation and catalyst recycling issues, use of heterogeneous catalysts is of high interest. We thus prepared heterogenised commercial ruthenium catalysts. The hybrid materials were prepared in a two-step procedure: after silver salt-mediated cationisation, the organometallic species were immobilised by ion exchange on mesoporous aluminosilicates of the MCM- 41 family. The novel catalysts were characterised by solidstate NMR, IR, XRD, BET, elemental analysis and TGA. They were successfully applied in several metathesis reactions involving the archetypic methyl oleate, a C 18 unsaturated ester, with different grades of purity. The probed reactions were self metathesis, ethenolysis and cross metathesis with functionalised olefins derived from acrylic and <b>crotonic</b> <b>acids.</b> Though recycling was not completely successful, the supported catalysts were able to efficiently catalyse all these transformations, providing in some instances the first heterogeneously examples of such...|$|R

40|$|The {{reaction}} {{between a}} halogen or hydrogen halide and an olefinic substance {{is one of}} the fundamental reactions of organic chemistry. It is not surprising, therefore, that considerable attention has been given to the kinetics of the electrophilic and nucleophilic addition of halogens or hydrogen halides to olefins under the influence of both thermal and photochemical activation (1 - 6). The factors most likely to influence the rate of the reaction viz., the nature of the olefin and its substituent groups, the particular halogen or hydrogen halide employed, the temperature, the influence of catalysts and the powerful solvent effects have all been investigated in detail with the result that this seemingly straightforward class of reactions has been shown to possess considerable complexity. On the other hand, the kinetics of the reactions of hypohalous acids, and in particular hypochlorous acid, with olefins has received rather scant attention. In some ways this is remarkable {{in view of the fact}} that the formation of chlorohydrins by this reaction has been known for at least seventy years when Erlenmeyer and Muller (7) and Melikov (8. 9) investigated the addition of hypochlorous acid to the isomeric <b>crotonic</b> <b>acids.</b> Perhaps the most important contribution to our knowledge of reactions of this kind is due to Bloomfield and co-workers (10, 11) who, while investigating the addition of olefinic acids and esters towards hypochlorous acid and ethyl hypochlorite, isolated, identified and estimated the relative amounts of the isomeric chlorohydrins formed in this reaction. At about the same time, Shilov and collaborators began an investigation of the kinetics of the reactions involving the addition of hypochlorous acid to olefinic compounds and during the past eighteen years, a series of papers from this source have been published Ca- 30. It is unfortunate that these investigators should have studied the catalytic effect of added chloride ion, usually from hydrochloric acid, in the majority of their reaction systems as the intervention of molecular chlorine formed in this way would seriously interfere with the true nature of hypochlorous acid additions. The results of early work by Shilov et al. (14) on the addition to ethene, indicated that the addition of chlorine to the double bond was about 100, 000 times greater than that of hypochlorous acid, yet it was only in later papers (10. - 22) that this complicating factor seemed to be fully appreciated. However, during their early work they concluded that the addition reaction was a complex one and could not be described by a simple bimolecular or termolecular process. It seemed, therefore, that a detailed investigation of the kinetics of chlorohydrin formation was desirable and would prove a profitable and useful subject for research...|$|R

Current industrial production of <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> through petrochemical route has several drawbacks: i) non-renewable, as it is derived from petroleum resource, ii) involves numerous complicated steps, and iii) produces low yield. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for production of bio-based <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> by direct pyrolysis of bacterial poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) inclusion {{as an alternative to}} the petrochemical route. Thermogravimetric profile of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) inclusions showed poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) degradation occurred at a temperature range of 270 °C– 350 °C with maximum degradation rate at 310 °C. Analysis of products from isothermal pyrolysis of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) at 310 °C revealed that pyrolysis of poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) inclusions yielded approximately 63 % of <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid.</b> This is 30 % higher than the conventional <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> production via petrochemical method. The proposed method also offers other benefits such as renewable and simpler in processing. Besides, by-products of fermentation and pyrolysis are easy to treat, thus minimizing threat to the environment. Moreover, demands for bio-based products are expected to rise in the near future because of social, environmental and economical issues related to fossil resources which make bio-based production method more appealing and favourable.

40|$|Superior {{plasticization}} efficiency {{was achieved}} by a grafting from functionalization of the PVC backbone. This was deduced to a synergistic effect of internal plasticization and improved intermolecular interactions between PVC and an oligomeric poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) plasticizer. A mild grafting process for functionalization of the PVC chain by <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> (CA) or acrylic acid (AA) was used. The formation of PVC-g-CA and PVC-g-AA was confirmed by FTIR and 1 H NMR. Grafting with the seemingly similar monomers, CA and AA, resulted in different macromolecular structures. AA is easily homopolymerized and long hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) grafts are formed resulting in branched materials. <b>Crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> does not easily homopolymerize; instead, single <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> units are located along the PVC chain, leading to basically linear PVC chains with pendant <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> groups. The elongation of PVC-g-CA and PVC-g-AA in comparison to pure PVC were greatly increased from 6 % to 128 % and 167 %, respectively, by the grafting reactions.

The reaction of <b>crotonic</b> <b>acid</b> with chlorine was carried out in water saturated with sodium chloride, in nitromethane, and in chloroform. In the first of these three solvents the products appeared to be entirely those which would he expected if the reaction proceeded through a two-stage mechanism in which the first stage involved electrophilic attach by a chlorine molecule on the alpha-carbon atom, followed by reaction of the carbonium ion so formed with any nucleophile present in the solution. In nitromethane the products were more unexpected, and appeared to consist largely of alpha-chloro-beta-hydroxybutyric acid, even when the reaction was carried out in dry solvent. A mechanism involving the intermediate formation of a lactone ring is suggested for this reaction. The chlorination which was carried out in chloroform produced, apart from ab-dichlorobutyric acid, a product which has not yet been identified conclusively, hut which, at the moment, appears to he a-chlorovinylacetic acid.
