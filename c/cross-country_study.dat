However, the correlation between attractive facial features and health has been questioned. Sociocultural factors, such as self-perceived attractiveness, status in a relationship and degree of gender-conformity, have been reported {{to play a role in}} female preferences for male faces. Studies have found that women who perceive themselves as physically attractive are more likely to choose men with masculine facial dimorphism, than are women who perceive themselves as physically unattractive. In men, facial masculinity significantly correlates with facial symmetry—it has been suggested that both are signals of developmental stability and genetic health. One study called into question the importance of facial masculinity in physical attractiveness in men arguing that when perceived health, which is factored into facial masculinity, is discounted it makes little difference in physical attractiveness. In a <b>cross-country</b> <b>study</b> involving 4,794 women in their early twenties, a difference was found in women's average [...] "masculinity preference" [...] between countries.|$|E

Pagés and Stampini (2009) is another <b>cross-country</b> <b>study</b> involving three Latin American and three transition economies that assesses labor market segmentation across formal and informal salaried jobs and self-employment.

40|$|Research on {{entrepreneurship}} {{has received}} an increased amount {{of interest in}} recent years, with self-employment being used as the most common proxy for “entrepreneurship” in empirical studies. However, there are various ways of defining selfemployment, making it a somewhat dubious proxy. This may flaw the analysis, especially in <b>cross-country</b> <b>studies,</b> since the documentation of data often is insufficient and difficult to access due to language barriers. We present an analysis of Swedish self-employment data. We show that the measurement of self-employment has changed over time to noticeably affect the reported number of self-employed in the two major statistical sources on self-employment. The reported development of self-employment sometimes differs diametrically depending on source.
