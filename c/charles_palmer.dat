5|$|The Sunderland Echo is {{an evening}} {{newspaper}} serving the Sunderland, South Tyneside and East Durham areas of North East England. The newspaper {{was founded by}} Samuel Storey, Edward Backhouse, Edward Temperley Gourley, <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> Richard Ruddock, Thomas Glaholm and Thomas Scott Turnbull in 1873, as the Sunderland Daily Echo and Shipping Gazette. Designed to provide a platform for the Radical views held by Storey and his partners, it was also Sunderland's first local daily paper.|$|E
5|$|The pitch was slow, and {{the weather}} was cold and showery for the {{traditional}} tour opener against Worcestershire. Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than ₤4000. The hosts elected to bat, and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137/1 after 133 minutes. However, the dismissal of <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> who top-scored with 85, precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233. Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets, with Johnson taking 3/52. In their sole innings, Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris (138) and Bradman (107). This took them to 265/1, before they declared at 462/8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time. Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6/135 for the locals. In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs, with 70 minutes to spare. McCool took 4/29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets.|$|E

25|$|Leicestershire's first 70 {{years were}} largely spent in lower table mediocrity, with few notable exceptions. In 1953, the {{motivation}} of secretary-captain <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> lifted the side fleetingly to third place, {{but most of the}} rest of the 1950s was spent propping up the table, or thereabouts.|$|E
25|$|Eight {{years later}} another unit was formed at Jarrow on the {{opposite}} (County Durham) bank of the River Tyne. The 1st Durham EV was raised and commanded by <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> (1822–1907), founder of Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and later the first mayor and Member of Parliament for Jarrow. The 1st Durham initially comprised six companies and Palmer was commissioned as Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant.|$|E
25|$|The Sunderland Echo was {{launched}} {{with an initial}} investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were: Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, shipbroker and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Only Ruddock, however, had any knowledge of newspapers and the money was quickly used up.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Thomas W. Meachem, son of the founder of New Process Gear Company, Thomas G.

25|$|Symington's {{departure}} from Leicestershire {{appears to have}} been abrupt. He captained the side in the match against Lancashire at Blackpool, but that was his last appearance for the team. The former Oxford University and Glamorgan all-rounder Gwynn Evans, now a schoolmaster in Leicestershire, took over as captain for the remaining six matches of the 1949 season. For 1950, Leicestershire recruited the former Worcestershire amateur <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> as both secretary and captain. Symington did not play first-class cricket again.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, at Eastbourne against Worcestershire {{he scored}} 89 in 44 minutes. He {{was caught by}} <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> at deep extra cover off a hit that, like the one against Yorkshire in 1938, would have gone for six had he missed it. At {{the end of the}} season, he played in what was to be Hedley Verity's last match before he died in the Second World War. On a drying wicket Verity took 7 for 9, Bartlett being one of the victims.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 the Newcastle {{company was}} united {{with the larger}} (8 companies) 1st Durham EV at Jarrow on the {{opposite}} (County Durham) bank of the River Tyne. This unit had been raised and commanded by <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> (1822–1907), founder of Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and later the first mayor and Member of Parliament for Jarrow. The two units were formed into the 1st Durham Administrative Battalion EV, consolidated in 1880 as the 1st Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham EV, with Palmer as commanding officer and an establishment of 1300 men.|$|E

Both the 1st Newcastle RE (V) and the Tyne Submarine Miners derived their seniority from the original 1st Newcastle EV established in 1860.|$|E
25|$|Diment was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman who {{was recruited}} by Leicestershire in 1955 as assistant secretary to the secretary/captain, <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> {{and was therefore}} allowed to play as an amateur. He played in 59 first-class games for the county {{over the next four}} seasons, being a fairly regular member of the side in both 1957 and 1958. But although he passed 50 in six innings, his career batting average was only 16 and his highest first-class score was just 71, made in his first match for Leicestershire, against Derbyshire in 1955. He had earlier played a single match for his native Gloucestershire in 1952, without success.|$|E
25|$|Palmer, by now created Sir <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> 1st Baronet of Grinkle Park, {{retired from}} the unit in 1888 with the rank of Colonel. The same year, the 1st Newcastle & Durham was split into three {{separate}} units: the 1st Newcastle RE (Volunteers), the 1st Durham RE (V), and the Tyne Division RE (V), Submarine Miners, with Palmer as Honorary Commandant of both the latter units. The Tyne Submarine Miners consisted of three companies {{and a number of}} working boats, and was based at Clifford's Fort, North Shields. Both the 1st Newcastle RE and the Tyne Submarine Miners derived their seniority from the original 1st Newcastle EV established in 1860.|$|E

25|$|There {{was also}} {{a great deal of}} {{discussion}} about the legality of the mutual housing program. This discussion was sparked by <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> the Defense Housing Coordinator, during 1941, although there was never any clear statement of an actual legal problem related to the mutual housing program. On a number of occasions the Legal Counsel of the FWA and Westbrook were asked to defend the legality of the program. They announced that they could not find any violation of the law. But the question itself, posed by the Defense Housing Coordinator, created a number of doubts among influential individuals who could have protected and encouraged the program, rather than watch it be dismantled.|$|E
25|$|An {{adaptation}} for the ITV {{television series}} Agatha Christie's Poirot, with David Suchet as Poirot, was produced for the show's twelfth season, aired in the UK in 2010. Guest stars include Tom Burke as Lieutenant Colin Race, Jaime Winstone as Sheila Webb, Lesley Sharp as Miss Martindale, and Anna Massey as Miss Pebmarsh; this was Massey's last performance, before her death, and the ITV {{broadcast of the}} episode is dedicated to her memory. <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> (who also directed Hallowe'en Party for the series) directs this instalment, with the screenplay being written by Stewart Harcourt (who also wrote the screenplay for Murder on the Orient Express). The adaptation was filmed on location in Dover, Dover Castle and St Margaret's Bay.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{emigration}} of Sandy Singleton to Rhodesia {{after the}} 1946 season, Allan White succeeded him as Worcestershire captain. The team lacked batting strength and did well {{to improve their}} championship position. The outstanding player was Test all-rounder Dick Howorth who was, as in 1946, {{the first player to}} complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. Howorth was a slow left arm spinner and formed a successful partnership with Peter Jackson who bowled mostly off breaks. Howorth took 164 wickets in all matches and Jackson 125. Future England player Roly Jenkins made a telling contribution (67 wickets) with his leg breaks and googlies while paceman Reg Perks took 123 wickets in all matches. The success of the bowlers owed much to keeper Hugo Yarnold who claimed the most victims in the championship. Howorth, Jenkins, Eddie Cooper and, in his first full season, Don Kenyon all exceeded 1,000 runs. Worcestershire's best known batsmen at the time were <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer</b> and the veteran Bob Wyatt and they were the first two in the county averages but neither played a full season. Laddie Outschoorn qualified for the championship {{for the first time and}} showed promise. Other players included Ronald Bird, Fred Cooper (brother of Eddie), Norman Whiting and Martin Young.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} winter of 195354, Hutton led M.C.C. on a controversial tour of West Indies, {{becoming the first}} professional captain of England on a tour in the twentieth century. His appointment as captain had been queried at home by those who believed that a professional might captain at home but would be unsuitable to lead a tour. Hutton also encountered problems as the touring party was being selected. Usually, M.C.C. tours had experienced managers; Hutton had expressed a preference for Billy Griffith, the assistant secretary to the M.C.C. who had toured West Indies as a player in 194748. The M.C.C. decided that Griffith could not be spared from his duties. Instead, they appointed <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> the captain of Leicestershire, as a player-manager, despite his inexperience in the role as manager and playerhe had not played Test cricket at the time. This appointment caused authority on the tour to become muddled as Palmer was tour manager {{for most of the}} time, with authority over the captain, but a player {{for the rest of the}} time, under the captain's orders. Nor did Palmer have the experience nor temperament for such a difficult position, according to Alan Gibson, while E. W. Swanton described the appointment of Palmer by the M.C.C. as one of the worst it ever made. Hutton also struggled to lead some of the senior professionals on the tour, feeling uncomfortable giving orders to fellow professionals, particularly as some, such as Godfrey Evans, were unco-operative at first, and he found Trueman difficult to handle.|$|E
500|$|The {{shipyard}} generated high {{employment to}} Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. Ellen Wilkinson, the town's historian {{and member of}} parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: [...] "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, {{and if you go}} there for an hour or two, reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, Sir <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> [...] "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".|$|E
500|$|The Sunderland Echo was {{launched}} {{with an initial}} investment of £3,500, raised by donations of £500 each from Storey and his business partners. Those joining the venture were Quaker banker Edward Backhouse, shipbroker and MP Edward Temperley Gourley, shipbuilder and MP Sir <b>Charles</b> <b>Palmer,</b> newspaper editor Richard Ruddock, rope-maker Thomas Glaholm and draper Thomas Scott Turnbull. Lack of experience—only Ruddock had previous knowledge of newspaper management—and over-optimistic estimates of costs meant that the initial funds were quickly exhausted. Storey later admitted: [...] "In our childlike, simple ways, we thought this might be sufficient, but {{in a few months}} all the money was gone, so we paid in another £3,500 and that soon went too." [...] As the prospect of any great financial success receded, Ruddock, Gourley and Palmer withdrew from the project. Storey, however, remained dedicated to the idea, and took on their shares. A further £7,000 in investment from Storey enabled the remaining partners to abandon the [...] "wheezing flat-bed press" [...] and, in July 1876, the Echo moved to new premises at 14Bridge Street, Sunderland.|$|E
