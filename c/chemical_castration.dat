5000|$|He rose to notoriety for {{his work}} on an aversion therapy medical program which {{attempted}} to cure gay men and lesbian women of homosexuality. Between 1971 and 1989, many victims were submitted to <b>chemical</b> <b>castrations</b> and electric shock treatment, meant to cure them of their homosexual “condition.” As many as 900 homosexuals, mostly 16-24 years old who had been drafted and had not voluntarily joined the military, were subjected to forced “sexual reassignment” surgeries. Men were surgically turned into women against their will, then cast out into the world, the gender reassignment often incomplete, and without the means to pay for expensive hormones to maintain their new sexual identities. After the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) heard testimony regarding the controversial nature of The Aversion Project Levin ran while in the SADF, details of which were published in 1999. Though Levin was not named in the TRC report, it did appear elsewhere, including in a 2001 published a paper called [...] "The Aversion Project: Psychiatric Abuses in the South African Defence Force During the Apartheid Era".|$|R

25|$|In reality, {{the nature}} of Turing's death {{is a matter of}} {{considerable}} debate. The <b>chemical</b> <b>castration</b> period ended fourteen months before his death. The official inquest into his death ruled that he had committed suicide by consuming a cyanide-laced apple. Turing biographer Andrew Hodges believes the death was indeed a suicide, re-enacting the poisoned apple from Snow White, Turing's favourite fairy tale, with some deliberate ambiguity included to permit Turing's mother to interpret it as an accident. However, Jack Copeland, an editor of volumes of Turing's work and Director of the Turing Archive for the History of Computing, has suggested that Turing's death may have been accidental, caused by the cyanide fumes produced by an experiment in his spare room, and that the investigation was poorly conducted.|$|E

40|$|To assess total {{testosterone}} and prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics among diverse <b>chemical</b> <b>castrations,</b> advanced-stage {{prostate cancer}} patients were randomized {{into three groups}} of 20 : Group 1, Leuprolide 3. 75 mg; Group 2, Leuprolide 7. 5 mg; and Group 3, Goserelin 3. 6 mg. All groups were treated with monthly application of the respective drugs. The patients' levels of serum total testosterone and PSA were evaluated at two time periods: before the treatment and 3 months after the treatment. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was utilized to verify the hypothesis of linear correlation between total testosterone and PSA levels. At the beginning the patients' age, stage, grade, PSA, and total testosterone were similar within the three groups, with median age 72, 70, and 70 years in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Three months after the treatment, patients who received Leuprolide 7. 5 mg presented significantly lower median total testosterone levels compared with Goserelin 3. 6 mg and Leuprolide 3. 75 mg (9. 5 ng/dL vs. 20. 0 ng/dL vs. 30. 0 ng/dL, respectively; p =. 0072), while those who received Goserelin 3. 6 mg presented significantly lower PSA levels compared with Leuprolide 7. 5 mg and Leuprolide 3. 75 mg (0. 67 vs. 1. 86 vs. 2. 57, respectively; p =. 0067). There was no linear correlation between total testosterone and PSA levels. Overall, regarding castration levels of total testosterone, 28. 77 % of patients did not obtain levels 50 ng/dL and 47. 80 % did not obtain levels 20 ng/dL. There was no correlation between total testosterone and PSA kinetics and no equivalence among different pharmacological castrations...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the police {{actively}} enforced laws prohibiting sexual behaviour between men. By {{the end of}} 1954, there were 1,069 gay men in prison in England and Wales, {{with an average age}} of 37. There were a number of high-profile arrests and trials, including that of scientist, mathematician, and war-time code-breaker Alan Turing, convicted in 1952 of [...] "gross indecency". He accepted treatment with female hormones (<b>chemical</b> <b>castration)</b> as an alternative to prison. Turing committed suicide in 1954. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in response to a petition, issued an apology on behalf of the British government in 2009 for [...] "the appalling way he was treated". In 1953, the trial and eventual imprisonment of Edward Montagu (the 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu), Michael Pitt-Rivers and Peter Wildeblood for committing acts of [...] "homosexual indecency" [...] caused uproar and led to the establishment of a committee to examine and report on the law covering [...] "homosexual offences" [...] appointed by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe and Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth.|$|E

40|$|SummaryGrowth of {{prostate}} cancer cells is dependent upon androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen, is usually synthesized in the prostate from testosterone secreted by the testis. Following <b>chemical</b> or surgical <b>castration,</b> prostate cancers usually shrink owing to testosterone deprivation. However, tumors often recur, forming castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses a gain-of-stability mutation {{that leads to a}} gain-of-function in 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (3 βHSD 1), which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in conversion of the adrenal-derived steroid dehydroepiandrosterone to DHT. The mutation (N 367 T) does not affect catalytic function, but it renders the enzyme resistant to ubiquitination and degradation, leading to profound accumulation. Whereas dehydroepiandrosterone conversion to DHT is usually very limited, expression of 367 T accelerates this conversion and provides the DHT necessary to activate the AR. We suggest that 3 βHSD 1 is a valid target for the treatment of CRPC...|$|R
