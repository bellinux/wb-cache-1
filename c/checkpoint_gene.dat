50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} is highly {{similar to the}} gene product of Schizosaccharomyces pombe rad17, a cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>gene</b> {{required}} for cell cycle arrest and DNA damage repair in response to DNA damage. This protein shares strong similarity with DNA replication factor C (RFC), and can form a complex with RFCs. This protein binds to chromatin prior to DNA damage and is phosphorylated by ATR after the damage. This protein recruits the RAD1-RAD9-HUS1 checkpoint protein complex onto chromatin after DNA damage, which may be required for its phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of this protein {{is required for the}} DNA-damage-induced cell cycle G2 arrest, and is thought to be a critical early event during checkpoint signaling in DNA-damaged cells. Eight alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene, which encode four distinct proteins, have been reported.|$|E

We used synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis using spindle assembly checkpoint mutants mad 1, mad 2, mad 3, and bub 3. We found 228 synthetic interactions with the four spindle assembly checkpoint mutants with substantial overlap in the spectrum of interactions between mad 1, mad 2, and bub 3. In contrast, there were many synthetic interactions that were common to mad 1, mad 2, and bub 3 that were not shared by mad 3.

Here, we sought to identify the attractive mitotic spindle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> appropriate for human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapies. Through expression profile analysis of 137 selected mitotic spindle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> in the publicly available microarray datasets, we showed that 13 genes were dramatically up-regulated in HCC tissues compared to normal livers and adjacent non-tumor tissues. A role of the 13 genes in proliferation was evaluated by knocking them down via small interfering RNA (siRNA) in HCC cells. As a result, several mitotic spindle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> were required for maintaining the proliferation of HCC cells, demonstrated by cell viability assay and soft agar colony formation assay.

More importantly, TTK was observably up-regulated in 46 (86. 8 %) of 53 HCC specimens.

However, here we show that CIN cells do undergo mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage. Although the maximum mitotic index achieved by CIN lines is diminished relative to MIN lines, CIN cells clearly have a robust spindle checkpoint.

40|$|A semipermissive growth {{condition}} was defined for a Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain carrying a thermosensitive allele of DNA polymerase delta (pol delta ts 03). Under this condition, DNA polymerase delta is semidisabled and causes {{a delay in}} S-phase progression. Using a genetic strategy, we have isolated a panel of mutants that enter premature mitosis when DNA replication is incomplete but which are not defective for arrest in G 2 /M following DNA damage. We characterized the aya 14 mutant, which enters premature mitosis when S phase is arrested by genetic or chemical means. However, this mutant is sensitive to neither UV nor gamma irradiation. Two genomic clones, rad 26 + and cds 1 +, were found to suppress the hydroxyurea sensitivity of the aya 14 mutant. Genetic analysis indicates that aya 14 is a novel allele of the cell cycle <b>checkpoint</b> <b>gene</b> rad 26 +, which we have named rad 26. a 14. cds 1 + is a suppressor which suppresses the S-phase feedback control defect of rad 26. a 14 when S phase is inhibited by either hydroxyurea or cdc 22, {{but it does not}} suppress the defect when S phase is arrested by a mutant DNA polymerase. Analyses of rad 26. a 14 in a variety of cdc mutant backgrounds indicate that strains containing rad 26. a 14 bypass S-phase arrest but not G 1 or late S/G 2 arrest.

40|$|Eukaryotic DNA-damage <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been}} shown to not only arrest cells at certain stages, but are also {{involved}} in the transcriptional response to DNA damage. However, while the signal transduction for cell-cycle checkpoint is well characterized, {{it is not clear whether}} the same signal transduction pathway is responsible for the regulation of all DNA damage-inducible genes. In order to understand how different <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> are involved in gene regulation, the effects of various checkpoint mutations on the expression of a unique yeast MAG 1 - DDI 1 dual promoter were examined in this study. MAG 1 and DDI 1 are transcribed from a common promoter region and co-induced by a variety of DNA damaging agents. However, gene-specific cis -acting elements were also identified, and the two genes are indeed differentially expressed under certain conditions. We found that DDI 1 induction was not affected in any of the checkpoint mutants. In contrast, MAG 1 induction was completely abolished in the pol 2 and rad 53 mutants. However, in the mec 1 - 1 or any of the G 1 /S and G 2 /M checkpoint mutants, including rad 9, rad 17 and rad 24, DNA damage-induced MAG 1 expression was not significantly affected, and a rad 9 rad 17 double mutation only slightly reduced MAG 1 induction.

40|$|Mitotic {{chromosomal}} instability (CIN) plays {{important roles}} in tumor progression, but what causes CIN is incompletely understood. In general, tumor CIN arises from abnormal mitosis, which is caused by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors.

We investigate if glucose deprivation and lactic acidosis – two tumor microenvironmental factors – could induce cancer cell CIN. We show that glucose deprivation with lactic acidosis significantly increases CIN in 4 T 1, MCF- 7 and HCT 116 scored by micronuclei, or aneuploidy, or abnormal mitosis, potentially via damaging DNA, up-regulating mitotic <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes,</b> and/or amplifying centrosome.

Miles and T. Formosa, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 : 1276 - 1280, 1992). We have now used genetic methods to characterize the gene encoding one of these DNA polymerase alpha-binding proteins (POB 1) {{to determine whether it}} plays a role in DNA replication in vivo. We find that yeast cells lacking POB 1 are viable but display a constellation of phenotypes indicating defective DNA metabolism. Populations of cells lacking POB 1 accumulate abnormally high numbers of enlarged large-budded cells with a single nucleus at the neck of the bud. The average DNA content in a population of cells lacking POB 1 is shifted toward the G 2 value. These two phenotypes indicate that while the bulk of DNA replication is completed without POB 1, mitosis is delayed. Deleting POB 1 also causes elevated levels of both chromosome loss and genetic recombination, enhances the temperature sensitivity of cells with mutant DNA polymerase alpha genes, causes increased sensitivity to UV radiation in cells lacking a functional RAD 9 <b>checkpoint</b> <b>gene,</b> and causes an increased probability of death in cells carrying a mutation in the MEC 1 <b>checkpoint</b> <b>gene.</b> The sequence of the POB 1 gene indicates that it is identical to the CTF 4 (CHL 15) gene identified previously in screens for mutations that diminish the fidelity of chromosome transmission. These phenotypes are consistent with defective DNA metabolism in cells lacking POB 1 and strongly suggest that this DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein plays a role in accurately duplicating the genome in vivo...|$|E

The length of the spindle at the delay point (3 – 4 �m) is not dependent on the physical distance between the two centromeres, indicating that the arrest represents surveillance of a dicentric induced aberration.

Some {{components of}} the yeast Ccr 4 -Not complex, which regulates transcription as well as transcript turnover, have previously been linked to DNA damage responses, but it is unclear if this involves transcriptional or post-transcriptional functions.

The exonuclease-inactivating ccr 4 - 1 point mutation mimics ccr 4 Δ phenotypes, including synthetic HU hypersensitivity with dun 1 Δ, demonstrating that Ccr 4 -Not mRNA deadenylase activity is required for DNA damage responses. However, ccr 4 Δ and caf 1 Δ DNA damage phenotypes and genetic interactions with <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> are not identical, and deletions of some Not components that are believed to predominantly function {{at the transcriptional level}} rather than mRNA turnover, e. g., not 5 Δ, also lead to increased DNA damage sensitivity and synthetic HU hypersensitivity with dun 1 Δ.

By conducting a screen for <b>checkpoint</b> <b>genes</b> in zebrafish, {{we found that}} dtl/cdt 2 is {{an essential component of}} the early, radiation-induced G 2 /M checkpoint. We subsequently found that dtl/cdt 2 is required for normal cell cycle control, primarily to prevent rereplication. Both the checkpoint and replication roles are conserved in human DTL. Our data indicate that the rereplication reflects a requirement for DTL in regulating CDT 1, a protein required for prereplication complex formation. CDT 1 is degraded in S phase to prevent rereplication, and following DNA damage to prevent origin firing. We show that DTL associates with the CUL 4 -DDB 1 E 3 ubiquitin ligase and is required for CDT 1 down-regulation in unperturbed cells and following DNA damage. The cell cycle defects of Dtl-deficient zebrafish are suppressed by reducing Cdt 1 levels. In contrast, the early G 2 /M checkpoint defect appears to be Cdt 1 -independent. Thus, DTL promotes genomic stability through two distinct mechanisms. First, it is an essential component of the CUL 4 -DDB 1 complex that controls CDT 1 levels, thereby preventing rereplication.
