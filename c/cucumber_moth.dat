50|$|Diaphania indica, the <b>cucumber</b> <b>moth</b> or cotton caterpillar, is a {{widespread}} but mainly Old World moth species. It belongs to the grass moth family, and therein to the large subfamily Spilomelinae. This moth occurs in many tropical and subtropical regions outside the Americas, though it is native to southern Asia; it is occasionally a significant pest of cucurbits and some other plants.|$|E
50|$|In 1859, the <b>cucumber</b> <b>moth</b> {{was moved}} to genus Phakellura by Francis Walker, and to Glyphodes by Edward Meyrick in 1895. It was placed in Margaronia by Fletcher in 1917, and by {{subsequent}} authors variously assigned it to Diaphania and Glyphodes, at that time incorrectly believed to be subgenera of Margaronia. Finally, in 1931 Hudson, recognizing that Saunders and Walker were quite correct in their original assessments, but that Eudioptis and Phakellura were junior synonyms of Diaphania, placed the moth in its current genus. Shin et al. in 1983 sided with Fletcher and proposed to move the species to Palpita (the senior synonym of Margaronia), but subsequent authors have generally preferred Hudson's treatment.|$|E
5000|$|Despite its {{characteristic}} appearance, the <b>cucumber</b> <b>moth</b> was anew described {{times and}} again, {{leading to a}} number of junior synonyms. Achille Guenée described the species three times alone [...] - [...] two times of which on the very same page of the Histoire naturelle des Insectes [...] - , using specimens from far-flung regions he believed to represent different taxa: from Java (for P. gazorialis), Réunion (for his Phakellura curcubitalis), and (presumably) the Levant (for P. zygaenalis). Actually, the moth's populations at the latter two locations, as well as the specimens from Limpopo and Orange Rivers from which Philipp Christoph Zeller described his Eudioptis capensis, seem to have been merely introduced there as pests in ships' stores.|$|E
50|$|From {{its closest}} relatives, the <b>cucumber</b> <b>moth</b> is most {{reliably}} distinguished by microscopic {{examination of the}} genitals. In the male, the clasper's harpe is {{twice as long as}} it is wide, with costa and sacculus running almost in parallel and being strongly sclerotized, and a rounded cucullus. From the center of the harpe, which is otherwise only weakly sclerotized, a thin spine extends. The uncus is covered in bristles and ends in a small tube; it is a bit longer than the tegumen which in turn is about as wide as it is long. The vinculum is almost quadratic, and the anellus forms a small triangular plate which is more strongly sclerotized. The aedeagus is almost straight, strongly sclerotized below, and has a flattened curved process at end.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of insecticides in controlling Helicoverpa spp., predominantly H. armigera (Hubner), on capsicum and zucchini was tested in small plot trials. Indoxacarb, methoxyfenozide, spinosad, emamectin benzoate and novaluron provided control, {{as measured by}} the percentage of damaged fruit, equal to or better than standard treatments of methomyl or methomyl alternated with methamidophos on capsicum. The Helicoverpa nucleopolyhedrovirus gave control equivalent to the standard treatment, as did Bacillus thuringiensis aizawai, but B. thuringiensis kurstaki was ineffective. Helicoverpa armigera larvae were present in zucchini flowers but did little damage to the fruit. None of the insecticides significantly reduced the percentage of damaged zucchini fruit compared with the untreated control. Bifenthrin, spinosad, emamectin benzoate and methoxyfenozide were effective in controlling larvae in flowers, while methomyl, B. thuringiensis aizawai, B. thuringiensis kurstaki and novaluron were not effective. Data indicated that all the insecticides effectively controlled larvae of Diaphania indica (Saunders), <b>cucumber</b> <b>moth,</b> in the zucchini flowers. There has been a limited range of insecticides available to manage Helicoverpa spp. in these vegetable crops, but these trials demonstrate the effectiveness of a number of newer insecticides that could be used and that would be compatible with integrated pest management programs in the crops...|$|E
