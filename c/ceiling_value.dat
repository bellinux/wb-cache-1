Wilson and colleagues determined that the Schipper values were close approximations to the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. By comparing Schipper's values to the newly calculated binomial values, they also found that Lawshe and Schipper had erroneously labeled their published table as representing a one-tailed test when in fact the values mirrored the binomial values for a two-tailed test.

40|$|Abstract—We {{have been}} proposing {{the concept of}} “i-Energy ” as a new energy {{management}} scheme to realize efficient and versatile control of e-power flows among decentralized energy generation/storage devices and appliances in homes, offices, and neighboring communities. The i-Energy concept is best characterized by a novel energy control method named “Energy on Demand (EoD). ” The novelties of EoD rest in (1) the explicit demand-based power supply control, (2) the best-effort power distribution based on appliance priorities, and (3) the ceiling control of power consumption. With EoD, people can attain the guaranteed reduction of energy consumption without damaging their quality of lives. Moreover, when utility companies are allowed to set and modify <b>ceiling</b> <b>values</b> based on contracts with consumers, EoD systems work as smart demand response systems.

Nevertheless, some epidemiological studies have associated adverse health effects to a chemical exposure with an inadequate or absent exposure quantification. In addition to the metric used, the truly representation of exposure by measurements depends on: the strategy of sampling, random collection of measurements, and similarity between the measured and unmeasured exposure groups. Two environmental monitoring methodologies for formaldehyde occupational exposure were used to assess the influence of metric selection in exposure assessment and, consequently, in risk assessment process.

40|$|In a {{deregulated}} {{power market}} financial transmission rights (FTR) {{serve as a}} mechanism for protecting market participants from price variation resulting from network congestion. Possession of FTRs allows participants to recover congestion related losses resulting from unequal locational marginal prices that arise from out of merit dispatch. There exists different strategies for allocating FTR which are in use in the deregulated market. Designing a comprehensive framework for market specific FTR allocation that includes factors like unbalanced FTR, FTR for losses and AC-OPF is currently a major research issue in the deregulated power industry. This thesis develops a method for allocation of financial transmission rights that maximizes revenue while satisfying the system security constraints of alternating current (AC) networks and the revenue adequacy constraint of the financial market. Both the maximization of the FTR revenue and maintaining the constraints are accomplished through solving {{a modified version of}} the optimal power flow program. The methodology developed here considers allocation of both balanced and unbalanced point to point FTR obligations. The design of the framework is centered around three main scenarios that arise in the allocation of FTR. In the first scenario the total FTR bid quantity is much less than the total generation quantity available in the network. To maximize revenue the ISO will allocate the entire quantity and needs to only determine the loss quantity associated with the FTR quantity. In the second scenario the total FTR bid quantity is much greater than the total generation quantity available in the network. The ISO is required to determine the maximum allocatable FTR bid per bus in the network for the given generation limit in the network. A novel adaptation of the OPF program that maximizes the total FTR quantity allocated is run in this case to determine the maximum allocatable bid quantities. The third scenario is when the total FTR bid quantity is less than the total generation quantity available in the network but when the losses stipulated by the FTR quantity are added to the bid quantity the total generation capacity is exceeded. Here the novel adaptation of the OPF program is run to determine the maximum allocatable FTR bid quantity per bus (<b>ceiling</b> <b>values).</b> The original FTR bid quantities are then allocated upto the <b>ceiling</b> <b>values</b> determined.

WEALs are defined here as the concentration in air that area monitors should alarm at to pro-vide adequate warning and be sufficiently protective of health to allow at least enough time to don respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and escape. The rationale for the approach is an-alysed, and ways of defining suitable substance group guidance values (GVs) for input into the RCP are considered and compared.

Near the Planck scale, the Planck charges, Planck currents, or Planck parameters can be defined and assigned to physical quantities such as the single particle electric charge and magnetic charge as the <b>ceiling</b> <b>value</b> obeyed by the low energy ordinary physics. The Dirac electric-magnetic charge quantization relation as one form of electric-magnetic duality dictates that, the present low value electric charge corresponds to a huge magnetic charge value already passed the Planck limit so as to render theories of magnetic monopoles into the strong coupling regime, and vice versa, that small and tractable magnetic charge values correspond to huge electric charge values. It suggests that for theoretic models in which the renormalization group equation provides rapid growth for the running electric coupling constant, {{it is easier for}} the dual magnetic monopoles to emerge at lower energy scales. Allowing charges to vary with the Dirac electric-magnetic charge quantization relation while keeping values under the Planck limit informs that the magnetic charge value drops below the Planck <b>ceiling</b> <b>value</b> into the manageable region when the electric coupling constant grows to one fourth at a model dependent energy scale, and continues dropping towards half the value of the Planck magnetic charge as the electric coupling constant continues growing at the model dependent rate towards one near Planck energy scale...|$|E

We provide a new algorithm based on a hierarchical structure called dendrogram, which offers the significant advantage that it can be used for multiple flooding with various scenarios of the <b>ceiling</b> <b>values.</b> In addition, when exploring the graph through its dendrogram structure in order to calculate the flooding levels, independent sub-dendrograms are generated, thus offering a natural way for parallel processing. We provide an efficient im- plementation of our algorithm through suitable data structures and optimal organisation of the computations. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms well established classical algorithms, and reveal that the cost of building the dendrogram highly predominates over the total running time, thus validating both the efficiency and the hallmark of our method. Moreover, we exploit the potential parallelism exposed by the flooding procedure to design a multi-thread implementation. As the underlying parallelism is created on the fly, we use a queue to store the list of the sub-dendrograms to be explored, and then use a cyclic distribution to assign them to the participating threads. This yields a load balanced and scalable process as shown by additional benchmark results.

Many authors have suggested that SusMR of various wild animal species {{are only a few}} times resting (basal or standard) metabolic rates (RMR). We test this conclusion by analyzing all 37 species (humans, 31 other endothermic vertebrates, and 5 ectothermic vertebrates) for which SusMR and RMR had both been measured. For all species, the ratio of SusMR to RMR, which we term sustained metabolic scope, is less than 7; most values fall between 1. 5 and 5. Some of these values, such as those for Tour de France cyclists and breeding birds, are surely close to sustainable metabolic ceilings for the species studied. That is, metabolic rates higher than 7 times RMR apparently cannot be sustained indefinitely. These observations pose several questions: whether the proximate physiological causes of metabolic ceilings reside in the digestive tract's ability to process food or in each tissue's metabolic capacity; whether <b>ceiling</b> <b>values</b> are independent of the mode of energy expenditure; whether ceilings are set by single limiting physiological capacities or by coadjusted clusters of capacities (symmorphosis); what the ultimate evolutionary causes of metabolic ceilings are; and how metabolic ceilings may limit animals' reproductive effort, foraging behavior, and geographic distribution...|$|R

Furthermore, we aimed to {{examine the impact of}} common adolescent illness and health concerns on their health and well-being. Methods: A stratified, two-stage, random cluster sampling design was used to obtain a cross-sectional sample of subjects through schools. A written questionnaire included the 80 -item 12 -scale self-report CHQ and items measuring health concerns, illnesses/health conditions, and sociodemographics. Results: A total of 2361 adolescents participated (response rate of 70 %). Reliability was high: Tests of internal consistency and discriminant validity reported 90 % of item-scale correlations >. 4; all scales had Cronbach alpha coefficients >. 7. Adolescents with illnesses/conditions or health concerns reported lower scores and larger differences for content-related scales, supporting content and construct validity. Statistically significant age and gender trends were observed for Mental Health, Self-Esteem, General Health, and Family Cohesion scales.

Between 3 % and 8 % of women are reported to meet criteria for the more severe form of PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Although PMDD has received increased attention in recent years, the cost effectiveness of treatments for PMDD remains unknown. Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US FDA-approved indication for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE). Abstract: Methods: A decision-analytic model {{was used to evaluate}} both direct costs (medication and physician visits) and clinical outcomes (treatment success, failure and discontinuation). Medication costs were based on average wholesale prices of branded products; physician visit costs were obtained from a claims database study of PMDD patients and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Clinical outcome probabilities were derived from published clinical trials in PMDD. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using the difference in costs and percentage of successfully treated patients at 6 months. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used {{to assess the impact of}} uncertainty in parameter estimates. Threshold values where a change in the cost-effective strategy occurred were identified using a net benefit framework. Abstract: Results: Starting therapy with DRSP/EE dominated both sertraline and paroxetine, but not fluoxetine. The estimated ICER of initiating treatment with fluoxetine relative to DRSP/EE was $US 4385 per treatment success (year 2007 values). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves revealed that for ceiling ratios ≥$US 3450 per treatment success, fluoxetine had the highest probability (≥ 0. 37) of being the most cost-effective treatment, relative to the other options.
