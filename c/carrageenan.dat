5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and <b>carrageenan</b> are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E

However, conversely, plant growth {{can also be}} induced by treatments with various abiotic and biotic elicitors. <b>Carrageenans</b> are sulfated linear polysaccharides that represent major cellular constituents of seaweeds belonging to red algae (Rhodophyta). Recent research has unraveled the biological activity of <b>carrageenans</b> and of their oligomeric forms, the oligo <b>carrageenans</b> (OCs), as promoters of plant growth and as elicitors of defense responses against pests and diseases. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which <b>carrageenans</b> and OCs mediate plant growth and plant defense responses. <b>Carrageenans</b> and OCs improve plant growth by regulating various metabolic processes such as photosynthesis and ancillary pathways, cell division, purine and pyrimidine synthetic pathways as well as metabolic pathways involved in nitrogen and sulfur assimilation. <b>Carrageenans</b> and OCs also induce plant defense responses against viroids, viruses, bacteria, fungi and insects by modulating the activity of different defense pathways, including salicylate, jasmonate and ethylene signaling pathways. Further studies will likely substantiate the beneficial effects of <b>carrageenans</b> and of OCs on plant growth and plant defense responses and open new avenues for their use in agriculture and horticultural industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Carrageenans</b> are {{abundant}} and safe non-starch polysaccharides exerting their biological effects in living organisms. Apart from their known pro-inflammation properties and some pharmacological activity, <b>carrageenans</b> can also strongly bind and hold metal ions. This property {{can be used}} for creation of the new drugs for elimination of metals from the body or targeted delivery of these metal ions for healing purposes. Metal binding activity of different <b>carrageenans</b> in aqueous solutions containing Y 3 + or Pb 2 + ions was studied in a batch sorption system. The metal uptake by <b>carrageenans</b> is not affected by the change of the pH within the range from 2. 0 to 6. 0. The rates and binding capacities of <b>carrageenans</b> regarding metal ions were evaluated. The Langmuir, Freundlich and BET sorption models were applied to describe the isotherms and constants, and the sorption isothermal data could be explained well by the Langmuir equation. The results obtained through the study suggest that �-, �-, and �-carrageenans are favorable sorbents. The largest amount of Y 3 + and Pb 2 + ions are bound by �-carrageenan. Therefore, it can be concluded that this type of polysaccharide is the more appropriate substance for elaboration of the drugs with high selective metal binding properties...|$|R

40|$|Producción CientíficaExtruded {{and native}} wheat flours were {{combined}} with agars (gracilaria and gelidium) and <b>carrageenans</b> (κ-carrageenan and ι-carrageenan) {{to modify their}} paste and gel properties. Combinations of extruded flours with hydrocolloids produced {{an increase in the}} hydration properties (swelling volume and water holding and water binding capacities). All hydrocolloids (particularly ι-carrageenan) also produced an increase in hydration properties after combination with native flours. With regard to the pasting properties of native flours combinations, all hydrocolloids produced an increase in peak viscosity (particularly gelidium agar), but only agars decreased the onset temperature of gelatinization and increased breakdown, indicating a different mechanism of action. In the presence of extruded flour, the incorporation of hydrocolloids increased the cold viscosity of flours in very different ways depending on the hydrocolloid. Both native and extruded flours exhibited higher G’ and G’’ values and a lower tanafter the incorporation of <b>carrageenans,</b> which, together with the lower dependence on frequency, would produce stiffer and more stable pastes/gels. Based on gel properties, greatest hardness with native and extruded flours was achieved by the incorporation of <b>carrageenans.</b> In general, <b>carrageenans,</b> besides producing stiffer and more stable pastes, gave rise to harder and clearer gels compared to those made with agar, for both their combination with extruded and native wheat flours.

40|$|Understanding of macroalgal {{dispersal}} {{has been}} hindered by {{the difficulty in}} identifying propagules. Different <b>carrageenans</b> typically occur in gametophytes and tetrasporophytes of the red algal family Gigartinaceae, and we may expect that carpospores and tetraspores also differ in composition of <b>carrageenans.</b> Using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy, we tested the model that differences in <b>carrageenans</b> and other cellular constituents between nuclear phases should allow us to discriminate carpospores and tetraspores of Chondrus verrucosus Mikami.  Spectral data suggest that carposporophytes isolated from the pericarp and female gametophytes contained κ-carrageenan, whereas tetrasporophytes contained λ-carrageenan. However, both carpospores and tetraspores exhibited absorbances in wave bands characteristic of κ-,ι-, and λ-carrageenans. Carpospores contained more proteins and may be more photosynthetically active than tetraspores, which contained more lipid reserves. We draw analogies to planktotrophic and lecithotrophic larvae. These differences in cellular chemistry allowed reliable discrimination of spores, but pretreatment of spectral data affected the accuracy of classification. The best classification of spores was achieved with extended multiplicative signal correction (EMSC) pretreatment using partial least squares discrimination analysis, with correct classification of 86 % of carpospores and 83 % of tetraspores. Classification may be further improved by using synchrotron FT-IR microspectroscopy because of its inherently higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with microspectroscopy using conventional sources of IR. This study demonstrates that FT-IR microspectroscopy and bioinformatics are useful tools to advance our understanding of algal dispersal ecology through discrimination of morphologically similar propagules both within and potentially between species...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} the k/i-ratio on the physical properties of k/i-hybrid <b>carrageenans</b> (synonyms: kappa- 2, k- 2, weak kappa, weak gelling kappa). To this end, a series of k/i-hybrid <b>carrageenans</b> ranging from almost homopolymeric k-carrageenan (98 mol% k-units) to almost homopolymeric-carrageenan (99 mol% i-units) have been extracted from selected species of marine red algae (Rhodophyta). The k/i-ratio of these k/i-hybrids was determined by NMR spectroscopy. Their rheological properties were determined by small deformation oscillatory rheology. The gel strength (storage modulus, G 0) of the j/i-hybrids decreases with decreasing j-content. On the other hand, the gelation temperature of the k-rich k/i-hybrids is independent of their composition. This allows one to control the gel strength independent of the gelation or melting temperature. The conformational order–disorder transition of the k/i-hybrids was studied using optical rotation and high-sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. High-sensitivity DSC showed that the total transition enthalpy of the k/i-hybrids goes through a minimum at 60 mol% k-units, whereas for the mixture of j- and i-carrageenan, the total transition enthalpy is a linear function of the composition. With respect to the ordering capability, the k/i-hybrid <b>carrageenans</b> seem to behave as random block copolymers with length sequence distributions truncated {{from the side of the}} small lengths. Intrinsic thermodynamic properties (e. g., transition temperature and enthalpy) of k- and i-sequences in these copolymers are close to those of their parent homopolymers.
