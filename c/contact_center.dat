40|$|Abstract:- The {{explosion}} of multimedia data, the continuous growth in computing power, and advances in machine learning and speech and {{natural language processing}} are {{making it possible to}} create a new breed of virtual intelligent agents capable of performing sophisticated and complex tasks that are radically transforming <b>contact</b> <b>centers.</b> These virtual agents are enabling ubiquitous and personalized access to communication services from anywhere. As <b>contact</b> <b>centers</b> grow and become more complex in their function and organization, the knowledge processes become more formal to ensure consistency of advice and efficiency. This paper suggests a multi-agent approach for distributed knowledge processing and discusses the use of enhanced mobile agent architecture (EMA) [12] in context of <b>contact</b> <b>centers</b> to advance and frame future discussion of these knowledge intensive environments. We prove the benefits of the enterprise resource planning (ERP) management using multi-agent systems for <b>contact</b> <b>centers</b> with distributed knowledge, considering an adequate case study and providing experimental results...|$|R
