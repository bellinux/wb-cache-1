40|$|In this study, it {{has been}} aimed to examine athletes’ body {{perception}} and gender role. 120 male athletes and 120 non-athletic male university students {{participated in the study}} voluntarily. In the study, as the data <b>collecting</b> <b>means,</b> The Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire-MBSRQ was used in order to determine males’ body perception levels, BEM Sex Role Inventory-BSRI was used to determine gender roles and Personal Information Form developed by the researcher was used to ascertain personal features of the subjects. When the athletes’ body perception levels are examined, the features of physical competence orientation, health orientation, appearance evaluation, fitness evaluation, health evaluation and body areas satisfaction {{have been found to be}} higher than non-athletes’ (p 0. 05). When gender roles are examined, athletes have been found to have higher values than non-athletes’ in terms of masculinity, femininity and social desirability (p< 0. 05). To conclude; as well as considering sports as a factor increasing individuals’ body perception level and gender role, it is also thought that athletes care about health, appearance and physical competence and are glad of body parts because of their muscled body structure developing due to the exercises and have flexible personality to show feminine and masculine features that the environment needs in terms of gender role...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Assertiveness {{is defined}} as the {{feelings}} and thoughts of a person being expressed without anxiety and fear. This research is a descriptive study {{in order to determine the}} assertiveness levels of nurses and factors, which may influence assertiveness. Material and Methods: The study group of thîs research included 465 nurses working at Erciyes University Gevher Nesibe Medical School Hospital, Dr. Vedat Ali Özkan State Hospital, Kayseri state SSK Hospital and Güneş Private Hospital. "Nurse Personality Form" and "Assertiveness Scale for Nurses" were used as data <b>collecting</b> <b>means.</b> "Assertiveness Scale for Nurses" was developed by Besti Üstün and its validity and confidence are approved. Single varient analysis and Scheffe test were used to assess the data. Results: According to the results of the current research, the assertiveness scores of nurses ranged between 197 and 346 [...] The factors which may influence the assertiveness levels included main school which the nurse graduated, parental education status, father's job, number of family members, family attitude, age, education status of the husbands of the nurses, reasons for choosing a tiring profession, current duty time, weekly working hours, place of employement and participating in professional activities. İt was determined that the parameters including the unit she works at, patient number in her care day and night, shift working and number of the weekly shift, where her family lives, family type, responsibility in family, mother's job, husbands' job, job that they preferred, marital status, tasks in the unit does not effect assertiveness levels. Conclusion: Analytic research of the relationship between organized structure and the audacity levels of the nurses revealed that the development of assertiveness is both provided during the education and the working periods of nurses...|$|E

The study was conducted in 2001 on the pupils of the 5 th and 8 th grades of three primary schools at low, middle and upper socio-economic levels and the 11 th grade high-school students in randomly picked classrooms – 313 students in total. A questionnaire form was used as the data <b>collecting</b> <b>means.</b> Frequency and percentages were used to analyze the data collected through the questionnaire form and the correlation between dependent and interdependent variables was tested through chi square. According to the findings gained through this study, the students state that some activities that are related to the future and promote thinking about the future are performed at schools, there are subjects within lessons that are related the future and promote thinking about the future and teachers establish a connection among "yesterday, today and tomorrow " and they provide activities to make them think about the future. They state that what affect them most in their thinking about the future are the people in the family and immediate surrounding, teachers and the mass media among which computers, television and books are the most influential ones. Also, while the students think that the future of the world and of themselves will be better, they think that nothing will change concerning the future of their country. According to them, the major negative factors affecting the world's future are wars and arms race followed by fatal diseases spreading rapidly (cancer, aids etc.), terror incidents, hunger, (famine, waste of resources etc.) and natural disasters (earthquake, flood, fire etc).
