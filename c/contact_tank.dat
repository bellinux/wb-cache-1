40|$|The {{flow pattern}} in <b>contact</b> <b>tanks</b> (CTs) can exhibit complex {{hydrodynamic}} and mixing processes, typically with {{the occurrence of}} recirculating flow and dead zones, shear and wall generated turbulence, as well as regions with relatively low horizontal velocities and others with fairly high vertical accelerations. The characterisation of these phenomena {{is of paramount importance}} for an integrative understanding of their effects on the performance of CTs, demanding the use of sophisticated investigative techniques, such as the direct assessment of the velocity field and use of appropriate and refined numerical schemes. Nonetheless, thorough comparisons of the performance of CTs against the predictions of complex three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical hydrodynamic and solute transport models have yet to be reported. A physical and numerical investigation of the 3 -D hydrodynamic and mixing processes in <b>contact</b> <b>tanks</b> was undertaken in this study. Physical experimentation has been carried out for various configurations of a prototype CT, providing data for the validation of numerical model results. These included velocity measurements with an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter, as well as assessments of solute transport processes by using tracer techniques. A 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics model has been developed, based on the finite volumes method and using a low Reynolds number k-s turbulence model, in addition to a depth-averaged eddy viscosity approach. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations have been discretised using the SIMPLER algorithm and solved in a line-by-line fashion for a non-uniform mesh configuration. The parameter C^ for the k-s model has been calculated as a function of local turbulence quantities. A sensitivity analysis of the predicted results has been undertaken for the variation of the Schmidt number and type of turbulence model. The numerical model predictions have been validated against analytical and empirical results for benchmark flow problems, as well as for hydrodynamic and solute transport data from various prototype CTs.

40|$|Mixing {{characteristics}} of multi-chambered <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> are analyzed employing the validated three-dimensional numerical model {{developed in the}} companion paper. Based on the flow characterization, novel volumetric mixing efficiency definitions are proposed {{for the assessment of}} the hydrodynamic and chemical transport properties of the <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> and its chambers. Residence time distribution functions are analyzed not only at the outlet of each chamber but also inside the chambers using the efficiency definitions for both Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) results. A novel tracer mixing index is defined to characterize short circuiting and mixing effects of the contact system. Comparisons of the results of these indexes for RANS and LES solutions indicate that mixing characteristics are stronger in LES due to the unsteady turbulent eddy mixing even though short circuiting effects are also more prominent in LES results. This result indicates that the mixing analysis based on the LES results simulates the mixing characteristics instantaneously, which is more realistic than that in RANS. Since LES analysis can capture turbulent eddy mixing better than RANS analysis, the interaction of recirculation and jet zones are captured more effectively in LES, which tends to predict higher turbulent mixing in the contact system. The analysis also shows that the mixing efficiency of each chamber of the <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> is different, thus it is necessary to consider distinct chemical release and volumetric designs for each chamber in order to maximize the mixing efficiency of the overall process in a <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> system...|$|E
40|$|Chlorine is {{extensively}} used {{to disinfect}} drinking water supply. However, {{the design of}} chlorine <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> is usually based on the volume displacement criterion, paying attention that detention time {{would be at least}} of half an hour. This criterion relies upon the assumption that plug-flow conditions hold along the tank. However, the existence and arrangement of baffles in the tank, and the tank inlet and outlet configurations can result in a much more complex flow pattern, where turbulent mixing, dead-zones and short-circuiting exist. This situation could result in an inefficient use of chlorine due to the formation of potentially carcinogenic compounds, which originate from residual chlorine in the tank. Further some bypassing allows some out-coming flow with less of the standard amount of contact with the chlorine dose. Therefore, understanding hydrodynamics and mass-transfer characteristics within a <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> is very useful.

40|$|New water {{directives}} impose strict {{regulations to}} reduce the footprint of treatment operations and contaminant levels, which suggest a performance review of water treatment facilities, including disinfection contact tanks. Serpentine <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> units suggest plug flow to be the optimal hydrodynamic condition at which disinfection performance is maximized. However, previous studies indicate that flow exhibits a residence time distribution (RTD) which can be significantly distorted from what is dictated by plug flow. Over the years, there has been rising concern over the impact of such digressions from optimal hydraulic conditions on microbe inactivation and the regulation of potentially carcinogenic Disinfection By-Products (DBPs). With the growth of computing power and the advancement of computational models, the potential of <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> water disinfection optimization by means of numerical modelling techniques can be assessed. In this study, Acoustic Doppler Velocity (ADV) and fluorescent tracer dye measurement campaigns are carried out to assess the hydraulic efficiency of a serpentine <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> physical model and evaluating appropriate indicators. Then, three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models are set up to simulate the hydrodynamic and solute transport processes {{for a variety of}} <b>contact</b> <b>tank</b> geometries examining the effects of inlet design, baffling configuration and tank scale. The simulation capability to reproduce the actual conditions is attested through comparisons against available laboratory results. The CFD approach is subsequently refined with appropriately selected kinetic models, describing the processes of disinfectant decay, pathogen inactivation and DBP formation. Results highlight that computational models can become invaluable tools for the simulation of disinfection processes as they can reproduce the conditions encountered experimentally to a satisfactory extent. Moreover, the optimization of hydraulic efficiency, as studied numerically, facilitates more uniform disinfectant contact time which corresponds to greater levels of pathogen inactivation and a more controlled by-product accumulation...|$|E

To evaluate the efficiency of this treatment process, flow and tracer transport analysis {{have been used in}} the literature using Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) and large-eddy simulations (LES). The {{purpose of this study is}} two-fold. First a unifying analysis of the flow field is presented and similarities and differences in the numerical results that were reported in the literature are discussed. Second, the vorticity field is identified as the key parameter to use in separating the mean flow (jet zone) and the recirculating zones. Based on the concepts of vorticity gradient and flexion product, it is demonstrated that the separation of the recirculation zone and the jet zone, fluid-fluid flow separation, is possible. The separation of the recirculation zones and vortex core lines are characterized using the definition of the Lamb vector. The separated regions are used to characterize the mixing efficiency in the chambers of the <b>contact</b> <b>tank.</b> This analysis indicates that the recirculation zone and jet zone formation are three-dimensional and require simulations over a long period of time to reach stability. It is recognized that the characteristics of the jet zones and the recirculation zones are distinct for each chamber and they follow a particular pattern and symmetry between the alternating chambers. Hydraulic efficiency coefficients calculated for each chamber show that the chambers having an inlet adjacent to the free surface may be designed to have larger volumes than the chambers having wall bounded inlets to improve the efficiency of the <b>contact</b> <b>tank.</b> This is a simple design alternative that would increase the efficiency of the system.

The contract was worth £41,046, and further contracts followed, which included £36,500 for 36 more contact beds and three settling tanks, £5,000 for excavating [...] of earth, and £36,484 for storm beds and other work, which was subsequently raised to £39,184, so that they could pay their workers at the same rate as Sheffield Corporation paid their own workmen.|$|R
