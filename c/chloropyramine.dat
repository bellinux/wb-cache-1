50|$|<b>Chloropyramine</b> {{should not}} be used {{internally}} with MAO inhibitors. Because of its anticholinergic activity, concurrent administration with cholinomimetics is not advisable. General anesthetics, analgesic agents and psycholeptics potentiate the sedative effect of <b>chloropyramine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloropyramine</b> {{is known}} as a {{competitive}} reversible H1 receptor antagonist (also known as an H1 inverse agonist), meaning that it exerts its pharmacological action by competing with histamine for the H1 subtype histamine receptor. By blocking the effects of histamine, the drug inhibits the vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and tissue edema associated with histamine release in the tissue. The H1 antagonistic properties of <b>chloropyramine</b> can be used by researchers for the purposes of blocking the effects of histamine on cells and tissues. In addition, <b>chloropyramine</b> has some anticholinergic properties.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases of}} severe {{allergic}} reactions, <b>chloropyramine</b> can be injected intramuscularly or intravenously. Oral administration: In adults, 25 mg {{can be taken}} 3 to 4 times daily (up to 150 mg); in children over 5 years old, 25 mg can be taken 2 to 3 times daily. For external application, the skin or the eye conjunctiva can be treated up to {{several times a day}} by applying a thin layer of cream or ointment containing 1% <b>chloropyramine</b> hydrochloride.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chloropyramine's</b> {{anticholinergic}} {{properties and}} the fact that it can pass through the blood-brain barrier are linked to its clinical side effects: drowsiness, weakness, vertigo, fatigue, dryness in the mouth, constipation, and rarely — visual disturbances and increase of intraocular pressure.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Chloropyramine</b> is a {{classical}} ("old" [...] or first generation) antihistamine drug approved in some Eastern European countries (like Russia) {{for the treatment}} of allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and other atopic (allergic) conditions.

50|$|<b>Chloropyramine</b> {{should not}} be used {{internally}} with alcohol, sedative drugs and hypnotics because of the potentiation of the effects. It should be used with caution in patients suffering from hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular diseases and asthma. In children, it can induce agitation, and in many adult patients dizziness may be observed. Because of the pronounced sedative effect the preparation should be prescribed cautiously in drivers and people working with machines.|$|E

40|$|Expression of the SASH 1 {{protein is}} reduced {{in a range}} of human cancers and has been implicated in {{apoptotic}} cancer cell death. This study investigated whether increasing SASH 1 expression could be a useful therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. Ectopic SASH 1 expression increased apoptosis in 7 / 8 breast cancer cell lines. Subsequent in silico connectivity screening demonstrated that the clinically approved antihistamine drug, <b>chloropyramine,</b> increased SASH 1 mRNA levels. <b>Chloropyramine</b> has previously been shown to have anti-tumour activity in breast cancer in part through modulation of FAK signalling, a pathway also regulated by SASH 1. This study demonstrated that <b>chloropyramine</b> increased SASH 1 protein levels in breast cancer cells. Consistent with this the agent reduced cell confluency in 7 / 8 cell lines treated irrespective of their ER status but not apoptosis incompetent MCF 7 cells. In contrast SASH 1 siRNA-transfected breast cancer cells exhibited reduced <b>chloropyramine</b> sensitivity. The prognostic significance of SASH 1 expression was also investigated in two breast cancer cohorts. Expression was associated with favourable outcome in ER-positive cases, but only those of low histological grade/proliferative status. Conversely, we found a very strong inverse association in HER 2 + disease irrespective of ER status, and in triple-negative, basal-like cases. Overall, the data suggest that SASH 1 is prognostic in breast cancer and could have subtype-dependent effects on breast cancer progression. Pharmacologic induction of SASH 1 by <b>chloropyramine</b> treatment of breast cancer warrants further preclinical and clinical investigation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chloropyramine</b> {{is a first}} {{generation}} antihistamine drug approved in some Eastern European countries {{for the treatment of}} allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, and other allergic conditions. <b>Chloropyramine</b> is known as a competitive reversible H 1 -receptor antagonist. By blocking the effects of histamine, the drug inhibits the vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, and tissue oedema associated with histamine release in the tissue. A simple gas chromatography method based on gas chromatography - mass detection technique (GC-MS) for the determination of <b>chloropyramine</b> active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in dragėes was developed and validated. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a fused silica ZB- 5 capillary column (30 m x 0. 25 mm i. d. x 0. 25 µm film thickness). Acquisition was performed in selected ion monitoring mode (SIM) with target ion (58 m/z) and reference ions (71 m/z, 125 m/z). The method was validated in respect system suitability, specificity, linearity, range accuracy and precision, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), specificity, robustness and stability. The advantages of this method include simple sample treatment, short elution time (less than 15 min) and short analysis time (less than 25 min). The proposed method could be applicable for routine analysis in pharmaceutical analytical laboratories.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the second most common cancer worldwide, {{accounting}} for 25 % of all female cancers. Although the survival rate has increased significantly in the past few decades, patients who develop secondary site metastasis as well as those diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer still represent a real unmet medical challenge. Previous studies have shown that <b>chloropyramine</b> (C 4) inhibits FAK-VEGFR 3 signalling. More recently, C 4 is reported to have SASH 1 inducing properties. However, C 4 exerts its antitumour and antiangiogenic effects at high micromolar concentrations (> 100 μm) that would not be compatible with further drug development against invasive breast cancer driven by FAK signalling. In this study, molecular modelling guided structural modifications have been introduced to the <b>chloropyramine</b> C 4 scaffold to improve its activity in breast cancer cell lines. Seventeen compounds were designed and synthesized, and their antiproliferative activity was evaluated against three human breast cancer lines (MDA-MB- 231, BT 474 and T 47 D). Compound 5 c was identified to display an average activity of IC 50 = 23. 5 – 31. 3 μm, which represents a significant improvement of C 4 activity in the same assay model. Molecular modelling and pharmacokinetic studies provided more promising insights into the mechanistic features of this new series...|$|E
40|$|The early {{phase of}} the ConA-induced {{inflammatory}} ascites was studied, with special reference to histamine. Concanavalin A (ConA), a cell-surface binding lectin was injected i. p. (25 mg/kg bw) to mice. After 1 h the animals were killed, the ascitic fluid collected and measured. Other agents were injected s. c., 10 min before the ConA-challenge. Exogenous histamine markedly inhibited the ConA-induced ascites. Release of endogenous vasoactive agents from the mast cells by Compound 48 / 80 had a similar, but slight effect. Cromolyn, a mast cell stabilizing agent, and <b>chloropyramine,</b> a histamine H 1 receptor antagonist was ineffective. Although histamine increases endothelial permeability, it did not enhance the formation of ascitic fluid, on the contrary, it inhibited the ConA-induced ascites, presumably due to its known hypotonic effect. It is concluded that ConA-induced ascites is not mediated by mast cell histamine...|$|E
