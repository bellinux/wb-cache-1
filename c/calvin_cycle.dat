5|$|Plant {{biochemistry}} is {{the study}} of the chemical processes used by plants. Some of these processes are used in their primary metabolism like the photosynthetic <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle</b> and crassulacean acid metabolism. Others make specialised materials like the cellulose and lignin used to build their bodies, and secondary products like resins and aroma compounds.|$|E
5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle,</b> which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle,</b> with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E
50|$|If a trophic mode is obligate, then it {{is always}} {{necessary}} for sustaining growth and maintenance; if facultative, {{it can be used}} as a supplemental source. Some organisms have incomplete <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycles,</b> so they are incapable of fixing carbon dioxide and must use organic carbon sources.|$|R
50|$|In {{photosynthetic}} prokaryotes {{the mechanisms}} of carbon fixation are more diverse. Here, carbon dioxide can be fixed by the <b>Calvin</b> - Benson <b>cycle,</b> a reversed citric acid cycle, or the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. Prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix CO2 through the <b>Calvin</b> - Benson <b>cycle,</b> but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction.|$|R

5|$|The {{light energy}} {{captured}} by chlorophyll a is initially {{in the form}} of electrons (and later a proton gradient) that's used to make molecules of ATP and NADPH which temporarily store and transport energy. Their energy is used in the light-independent reactions of the <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle</b> by the enzyme rubisco to produce molecules of the 3-carbon sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the first product of photosynthesis and the raw material from which glucose and almost all other organic molecules of biological origin are synthesised. Some of the glucose is converted to starch which is stored in the chloroplast. Starch is the characteristic energy store of most land plants and algae, while inulin, a polymer of fructose is used for the same purpose in the sunflower family Asteraceae. Some of the glucose is converted to sucrose (common table sugar) for export {{to the rest of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle,</b> a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle,</b> {{also known}} as the dark reactions, is a series of {{biochemical}} reactions that fixes CO2 into G3P sugar molecules and uses the energy and electrons from the ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions.

The recombinant PPi-PFK (4 × 45 kDa) was highly active, non-allosteric and stringently specific to pyrophosphate as the phosphoryl donor. The enzyme was more specific for the reverse reaction substrate fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate (K(m) 0. 095 mM, V(max) 805 U/mg of protein) {{than for the}} forward reaction substrate fructose- 6 -phosphate (K(m) 0. 64 mM, V(max) 577 U/mg of protein). It also phosphorylated sedoheptulose- 7 -phosphate with much lower efficiency (K(m) 1. 01 mM, V(max) 0. 118 U/mg of protein). The kinetic properties of the M. alcaliphilum PP(i) -PFK were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} PP(i) -PFKs from other methanotrophs.

This extensive sequence divergence of PPi-PFKs correlated with differential ability to phosphorylate sedoheptulose- 7 -phosphate and with the metabolic patterns of these bacteria assimilating C(1) substrate either via the ribulose monophoshate (RuMP) cycle or simultaneously via the RuMP and the <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycles.</b> Based on enzymic and genomic data, the involvement of PPi-PFK in pyrophosphate-dependent glycolysis in M. alcaliphilum 20 Z was fist proposed...|$|R

Three full-length cDNAs encoding PEPC were isolated from H. verticillata, two from leaves and one from root. The sequences were 95 % to 99 % identical and shared a 75 % to 85 % similarity with other plant PEPCs. Transcript studies revealed that one isoform, Hvpepc 4, was exclusively expressed in leaves during C 4 induction. This and enzyme kinetic data were consistent with it being the C 4 photosynthesis isoform. However, the C 4 signature serine of terrestrial plant C 4 isoforms was absent in this and the other H. verticillata sequences. Instead, alanine, typical of C 3 sequences, was present. Western analyses of C 3 and C 4 leaf extracts after anion-exchange chromatography showed similar dominant PEPC-specific bands at 110 kD. In phylogenetic analyses, the sequences grouped with C 3, non-graminaceous C 4, and Crassulacean acid metabolism PEPCs but not with the graminaceous C 4, and formed a clade with a gymnosperm, which is consistent with H. verticillata PEPC predating that of other C 4 angiosperms...|$|R

The results show that Km values have no major influence on the cycle activity at optimal concentrations of external orthophosphate.

The anaerobic photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodospirillum rubrum, is an organism particularly attractive for the bioconversion of syngas into PHAs. In this study, a quantitative physiological analysis of R. rubrum {{was carried out}} by implementing GC-MS and HPLC techniques to unravel the metabolic pathway operating during syngas fermentation that leads to PHA production. Further, detailed investigations of the central carbon metabolites using 13 C-labeled substrate showed significant CO 2 assimilation (of 40 %) into cell material and PHA from syngas carbon fraction. By a combination of quantitative gene expression and enzyme activity analyses, the main role of carboxylases from the central carbon metabolism in CO 2 assimilation was shown, where the <b>Calvin</b> Benson-Bassham <b>Cycle</b> (CBB) played a minor role.

40|$|Proton {{gradients}} {{are fundamental}} to chloroplast function. Across thylakoid membranes, the light induced proton gradient {{is essential for}} ATP synthesis. As a result of proton pumping into the thylakoid lumen, an alkaline stromal pH develops, which is required for full activation of pH-dependent <b>Calvin</b> Benson <b>cycle</b> enzymes. This implies that a pH gradient between the cytosol (pH 7) and the stroma (pH 8) is established upon illumination. To maintain this pH gradient chloroplasts actively extrude protons. More than 30 {{years ago it was}} already established that these proton fluxes are electrically counterbalanced by Mg 2 +, K+ or Cl- fluxes, but only recently the first transport systems that regulate the pH gradient were identified. Notably several (Na+,K+) /H+ antiporter systems where identified, that play a role in pH gradient regulation, ion homeostasis, osmoregulation, or coupling of secondary active transport. The established pH gradients are important to drive uptake of essential ions and solutes, but not many transporters involved have been identified to date.

40|$|International audienceThe Caribbean {{bivalves}} Codakia orbicularis (Linnée, 1758) and C. orbiculata (Montagu, 1808) live in seagrass beds of Thalassia testudinum and harbor intracellular sulfuroxidizing gamma-proteobacteria. These bacterial symbionts fix CO 2 via the <b>Calvin</b> Benson <b>cycle</b> {{and provide}} organic compounds to the bivalve. During experimentally induced starvation, no reduced sulfur compounds and no organic particle food are available; the symbionts {{could be considered}} as the sole nutrient source of the host bivalve. A previous study {{has shown that the}} intracellular bacterial population decreased considerably during starvation and that bacterial endosymbionts were not released by the bivalves. In this study, the activity of two lysosomal marker enzymes (acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase) was detected using cytochemical experiments coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray transmission electron microscopy during sulfide and organic particle starvation. The degradation of bacterial endosymbionts began after 2 weeks of starvation in C. orbiculata and after 3 weeks in C. orbicularis. Degradation processes seem to be continuous over several months and could be responsible for the disappearance of the bacterial endosymbionts within the gills during starvation. These data suggest that the host use symbionts as a nutrient source to survive a hunger crisis. The carbon transfer from the symbionts to the host could be flexible and could consist in transfer of organic matter, “milking,” under normal feeding conditions and digestion of the symbionts under starved conditions...|$|R
25|$|Transketolase is {{an enzyme}} {{of both the}} pentose {{phosphate}} pathway in all organisms and the <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle</b> of photosynthesis. It catalyzes two important reactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon aldose (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon aldose glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the <b>Calvin</b> <b>cycle,</b> transketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the aldose D-ribose-5-P and the ketose D-xylulose-5-P.|$|E

40|$|In {{photosynthetic}} organisms the redox-dependent {{modification of}} thiols belonging to enzymes of the photosynthetic cycle, plays {{a prominent role}} in the regulation of metabolism and signalling. An important regulatory mechanism is represented by light that acts through a ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. The system permits the reduction/oxidation of disulfide bridges of the target enzymes. Moreover, cysteines residues can undergo other modifications such as glutathionylation and nitrosylation. Proteomic studies have allowed the identification of new putative targets of redox modifications, including <b>Calvin</b> Benson <b>cycle</b> enzymes. The aim of the studies was to investigate whether phosphoglycerate kinase, triose phosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii undergo redox modifications. All enzymes and their mutants (i. e. cysteines variants) were purified and the treatments with alkylating and oxidative agents have permitted to confirm the presence of reactive cysteine(s). The sensitivity of recombinant proteins to redox modifications and the cysteine(s) involved were analyzed by biochemical approcheas. The structural features were analyzed, and the crystallography structure of CrTPI and CrGPA were solved. The three enzymes result all redox regulated although with different biochemical features. The CrPGK contains two cysteines sensitive to redox treatments, although the inhibitor effects of these modifications are different, indeed glutathionylation slightly affected the enzymatic activity compare to nitrosylation. Moreover, the crystallographic structure of CrTPI was determined at a resolution of 1. 1. Å, showing a homodimeric conformation containing the typical α/β- barrel fold. No evidence for CrTPI Trx-dependent regulation was obtained but was found to undergo glutathionylation and nitrosylation with a moderate down-regulation on activity. Furthermore, the CrGAPA shows an extreme sensitivity to oxidant molecules and the crystallographic structure of CrGAPA was determined at a resolution of 1. 8. Å, confirming the tetrameric fold of the enzyme. the results suggest that redox modifications could constitute a mechanism for the regulation of the Calvin-Benson cycle under oxidative stress conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{production}} of valuable biological products from sugars via fermentation is of {{importance in the}} chemical industry. One key parameter by which processes are evaluated is the product carbon yield on substrate. In the normal growth of heterotrophic organisms on fermentable sugars, some carbon is lost as CO 2. In the {{production of}} acetate from hexose or pentose sugars, homoacetogens using the reductive acetyl CoA pathway have a theoretical yield of acetate on glucose of 3. We hypothesized that the addition of enzymes necessary for fixation of the lost CO 2 would enhance the theoretical carbon yield of acetate in the dark in organisms without the reductive acetyl CoA pathway. Using computational flux balances of central metabolism of Escherichia coli, we show that {{the addition of the}} enzymes for the reductive pentose phosphate (<b>Calvin</b> Benson Bassham) <b>cycle</b> increases the theoretical yield of acetate from glucose or xylose. An even more significant increase in the theoretical carbon yield of acetate was obtained by adding the reactions for the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA), matching that of homoacetogens. However, addition of these pathways did not result in an increase in the theoretical yield of other excreted metabolites or biomass...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} elements on Earth stored in a multitude of reservoirs and constantly cycled through various processes occurring on our planet. Although it represents only a small percentage of the total carbon on Earth, the biosphere is the most active of all carbon reservoirs. We have a comparatively large knowledge of the surface biosphere and primary production associated with phytoplankton and green plants, as well as respiration of organic compounds. A substantial biosphere, driven by "dark energy" or chemical disequilibria may exist for kilometers beneath the continents and the seafloor. Water-rock reactions at high temperatures mobilize the reducing power of the deep Earth, and upon mixing with seawater produce copious and diverse energy sources which can support autotrophic growth. Several remarkable cases of chemotrophic carbon assimilation have been demonstrated since the discovery of the deep-sea vents more than 30 years ago (e. g. bacterial endosymbionts inhabiting the tube worm trophosome), and the isolation of a number of thermophilic and hyperthermophilic chemolithoautotophs. To date, there are six known pathways of carbon assimilation, including the canonical Calvin Benson-Bassham pathway. All of the most recently discovered pathways have been found in thermophiles and Archaea specifically all likely to occurring at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.   This study seeks to document the occurrence of autotrophic microorganisms in the context of thermal and chemical gradients within the walls of deep-sea vent chimneys. Furthermore, we show that the phylogeny of genes associated with the <b>Calvin</b> Benson-Bassham <b>cycle</b> is associated with the environmental characteristics in which it occurs.   This work has implications for understanding feedbacks between environmental characteristics and carbon assimilation as well as the evolutionary history of carbon fixation pathways. These pathways were likely operative since early in Earth's history, and overlap with conditions which favor the abiotic synthesis of small organic molecules. Research in this realm thus may provide clues to the origins and diversification of carbon fixation pathways as well.   M. S...|$|R

[...] In doing so, Calvin, Benson and Bassham showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacturing of organic compounds, rather than on carbon dioxide as was previously believed.

Comparisons with known sequences suggested cbbT to encode transketolase (TK; EC 2. 2. 1. 1) as an additional enzyme of the cycle. No significant overall sequence similarities were observed for cbbZ. Although both regions exhibited very high nucleotide identities, 93 % (cbbZ) and 96 % (cbbT), only the chromosomally encoded genes were heterologously expressed to high levels in Escherichia coli. The molecular masses of the observed gene products, CbbT (74 kDa) and CbbZ (24 kDa), correlated well with the values calculated {{on the basis of}} the sequence information. TK activities were strongly elevated in E. coli clones expressing cbbT, confirming the identity of the gene. Strains of E. coli harboring the chromosomal cbbZ gene showed high levels of activity of 2 -phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP; EC 3. 1. 3. 18), a key enzyme of glycolate metabolism in autotrophic organisms that is not present in wild-type E. coli. Derepression of the cbb operons during autotrophic growth resulted in considerably increased levels of TK activity and the appearance of PGP activity in A. eutrophus, although the pHG 1 -encoded cbbZ gene was apparently not expressed.

40|$|The Krebs cycle (citric acid or {{tricarboxylic acid}} cycle), the final common pathway in aerobic {{metabolism}} for the oxidation of carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids, {{is known to}} be irreversible. It liberates CO 2 and generates NADH whose aerobic oxidation yields ATP but it does not operate in reverse as a biosynthetic pathway for CO 2 assimilation. In 1966, our laboratory described a cyclic pathway for CO 2 assimilation (Evans, Buchanan and Arnon 1966) that was unusual in two respects: (i) it provided the first instance of an obligate photoautotroph that assimilated CO 2 by a pathway different from Calvin's reductive pentose phosphate <b>cycle</b> (<b>Calvin</b> 1962) and (ii) in its overall effect the new cycle was a reversal of the Krebs cycle. Named the 'reductive carboxylic acid cycle' (sometimes also called the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle) the new cycle appeared to be the sole CO 2 assimilation pathway in Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum (Evans et al. 1966) (now known as Chlorobium limicola forma thiosulfatophilum). Chlorobium is a photosynthetic green sulfur bacterium that grows anaerobically in an inorganic medium with sulfide and thiosulfate as electron donors and CO 2 as an obligatory carbon source. In the ensuing years, the new cycle was viewed with skepticism. Not only was it in conflict with the prevailing doctrine that the 'one important property [...] . shared by all (our emphasis) autotrophic species is the assimilation of CO 2 via the Calvin cycle' (McFadden 1973) but also some of its experimental underpinnings were challenged. It is only now that {{in the words of one}} of its early skeptics (Tabita 1988) 'a long and tortuous controversy' has ended with general acceptance of the reductive carboxylic acid cycle as a photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation pathway distinct from the pentose cycle. (Henceforth, to minimize repetitiveness, the reductive pentose phosphate cycle will often be referred to as the pentose cycle and the reductive carboxylic acid cycle as the carboxylic acid cycle.) Aside from photosynthetic pathways which are the focus of this article, CO 2 assimilation is also known to sustain autotrophic growth via the acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood et al. 1986). Our aim here is to discuss (i) the findings that led our group to the discovery of the reductive carboxylic acid cycle, (ii) the nature and resolution of the controversy that followed, and (iii) the possible evolutionary implications of the cycle as an ancient mechanism for photosynthetic CO 2 assimilation that preceded the pentose cycle and served as a precursor of the Krebs cycle in aerobic metabolism...|$|R
