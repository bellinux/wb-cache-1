500|$|Its taxonomic {{placement}} {{has been}} controversial {{and subject to}} change. [...] In 1951, Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott assigned O. g. brookei as a subspecies of the Turkestan red pika (Ochotona rutila), but it is now treated as a subspecies of Glover's pika. Pen et al., in 1962, descriped the Muli pika (Ochotona muliensis) as {{a new form of}} the Glover's pika, but it is now considered an independent species based on skull morphology. [...] The Glover's pika was earlier treated as a subspecies of the Turkestan red pika, but it is now <b>considered</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> species based on the skull morphology, pelage color, and zoogeography. It had also been treated as a subspecies of the Chinese red pika (Ochotona erythrotis) partly because of its assignment under the Turkestan red pika. According to morphological and molecular studies,the Glover's pikais closely related to the Chinese red pika and the two are sister groups. In 1948, Argyropulo described the species Ochotona kamensis, and explained it to be the larger and more differentiated than the Chinese red pika and the Glover's pika. In 1985, after observing striking similarities between their skull structures and coat colors, Feng and Zheng synonymized Ochotona kamensis with Ochotona gloveri. In 1988, however, Erbajeva synonymized Ochotona kamensis with Ochotona gloveri brookei, and retained the name kamensis, as she did not use the principle of priority which recognizes the first valid application of a name to a plant or animal.|$|E
