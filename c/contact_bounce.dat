40|$|RF MEMS switch is {{becoming}} the preferred choice for RF switching due to its outstanding performance when compared to conventional counterparts. However, due to its electro-mechanical nature, the RF MEMS switch suffers from reliability issues such as early failure, inconsistent switching characteristics, and higher cost where a driver circuit is necessary to drive the MEMS device. Thus, the reliability and characteristic of the RF MEMS switch have to be improved significantly before it can benefit from a much wider market acceptance. Dielectric charging in MEMS switches {{was reported to be}} one of the causes that limits the lifespan of the device. This phenomenon is mainly due to the high actuation voltage required to activate the MEMS switch where a penetration and trapping of charge carriers occur within the dielectric layer present in most capacitive RF MEMS switches. Other notable causes of early failure of the MEMS switch are mechanical failure and material degradation of the contacting surfaces. Mechanical contact made in metal-tometal MEMS switches improves the insertion loss, however, accelerates the physical failure of the device. <b>Contact</b> <b>bouncing</b> occurrence during the actuation period was reported {{to be one of the}} main factors that accelerates wear and tear of the contacting surfaces. In this work, the dielectric charging was investigated for the conventional driving method and existing charge-reducing actuation schemes through numerical simulation and corroborated by experimental findings. A novel actuation voltage waveform was proposed to effectively minimize the charge accumulation during continuous actuation, thus prolonging the lifetime of the MEMS switches. Also, the <b>contact</b> <b>bouncing</b> occurrence of MEMS switch was analyzed by simulating the dynamic response of the moving component upon contact. The ability of mitigating <b>contact</b> <b>bouncing</b> of the proposed actuation voltage waveform was evaluated and compared to the existing actuation schemes. Experiments were conducted on commercially available RF MEMS switches to support the analytical findings. Apart from life-limiting issues, MEMS switches also suffer from inconsistency of switching response due to parameters variation. The micro-scaled fabrication imperfection causes the devices' parameters to vary which in turn affects the switching characteristics of the MEMS switch such as pull-in and pull-out voltage requirements. In order to examine the robustness of different actuation waveforms to the MEMS switch's parameters variation, the dynamic response of the typical RF MEMS switch was simulated with changeable parameters, and the effects on the switching response were observed. Experiments were carried out to verify the analytical findings. Beside the characteristic variation due to fabrication, the temperature effect on MEMS switches was also investigated. A novel actuation strategy was introduced to optimize the actuation voltage while the MEMS switch is working under varying temperature condition. Finally, a generic MEMS switch driver was developed to implement the proposed actuation voltage waveform. As demonstrated in the analyses, the reliability of electrostatically actuated MEMS switch is expected to improve significantly without any physical changes on the MEMS device by replacing the conventional actuation method with the proposed MEMS switch driver. In addition, the implementation of the proposed Temperature Dependent Actuation Voltage (TDAV) approach was also presented. This actuation method can also be integrated into the proposed MEMS switch driver as an add-on feature when the system is operating under changeable temperature condition...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{high speed}} {{printing}} machines {{are able to}} print up to 700 m/min. At this rate, little excita-tions lead to vibrations, which may lead to loss of contact between the rollers (bouncing). This bouncing results in white stripes, being visible on the printed image. To enable the simulation of the whole printing process, including effects like bouncing, a discrete multibody model is developed. The rollers are modeled by several rigid bodies. These bodies are connected to each other by rotational springs, which allow simulation of the first bending eigenmodes of each roller. The contact area between the rollers is modeled by several nonlinear translational springs and damping elements. These elements change their stiffness and damping values depending on {{the distance between the}} rollers. If a defined distance is exceeded, the values become zero, which represents the loss of <b>contact</b> (<b>bouncing).</b> The unknown spring and damping elements of this model are parametrized with help of an experimental modal analysis.

These switching contacts are tested under conditions typical of MEMS relay applications; 4 V, with a static contact force of 1 mN, at a low current between 20 – 50 mA. The failure of the switch is identified by the evolution of contact resistance which is monitored throughout the switching cycles.

50|$|<b>Contact</b> <b>bounce</b> (also called chatter) is {{a common}} problem with {{mechanical}} switches and relays. Switch and relay contacts are usually made of springy metals. When the contacts strike together, their momentum and elasticity act together to cause them to bounce apart one or more times before making steady contact.

The effect is usually unimportant in power circuits, but causes problems in some analogue and logic circuits that respond fast enough to misinterpret the on‑off pulses as a data stream.|$|E
50|$|The {{effects of}} <b>contact</b> <b>bounce</b> can be {{eliminated}} {{by use of}} mercury-wetted contacts, but these are now infrequently used because of the hazard of mercury release.

In digital systems, multiple samples of the contact state can be taken {{at a low rate}} and examined for a steady sequence, so that contacts can settle before the contact level is considered reliable and acted upon. Bounce in SPDT switch contacts signals can be filtered out using a SR flip-flop (latch) or Schmitt trigger. All of these methods are referred to as 'debouncing'.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vibration or <b>bouncing</b> of {{electrical}} <b>contacts</b> at closure {{is a reason}} of failure occurring in relays, contactors, circuit breakers and other electrical equipment due to arc erosion and welding. Experimentally observed <b>bouncing</b> {{of electrical}} <b>contacts</b> in vacuum circuit breakers cannot be satisfactorily explained by elastic restitution force or electrodynamic repulsion. This paper attempts to estimate the influence of metallic vapour pressure generated by arc in the contact gap on contact motion. The mathematical model describing these phenomena includes a non-linear differential motion equation for a movable contact piece, heat equations for anode and cathode (Axisymmetric Stefan’s problem with two free boundaries for melting and evaporation), a differential equation for the arc column, and non-linear algebraic equations for near-electrode regions. The special method of majorant functions is applied for the solution of this problem. It is found theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the vapour force at <b>contact</b> <b>bouncing</b> is sometimes comparable and may be greater than the contact spring force even in vacuum.

40|$|Auxiliary {{bearings}} {{are used}} in many rotor systems, e. g. those with active magnetic bearings. In {{a case of a}} contact with the auxiliary bearing, high impact forces and wear are possible. Therefore the auxiliary bearings have to be replaced after a certain number of contact events. This is very costly and often needs complete dismantling of the rotor system. In this paper a concept for model based condition monitoring of an auxiliary bearing is developed. The rotor system is modeled in a multibody simulation environment, including the contact to the auxiliary bearing and various fault parameters. After <b>contact</b> (drop or <b>bouncing</b> <b>contact)</b> occurs in the real rotor system, an identification algorithm analyses the measuremental data of the contact event and determines the fault which occurred. Based on the results of the identification algorithm, an optimization tool aligns the rotor simulation with the measurement by varying the fault parameters.

This procedure is performed after each contact event. Hence, a weighting of the load over the surface of the auxiliary bearing is gained.

Traditionally, the design of actuated systems revolves around sizing torques, speeds, and control strategies without considering the system’s passive dynamics.
