50|$|Another {{example of}} a feebate is {{proposed}} in the Rocky Mountain Institute’s 2004 publication, “Winning the Oil Endgame”. For each class of car and light truck, a feebate mechanism is used to reward buyers of vehicles that are more fuel efficient than the average vehicle in that class and penalize buyers of less fuel efficient vehicles. This feebate is revenue-neutral, meaning {{that the amount of}} money <b>collected</b> through fees (<b>surcharges)</b> equals the amount paid out in rebates.|$|R

Over the subsequent five-year period, additional borrowing (made possible by lower borrowing during the first five years), as well as reduced net income to the program, would increase direct spending by $165 million, resulting in no net effect over the 2015-2024 period.|$|R

50|$|On April 9, 1968 East Germany adopted {{its second}} constitution, {{accounting}} for the de facto transformation into a communist dictatorship. Thus the East German government deprived the church bodies of their status as statutory bodies (Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts) and abolished the church tax, by which parishioners' contributions had been automatically <b>collected</b> as a <b>surcharge</b> on the income tax. Now parishioners would have to fix {{the level of their}} contributions and to transfer them again and again on their own. This together with ongoing discrimination of church members, which resulted in many people leaving the church, effectively eroded the financial situation of the church bodies in the East.|$|R

40|$|ALCOHOLISM. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Imposes tax {{surcharge}} upon beer, wine and distilled spirits {{sold in the}} state of 5 cents per ounce of absolute alcohol content plus specified inflation adjustment factor. Proceeds are to be deposited in State Treasury as follows: (1) 30 % to Alcohol Program Services Special Fund. (2) 30 % to Alcohol Traffic Safety, Enforcement, and Prosecution Fund. (3) 10 % to Special Victims Indemnity Fund. (4) 30 % to General Fund. Specifies appropriations and uses of these funds for designated alcohol and related programs, including distribution of portion of funds to counties for designated uses. Contains policy statements and other provisions. Fiscal impact on state and local governments: The Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance advise that the adoption of this measure would generate about $ 160 million in alcoholic beverage surcharge revenues during {{the last half of the}} 1982 - 83 fiscal year, and about $ 400 million during the first full year this measure would be operative, namely 1983 - 84. Beginning in 1985, the surcharge tax rate would be indexed to changes in the U. S. Consumer Price Index. The surcharge revenues would be earmarked for the alcohol programs specified in Sections 32223 and 32224 of this measure. The administrative cost of <b>collecting</b> the <b>surcharge</b> would be funded out of the tax revenues. Therefore, there would be no net additional state costs. Because the surcharge would be part of the sales tax base, state and local governments would receive higher sales taxes as a result of this measure. In 1982 - 83, the additional sales tax revenues would be about $ 10 million and in 1983 - 84, about $ 24 million. These additional sales tax revenues are not earmarked for alcohol programs...|$|R

5000|$|The {{details of}} the {{agreement}} were finalized on December 22, 2006. In the agreement, the City of Orlando will take ownership of the new arena, while the Magic will control the planning and construction of the facility so long as contracting procedures are done in the same public manner as governments advertise contracts. In addition, the City will be paid a part of naming rights and corporate suite sales, a share estimated to be worth $1.75 million {{the first year of}} the arena's opening. The Magic will receive all proceeds from ticket sales for Magic games, while the City will receive all proceeds from ticket sales to all other events. The Orlando Magic will contribute at least $50 million in cash up-front, pick up any cost overruns, and pay rent of $1 million per year for 30 years. The City of Orlando will pay for the land and infrastructure. The remaining money will come from bonds which will be paid off by part of the Orange County, Florida, Tourist Development Tax, <b>collected</b> as a <b>surcharge</b> on hotel stays, which was raised to 6% in 2006.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Over 25 years ago, Congress transformed federal freight rail transportation policy. At that time, after almost 100 years of economic regulation, the railroad industry was in serious economic decline, with rising costs, losses, and bankruptcies. In response, Congress passed the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. Together, these pieces of legislation substantially deregulated the railroad industry. In particular, the 1980 act encouraged greater reliance on competition to set rates and gave railroads increased freedom to price their services according to market conditions, including the freedom to use differential pricing [...] that is, to recover {{a greater proportion of}} their costs from rates charged to those shippers with a greater dependency on rail transportation. At the same time, the 1980 act anticipated that some shippers [...] commonly referred to as "captive shippers" [...] might not have competitive alternatives and gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), and later the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the authority to establish a process through which shippers could obtain relief from unreasonably high rates. This process establishes a threshold for rate relief, allowing a rate to be challenged if it produces revenue equal to or greater than 180 percent of the variable cost of transporting a shipment. Since the passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, we have issued several reports on the freight railroad industry. On October 6, 2006, we issued our most recent report, in which we reported that industry rates and the rates for many commodities (e. g., coal and motor vehicles) had generally declined from 1985 through 2004. We also reported that freight railroad companies do not consistently report revenues raised from fuel surcharges. Some railroads report fuel surcharges as part of their general revenues, others categorize the surcharges separately as "miscellaneous revenue," and still others may not report revenue <b>collected</b> from fuel <b>surcharges</b> at all. This inconsistent reporting led us to recommend that STB review its method of data collection to ensure that all freight railroads are consistently and accurately reporting all revenues collected from shippers. Congress asked us to update our October report using 2005 data, which became available after we issued our report. This report provides that update, including changes in industry and commodity rates, other costs to shippers (such as railcar ownership and miscellaneous revenue), and data on traffic traveling at rates equal to or greater than 180 percent revenue to variable cost (R/VC). ...|$|R
40|$|A growing {{majority}} of climate scientists {{are convinced that}} unless emissions are reduced, global warming would cause a number of adverse effects throughout the United States. In California, rising temperatures would reduce the snow pack in the Sierra-the state's primary source of water-and lead to less water for irrigating farms in the Central Valley. Global warming would {{increase the number of}} extreme heat days and greatly increase the risk of poor air quality across the state. California's 1, 100 miles of coastline and coastal communities are vulnerable to rising sea levels. Concerted action could curb global warming, but all sectors would need to take immediate steps to reduce heattrapping pollution. In California, the transportation sector consumes well over half the oil used statewide, and passenger cars and trucks emit 20 to 30 percent of the state's global warming pollution. Vehicles therefore are a central focus of the immediate action required to reduce global warming. The state of California's regulatory approach involves phasing in limits to average global warming emissions from passenger cars and trucks beginning in 2009 and culminating in 2016. This regulation is often called "Pavley," after its author, Assemblywoman Fran Pavley. The federal government's approach provides tax incentives to buyers of hybrid vehicles, which emit significantly lower amounts of global warming pollution than most conventional vehicles. However, the hybrid incentive affects {{only a small portion of}} the vehicle market. A third approach that could be used to enhance or replace existing regulations would be a feebates program. A feebates program creates a schedule of both fees and rebates that reflects the amount of global warming pollution that different vehicles emit. Purchasers of new vehicles that emit larger amounts of heat-trapping emissions pay a one-time surcharge at the point of purchase. These surcharges are then used to provide rebates to buyers of new vehicles that emit less pollution. A feebates program has several advantages over other approaches: Market-oriented: A feebates program recognizes the power of price signals to change consumer behavior. That is, incentives spur consumers to purchase and manufactures to produce cleaner vehicles. Self-financing: A feebates program can be designed so that the <b>surcharges</b> <b>collected</b> equal the rebates paid. Affects entire market: A feebates program applies to all new vehicles-clean and dirty-spurring a transformation of the entire market. Consumer choice: A feebates program can be designed so that consumers have the option to buy vehicles that carry no surcharge in each vehicle class, such as cars, trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and minivans. This study explores the economic impacts on consumers and manufacturers of the existing Pavley regulation and a feebates program by analyzing four alternative scenarios, using information from 2002 as the base year. Our findings show that a feebates program is an effective strategy to reduce global warming pollution by up to 25 % more than Pavley alone. Also, under a feebates program consumers will save thousands of dollars and retailers will see their revenue rise by as much as 6 %. ...|$|R
