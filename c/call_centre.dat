40|$|One of the {{sectors that}} gained {{most of the}} boost in ICT {{developments}} is the <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> sector. The focus in this paper is on spatial diffusion patterns of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands. The number of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> has increased rapidly {{in the last decade}} and it seems that impacts of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> on the labour market are still underestimated. We will pay attention to two spatial levels: first, regional and second, local. Given the labour intensity and quality required by <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> and the absence of physical contacts with consumers one might expect that most <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are located in the more peripheral regions of the country. In those peripheral regions there is less pressure on the labour market and the level of education - in particular the ability to speak English is almost as good as elsewhere in the country. At the local level we are interested in the precise location of the <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> We expect that they will prefer back office locations or even locations on cheap industrial sites, again due to the absence of physical contacts with consumers. They only will need enough parking space for their employees, since this is a relatively labour intensive economic activity. In this exploratory study we will analyze the spatial diffusion patterns of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands and link them to regional labour market developments and other location factors. call centres; Netherlands; spatial diffusion patterns; labour market...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study of management’s attitudes and {{responses}} to union activities in 20 <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in Western Australia. Australian unions have identified <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> as an important sector to organise, but past research has acknowledged the importance of employer recognition of union rights to organise within the workplace as {{critical to the success}} of a union campaign. In addition, there is now substantial literature illustrating <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> as high control workplaces, and therefore difficult sites for unions to organise, although the question as to what extent these high control strategies reflect management’s attitude towards union organisation in <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> has been much less addressed. This article outlines management's stance towards unions within the sample of Western Australian <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> detailing the forms their co-operation and resistance take. It explores the link between management's control strategies and their attitudes towards unions and, finally, identifies several factors influencing management's stance towards unions. ...|$|R

When a planar figure is the central projection of another planar figure, the center of projection then lies on a spatial circle (<b>called</b> <b>Centre</b> Circle) which is intersected by a sphere S (<b>called</b> <b>Centre</b> Sphere) and a plane perpendicular to this intersection (<b>called</b> <b>Centre</b> Plane). The two equations determining {{the position of the}} Centre Circle can be deduced from Eqs. (2) and (3) respectively.|$|R
