At this time, men will, if they look not well to their doings and goings, be tempted to strain <b>curtesies</b> both with {{conscience}} and with God's Word, and adventure to do things that are dangerous, and that have a tendency to make all their religion and profession vain. This holy Agur was aware of; so he prayed, Let me not be rich and full, lest I deny thee; let me not be poor, lest I steal, and take the name of my God in vain (Prov 30:7-9). There are many inconveniences that attend him that is fallen into decay in this world. It is an evil day with him, and the devils will be as busy with him, as the flies are with a lean and scabbed sheep. It shall go hard but such a man shall be full of maggots; full of silly, foolish, idle inventions, to get up, and to abound with fulness again. It is not a time now, will Satan say, to retain a tender conscience, to regard thy word or promise, to pay for what thou buyest, or to stick at pilfering, and filch from thy neighbour.[32] This Agur was afraid of; therefore he prayed that God would keep him from that which would be to him a temptation to do it. How many in our day have, on these very accounts, brought religion to a very ill savour, and themselves unto the snare of the devil, and all because they have not addicted themselves to pray to God for grace to help in this time of need, but rather have left off the thing that is good, and given up themselves to the temptations of the devil, and the subtle and ensnaring motions of the flesh.|$|R

50|$|Seisin is now {{confined}} to {{possession of the}} freehold, though at one time {{it appears to have}} been used for simple possession without regard to the estate of the possessor. Its importance is considerably less than it was at one time, owing to the old form of conveyance by feoffment with livery of seisin having been superseded by a deed of grant, and the old rule of descent from the person last seised having been abolished in favour of descent from the purchaser. Lord Denning controversially supported the abolition of the concept of seisin, however the common law has since decided to maintain the concept of seisin. At one time the right of the wife to dower and of the husband to an estate by <b>curtesy</b> depended upon the doctrine of seisin. The Dower Act (1833-1834), however, rendered the fact of the seisin of the husband of no importance, and the Married Women's Property Act 1882 practically abolished the old law of <b>curtesy.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{family was}} so favored {{that in order}} to keep {{property}} within the same family, women—who on marriage in effect joined another family—were accorded very few property rights. Therefore, widows were universally disinherited, though they were varyingly entitled to a dower and/or a terce (or <b>curtesy</b> in the case of widowers), that is, one third of the heritable marital estate. The terce was earliest known as tertia collaborationis and first appears in the Ripuarian law code, making it also a localized Germanic custom. In the customs of York and London, for example, a widow was entitled both to her widow's part (customary share) and terce (widow's chamber), the last of which was half—not a third—of the marital estate.|$|E

50|$|Jeroo Billimoria is {{the founder}} of Childline, which is a twenty-four-hour {{helpline}} for children needing help. Billimoria did post graduate work in New York City, becoming involved in a project called “Coalition for the Homeless”, a nonprofit that assists the homeless. “I was very moved by the spirit of survival among the homeless,” Billimoria said. She found herself drawn to the children back home in Bombay, India, and discovered that they needed to be acknowledged, that they were “proud”. The children began calling Billimoria, “Didi”, which means “big sister”. Soon, Billimoria realized that it could take days for a street child to receive help in an emergency, and her idea for Childline was born. Billimoria wanted to network the various organizations that give assistance to children together. Ultimately, Billimoria was inspired to start a twenty-four-hour hotline that could provide immediate response to the needs of Bombay’s street children. Since then, Childline has expanded into forty-two cities, 120 organizations implement the service, and as of October 2002, Childline has fielded over 2.7 million calls. Childline is an organization that deeply cares for the rights of a child, and goes to great lengths to demonstrate respect and <b>curtesy</b> for each individual they work with. Despite all this, Billimoria is humble and acknowledges her weaknesses. Since resigning from Childline, she stated, “I was a lousy administrator”. Billimoria’s genius for setting up a thriving organization that assists children lies in her ability to synthesize available resources by linking various programs together, seeing a problem, and envisioning a bold, simple solution.|$|E

However, one area in which they did not become more equal with men was {{inheritance}} rights. When husbands and wives died without a will, their estates were distributed according to the state's dower and <b>curtesy</b> laws. These laws allowed a husband to inherit more of his wife's estate than she could of his.

40|$|A {{revocable}} {{trust is}} a popular estate planning tool used to disinherit a spouse in sixteen jurisdictions. In common law jurisdictions, a surviving spouse, who is dissatisfied {{with his or her}} inheritance, has the right to receive an elective share of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate regardless of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate plan. However, sixteen jurisdictions have defined a dissatisfied spouse 2 ̆ 7 s rights with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 net probate estate, 2 ̆ 2 allowing one spouse to disinherit the other, by single-handedly transferring his or her assets to a revocable trust. To add insult to injury seven of these common law jurisdictions have recently codified trust law making it seamless for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s creditor to be paid from revocable trust assets. The elective share is one of few limitations imposed on testamentary freedom. Common law property jurisdictions have created a public policybased statute for married persons that prohibit the first-to-die spouse from disinheriting his or her surviving spouse. To avoid disinheritance, common law jurisdictions statutorily protect a surviving spouse (spouse) with an elective share. The elective share arose {{in the early nineteenth century}} as a replacement of dower and <b>curtesy</b> rights. At that time the nature of wealth shifting from real to personal property made dower and <b>curtesy</b> obsolete. The elective share protected the spouse from disinheritance by guaranteeing him or her with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s net probate estate, a method known as the traditional elective share. 2 ̆ 7 However, like the shift from real to personal property there has been a subsequent shift in wealth from probate to non-probate assets (like revocable trusts) making the traditional elective share equally obsolete and inadequate to protect a spouse from disinheritance...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explicate often {{neglected}} problems of courtesy in relation to intercultural communication between Koreans and Japanese. Anecdotal data show that Koreans misunderstand Japanese courtesy and vice versa. These cultures share much in common historically and culturally. This often deludes intercultural communication partners to perceive that courteous behaviors on one side as authentic, and the other side as anomalous. Therefore, a tentative answer to this perceptual problem is to extract underlying values and principles on each side of <b>curtesy</b> systems. Within Korean culture, Confuciusnists' teaching of seniority (choyo no jo) is still operating strongly. However, courteous behavioral restrictions tend to be abandoned among interpersonal relationships other than a senior-junior relationship. The value of this freedom is not to confuse a senior-junior relationships with other relationships, which enables the latter to stay intact. Within Japanese culture, the same principle is still at work. However, courtesy among all relationships seems to remain. The value of this restriction is to redefine existing relationships from a refreshing perspective...|$|E
