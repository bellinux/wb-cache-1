Then, I used axial coding to compare different <b>categories</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategories</b> across the data to establish connections among them. To develop the common pattern of processes involved in GPT, I reviewed the codes developed during first cycle of coding, focused coding, and axial coding to explore the commonality and variations among the <b>categories</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategories</b> to describe the network of interrelationships from the data. As the main relationships among <b>categories</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategories</b> were evolved <b>and</b> recognized, I started writing memos underlying each <b>category,</b> <b>subcategory,</b> <b>and</b> their interrelationships to find the main theme underlying wide range of the processes students applied in both tasks differently. Then, I sorted memos to do theoretical integration of emerging categories to refine comparisons among those relationships to construct the common pattern grounded in data drawn from GPT. I also used diagramming to provide a visual description of <b>categories</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategories</b> to integrate them into one coherent model. I also moved {{back and forth between}} writing memos and drawing diagrams to realize where each category had a strong or weak relation to each <b>subcategory</b> <b>and</b> made attempt to refine the interrelationships underlying emerging processes in both tasks separately. Writing memos, sorting them, and drawing diagrams informed me a common pattern among the six major <b>categories</b> <b>and</b> 16 <b>subcategories</b> in GPT representing the cognitive processes in which participants were engaged to complete the task.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} collect as many Welsh lake legends as possible, {{to produce a}} {{thematic}} classification and to analyse each resultant <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategory</b> from a historical point of view. The collection of lake stories is substantially based upon several reliable works edited during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries, which are also the base for more recent volumes. After an a thorough research, I gathered legends about more than forty lakes. The next step was classifying them into three main categories, namely legends of fairies, legends of catastrophes and legends of magic and ghosts. Finally, the analyses of the tales consisted of identifying relevant folklore motifs, trying to fit them into a historical context within the Celtic world. That process opened the way to propose and revise theories about the appearance of such motives and, to a certain extent, the possible origin of each legend and its influence on later Welsh traditions. In conclusion, the research underlines the importance of lake mythology as a contributor {{to a better understanding of}} Welsh culture...|$|E

40|$|Background: Aim of {{this study}} was to verify a {{systematic}} and practical categorization system that allows dynamic classification of pediatric DPLD irrespective of completeness of patient data. Methods: The study was based on 2322 children submitted to the kids-lung-register between 1997 and 2012. Of these children 791 were assigned to 12 DPLD categories, more than 2 / 3 belonged to categories manifesting primarily in infancy. The work-flow of the pediatric DPLD categorization system included (i) the generation of a final working diagnosis, decision on the presence or absence of (ii) DPLD and (iii) a systemic or lung only condition, and (iv) the allocation to a <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategory.</b> The validity and inter-observer dependency of this workflow was re-tested using a systematic sample of 100 cases. Results: Two blinded raters allocated more than 80 % of the re-categorized cases identically. Non-identical allocation was due to lack of appreciation of all available details, insufficient knowledge of the classification rules by the raters, incomplete patient data, and shortcomings of the classification system itself. Conclusions: This study provides a suitable workflow and hand-on rules for the categorization of pediatric DPLD. Potential pitfalls were identified and a foundation was laid for the development of consensus-based, international categorization guidelines...|$|E

Problem descriptions that were not formulated clearly enough to enable the reviewer to understand the corresponding error or difficulty were not taken into account. Furthermore, close calls and operational difficulties were only taken into account and recorded if the corresponding problem was not described as a use error in the corresponding article. In this context, all issues {{that could not be}} unambiguously classified as use errors were considered to be operational difficulties. All extracted items were cross-checked by a second expert.

Participants completed a category fluency task in each of their languages in three main categories (animals, clothing, food), each with two subcategories, {{as well as a}} language use questionnaire assessing their proficiency in each of their languages. Multivariate analyses of variance revealed that the average number of correct items named in the category fluency task across the three main categories varied across the different groups for English items only. A series of repeated-measures analyses of covariance revealed that the exposure component that had been extracted from the language use questionnaire using a principal component analysis significantly affected the average number of items named across the three main categories. When the effect of exposure was controlled, the effect of language combination was no longer significant. A regression analysis showed that the relative amount of exposure participants had to each of their languages predicted participants’ relative performance in each language. Additional multivariate analyses of variance found significant differences in the number of correct items named in each main <b>category</b> <b>and</b> <b>subcategory</b> in both English and participants’ other language based on language combination. Overall, these results demonstrate the effects of particular language combinations on bilingual lexical access and provide important insights into the role of proficiency on access...|$|E
