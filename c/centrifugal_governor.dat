50|$|<b>Centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> {{were used}} to {{regulate}} the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the 17th century.

2500|$|Even {{prior to}} the terms being applied, James Clerk Maxwell had {{described}} several kinds of [...] "component motions" [...] associated with the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> used in steam engines, distinguishing between those that lead to a continual increase in a disturbance or the amplitude of an oscillation, and those that lead to a decrease of the same.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} the {{centrifugal}} force can be applied in rotating devices, such as centrifuges, <b>centrifugal</b> pumps, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governors,</b> and <b>centrifugal</b> clutches, and in centrifugal railways, planetary orbits and banked curves, when they are analyzed in a rotating coordinate system.

25|$|Although {{control systems}} {{of various types}} date back to antiquity, a more formal {{analysis}} of the field began with a dynamics analysis of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor,</b> conducted by the physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1868, entitled On Governors. This described and analyzed the phenomenon of self-oscillation, in which lags in the system may lead to overcompensation and unstable behavior. This generated a flurry {{of interest in the}} topic, during which Maxwell's classmate, Edward John Routh, abstracted Maxwell's results for the general class of linear systems. Independently, Adolf Hurwitz analyzed system stability using differential equations in 1877, resulting in what is now known as the Routh–Hurwitz theorem.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E

50|$|Maxwell himself {{developed}} the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and published the first scientific treatment of control theory. Control theory {{is the basis}} for process control, which is widely used in automation, particularly for process industries, and for controlling ships and airplanes. Control theory was developed to analyze the functioning of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governors</b> on steam engines. These governors came into use in the late 18th century on wind and water mills to correctly position the gap between mill stones, and were adapted to steam engines by James Watt. Improved versions were used to stabilize automatic tracking mechanisms of telescopes and to control speed of ship propellers and rudders. However, those governors were sluggish and oscillated about the set point. James Clerk Maxwell wrote a paper mathematically analyzing the actions of governors, which {{marked the beginning of the}} formal development of control theory. The science was continually improved and evolved into an engineering discipline.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{applications of}} process control were mechanisms that adjusted {{the gap between}} mill stones for grinding grain and for keeping windmills facing into the wind. [...] The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> used for adjusting the mill stones was copied by James Watt for controlling speed of steam engines in response to changes in heat load to the boiler; however, if the load on the engine changed the governor only held the speed steady at the new rate. [...] It took much development work to achieve the degree of steadiness necessary to operate textile machinery. [...] A mathematical analysis of control theory was first developed by James Clerk Maxwell. [...] Control theory was developed to its [...] "classical" [...] form by the 1950s.

6000|$|The {{hypothesis}} of Lamarck--that progressive changes in {{species have been}} produced by the attempts of animals to increase {{the development of their}} own organs, and thus modify their structure and habits--has been repeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties and species, and it seems to have been considered that when this was done the whole question has been finally settled; but the view here developed renders such hypothesis quite unnecessary, by showing that similar results must be produced by the action of principles constantly at work in nature. The powerful retractile talons of the falcon-and the cat-tribes have not been produced or increased by the volition of those animals; but among the different varieties which occurred in the earlier and less highly organized forms of these groups, those always survived longest which had the greatest facilities for seizing their prey. Neither did the giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the foliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for the purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its antitypes with a longer neck than usual at once secured a fresh range of pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions, and on the first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them. Even the peculiar colours of many animals, more especially of insects, so closely resembling the soil or leaves or bark on which they habitually reside, are explained on the same principle; for though in the course of ages varieties of many tints may have occurred, yet those races having colours best adapted to concealment from their enemies would inevitably survive the longest. We have also here an acting cause to account for that balance so often observed in nature,--a deficiency in one set of organs always being compensated by an increased development of some others--powerful wings accompanying weak feet, or great velocity making up for the absence of defensive weapons; for {{it has been shown that}} all varieties in which an unbalanced deficiency occurred could not long continue their existence. The action of this principle is exactly like that of the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>governor</b> of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow. An origin such as is here advocated will also agree with the peculiar character of the modifications of form and structure which obtain in organized beings--the many lines of divergence from a central type, the increasing efficiency and power of a particular organ through a succession of allied species, and the remarkable persistence of unimportant parts, such as colour, texture of plumage and hair, form of horns or crests, through a series of species differing considerably in more essential characters. It also furnishes us with a reason for that [...] "more specialized structure" [...] which Professor Owen states to be a characteristic of recent compared with extinct forms, and which would evidently be the result of the progressive modification of any organ applied to a special purpose in the animal economy.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} chaos {{suppression of}} the mechanical <b>centrifugal</b> flywheel <b>governor</b> system with output constraint and fully unknown parameters via adaptive dynamic surface control. To have a certain understanding of chaotic nature of the mechanical <b>centrifugal</b> flywheel <b>governor</b> system and subsequently design its controller, the useful tools like the phase diagrams and corresponding time histories are employed. By using tangent barrier Lyapunov function, a dynamic surface control scheme with neural network and tracking differentiator is developed to transform chaos oscillation into regular motion and the output constraint rule is not broken in whole process. Plugging second-order tracking differentiator into chaos controller tackles the “explosion of complexity” of backstepping and improves the accuracy {{in contrast with the}} first-order filter. Meanwhile, Chebyshev neural network with adaptive law whose input only depends on a subset of Chebyshev polynomials is derived to learn the behavior of unknown dynamics. The boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system is verified in stability analysis. Finally, the results of numerical simulations illustrate effectiveness and exhibit the superior performance of the proposed scheme by comparing with the existing ADSC method...|$|R

5000|$|Automatic {{control systems}} were first {{developed}} over {{two thousand years}} ago. The first feedback control device on record {{is thought to be}} the ancient Ktesibios's water clock in Alexandria, Egypt around the third century BCE.

This certainly was a successful device as water clocks of similar design were still being made in Baghdad when the Mongols captured the city in 1258 A.D. A variety of automatic devices have been used over the centuries to accomplish useful tasks or simply to just entertain. The latter includes the automata, popular in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, featuring dancing figures that would repeat the same task over and over again; these automata are examples of open-loop control.
