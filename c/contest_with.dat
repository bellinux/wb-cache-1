5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E

5|$|In week 9, the Wolverines {{traveled}} to Champaign, Illinois for a Halloween afternoon <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> the Illinois Fighting Illini.

5|$|The National Reorganization Process {{dictatorship}} {{came to an}} end in 1983, when Raúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections.

He was helped by the clergy of the province, who opposed the radical candidate because of his secularism.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, on 6 November 1912, Oxford {{hosted the}} South African team touring the United Kingdom and France. Dingle played at centre. It {{was a close}} <b>contest,</b> <b>with</b> South Africa coming through to win 6–0. After the Springboks' convincing victory over Cambridge a little later, Oxford were favourites to win the Varsity Match and to add to their winning series. Dingle was unable to play due to injury, missing a game that went against the odds.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 2011–12 season, the Hokies lost star Malcolm Delaney, {{who signed}} a {{conditional}} one-year contract with the French professional basketball team Élan Chalon following his senior year. Garland debuted as a sophomore on November 12, 2011 against East Tennessee State, making his first-ever start at the collegiate level due {{to the absence of}} Erick Green. He played 24 minutes throughout the game, recording 13 points, 3 assists, and 2 steals. In Tech's next <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> Monmouth, Garland scored a career-high 18 points off the bench, shooting 7-for-7 from the field.|$|E
5|$|First-class cricket {{was first}} played in South Africa in the {{previous}} 1888–89 season, when Robert Warton managed a side which toured the country, playing against representative teams {{from each of the}} provinces, and two matches against South Africa, which were later adjudged to have Test cricket status. During that tour, Donald Currie donated the Currie Cup to be awarded to the team which performed best against the touring side; which was judged to be Kimberley. In other first-class matches during the 1889–90 season, Kimberley faced Natal twice, winning both matches. Transvaal did not play any first-class cricket prior to their Currie Cup <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> Kimberley.|$|E
5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé {{to have said}} that he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the <b>contest.</b> <b>With</b> Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E

5|$|If the {{election}} {{had been left}} to the papacy, Ernst {{would have been the}} choice, but the Pope was {{not a member of the}} Cathedral Chapter and Gebhard had the support of several of the Catholic, and all the Protestant, canons in the Chapter. In December 1577, he was chosen Elector and Archbishop of Cologne after a spirited <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> the papacy's candidate, Ernst: Gebhard won {{the election}} by two votes. Although it was not required of him, Gebhard agreed to undergo priestly ordination; he was duly consecrated in March 1578, and swore to uphold the Council of Trent's decrees.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{the court}} {{moved into the}} new Oregon Supreme Court Building, and McNary filed to run for a full six-year term on the bench. At that time the office was partisan, and McNary lost the Republican primary, by a single vote, to Henry L. Benson, after several recounts and the {{discovery}} of uncounted ballots. After his defeat, he served {{the remainder of his}} partial term and left the court in 1915. On July 8, 1916, after a close, multiballot <b>contest,</b> <b>with</b> several contenders, the Republican State Committee elected McNary to be the chair. He was seen as someone who could unify the progressive and conservative wings of the party in Oregon.|$|E

5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street.

5|$|Michigan's rushing {{touchdown}} {{in the fourth quarter}} snapped a streak of 24 quarters where Iowa hadn't allowed a rushing touchdown (dating back to the Orange Bowl vs. Georgia Tech). With his rushing performance, Denard Robinson surpassed 1,000 rushing yards for the season, becoming just the second Big Ten quarterback to accomplish the feat in conference history. Indiana's Antwaan Randle El established the Big Ten record for rushing yards by a quarterback (1,270) in 2000. Robinson ended the <b>contest</b> <b>with</b> 1,096 rushing yards on the year.|$|E
5|$|Nixon won the Republican {{primary and}} Douglas the Democratic <b>contest,</b> <b>with</b> each also {{finishing}} {{third in the}} other party's contest (Boddy finished second in both races). The contentious Democratic race left the party divided, and Democrats were slow to rally to Douglas—some even endorsed Nixon. The Korean War broke out only days after the primaries, and both Nixon and Douglas contended that the other had often voted with Marcantonio {{to the detriment of}} national security. Nixon's attacks were far more effective, and he won the November 7 general election by almost 20percentage points, carrying 53 of California's 58counties and all metropolitan areas.|$|E
