Moynihan as director and sole shareholder was asked by the council on 23 November 1995 to remove the waste or the council would under EPA 1990 ss 33 and 59 do it at Moynihan’s expense. Moynihan replied by fax, and the council removed the waste for £200,000. Two weeks later, under EPA 1990 section 71(2) it demanded that Moynihan provide details of (1) people, companies and hospitals hat had supplied waste to Green (2) who carried waste on its behalf (3) staff employed to handle the waste (4) companies Green employed to dispose of the waste (5) suppliers or hirers of the trailers (6) keepers of any vehicles used to collect the waste (7) locations of any other sites Green used and (8) where three bins previously at the site now were. On the advice of his solicitor, Green replied he would give information if he was given the assurance that none of it would be used a prosecution.

40|$|Severe {{malnutrition}} is a {{major health}} problem in developing countries and can present itself as kwashiorkor or marasmus. Although marasmus is characterized by <b>clinical</b> <b>wasting,</b> kwashiorkor is associated with peripheral edema, oxidative stress, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoglycemia. The etiology of the hypoglycemia is poorly understood. We determined endogenous glucose production (EGP) in children with severe malnutrition. Children with kwashiorkor, marasmus, and controls received a primed constant infusion of [6, 6 H(2) ]glucose for 2 h. An i. v. bolus of C- 13 -ketoisocaproic acid (KIC) was given, and breath samples were obtained during 2 h. Isotope dilution was used to calculate EGP, and (CO 2) -C- 13 /(CO 2) -C- 12 production was determined. Mean EGP +/- SEM was 5. 5 +/- 0. 3 mg/kg/min in the kwashiorkor group and 6. 9 +/- 0. 4 mg/kg/min and 7. 6 +/- 0. 7 mg/kg/min in the marasmic and control group, respectively, (p < 0. 05 kwashiorkor versus marasmus and controls). EGP correlated with serum albumin concentration (r = 0. 67; p < 0. 001) and urinary 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine as a marker of oxidative stress (r = - 0. 62; p < 0. 005). (CO 2) -C- 13 secretion as a marker of hepatic mitochondrial function was significantly higher in the marasmic group compared with kwashiorkor and controls.

Compliance with the Botswana <b>Clinical</b> <b>Waste</b> Management Code of Practice, 1996 and Waste Management Act, 1998 and other related documents were used as standards to assess <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management practices. The waste management practices were analysed for a week in each healthcare facility to capture the daily management practices. The generated <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> was weighed to compute the generation rates and was followed through the various management practices to the final disposal. Findings of the study revealed that <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> generation rates were: 0. 75 kg/patient/day for Princess Marina Hospital and 0. 1 - 0. 3 kg/patient/day for clinics and health posts. Numerous aspects of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> management were found to comply with the expected rules and standards at Princess Marina Hospital, but the clinics and health posts had less appropriate practices. <b>Clinical</b> <b>waste</b> generated at Princess Marina Hospital is quantified in reliable records and dedicated Infectious Control Officers are responsible for monitoring the {{management of}} <b>clinical</b> <b>waste.</b> The study revealed that clinics and health posts do not quantify <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> and there are no officers responsible for monitoring <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> and there are no documents for monitoring the management of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste.</b> The main treatment method of <b>clinical</b> <b>waste</b> for the surveyed healthcare facilities is incineration and it is being done properly.
