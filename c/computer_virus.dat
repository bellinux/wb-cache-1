5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they {{come to understand the}} workings of the Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a <b>computer</b> <b>virus)</b> and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a <b>computer</b> <b>virus</b> into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

Sam and Max access the program themselves and introduce a <b>computer</b> <b>virus</b> that crashes Reality 2.0 and deletes the digital embodiment of the Internet. Prior to expiring, the Internet reveals that it was following the plans of one Roy G. Biv. Sam eventually deduces that Roy G. Biv is actually Hugh Bliss, a character seemingly in the background of all their previous cases. The Freelance Police travel to Bliss' Prismatology retreat on the Moon, where Bliss is preparing a device to hypnotize the entire planet. Bliss reveals himself as a colony of sentient bacteria that feeds off of the endorphins produced by human happiness; by hypnotizing the planet, Bliss assures himself of a permanent supply of nourishment. Bliss activates the device, but is killed when Sam tricks him into a tank of water and boils it using the rocket engine of a lunar lander. Returning to Earth, Max takes great pleasure in reversing the hypnotism by personally knocking everyone on the planet unconscious.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} towards the detection of metamorphic <b>computer</b> <b>viruses</b> through the algebraic specification of an assembly language. Metamorphic <b>computer</b> <b>viruses</b> are <b>computer</b> <b>viruses</b> that apply a variety of syntax-mutating, behaviour-preserving metamorphoses to their code in order to defend themselves against static analysis based detection methods. An overview of these metamorphoses is given. Then, {{in order to identify}} behaviourally equivalent instruction sequences, the syntax and semantics of a subset of the IA- 32 assembly language instruction set is specified formally using OBJ – an algebraic specification formalism and theorem prover based on order-sorted equational logic. The concepts of equivalence and semi-equivalence are given formally, and a means of proving equivalence from semi-equivalence is given. The OBJ specification is shown to be useful for proving the equivalence or semi-equivalence of IA- 32 instruction sequences by applying reductions – sequences of equational rewrites in OBJ. These proof methods are then applied to fragments of two different metamorphic <b>computer</b> <b>viruses,</b> Win 95 /Bistro and Win 9 x. Zmorph. A, in order to prove their (semi-) equivalence. Finally, the application of these methods to the detection of metamorphic <b>computer</b> <b>viruses</b> in general is discussed...|$|R
