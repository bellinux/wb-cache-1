People won't take sufficient notice of one, don't you know. I remember Powell so well simply because {{as one of the}} Shipping Masters in the Port of London he dispatched me to sea on several long stages of my sailor's pilgrimage. He resembled Socrates. I mean he resembled him genuinely: that is in the face. A philosophical mind is but an accident.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a test system for dynamically and/or cyclically load testing a material sample, a component, or an assembly, hereinafter {{referred to as}} sample. The test system is provided with a test frame, to which a bearing and a <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> are attached. At least one actuator consisting of a multifunctional solid state transducer material system is connected to the <b>counter</b> <b>bearing,</b> directly or indirectly, to which, also directly or indirectly, a fastening means is attached for one-sided detachable, firm fixation of the sample.

40|$|Phosphonium halides are a {{class of}} {{compounds}} containing a tetrahedral phosphorus cation with a halogen acting as a <b>counter</b> ion. Analogues <b>bearing</b> the alkyl triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation have been employed as reagents in organic synthesis and as fertilizers, they are known to inhibit mitochondrial function specifically in cancerous cells, and their role as surfactants in polymer-cellulose and polymer-clay nanocomposites has been explored. The revelations made above make it essential to fully characterize the different components of phosphonium halides including the local electronic environment surrounding the halogen nuclei and how this relates to the different packing motifs in the crystal structures. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) is a tool developed {{for this type of}} analysis for halogen nuclei and has been explored by our group frequently in recent years [1]. We report here on our initial efforts to completely characterize the 79 / 81 Br electric field gradient (EFG) and chemical shift (CS) tensors for phosphonium bromides bearing the TPP moiety. The National Ultrahigh-Field NMR Facility for Solids was paramount in this undertaking as it permitted (i) the more accurate measurement of CS anisotropy since this subtle effect is accentuated at higher magnetic fields, and (ii) performing 81 Br MAS experiments (vrot = 31. 25 kHz and 62. 50 kHz), as the second-order quadrupolar broadening is diminished significantly compared to spectra obtained with our 11. 75 T magnet at the University of Ottawa.

30|$|The {{forces in}} the {{osteotomy}} in indirect loading reached {{less than half of}} the amount of those in direct loading. Strengthening the <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> of the distal bone fragment, which in the experimental set-up consisted of the four elastic wires, can be expected to result in higher {{forces in the}} osteotomy. A higher stability may be achieved with additional wires or half pins, as demonstrated in particular for axial frame stiffness [8, 10]. Most of the applied axial forces at indirect loading bypassed the osteotomy via the frame instead of being transferred through the osteotomy, which resulted in higher mechanical stress on the frame and wires in general and could lead to higher failure rates from material yielding.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop an advanced-bearing couple for TKA that optimizes the balance between wear resistance and mechanical properties. The mechanical and structural properties of virgin and highly crosslinked, re-melted UHMWPE were evaluated, and tibial inserts manufactured from these UHMWPE materials were tested against either oxidized zirconium (OxZr) or CoCr femoral components on a knee simulator. This study confirmed that the wear resistance of crosslinked UHMWPE improves with increasing radiation dose but is accompanied by a concomitant reduction in mechanical properties. Compared to CoCr, the ceramic surface of OxZr allows the use of a lower irradiation dose to achieve equivalent reductions in wear rates. As a result, a given wear rate can be achieved without sacrificing the mechanical properties to the same extent that is necessary with a CoCr femoral component. The advantage of ceramic <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces extends to both pristine and microabrasive conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{variable}} torsion stiff-ness (VTS) aiming on biomechanical applications like prosthetic knee joints. By varying the effective {{length of a}} torsional elastic element via a relocatable <b>counter</b> <b>bearing,</b> the stiffness of a rotational joint is adjusted. This functional concept is described in detail by the authors {{as well as the}} design of such VTS joints. Additionally, analytical models for the transfer behaviour of drivetrain and stiffness control are derived. These are used for a simulative evaluation of a pendulum driven by a VTS unit. Based on the results of this simulation, the power requirements of VTS are analysed. Furthermore, an analysis of its structural strength is presented. For practical comprehensibility, the example of the design of a prosthetic knee joint is taken up for several times in this paper. Finally, the concept, modeling and design of VTS as well as the simulation results are concluded and discussed in a final assessment and in comparison to other contemporary concepts. I...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion {{in water}} {{is based on}} the {{interaction}} of motion body and water, respectively (under the condition of limited energy reservoir). The swimming movements are transmitting momentum creating a flow in the aquatic surrounding. Self-propulsion is a mutual result of a transfer of momentum from the propelling parts of the body on the water as well as a transfer of impulse from the water on the body, producing a <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> (a term indicating the application of Newton’s 3 rd Law) and leaving thereby some traces. In water the traces are useful for discussions about the efficiency of swimming techniques. Here the traces of vortex (a common term for mass of whirling fluid) are emphasised. Vortices occur in different organized patterns, as trailing vortex next to the hands (front driven body) or rolling vortex {{in the wake of the}} feet (rear driven body). Trailing vortex create a zone of underpressure: it is hypothised that the hand is resited by this suction from the intended pull through the water and thus the action of the trunk-arm muscles propels the body past the hand. Rolling vortex may transfer a power stroke to the body in case the sense of its rotation is altered...|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{split into two}} parts: {{in the first part}} the {{different}} dynamic damage indicators are defined and applied to beam and slab structures under laboratory conditions, whereas the present second part deals with experiments carried out on two real post-tensioned bridges. The damage indicators defined in part one are based on swept sine excitation and esveal the drop of the eigenfrequencies, the changes in damping, the varying dependency range of the first eigenfrequency on excitation force amplitude and the occurrence of higher harmonics, which changed the Total Harmonic Distorsion (THD) and a special transfer-function called TF or FRFsmall. In the first part it was proved that the amount of nonlinearities varies with damage and that harmonic excitation is favorable for good test conditions. In the laboratory this can easily be done using an electric or hydraulic shaker, but on real bridges this kind of excitation becomes more complicated due to the higher forces and the necessity to provide <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> for any shaker system. That is why two machines were designed and used to excite big structures harmonically, e. g. real bridges in this part. The different indicators are applied to assess the state of two post-tensioned bridges, which had been in good order and condition before artificial damage in multiple steps was caused. It turns out that the decrease in the eigenfrequencies is the most important damage indicator, provided temperature and mass dependant effects can be eliminated. All other indicators may be used as supplements to give correct tendencies, but no strict limits...|$|E
40|$|Where {{the complex}} form shapes of work pieces require five-axes {{machining}} in highest precision, the machine {{systems that are}} available on the market, are often limited in their accuracy (spatial positioning accuracy < 10 mym). In previous enquiries, the five-axes machining accuracy was identified as limiting factor for the high precision manufacturing of complex micro parts for high end applications. Especially the rotary axes of conventional five-axes machine design affect the machine accuracy significantly. For this reason the Fraunhofer IPT initiated a research project focusing on the reduction of the rotational axis error by implementing an integral design strategy consequently. A concept has been developed integrating hydrostatic bearings into a torque motor. Therefore electrotechnical as well as mechanical issues have been worked out following the integral resolution method for increasing the five-axes accuracy. Focusing on the reduction of the error activating cantilevers caused by the rotary axes, a concept has been worked out integrating hydrostatic bearings into a torque motor. Thereby, a radial bearing is integrated into the air gap of the torque motor while two axial bearings are positioned in-between the work piece table and the face side of the motor. Following the integral design idea principally, the bearing pockets are integrated into the primary part of the drive and the <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces are provided by the work piece table, the motor's face side and the circumference of the rotor. The integration of the radial hydrostatic bearing changes the electro-magnetical, the mechanical as well as the thermal conditions of the torque motor although the bearing behaviour will be affected by the mechanical stiffness (gap variation) and by the temperature (gap variation and oil viscosity) of the torque motor...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} {{of complex}} micro parts requires five-axis machining accuracy {{that is not}} covered by currently available machine systems. For this reason, the Fraunhofer IPT investigates strategies for the enhancement of positioning accuracy, stiffness and damping of five-axis machine systems. The 'Integral Design' describes one possibility to follow precision design rules by integrating several functions in one item {{in order to reduce}} error activating cantilevers andjoint patches. Hence, the volumetric positioning accuracy as well as the overall machine stiffness can be enhanced and thermal errors can be reduced, too. This work exemplifies the integration of a hydrostatic radial bearing into a torque motor in order to decrease the error influences of a rotary swivel stage by reducing the Steiner Distance (from centre of gravity to pivot axis) and the Pivot Distance. Hereby, a carbon fibre bushing with hydrostatic bearing pockets is integrated into the primary part of a torque motor while a magnet coating realises the hydrostatic <b>counter</b> <b>bearing</b> face. The principal project idea, the design and the manufacturing of the components with bearing function is described in the following. The integral design follows precision design fundamentals and focuses on the reduction of cantilevers affecting Abbe, Pivot and Thermal Errors as well as the static and dynamic machine behaviour. The described integral rotary axis is realised by the integration of a hydrostatic radial bearing into a torque drive. A fibre composite bushing with five integrated hydrostatic pockets and oil supply is manufactured and fitted into the primary part whereas the bearing counter face is made by a 2 K-epoxy mass, that is cast on the rotor side, also protecting the magnets. The axial bearing is directly placed under the workpiece table for highest damping and stiffness against tilt movement. Due to a magnet restrictive measuring system only one non-contact sealing system needs to be integrated, separating the drive, bearing and measuring system towards the process. In comparison to a given partial design rotary stage, the Steiner Distance is reduced by 27 %, the Steiner Inertia by more than 50 % and the torque drive by 35 %. This provides the potential to increase the accuracy of five-axes machines as required. Furthermore, the given integral design can be translated to conventional machine tools supporting further accuracy enhancements...|$|E
