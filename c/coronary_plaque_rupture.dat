50|$|These effects {{result from}} coagulation, which is {{normally}} prevented in the vascular endothelium by expression of antithrombotic factors on its surface. Sepsis, which causes disruption and apoptosis of endothelial cells {{results in the}} endothelium switching to a procoagulant phenotype. This promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation. Moreover, only once disruption of the plaque surface has occurred are these prothrombotic effects likely to be significant in the pathogenesis of ACS. Sepsis is also largely associated with haemodynamic changes. Coronary artery perfusion pressure is reduced in peripheral vasodilation, which results in reduced blood pressure and reduced myocardial contractility. Endothelial dysfunction induces coronary vasoconstriction. This is caused by catecholamine release and by infections. Severe infections lead to increase myocardial metabolic demands and hypoxia. When neuronal tissue is deprived of adequate oxygen, the haemodynamic response has less of an effect at active neuronal tissue. All of these disturbances {{increase the likelihood of}} ACS, due to <b>coronary</b> <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> and thrombosis.

BackgroundVarious in-vitro studies have demonstrated that shear stress of the vascular lumen is one of the important determinants of coronary plaque vulnerability. However, the in-vivo relationship between shear stress and plaque rupture is still unclear. MethodsIn the present study, 3 -dimensional IVUS was used to obtain spatial information on luminal geometry from 20 patients with acute coronary syndrome having a distinct ulcerative lesion. These 3 -dimensional contours for each lumen were first reconstructed into mesh polygons, and then analyzed by means of a program for calculating the fluid dynamics. The flow was considered to be a constant laminar one. Then, colorized mappings of the distribution of the streamline, blood pressure, and shear stress were performed. The original luminal contour for each ruptured lesion was obtained by smoothing and extrapolation. ResultsAll patients had a <b>coronary</b> <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> in the proximal or top portion of the plaque hill. In the color mapping, localized elevation of blood pressure and shear stress could be observed on each plaque surface.

BackgroundThe concept of multiple <b>coronary</b> <b>plaque</b> <b>ruptures</b> has been established. However, no detailed follow-up studies of <b>ruptured</b> <b>plaques</b> in nonculprit lesions have yet been reported. MethodsForty-eight thrombi in 50 <b>ruptured</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>plaques</b> in nonculprit lesions in 30 patients {{were identified by}} angioscopy. The percent diameter stenosis (%DS) at the target <b>plaques</b> on quantitative <b>coronary</b> angiographic analysis and the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level were measured.

Thirty-five superimposed thrombi still remained at follow-up, and the predominant thrombus color changed from red (56 %) at baseline to pinkish-white (83 %) at follow-up. The healing rate increased according to the angioscopic follow-up period (23 % at ≤ 12 months vs. 55 % at > 12 months, p = 0. 044). The %DS at the healed plaque increased from baseline to follow-up (12. 3 ± 5. 8 % vs. 22. 7 ± 11. 6 %, respectively; p = 0. 0004).

As MMP expression can be promoted by the modified lipoproteins, oxidative stress and hyperglycaemia that characterises Type 2 diabetes, we hypothesised that peripheral monocytes in these patients, exposed to these factors in vivo, would demonstrate increased MMP production compared to controls. Methods We examined peripheral venous monocyte expression of MMP and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 (TIMP- 1) in 18 controls and 22 subjects with Type 2 diabetes and no previous cardiovascular complications.

Reliable diagnostic of the different plaque types are of great interest for the medical community the predicting their evolution and applying an effective treatment.

In this paper, a method to reconstruct IVUS images from the raw Radio Frequency (RF) data coming from ultrasound catheter is proposed. This framework offers a normalization scheme to compare accurately different patient studies. The automatic tissue classification is based on texture analysis and Adapting Boosting (Adaboost) learning technique combined with Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC).

Investigation of biomarkers {{in the context}} of de novo <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> in humans is confounded by the inability to attribute the <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> as the source of biomarker release, as <b>plaque</b> <b>ruptures</b> are typically associated with prompt down-stream events of myocardial necrosis and systemic inflammation. METHODS: We developed a novel approach to identify potential biomarkers of <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> by integrating <b>plaque</b> imaging, using optical coherence tomography, with both plaque and plasma proteomic analysis in a human model of angioplasty-induced plaque disruption. RESULTS: We compared two pairs of <b>coronary</b> <b>plaque</b> debris, captured by a FilterWire Device, and their corresponding control samples and found matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) to be significantly enriched in plaque. Plaque contents, as defined by optical coherence tomography, affect the systemic changes of MMP 9. Disruption of lipid-rich plaque led to prompt elevation of plasma MMP 9, whereas disruption of non-lipid-rich plaque resulted in delayed elevation of plasma MMP 9. Systemic MMP 9 elevation is independent of the associated myocardial necrosis and systemic inflammation (measured by Troponin I and C-reactive protein, respectively). This information guided the selection of a subset of subjects of for further label free proteomics analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We discovered five novel, plaque-enriched proteins (lipopolysaccharide binding protein, Annexin A 5, eukaryotic translocation initiation factor, syntaxin 11, cytochrome B 5 reductase 3) to be significantly elevated in systemic circulation at 5  min after plaque disruption.

Cardiovascular events (cardiovas-cular death, myocardial infarction [MI], ischemic stroke [CVA], and emergency hospitalization for unstable angina) were determined during 42 months of follow-up. Patients experiencing a cardiovascular event (n 19) had similar baseline characteristics to those free of events. Substance P caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma t-PA concentrations (P 0. 001). However, net t-PA release was 72 % lower in the patients who experienced death, MI, or CVA, and 48 % lower in those who suffered death, MI, CVA or hospitalization for unstable angina (P 0. 05). Major adverse cardiovascular events were most frequent in those with the lowest fibrinolytic capacity (P 0. 03 for trend); patients with the lowest quartile of t-PA release had the highest rate of adverse events (P 0. 01). Conclusion—Endothelial fibrinolytic capacity, as measured by stimulated t-PA release, predicts the future risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease. We suggest that endothelial fibrinolytic capacity is...|$|E
40|$|Acute mental {{stress is}} a potent trigger of acute {{coronary}} syndromes. Catecholamine-induced hypercoagulability with acute stress contributes to thrombus growth after <b>coronary</b> <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture.</b> Melatonin may diminish catecholamine activity. We hypothesized that melatonin mitigates the acute procoagulant stress response and that this effect {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in the stress-induced catecholamine surge. Forty-five healthy young men received a single oral dose of either 3 mg melatonin (n = 24) or placebo medication (n = 21). One hour thereafter, they underwent a standardized short-term psychosocial stressor. Plasma levels of clotting factor VII activity (FVII:C), FVIII:C, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and catecholamines were measured at rest, immediately after stress, and 20 min and 60 min post-stress. The integrated change in D-dimer levels from rest to 60 min post-stress differed between medication groups controlling for demographic and metabolic factors (P = 0. 047, eta(p) (2) = 0. 195). Compared with the melatonin group, the placebo group showed a greater increase in absolute D-dimer levels from rest to immediately post-stress (P = 0. 13; eta(p) (2) = 0. 060) and significant recovery of D-dimer levels from immediately post-stress to 60 min thereafter (P = 0. 007; eta(p) (2) = 0. 174). Stress-induced changes in FVII:C, FVIII:C, fibrinogen, and catecholamines did not significantly differ between groups. Oral melatonin attenuated the stress-induced elevation in the sensitive coagulation activation marker D-dimer without affecting catecholamine activity. The finding provides preliminary support for a protective effect of melatonin in reducing the atherothrombotic risk with acute mental stress...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although plaque erosion causes {{approximately}} 40 % of all coronary thrombi and disproportionally affects {{women more}} than men, its mechanism {{is not well}} understood. The role of tissue mechanics in <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> and regulation of mechanosensitive inflammatory proteins is well established, but their role in plaque erosion is unknown. Given obvious differences in morphology between <b>plaque</b> erosion and <b>rupture,</b> we hypothesized that inflammation in general {{as well as the}} association between local mechanical strain and inflammation known to exist in <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> may not occur in plaque erosion. Therefore, our objective was to determine if similar mechanisms underlie <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> and <b>plaque</b> erosion. Methods and Results: We studied a total of 74 human <b>coronary</b> <b>plaque</b> specimens obtained at autopsy. Using lesion-specific computer modeling of solid mechanics, we calculated the stress and strain distribution for each plaque and determined if there were any relationships with markers of inflammation. Consistent with previous studies, inflammatory markers were positively associated with increasing strain in specimens with rupture and thin-cap fibroatheromas. Conversely, overall staining for inflammatory markers and apoptosis were significantly lower in erosion, and there was n...|$|R
40|$|Atherosclerotic <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture</b> and {{subsequent}} thrombotic complications are a {{leading cause of}} myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. The majority of these cardiovascular events occur in coronary arteries with < 50 % stenosis, 1 indi-cating that information about luminal stenosis is not sufficient to predict plaque vulnerability. Despite a progressive under-standing of the crucial role of inflammation in <b>plaque</b> <b>rupture,</b> 2 conventional intracoronary imaging modalities including intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have focused on the morphological changes and are insufficient to provide information about inflammatory activ-ity.
