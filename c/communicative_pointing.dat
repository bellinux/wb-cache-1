50|$|Language {{development}} {{is viewed as}} a motive to communication, and the communicative function of language in-turn provides the motive for language development. Jean Piaget uses the term “acted conversations” to explain a child’s style of communication that rely more heavily on gestures and body movements, rather than words. Younger children depend on gestures for a direct statement of their message. As they begin to acquire more language, body movements take on a different role and begin to complement the verbal message. These nonverbal bodily movements allow children to express their emotions before they can express them verbally. The child’s nonverbal communication of how they’re feeling is seen in babies 0 to 3 months who use wild, jerky movements of the body to show excitement or distress. This develops to more rhythmic movements of the entire body at 3 to 5 months to demonstrate the child’s anger or delight. Between 9-12 months of age, children view themselves as joining the communicative world. Before 9-12 months, babies interact with objects and interact with people, but they do not interact with people about objects. This developmental change is the change from primary intersubjectivity (capacity to share oneself with others) to secondary intersubjectivity (capacity to share one’s experience), which changes the infant from an unsociable to socially engaging creature. Around 12 months of age a communicative use of gesture is used. This gesture includes <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> where an infant points to request something, or to point to provide information. Another gesture of communication is presented around the age of 10 and 11 months where infants start gaze-following; they look where another person is looking. This joint attention result in changes to their social cognitive skills between the ages of 9 and 15 months as their time is spent increasingly with others. Children’s use of non-verbal communicative gestures foretells future language development. The use of non-verbal communication in the form of gestures indicate the child’s interest in communication development, and the meanings they choose to convey that are soon revealed through the verbalization of language.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHumans usually {{point at}} objects to {{communicate}} with other persons, although they generally avoid pointing at the other's body. Moreover, patients with heterotopagnosia after left parietal damage cannot point at another person's body parts, although they can point at objects and at their own body parts and although they can grasp the others' body parts. Strikingly, their performance gradually improves for figurative human body targets. Altogether, {{this suggests that the}} body of another real person holds a specific status in <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing.</b> Here, we test in healthy individuals whether performance for <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> is influenced by the communicative capacity of the target. In Experiment 1, pointing at another real person's body parts was compared to pointing at objects, and in Experiment 2, the person was replaced by a manikin. While reaction times for pointing at objects were shorter compared to pointing at other person's body parts, they were similar for objects and manikin body parts. By adapting Experiment 1 to PET-scan imaging (Experiment 3), we showed that, compared to pointing at objects, the brain network for pointing at other person's body parts involves the left posterior intraparietal sulcus, lesion of which could cause heterotopagnosia. Taken together, our results indicate that the specificity of pointing at another person's body goes beyond the visuo-spatial features of the human body and might rather rely on its communicative capacity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the use of}} referential gestures with concomitant gaze orienting behavior to both distal food objects and communicative interactants by 115 chimpanzees, ranging from 3 to 56 years of age.

Pointing was the most common gesture elicited; 47 subjects pointed with the whole hand, whereas 6 subjects pointed with index fingers. Thus, <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> is commonly used by laboratory chimpanzees, without explicit training to point, language training, or home rearing. Juveniles exhibited striking decrements in their propensity to communicate with adult male experimenters compared with older chimpanzees.

40|$|In {{a series}} of 3 experiments, dogs (Canis familiaris) were {{presented}} with variations of the human pointing gesture: gestures with reversed direction of movement, cross-pointing, and different arm extensions.

If these minimum requirements were not accessible, dogs still could rely on the body position of the signaler. The direction of movement of the pointing arm did not influence the performance.

Many of the infants also reversed roles and produced appropriate pointing gestures for the adult in this same game, and indeed there was a correlation such that comprehenders were for the most part producers.

40|$|The present {{longitudinal}} diary {{study investigated}} the development of early functions of pointing within everyday routines in infants between 5 and 22 months of age. Pointing has been studied extensively {{and there are several}} theories on how this gesture develops. Most current studies on pointing involve experimental settings and infants who have already mastered <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing.</b> Building on the relational view and, more specifically, the importance of infants’ involvement in everyday routines, the present study analyzed diary observations recorded by parents within everyday routines, focusing on the longitudinal changes in infants’ early pointing behaviour. Results are interpreted in terms of historically important findings and theories on the origins and development of pointing. Findings indicate a tendency to use the index finger for tactile exploration and in imitation, as well as a tendency to point with the whole hand, before infants become aware of the social function of their raised arm and index finger. In addition, results suggest that different functions of pointing might emerge along different developmental pathways...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the interplay of verbal and nonverbal communication with respect to infants' perception of pointing gestures. Infants were presented with still images of pointing hands (cue) in combination with an acoustic stimulus. The communicative content of this acoustic stimulus was varied from being human and communicative to artificial. Saccadic reaction times (SRTs) from the cue to a peripheral target were measured {{as an indicator of}} the modulation of covert attention. A significant cueing effect (facilitated SRTs for congruent compared with incongruent trials) was only present in a condition with additional communicative and referential speech. In addition, the size of the cueing effect increased the more human and communicative the acoustic stimulus was. This indicates a beneficial effect of verbal communication on the perception of nonverbal <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures, emphasizing the important role of verbal communication in facilitating social understanding across domains. These findings additionally suggest that human and communicative (ostensive) signals are not qualitatively different from other less social signals but just quantitatively the most attention grabbing among a number of other signals.

40|$|In {{everyday}} human communication, {{we often}} express our communicative intentions by manually pointing out referents {{in the material}} world around us to an addressee, often in tight synchronization with referential speech. This study investigated whether and how the kinematic form of index finger pointing gestures is shaped by the gesturer's communicative intentions and how this is modulated {{by the presence of}} concurrently produced speech. Furthermore, we explored the neural mechanisms underpinning the planning of <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures and speech. Two experiments were carried out in which participants pointed at referents for an addressee while the informativeness of their gestures and speech was varied. Kinematic and electrophysiological data were recorded online. It was found that participants prolonged the duration of the stroke and poststroke hold phase of their gesture to be more communicative, in particular when the gesture was carrying the main informational burden in their multimodal utterance. Frontal and P 300 effects in the ERPs suggested the importance of intentional and modality-independent attentional mechanisms during the planning phase of informative pointing gestures. These findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the complex interplay between action, attention, intention, and language in the production of pointing gestures, a communicative act core to human interaction...|$|E
40|$|Nonverbal {{communication}} using social cues, like gestures, governs a {{great part}} of our daily interactions. It has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show a deviant processing of social cues throughout their social cognitive development. However, social cues do not always convey an intention to communicate. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} test the sensitivity of adolescents and adults with ASD and neurotypical controls to social cues of high <b>communicative</b> (<b>pointing)</b> and low communicative values (grasping). For this purpose, we employed a spatial cueing paradigm with both Cue Types and compared saccadic reaction times (SRTs) between conditions in which the target appeared at a location which was congruent versus incongruent with the direction of the cue. Results showed that both adolescents and adults with ASD had slower SRTs for the incongruent relative to the congruent condition for both Cue Types, reflecting sensitivity to these cues. Additionally, mental effort during the processing of these social cues was assessed by means of pupil dilation. This analysis revealed that, while individuals with and without ASD required more mental effort to process incongruent compared to the congruent cues, cues with higher communicative value posed more processing load for the ASD group. These findings suggest that the perception of social gestures is intact in ASD but requires additional mental effort for gestures with higher communicative value...|$|E

40|$|The article {{sets out}} to relate the {{intentional}} element of discursive activity with some translating strategies, starting {{on the basis that}} the translated text, which is subjected to the demands of a prior communicative act, is a good tool to highlight both the intentional capacity of some linguistic resources and their constraints. Many grammatical forms have an important role, as much or more than the one associated with lexical elements in the creation of this purpose. As a consequence, this paper is based on the analysis of the translation of the French connector pourtant into Catalan and Spanish in a corpus of literary texts and its respective translations. Particularly, it focuses on those ones which, despite their correctness at formal level, have discarded intentional aspects, so they have given rise to an eroded translation from the <b>communicative</b> <b>point</b> of view.

40|$|Focus {{theories}} distinguish {{different types}} of focus according to the pragmatic conditions or <b>communicative</b> <b>point</b> {{on the one side}} and different scopes of focus on the other side. The assertion in term focus constructions (Dik 1989), called by others argument focus constructions or identificational sentences (Lambrecht 1994), has the purpose of establishing a relation between an argument and an open proposition. Kar, a north-eastern Senufo language of Burkina Faso, which has the basic word order S-Aux-O-V-other, has at its disposal different strategies to mark argument focus, among them fronting of the focused item. In many West African languages the displacement of the focused argument involves other devices, {{such as the use of}} special verb forms. In Kar fronting of a focused argument requires the use of special pronouns in the out-of-focus part of the sentence, called background subject pronouns. They are used in other backgrounded contexts, too, for example in relative clauses, adverbial clauses and constituent questions. Their inconsistent use is attributed to a particular sociolinguistic situation in which the data has been collected. The use of the same focus strategies for completive and contrastive focus suggests that Kar does not distinguish pragmatic conditions on the level of sentence grammar...|$|R
40|$|<b>Communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> {{is a human}} {{specific}} gesture {{which allows}} sharing information about a visual item with another person. It sets up a three-way relationship between a subject who points, an addressee and an object. Yet psychophysical and neuroimaging {{studies have focused on}} non-communicative pointing, which implies a two-way relationship between a subject and an object without the involvement of an addressee, and makes such gesture comparable to touching or grasping. Thus, experimental data on the communicating function of pointing remain scarce. Here, we examine whether the communicative value of pointing modifies both its behavioral and neural correlates by comparing pointing with or without communication. We found that when healthy participants pointed repeatedly at the same object, the communicative interaction with an addressee induced a spatial reshaping of both the pointing trajectories and the endpoint variability. Our finding supports the hypothesis that a change in reference frame occurs when pointing conveys a communicative intention. In addition, measurement of regional cerebral blood flow using H 2 O 15 PET-scan showed that pointing when communicating with an addressee activated the right posterior superior temporal sulcus and the right medial prefrontal cortex, in contrast to pointing without communication. Such a right hemisphere network suggests that the communicative value of pointing is related to processes involved in taking another person’s perspective.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{recognition}} (Anerkennung in German) {{has been in}} the center of intensive interest and debate for some time in social and political philosophy, as well as in Hegel-scholarship. The first part of the article clarifies conceptually what recognition in the relevant sense arguably is. The second part explores one possible route for arguing that the 'recognitive attitudes' of respect and love have a necessary role in the coming about of the psychological capacities distinctive of persons. More exactly, it explores the possibility that they are necessary in the kind of intersubjective relationship in which normal human infants engage in the pre-linguistic communicative practice of pointing things to others, as described by Michael Tomasello. If an incapacity to participate in the already Gricean communicative practices of pointing makes it also impossible for the infant to learn symbolic communication, and if without the immediately intrinsically motivating other-regarding attitudes of recognition <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> does not get off the ground (at least among the most intelligent animals currently known to exist), then the capacity for recognition may be a decisive difference between humans and their closest non-human relatives. That is, it may be why only human infants, but no other animals, are capable of embarking on a developmental journey that normally leads to full-fledged psychological personhood. If this is so, then the concept of recognition, today mostly discussed in social and political philosophy and Hegel-studies, {{could turn out to be}} a very useful tool in cognitive scientific work interested in specifically human forms of social intentionality, cognition, volition and so forth. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Pointing gesture allows {{children}} to communicate their intentions before {{the acquisition of}} language. In particular, two main purposes seem to underlie the gesture: to request a desired object (imperative pointing) or to share attention on that object (declarative pointing). Since the imperative pointing has an instrumental goal and the declarative an interpersonal one, only the latter gesture is thought to signal the infant’s awareness of the communicative partner as a mental agent. The present study examined the neural responses of adult subjects with the aim {{to test the hypothesis}} that declarative rather than imperative pointing reflects mentalizing skills. Fourteen subjects were measured in a MEG environment including 4 conditions, based on the goal of the pointing–imperative or declarative–and the role of the subject–sender or receiver of pointing. Time-Frequency modulations of brain activity in each condition (Declarative Production and Comprehension, Imperative Production and Comprehension) were analyzed. Both low BETA and high BETA power were stronger during Declarative than Imperative condition, in anterior cingulated cortex and right posterior superior temporal sulcus, respectively. Furthermore, high GAMMA activity was higher in right temporo-parietal junction during the sender than receiving condition. This suggests that <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> modulated brain regions previously described in neuroimaging research as linked to social cognitive skills and that declarative pointing is more capable of eliciting that activation than imperative. Our results contribute {{to the understanding of the}} roles of brain rhythm dynamics in social cognition, thus supporting neural research on that topic during developmental both in typical and atypical conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder. In particular, the identification of relevant regions in a mature brain may stimulate a future work on the developmental changes of neural activation in the same regions. <br/...|$|E
40|$|This paper elaborates on offline {{and online}} {{research}} into linguistic status of non-anaphoric 'er' "there" in presentive sentences with a preposed adjunct (e. g. Op de hoek van de straat is (er) een winkel). In a first study (Grondelaers & Brysbaert 1996), we used corpus materials and self-paced reading data {{to demonstrate that}} there is a positive correlation between the presence of 'er' in adjunct sentences and the spatial and discursive situating potential of the preposed locative adjunct: the preference for 'er' in such sentences increases as the locative search precision of the adjunct and the topicality of the adjunct referent decrease. Building on additional corpus data and a new self-paced reading experiment, the present paper goes beyond the observation of correlations, and concentrates on 'er's' exact linguistic function. The cumulative empirical evidence suggests that 'er' is an acciessibility marker in the sense of Ariel (1990) : 'er' is not - as is generally assumed - an optional dummy element, but a discourse particle inserted to inform the hearer how important the subject to be created is from a <b>communicative</b> <b>point</b> of view, how inferrable it is from the foregoing context, and how much effort the hearer should invest in its creation...|$|R

As {{a matter of fact}} the evolution of classic and contemporary sociology seems to be characterized by different ways of exploiting the implicit potentials offered by the concept of borders in terms of orientation and classification. In this context the concept appears essential from a relational point of view because it underlines gradual social connections not encompassed by clear cut dichotomies; from a methodological point of view because it suggests a vast array of instruments able to measure, as the weberian ideal-types, the increasing distance of social phenomena from abstract sociological models; from a theoretical point of view, since it outlines nets of meaningful relations, as the social games, which can be applied through flexible strategies with uncertain outcomes; from a systemic point of view, as it concentrates attention on the basic distinction between system and environment which can be reproduced at different levels in reflexive and circular ways; from a <b>communicative</b> <b>point</b> of view, which refusing universal criteria of evaluation produces an inter-individual logic based on higher or lower degrees of compatibilities within the discourse...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} a {{demonstrated}} bias toward use of the right hand from birth, {{the meaning of this}} bias and its stability over time are unclear. Within a longitudinal study of language development at 13, 20, and 28 months, we extracted information about unimanual and bimanual hand preference from videotapes. Both unimanual and bimanual actions on objects were divided into symbolic (e. g., pretend play) and nonsymbolic (e. g., picking up and putting down). A separate count was made of <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures. Children showed a marked right?hand bias (70 %) across categories, a bias that did not differ as a function of age, sex, or unimanual or bimanual type. However, preference for the right hand was stronger for symbolic than for nonsymbolic movements in both unimanual and bimanual activity. At 13 and 28 months, there was a significantly greater right?hand bias in pointing than in any other manual activity. Total right?hand bias at 13 months was significantly correlated with analytic/ receptive aspects of language development. The same linear correlation did not hold for hand bias at the later stage (although correlations were stronger for girls). At 20 months there was a significant nonlinear relationship between nonsymbolic hand movements and language. This combination of linear and curvilinear patterns, together with the greater hand bias for symbolic communicative activities that are compatible with language, led us to consider the contralateral interference hypothesis of Kinsbourne and Hiscock. A temporary instability in hand bias may reflect increased need to use left?hemisphere resources for language whenever a child enters a new stage of language functioning. This would lead to ?cyclic? patterns of hand preference around major milestones in language, particularly for nonsymbolic actions that compete with language...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of culture on cognitive development {{is well established}} for school age and older children. But almost nothing is known about how different parenting and socialization practices in different cultures affect infants' and young children's earliest emerging cognitive and social-cognitive skills. In the current monograph, we report a series of eight studies in which we systematically assessed the social-cognitive skills of 1 - to 3 -year-old children in three diverse cultural settings. One group of children was from a Western, middle-class cultural setting in rural Canada {{and the other two}} groups were from traditional, small-scale cultural settings in rural Peru and India. In a first group of studies, we assessed 1 -year-old children's most basic social-cognitive skills for understanding the intentions and attention of others: imitation, helping, gaze following, and <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing.</b> Children's performance in these tasks was mostly similar across cultural settings. In a second group of studies, we assessed 1 -year-old children's skills in participating in interactive episodes of collaboration and joint attention. Again in these studies the general finding was one of cross-cultural similarity. In a final pair of studies, we assessed 2 - to 3 -year-old children's skills within two symbolic systems (pretense and pictorial). Here we found that the Canadian children who had much more experience with such symbols showed skills at an earlier age. Our overall conclusion is that young children in all cultural settings get sufficient amounts of the right kinds of social experience to develop their most basic social-cognitive skills for interacting with others and participating in culture at around the same age. In contrast, children's acquisition of more culturally specific skills for use in practices involving artifacts and symbols is more dependent on specific learning experiences...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} emergence of the linguistic use of pointing as first- and non-first-person pronoun in Greek Sign Language. Despite the similarity in form between the pointing gesture and pronominal pointing signs, children acquiring sign language pass through the same stages and acquire personal pronouns at {{about the same age as}} children acquiring spoken language. According to Petitto (1984, 1987, 1994), the transition to pronominal pointing in American Sign Language is characterised by: (a) a period of discontinuity in which children avoid using pointing directed towards persons, and (b) the occurrence of reversal errors before the acquisition of first and second-person pronouns. The present study offers additional evidence on the acquisition of personal pronouns through the investigation of: (a) the manner and the age at which pronominal pointing signs are acquired by a child exposed to Greek Sign Language, (b) the use of other signs for reference to persons and self, and (c) the existence of reversal errors in the child’s early use of pointing. Data consist of video-recorded spontaneous interaction between a deaf boy and his family every fortnight from the age of 12 to 36 months. Thirty hours of the child’s communicative behaviour have been transcribed and all sequences that included pointing were analysed in terms of reference and function. This study confirms that language modality plays a restricted role in language acquisition. The time and the frequency of occurrence of pronominal pointing signs correspond to the general developmental pattern observed in the acquisition of ASL. However, there are also important differences: (a) common nouns and proper names are used for reference to others before the acquisition of pronominal pointing, but to a limited extent (b) the existence of only one erroneous pointing sign indicates that the deaf child, from the beginning, uses pronominal signs correctly, and (c) there is no evidence of discontinuity in the transition from the early <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> gesture to pronominal pointing signs.

Several studies investigated metaphor from semantic, cognitive and <b>communicative</b> <b>points</b> of view, but only few were interested in explaining the representational form of figurative language. Participants and Methods: 320 sentences (equally shared in literal and familiar metaphorical endings), were presented to 36 subjects, grouped into three different categories: low-, medium and high-visualizers. An ERPs analysis {{was applied to the}} comprehension process, taking into account the temporal window of 250 - 350 ms post-stimulus. Results: ERP analysis showed a negative peak around 340 msec (N 3) for both the literal and metaphorical endings, with an increased amplitude for the last one. The methaphorical endings revealed the presence of an higher negative deflection in comparison with the literal endings. Moreover, high-visualizers showed an ampler N 3 than the medium- and low- ones for the metaphorical endings. Finally, the occipital area were more activated than the others {{as a function of the}} metaphorical sentences and the visualization strategy. Conclusions: These results suggest that metaphor involves an iconic representation, more posteriorly distribuited on the brain, than the literal condition.

40|$|Purpose – In {{an attempt}} to gain insight into the effects of {{transparent}} communication on critical performances, this paper aims to explore performance measures and communication of a large‐scale service organization, i. e. the Dutch Railways (Nederlandse Spoorwegen, (NS)). Design/methodology/approach – Semi‐structured interviews with employees of NS and external stakeholders were analyzed to study which performances are measured by NS, why they are measured, {{and how they are}} communicated to the employees and stakeholders. Findings – An ambiguous view on transparency was observed. Although transparency is advocated by most employees and stakeholders, this study revealed the complexity of performance communication of a service organization. In this case, NS used to fully disclose performances but emphasized positive performances. This transparent communication strategy seemed to backfire and yielded a counterbalanced societal response from customer organizations which resulted in a strained relationship. Research limitations/implications – The findings are based on qualitative data of a limited number of interviews. Several types of actors were interviewed but not passengers of NS themselves. Practical implications – From a <b>communicative</b> <b>point</b> of view, it might be wise to publish negative aspects as well as the positive ones to promote trust and corporate credibility. Building trust involves investing in positive experiences for customers and promotion of realistic expectations. To enhance trust, organizations must not only inform stakeholders and citizens about their performances but also invest in direct communication with their stakeholders.

It {{has a number of}} structural characteristics that are unusual compared to other sign languages; most notably, Kata Kolok signers prefer an absolute Frame of Reference in spatial description. Perhaps less surprsingly, one in six signs is an index finger point in Kata Kolok, and these points come to serve a wide range of functions including, but not restricted to, colour indications, time adverbial constructions, and place and person reference (de Vos 2012). The ubiquity of pointing signs and their high degree of functional diversification suggest that pointing signs are a key aspect in learning to use the language appropriately. While all infants use <b>communicative</b> <b>pointing</b> gestures, pointing signs in sign languages come to serve grammatical functions, particularly in the domain of place, time and person reference. Adopting a developmental perspective, what language-specific evidence can be identified in support of the syntactic integration of different pointing types? Petitto (1987) showed that children acquiring American Sign Language start to differentiate first and second person pointing by 24 - 27 months, in parallel to hearing children acquiring English pronouns in terms of timing and acquisition errors. This study is based on monthly video recordings of a deaf preschooler in the age of 24 - 36 months, who acquires Kata Kolok - a village sign language of Bali natively. Based on the analysis of 5. 5 hours of video data, it explores the use of index finger pointing, in spontaneous conversations between the child and his caregivers, relatives, and older siblings. Transcription activities have thusfar resulted in the identification of 1, 119 manual signs of which 458 (41 %) are pointing signs. Following Petitto's (1987) study, I highlight a few developmental transitions that are taken to indicate a possible transition from pre-linguistic gesture to pointing sign on behalf to the child. Most notably, the child starts to co-produce multiple grammatical facial expressions alongside index finger points, such as the perfective marker 'pah', around 25 months, suggesting that the syntactic integration of pointing signs starts as early as 25 months. This finding matches previous observations on the syntactic acquisition of pronominal pointing signs made by Petitto (1987). These initial results suggest that the ontological development of pointing may provide additional evidence for the grammatical status of pointing in adult signing, as instantiated in language-specific ways. Given Kata Kolok’s unique typological profile, further exploration of the child signing section of the Kata Kolok corpus could contribute considerably to our understanding of what is universal and particular in the acquisition of sign languages, thus having the potential to advance our understanding of the comparative acquisition of typologically-distinct sign languages...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{the major}} {{dimensions}} of a communicative language test that Bachman proposed, this paper aims to have an investigation on {{the validity of the}} new CET- 4 listening subtest in China from a <b>communicative</b> <b>point</b> of view. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are involved in the study. Material analysis falls into qualitative study, including analysis of the CET- 4 testing syllabus and eight new CET- 4 listening comprehension tests. Students’ scores of two tests and the questionnaires are analyzed quantitatively. Through analysis, it is found that the new CET- 4 listening subtest has a high validity and can measure test-takers’ listening ability in real communication. First, the new CET- 4 listening subtest has the quality of reliability. Second, the seven listening skills tested in this subtest can measure the communicative language ability required in the testing syllabus. The intra-correlation analysis shows that each part of the new CET- 4 listening subtest focuses on different language abilities related to listening. Third, the authenticity of the new CET- 4 listening subtest reaches a satisfactory level. The materials chosen in the test cover various topics and genres. Speakers’ pronunciation, tone and speed are in accordance with the real situation. However, some shortcomings also exist in the test design and should be improved later. For example, its limited item types cannot represent the task types in real life, and the actual input is too ideal to be authentic.   Keywords: Communicative language ability, communicative language testing, listening comprehension, test validit...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} is the vocal expression of emotions as flexible and culturally defined tools aiming at communicating. The emotional expressions can influence consistently the other behavior by participating the management of interactions and the negotiation of interpersonal relationships, as it emerge from the Behavioral Ecology approach, elaborated by Fridlund (1994), and the Minimal Universality approach, proposed by Russell (1995). The existing literature about suprasegmental vocal traits and their functions within <b>communicative</b> exchange <b>points</b> out the role of voice in expressing emotions. Results found {{in the last few years}} show with consistency the value and the effectiveness of paralinguistic components in the emotional expressions, with an accuracy of recognition which is around 60...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the prelinguistic communicative behaviors of 48 young Israeli children with hearing impairments (ages 8 months to 49 months). Most subjects were severely hearing impaired. Ninety percent were born to hearing parents. A parent questionnaire utilizing a direct observation methodology in six situational contexts was selected, translated into Hebrew, and modified to be in accord with Israeli culture and with early characteristics {{of the language of}} the deaf. The revised version included information on the use of signs as well as gestures and speech. The study found two groupings of related <b>communicative</b> behaviors: <b>pointing,</b> independent behaviors, and collaboration with an adult; and vocalizations and words. Results suggested that the theoretical model of early communicative development in hearing infants, which finds a qualitative difference between early noncommunicative behaviors ar...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} 6 captive dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) to comprehend without explicit training 3 human <b>communicative</b> signs (<b>pointing,</b> directed gaze, and replica). Pointing consisted of indicating the target item with the index finger and a fully extended arm. Directed gaze consisted of orienting the head and eyes toward the target item {{while the rest of}} the body remained stationary. The replica signal consisted of holding up an exact duplicate of the target item. On the initial series of 12 trials for each condition, 3 dolphins performed above chance on pointing, 2 on gaze, and none for replica. With additional trials, above chance performance increased to 4 dolphins for pointing, 6 for gazing, and 2 for replica. The replica sign seemed to be the most taxing for them (only 2 dolphins achieved results significantly above chance). Taken together, these results indicate that dolphins are able to interpret untrained communicative signs successfully...|$|R
40|$|Pointing {{has long}} been {{considered}} to be a uniquely human, universal, and biologically based gesture. However, pointing emerges spontaneously, without explicit training, in captive chimpanzees. Because pointing is commonplace in captive chimpanzees and virtually absent in wild chimpanzees, and because both captive and wild chimpanzees are sampled from the same gene pool, pointing by captive apes is attributable to environmental influences on <b>communicative</b> development. If <b>pointing</b> by captive chimpanzees is so variably expressed in different rearing environments, this suggests that pointing by humans may also be attributable to situational factors that make pointing effective in certain developmental contexts...|$|R
