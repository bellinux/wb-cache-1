6000|$|When beasts could speak, (the learned say They {{still can}} do so every day,) It seems, they had {{religion}} then, As much as now we find in men. It happen'd, when a plague broke out, (Which therefore made them more devout,) The king of brutes (to make it plain, Of quadrupeds I only mean) By proclamation gave command, That every subject in the land Should to the priest confess their sins; And thus the pious Wolf begins: Good father, I must own with shame, That often I have been to blame: I must confess, on Friday last, Wretch that I was! I broke my fast: But I defy the basest tongue To prove I did my neighbour wrong; Or ever went to seek my food, By rapine, theft, or thirst of blood. [...] The Ass approaching next, confess'd, That in his heart he loved a jest: A wag he was, he needs must own, And could not let a dunce alone: Sometimes his friend he would not spare, And might perhaps be too severe: But yet the worst that could be said, He was a wit both born and bred; And, if it be a sin and shame, Nature alone must bear the blame: One fault he has, is sorry for't, His ears are half a foot too short; Which could he to the standard bring, He'd show his face before the king: Then for his voice, there's none disputes That he's the nightingale of brutes. [...] The Swine with contrite heart allow'd, His shape and beauty made him proud: In diet was perhaps too nice, But gluttony was ne'er his vice: In every turn of life content, And meekly took what fortune sent: Inquire through all the parish round, A better neighbour ne'er was found; His vigilance might some displease; 'Tis true, he hated sloth like pease. [...] The mimic Ape began his chatter, How evil tongues his life bespatter; Much of the censuring world complain'd, Who said, his gravity was feign'd: Indeed, the strictness of his morals Engaged him in a hundred quarrels: He saw, and he was grieved to see't, His zeal was sometimes indiscreet: He found his virtues too severe For our corrupted times to bear; Yet such a lewd licentious age Might well excuse a stoic's rage. [...] The Goat advanced with decent pace, And first excused his youthful face; Forgiveness begg'd that he appear'd ('Twas Nature's fault) without a beard. 'Tis true, he was not much inclined To fondness for the female kind: Not, as his enemies object, From chance, or natural defect; Not by his frigid constitution; But through a pious resolution: For {{he had made a}} holy vow Of Chastity, as monks do now: Which he resolved to keep for ever hence And strictly too, as doth his reverence.[2] [...] Apply the tale, and you shall find, How just it suits with human kind. Some faults we own; but can you guess? --Why, virtue's carried to excess, Wherewith our vanity endows us, Though neither foe nor friend allows us. [...] The Lawyer swears (you may rely on't) He never squeezed a needy client; And this he makes his constant rule, For which his brethren call him fool; His conscience always was so nice, He freely gave the poor advice; By which he lost, he may affirm, A hundred fees last Easter term; While others of the learned robe, Would break the patience of a Job. No pleader at the bar could match His diligence and quick dispatch; Ne'er kept a cause, he well may boast, Above a term or two at most. [...] The cringing knave, who seeks a place Without success, thus tells his case: Why should he longer mince the matter? He fail'd, because he could not flatter; He had not learn'd to turn his coat, Nor for a party give his vote: His crime he quickly understood; Too zealous for the nation's good: He found the ministers resent it, Yet could not for his heart repent it. [...] The Chaplain vows, he cannot fawn, Though it would raise him to the lawn: He pass'd his hours among his books; You find it in his meagre looks: He might, if he were worldly wise, Preferment get, and spare his eyes; But owns he had a stubborn spirit. That made him trust alone to merit; Would rise by merit to promotion; Alas! a mere chimeric notion. [...] The Doctor, if you will believe him, Confess'd a sin; (and God forgive him!) Call'd up at midnight, ran to save A blind old beggar from the grave: But see how Satan spreads his snares; He quite forgot to say his prayers. He cannot help it, for his heart, Sometimes to act the parson's part: Quotes from the Bible many a sentence, That moves his patients to repentance; And, when his medicines do no good, Supports their minds with heavenly food: At which, however well intended, He hears the clergy are offended; And grown so bold behind his back, To call him hypocrite and quack. In his own church he keeps a seat; Says grace before and after meat; And calls, without affecting airs, His household twice a-day to prayers. He shuns apothecaries' shops, And hates to cram the sick with slops: He scorns to make his art a trade; Nor bribes my lady's favourite maid. Old nurse-keepers would never hire, To recommend him to the squire; Which others, whom he will not name, Have often practised to their shame. [...] The Statesman tells you, with a sneer, His fault is to be too sincere; And having no sinister ends, Is apt to disoblige his friends. The nation's good, his master's glory, Without regard to Whig or Tory, Were all the schemes he had in view, Yet he was seconded by few: Though some had spread a thousand lies, 'Twas he defeated the excise.[3] 'Twas known, though he had borne aspersion, That standing troops were his aversion: His practice was, in every station: To serve the king, and please the nation. Though hard to find in every case The fittest man to fill a place: His promises he ne'er forgot, But took memorials on the spot; His enemies, for want of charity, Said, he affected popularity: 'Tis true, the people understood, That all he did was for their good; Their kind affections he has tried; No love is lost on either side. He came to court with fortune clear, Which now he runs out every year; Must, at the rate that he goes on, Inevitably be undone: O! if his majesty would please To give him but a writ of ease, Would grant him license to retire, As it has long been his desire, By fair accounts it would be found, He's poorer by ten thousand pound. He owns, and hopes it is no sin, He ne'er was partial to his kin; He thought it base for men in stations, To crowd the court with their relations: His country was his dearest mother, And every virtuous man his brother; Through modesty or awkward shame, (For which he owns himself to blame,) He found the wisest man he could, Without respect to friends or blood; Nor ever acts on private views, When he has liberty to choose. [...] The Sharper swore he hated play, Except to pass an hour away: And well he might; for, to his cost, By want of skill, he always lost; He heard there was a club of cheats, Who had contrived a thousand feats; Could change the stock, or cog a die, And thus deceive the sharpest eye: Nor wonder how his fortune sunk, His brothers fleece him when he's drunk. [...] I own the moral not exact, Besides, the tale is false, in fact; And so absurd, that could I raise up, From fields Elysian, fabling Æsop, I would accuse him to his face, For libelling the four-foot race. Creatures of every kind but ours Well comprehend their natural powers, While we, whom reason ought to sway, Mistake our talents every day. The Ass was never known so stupid, To act the part of Tray or Cupid; Nor leaps upon his master's lap, There to be stroked, and fed with pap, As Æsop would the world persuade; He better understands his trade: Nor comes whene'er his lady whistles, But <b>carries</b> <b>loads,</b> and feeds on thistles. Our author's meaning, I presume, is A creature bipes et implumis; Wherein the moralist design'd A compliment on human kind; For here he owns, that now and then Beasts may degenerate into men.[4] ...|$|E

30|$|In the {{following}} {{we attempt to}} find the maximum <b>carried</b> <b>loads</b> of each link in various scenarios. One observation from solving the system of equations in Section 5.1 is that the <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> will be smaller than the offered load when the offered load is too large. This corresponds to the instability of 802.11 observed in previous works (e.g., [15]). Therefore, we use binary search to find the maximum <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> under stable conditions. Initially, the search range for the offered load is between 0 and 1 [*]Mbps. We choose {{the midpoint of the}} search range to be the offered load and solve the system of equations. If the resultant <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> {{is the same as the}} offered load, the offered load can be increased, and the next search range will be the upper half of the original one. Otherwise, the offered load results in instability, and the next search range will be the lower half of the original one. This procedure is repeated until the search range is sufficiently small.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHeavy working conditions, {{as well as}} {{sedentary}} behaviour, are {{risk factors}} for health. There {{is a lack of}} wearable measurement systems for monitoring <b>carried</b> <b>loads</b> while walking. Pedobarography, the study of force fields acting between the plantar surface of the foot and a supporting surface, is supposed to be useable for estimating <b>carried</b> <b>loads.</b> Purpose. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a novel method for selecting appropriate measurement samples for weight estimation of <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> during walk and a wearable system, based on pedobarography, consisting of commercial off the shelf components. The main idea is to choose samples when half of the total weight is on the forward sensors and the other half is on the heel sensor “equipoise” in one foot while the other foot not touches the ground. Methods. The system consists of insoles with force sensing resistors, data acquisition with IOIO-OTG and analysis in Excel. Each subject was weighed on an electronic floor scale. Three walks were performed on level ground. The first walk without any added load and then with two increases of <b>carried</b> <b>load.</b> Equipoise was defined as having half the weight distributed on the heel and the other half over the metatarsal pad. An equipoise value of 0. 5 represents equilibrium regarding the weight distribution on one foot, with the other foot in the air. Samples were chosen in the equipoise region of 0. 5 ± 0. 1 and then the average of the samples collected during one minute estimated the total weight. Results. The system can detect increases in <b>carried</b> <b>loads</b> but has a tendency to overestimate them. The estimated value was always larger with increased weight but the system was not always linear. The average overestimation error was 16. 7 kg. Discussion. This study shows that this type of wearable system is usable for estimating <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> during walk after calibration of the system to the body weight force distribution on the sensors. There is still need for future development to obtain real-time analysis and direct feedback. A smaller and lighter measurement system is also desirable. Conclusion. This study shows that the novel method, equipoise, is usable for selecting appropriate measurement samples for weight estimation of <b>carried</b> <b>load</b> during walk. This study also shows that the wearable system, consisting of commercial off the shelf components, can be used for these measurements. However, there is a tendency to overestimate the loads...|$|R
