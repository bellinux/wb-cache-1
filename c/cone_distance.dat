The robustness comes from using geometric operations rather than numerical methods to find all local extrema.

The experimental technique {{is similar to that}} used in stellar speckle interferometry. It is based on the recording and posterior processing of coherent short-exposure images of a small area of the central fovea.

The reconstruction of the whole spatial information of the cone mosaic would also be possible by further improvements of the technique by subsequent application of image-reconstruction algorithms.

40|$|We {{examine the}} space-time {{properties}} of the distributions of (¯ d −ū) and ¯ d/ū in the proton. The difference of the antiquark distributions shows the expected peak at the approximate pion Compton wavelength and is supportive of the thesis that the meson cloud of the nucleon is at {{the origin of the}} asymmetry of (¯ d − ū), with the pion cloud playing a dominant role. The partonic distribution functions of the proton, particularly the flavor dependence of the antiquark distributions, remain of considerable interest. Experimentally, the NMC measurement of the integral of (¯ d−ū) [1], and the more recent measurements of the ratio ¯d/ū by means of the Drell-Yan process [2, 3] provide evidence for the excess of ¯ d over ū in the proton. Similar results for (¯ d − ū) were obtained by HERMES [4]. One of the simplest (physically ”anschaulich”) explanations for the excess is based on the meson cloud model and the Sullivan process. This model can explain the momentum fraction (Bjorken x-dependence) of the (¯ d − ū) distribution (for reviews, see [5]). Pions play the leading role in this context, while the detailed description of the ratio ¯ d/ū may also require correlated q¯q pairs of heavier mass[3, 6, 7]. In this Letter we do not wish to dwell on the differences between theoretical models and experiment, but examine the spacetime {{properties of the}} flavor distribution asymmetries in order to see whether they offer any clues as to their origin. In order to obtain the distribution functions in coordinate space, we follow Piller et al. [8] and Vänttinen et al. [9].

50|$|Races {{can be done}} in dual format {{where the}} racing is a {{head-to-head}} match, or in a single lane format where the racer is only racing against the clock. There are five types of Slalom race formats: Super Giant Slalom, Giant Slalom, Hybrid Slalom (a.k.a. Special Slalom), Tight Slalom, and Banked Slalom. The Super Giant Slalom, or SuperG, is characterized by fast speeds of 30-40 mph, very long <b>distances</b> between <b>cones</b> (up to 40-50 feet) and run times of around 1 minute. Giant Slalom is similar to SuperG but is typically smaller <b>cone</b> <b>distances,</b> more <b>cones,</b> and is often time run in a single lane format. Hybrid or Special slalom is a combination of Giant Slalom cone spacings of 10-15' and tight cones spacings of 5-7' and is most often run head-to-head. Tight Slalom is characterized by very small cones spacings of 5'-7' and has the highest frequency of turns. Tight slalom skaters will pass through 3-4 cones per second. Banked slalom involves skating through a course on banked walls, such as in a skatepark or in a drainage ditch. Banked slalom is similar to other forms of slalom except that it is almost never head-to-head and the course weaves through a non-level obstacle course, as opposed to a street surface where other forms of slalom are held.|$|R

The collection of all pointed cones forms an open set in the metric space (Ξ(H), δ). One possible way of measuring the degree of pointedness of a cone K is by evaluating the distance from K to {{the set of}} all nonpointed cones. The number ρ(K) obtained {{in this way is}} called the radius of pointedness of the cone K. The evaluation of this number is, in general, a very cumbersome task. In this note, we derive a simple formula for computing ρ(K), and we propose also a method for constructing a nonpointed <b>cone</b> at minimal <b>distance</b> from K.
