5|$|UPLB admits {{more than}} 2,500 {{students}} and produces about 1,800 graduates every year. Undergraduate admission {{is determined by}} the University of the Philippines College Admission Test (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the standard <b>cut-off</b> are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the actual <b>cut-off,</b> though the appeal process does not guarantee admission. The <b>cut-off</b> scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a standard UPG <b>cut-off</b> of 2.42 while the actual <b>cut-off</b> was 2.8 (this actual <b>cut-off</b> was retained in 2011). But in 2014-2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3. Seventy percent of slots are given to incoming freshmen with the highest scores, while the remaining thirty percent are given to public high school students and members of minority groups. Before the UPCAT was used for admission, UPCA only admitted the top 5 percent of Philippine high school graduates.|$|E

The usability of an intelligent email client that learns to filter spam emails is tested under three variants of adaptation: no user modeling, user modeling with fixed (optimal) spam <b>cut-offs,</b> and user modeling with user adjustable spam <b>cut-offs.</b> The results supported our hypothesis that user control over adaptation is preferred because the user can maintain the system’s interaction state within a region of user expectation. This remains true even when performance of the system (accuracy of spam filtering) degrades because of errors in user control (adjustment of spam <b>cut-offs).</b> ...|$|R

We analyzed the sensitivities of NT alone for screening chromosomal aberration using three <b>cut-offs</b> - 2. 5 mm, 3. 0 mm, and 95 th percentile for each crown rump length (CRL). There were 31 chromosomal aberrations (1. 2 %) including 12 cases of trisomy 21. The numbers of chromosomal aberrations that were detected by NT with different <b>cut-offs</b> of 2. 5 mm, 3. 0 mm and the 95 th percentile CRL were 22, 18 and 23, respectively. At a threshold of 2. 5 mm, the sensitivity and the false positive rate for total chromosomal aberrations were 67. 7 % and 6. 3 %, respectively. At 3. 0 mm, those were 54. 8 % and 3. 5 %, respectively. At the 95 th percentile CRL, those were 70. 9 % and 5. 8 %, respectively.

This study was undertaken to assess nutritional status of children from an urban community using the three reference <b>cut-offs.</b> This survey involved 1903 children, aged 1 - 10 years, recruited randomly from crèche, nursery and primary schools in Lagos, Nigeria. The estimation of the prevalence of thinness, overweight and obesity was based on age and sex-specific BMI <b>cut-offs</b> by 2007 WHO and IS/IOTF references. Thinness, stunting and underweight were defined as BMI-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-age (Z-score), below 2 SD (3 SD for severe) from the relative median value of the 2007 WHO <b>cut-offs,</b> respectively. Boys (girls) had 75. 6 % (74. 4 %) prevalence of stunting which increases with age and 1. 4 % (0. 9 %) severe stunting. 5 % and 1. 2 % of children were underweight and severe underweight respectively. By IOTF / IS <b>cut-offs,</b> 42. 9 %, 2. 6 % and 1. 2 % of children were thin, overweight and obese respectively. Using 2007 WHO <b>cut-offs,</b> 43. 2 %, 4. 1 % and 3. 6 % of children were thin, overweight and obese respectively. Obesity prevalence was high in ages 1 - 4 years in boys and girls.

The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the prevalence of thinness using two recently developed growth references, among children and adolescents living in the Seychelles, an economically rapidly developing country in the African region. Methods Weight and height were measured every year in all children of 4 grades (age range: 5 to 16 years) of all schools in the Seychelles as part of a routine school-based surveillance program. In this study we used data collected in 16, 672 boys and 16, 668 girls examined from 1998 to 2004. Thinness was estimated according to two growth references: i) an international survey (IS), defining three grades of thinness corresponding to a BMI of 18. 5, 17. 0 and 16. 0 kg/m 2 at age 18 and ii) the WHO reference, defined here as three categories of thinness (- 1, - 2 and - 3 SD of BMI for age) with the second and third named "thinness" and "severe thinness", respectively. Results The prevalence of thinness was 21. 4 %, 6. 4 % and 2. 0 % based on the three IS <b>cut-offs</b> and 27. 7 %, 6. 7 % and 1. 2 % based on the WHO <b>cut-offs.</b> The prevalence of thinness categories tended to decrease according to age for both sexes for the IS reference and among girls for the WHO reference. Conclusion The prevalence of the first category of thinness was larger with the WHO <b>cut-offs</b> than with the IS <b>cut-offs</b> while the prevalence of thinness of "grade 2 " and thinness of "grade 3 " (IS <b>cut-offs)</b> was similar to the prevalence of "thinness" and "severe thinness" (WHO <b>cut-offs),</b> respectively. </p...|$|R
