50|$|A <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> is {{used when}} the {{prospective}} {{short circuit current}} in a distribution or transmission system is calculated to exceed the interrupting rating of the associated switchgear. The inductive reactance is chosen to be low enough for an acceptable voltage drop during normal operation, but high enough to restrict a short circuit to the rating of the switchgear. The amount of protection that a <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> offers depends upon the percentage increase in impedance that it provides for the system.|$|E
50|$|A {{thyristor}} {{switched capacitor}} (TSC) {{is a type}} of equipment used for compensating reactive power in electrical power systems. It consists of a power capacitor connected in series with a bidirectional thyristor valve and, usually, a <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> (inductor). The thyristor switched capacitor is an important component of a Static VAR Compensator (SVC), where it is often used in conjunction with a thyristor controlled reactor (TCR). Static VAR compensators are a member of the Flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) family.|$|E

In the control of electric motors, <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> can be used to restrict starting current or as part of a speed control system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors,</b> {{once called}} <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> {{reactance}} coils, were first presented in 1915.The {{inventor of the}} <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> reactance coil was Vern E.

30|$|In {{order to}} realize the ability to {{distinguish}} the different fault zones and facilitate the non-unit protection, recent researches advised to install <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> that could increase the electrical distance [62, 63]. A small reactor was installed at each {{head of the line}} to set protection boundaries, thus adjacent lines are easily discriminated. In [62], the system simply adopted the over current and low voltage protection principle, but {{there was no need to}} utilize time delay to guarantee the selectivity. In fact, this method that uses <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> to divide the grid into different zones is borrowed from the protection scheme in HVDC grids. In the DC system, this approach makes it possible {{to realize the}} whole system protection simply with applying non-unit protection methods.|$|R
30|$|Taking a {{planning}} power system for example, the feasibility and speediness {{of this method}} is validated. Considering a 5 % margin, for the breakers with maximum interruptive current of 63 kA, the short circuit current upper limit is set to 59.85 kA. The impedance value of <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> is set to the range of 0 – 10 Ω. The minimum multi-infeed short-circuit ratio is set to 2.0 [18]. The cost factors of opening the line are as follows: k as  =  60, k bs  =  0, and the cost factors of installing the <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> are as follows: k as  =  625, k bs  =  25 [13].|$|E

It means that opening the line has a better current limiting effect than installing the <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E

50|$|The main motive {{of using}} <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> {{is to reduce}} {{short-circuit}} currents so that circuit breakers with lower short circuit breaking capacity can be used.

40|$|The new firing {{scheme for}} an analog trigger circuit of a {{naturally}} commutated tripler is described. This static power frequency changer {{is used to}} produce triple frequency 1 -phase output from a 60 Hz 3 -phase supply. Compared with what it was, the working transformer is smaller roughly 1 / 10 times than transformers using a conventional tripler. By using this trigger circuit, the tripler is operated stably {{in a wide range}} of R or L loads. Consequently, it doesn't need the <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> and has a quickly response for a load variation. The power efficiency is high but the input power factor is inherently low as a lagging current operation. The low power factor will be generally corrected to close to unity by using capacitors or a pair combination of leading current type triplers...|$|R

30|$|Short circuit current {{can cause}} {{mechanical}} and thermal stresses {{proportional to the}} square of the current, and hence lead to the damage of the equipment in power system. This situation is worsened with the increase of interconnections in power system and high-capacity generators being injected to the grid. Short circuit current can be limited in many ways, which can be divided into two categories depending on the cost and effect. One is to open the switches of lines or buses, which is simple, economical and obviously effective. However, this method has a greater impact on the system stability. The other is to increase the installations of electrical equipment or upgrade them, such as installing the <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> or fault current limiter (FCL), even replacing with the high-impedance transformer. This method has little influence on the system stability, but the high cost is needed and the effect is limited.|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{generators}} (DG) {{are scattered}} throughout the countryside. As a result, they are of relatively small power and should be connected without commutating apparata to low and medium voltage radial power lines. The protection of this power line loses accuracy. To what extent current or distant protection is impaired, depends on many factors. The negative impact of DG is characterized by setting ratio (SR) : the relation of current or impedance setting with DG to these quantities without DG. SR depends primarily on DG fault quotients – the fault current of separate DG divided by total fault current of main source and all DG connected to this radial line. Usually DG fault quotients are greater than DG load shares and grow {{to the end of}} radial line. SR are worse when fault quotients increase along the line. Head current protection and head distance protection and intermediate distance protections have underreach when DG fault quotients are not very different. For head protection, impedance SR is inverse of current SR and improves when protection is installed nearer to the fault. <b>Current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactors</b> in series with DG improve SR...|$|R

40|$|Transmission System Operators (TSO's) {{are facing}} an {{increase}} of fault current levels in their networks due {{to the expansion of}} generation capacity. This thesis investigates three possible fault current limiting measures in the Dutch transmission grid which is operated and maintained by TenneT TSO. In order to evaluate the behavior of the fault current limiting measures, two independently operating grid models were established and validated. The examined fault current limiters consisted of a <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>reactor</b> (CLR) and a superconducting fault current limiter (SCFCL). The possibility of substation splitting was also investigated. All three measures reduced the short-circuit levels successfully to values within the electromechanical and thermal withstand levels of the power system. Simulation results revealed that the SCFCL has a significantly lower impact on the rate-of-rise-of-recovery-voltage (RRRV) of the circuit breaker (CB) as compared to the CLR. Additional measures were presented to keep the RRRV of the CLR within the dielectric withstand levels of the CB as specified in the IEC 62271 - 100.

Heat transfer, neutronics, and accident analyses are presented to support an increase of the power level of the Texas A&M University Nuclear Science Center Reactor.

The flux-lock type SFCL with two magnetically coupled circuits has the similar fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics to the flux-lock type SFCL using its third winding. The <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> operation of the SFCL is performed by the generation of the magnetic flux between two coils when a fault happens and the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of the SFCL are dependent on the winding direction of two coils.

With the arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuses, the major obstacle to higher rated current and interrupting capability lies in the long operation time of the arc trigger. Increasing the current density of arc trigger notches can effectively improve the operation speed of the trigger. Simulation and parameter optimization of the arc trigger are conducted by using ANSYS 11. 0 to attain the optimal fuse element structure. In this study, the notch current density of the arc trigger was as high as 3300 A/mm 2, and the trigger can be used in the hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse of rated 35 kV, 2 kA and 40 kA interrupting capability...|$|R
