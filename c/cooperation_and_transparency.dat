40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{explores the}} effect of information <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> among the front nodes of supply chains. Although published works in the supply chain (SC) domain underline the need for information <b>transparency</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooperation</b> for competitiveness of firms, the majority among these are conceptual or empirical. As such, the domain requires fresh effort towards analytical and simulation based research for validation. In the present work, simulation is used as the research methodology. The simulation platform is developed in ARENA®, {{which is based on}} simulation language SIMAN. It has the capability to model multi-product, multi-echelon supply chains. Cooperation is depicted in the form of demand pooling and accelerated delivery of consignments from cooperating SC nodes, when stock-out contingency occurs at a particular node. The modelling also explores the effects of full, partial and zero level of information transparency on the SC performance. The simulation results suggest that these initiatives improve SC service time performance. It is also observed that more advantages from <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> information <b>transparency</b> are obtainable when the SC is leaner. The studies also highlight that such SC initiative that motivates local optimisation at the nodes is counter-productive to SC wide performance...|$|R

40|$|Fisheries {{management}} {{is not only}} about managing the resource fish, but also includes managing the social system. Aquatic ecosystems and the social system are both complex and change continuously. It is important to address what types of uncertainty the combination of both systems, complex socio-ecological systems leads to, their consequences and how these should be dealt with. Successful or unsuccessful management outcomes are difficult to address {{whether or not they}} are due to management efforts or natural changes. In addition, uncertainties often lead to a short-term management, since lack of knowledge makes it difficult to act in a long-term perspective. This thesis conceptualizes how to address different types of uncertainty prevalent in fisheries management, with focus on natural process uncertainty, measurement and estimation uncertainty, decision and implementation uncertainty, and institutional and regime uncertainty.   This was done by analyzing how three theoretical approaches, namely co-management, adaptive management and adaptive co-management address these uncertainties. In order to highlight how different types of uncertainty have been dealt with in practice, a case study on the fishery management in Lake Vättern has been made. A comparison between the literature study and this thesis’ case study shows that hypothesis-testing, <b>cooperation,</b> communication <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> are corresponding factors on how to deal with uncertainties in fisheries management and that institutional and regime uncertainty is inadequately addressed in Sweden...|$|R

How can Egger’s trust model be further developed and applied to B 2 C companies in Thailand for creating more efficiency?

We also collected data by interviews and gathered information from both companies’ websites in order to consistent with the theory.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to anticipate {{and respond to}} climate change can critically shape vulnerability, influencing whether a country experiences harm from exposure to stresses or is able to cope, adapt and realize sustainable outcomes. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study that evaluates capacity in relation to the health and water sectors in Vietnam. The study presents informants' views on the adequacy of financial resources, understanding of vulnerability and adaptation, training needs, information requirements and levels of cooperation as well as their priorities to address adaptation. The perceptions of respondents on challenges and obstacles faced in developing adaptation strategies are also examined. Training on vulnerability and increasing funds for adaptation were reported as the top priorities, indicating that the inadequacy of human and financial resources is the most significant challenge to effective adaptation in the study context. Difficult and weak cooperation was also widely considered to be a barrier. The paper concludes that there are significant interconnected constraints on adaptive capacity in Vietnam that are further exacerbated by governance issues, such as inadequate <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>transparency</b> in sharing information and data. This paper identifies priorities for action to address the challenge of climate change adaptation. 16 page(s...|$|E

This paper explores through the selected cases, how five key factors, acting individually and in interaction, compromise or prevent {{the efficiency and}} stability of evidence-based policy making. As a result, the transit file often becomes excessively politicized in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Although this paper does not engage in a strict causal analysis, it will be demonstrated how the selected factors interact in complex, non-predetermined manners to destabilize regional,evidence-based planning, and reinforce the public’s perception of political paralysis. Therefore, the institutional framework of intergovernmentalism will be critically analyzed in examining why municipalities tend to operate in isolation. The Eglinton Crosstown and Scarborough subway debate will then highlight the five factors which contribute to this policy crisis. Following, the paper will explore the role of Metrolinx, {{and how it can}} become a legitimate authority to execute efficient and effective transit investments. The policy recommendation of reforming Metrolinx’s regional governance structure will be presented. In addition, expanding the role of the federal government’s fiscal spending powers will be discussed as a policy alternative...|$|E
