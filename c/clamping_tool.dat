5000|$|In {{a storage}} {{room at the}} back of the gallery, the demon stands staring into space, then turns when Angel comes in behind her. She orders him to leave but at that moment, wind and {{lightning}} and thunder spring from nowhere. A swirling portal forms, the shrieking coming from it seeming to draw rapidly closer. A naked humanoid girl drops out of the portal and hits the floor hard. As Angel pulls over a tarp to cover her, he gets a brief but clear glimpse of the girl's smooth forehead and of the raised ridges running along her upper spine. At that moment, Tae and his all-male team break into the room armed with kama weapons. The female demon and Angel battle furiously, but Tae abducts the newly arrived girl and drives away with her. Looking helplessly after the speeding vehicle, Angel asks the female demon what will happen to the girl and learns that she will be [...] "unmade." [...] The male demons take the frightened girl to their base where, without further ado, they use a special <b>clamping</b> <b>tool</b> to cut out the raised ridges extending down from the girl's nape to between her shoulder blades. Gone breathless with fear, the girl screams in agony at the first cut.|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} micro-spindle units, {{a critical}} problem is miniaturization of the <b>tool</b> <b>clamp.</b> Approaches for scaling down conventional <b>tool</b> <b>clamps,</b> {{such as the}} collet-chuck, hydraulic chuck, and shrink-fit methods may be limited by their inherently complicated mechanisms. This study developed a novel <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> based on shape memory alloy (SMA), which allows further miniaturization. The <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> can be simplified by using an SMA ring, which {{is all that is}} needed for <b>clamping.</b> The SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> does not require any collet, and its structural configuration is axisymmetric. Furthermore, the SMA makes it possible to switch between the clamped and unclamped states by using a simple device to regulate small changes in temperature. This paper first describes the operating principle of the SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp.</b> Second, it presents the finite element method (FEM) analyses that were conducted to investigate the characteristics of the clamping/unclamping operations and the effect of centrifugal force. Third, it describes a prototype of the SMA-based <b>tool</b> <b>clamp,</b> which was designed and built for applications in micro-spindle units. Fourth, it presents an evaluation of the time needed for the clamping/unclamping operations and the tool-clamping force, which were both evaluated experimentally. Finally, it describes a mill-machining test conducted with the prototype, which confirmed that the <b>tool</b> <b>clamp</b> is little affected by centrifugal force at high rotational speeds.

40|$|Cutting tools need to {{be changed}} {{constantly}} while the machinability of materials is evaluated by cutting force measurements. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the variation of the cutting force caused by such a tool change. In this study, a homogeneous material was used as the cutting object and an ordinary, mechanically <b>clamped,</b> external cutting <b>tool</b> was used. For the same cutting parameters, when the tool wear can be ignored, the effects of the insert resetting and the whole mechanically <b>clamped</b> cutting <b>tool</b> remounting on the main cutting force were examined. The change in the cutting force caused by the insert resetting and replacing is less than 2 %, while that caused by remounting of the whole mechanically <b>clamped</b> cutting <b>tool</b> is as great as 11 %. If the cutting force is used to evaluate the machinability of materials, a mechanically <b>clamped</b> <b>tool</b> should be used, and the insert can be replaced, but the tool holder should be mounted once only for all subsequent tests. This conclusion is very important for accurate measurement of the cutting force and accurate evaluation of the metal machinability...|$|R

40|$|To {{position}} (without experiencing friction or play) a <b>clamped</b> <b>tool</b> in x-, z- and psi-direction on the Lifrel, a Philips diamond turning machine, an aluminium toolholder {{has been}} designed. The toolholder has {{a stroke of}} +- 0. 5 mm in x- and z- and +- 1 degreesC in psi-direction with an accuracy of respectively 0. 25 microm and 0. 1 degreesC. Positioning can be done manually using the intuitive mechanism with differential micrometers. The mechanism contains a virtual point of rotation, providing translation-free tooltip rotation. Applying this toolholder in combination with a converging adjustment procedure reduces the adjustment time from a two day to a two hour maximum. During machining the desired position is fixed using a clamp, which improves the stiffness and natural frequency. Displacement information for tool positioning on the Lifrel comes from the differential micrometerscale and from measuring a product copy. Applying the toolholder on a more accurate machine requires displacement sensors. Some groove structures made with two tools require a depth variation in or in between grooves. A closed-loop piezo-driven small-stroke module with a profile tool, added to the toolholder, establishes a 10 microm depth variation {{with respect to the}} reference tool at a machining frequency of 50 Hz. An additional encoder attached to the drum, provides necessary position information. A second toolholder is used to position the reference tool...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} {{laser welding}} tests on 45 µm and 95 µm thick Fe 20 Cr 5 Al foils of Sandvik 0 C 404 {{in order to}} study the welding feasibility of the catalytic converter monolith. In accordance with the contact configurations occurring between the corrugated foil and the flat foil during the coiling process of the honeycomb-structured monolith, several laser welding techniques are selected and tested in pulsed and continuous wave mode. For each technique, processing domains are explored to identify the ranges of usable energetical and optical parameters. Continuous-wave in keyhole mode is selected for offering better compatibility with the other manufacturing operations. Optimized-irradiation conditions in argon protective atmosphere for overlapped-joint welding of 2 ? 45 µm foils correspond to full penetration-depth and fusion zone widths of 120 µm and 80 µm. Specific <b>clamping</b> <b>tools</b> are used in order to consolidate honeycomb structure prototypes under the optimized-laser beam conditions. We carry out engine-bench durability tests on these laser welded prototypes and on prototypes strengthened by conventional joining processes. The monolith shows higher performances when consolidated with laser welding than with conventional capacity-discharge welding. These demonstrates the feasibility of the laser welding technique. To study the laser weld behaviour under a stress field and an environment representative of service conditions, isothermal oxidation in both ambient and synthetic air (TGAnalysis) and tensile and creep tests at elevated temperatures are performed on samples including large fractions of laser seams. The laser weld differs significantly from the base material in terms of oxidation and thermomechanical behaviors at high temperature. We interpret these differences by the change in grain morphology and in the localization and combination of the reactive elements, carbon and nitrogen during the fast fusion/solidification cycles...|$|R
40|$|Chatter in {{machining}} process {{is one of}} the common failures of a production line. For a cantilever tool, such as a boring bar, the rule of thumb requires the overhang length of the tool to be less than 4 times the diameter. The reason is because longer overhang will induce severe tool vibration in the form of chatter during machining. When a longer overhang than 4 times diameter is necessary for performing special machining operations, damping methods are needed to suppress tool chatter. One of the methods is the constrained layer damping method. Materials, such viscoelastic material, are applied in the vibration node regions of the structure to absorb the concentrated vibration strain energy and transform the mechanical energy to heat. With a cantilever <b>tool</b> <b>clamped</b> in a <b>tool</b> holder, the <b>clamping</b> interface is usually the vibration node region. The friction in the joint interface with low normal pressure became another source of damping and can be used for tool chatter suppression in mechanical structures. Joint interfaces are well known to possess normal pressure dependent stiffness and damping. The normal pressure’s effect on the structures frequency response function had been observed by H. Åkesson [1] et al, and L. Mi [2] et al. However, the direct effect of the joint interface normal pressure on {{machining process}} stability hasn’t been investigated. In this paper, a cantilever tool with 6. 5 overhang length to diameter ratio is investigated. The direct effect of the <b>tool</b> <b>clamping</b> interface’s normal pressure on the machining process stability is studied. Three different levels of clamping normal pressure are tested with an internal turning process. The machining results indicate another adaptable solution on shop floor for suppressing tool chatter.
