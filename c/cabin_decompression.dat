40|$|Many {{aircraft}} {{make use}} of an on-board oxygen generation system to provide breathing oxygen for the aircrew.

50|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Air Lines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-SR100, {{experienced}} <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression</b> 12 {{minutes after}} takeoff from Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan, at 24,000 feet. The decompression {{was caused by}} failure of a previously repaired aft pressure bulkhead. Cabin air rushed into the unpressurized fuselage cavity, overpressurizing the area and causing failure of the auxiliary power unit (APU) firewall and the supporting structure for the vertical fin. The vertical fin separated from the airplane. Hydraulic components located in the aft body were also severed, leading to a rapid depletion of all four hydraulic systems. The loss of the vertical fin, coupled {{with the loss of}} all four hydraulic systems, left the airplane extremely difficult, if not impossible, to control in all three axes. Lack of independence of four hydraulic systems from a single failure event was a zonal hazard. The aircraft struck a mountain at forty-six minutes after takeoff with 520 fatalities and 4 survivors.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: NASA's {{plans for}} lunar surface {{exploration}} include pressurized suitport rovers that are quickly ingressed and egressed with minimal consumables losses. This capability enables crewmembers to perform multiple short extravehicular activities (EVAs) at different locations {{in a single}} day versus a single 8 -hr EVA. Modeling work and empirical human and animal data indicate that intermittent recompressions between EVA suit pressure and <b>cabin</b> pressure reduce <b>decompression</b> stress. Savings in crew time and gas losses may also be achieved if the N 2 purge is shortened to 2 minutes, achieving 80 % O 2 (vs. 8 minutes, 95 % O 2). METHODS: A validated Tissue Bubble Dynamics Model was used to predict decompression stress using 80 % and 95 % O 2 breathing mixtures during 3 x 2 -hr EVAs (4. 3 PSIA) with 1 hr recompressions back to 8. 0 PSIA (32 % O 2) versus a single 8 -hr EVA. 15 minutes was spent at 6. 0 PSIA before depressurizations to 4. 3 PSIA; initial EVA tasks could be performed during this time. Model validation was based on significant prediction (p< 0. 001) and goodness of fit with 84 cases of DCS in 668 altitude exposures (McFadden s rho-squared= 0. 214). RESULTS: A 2. 2 % predicted increase in DCS risk due to the shortened purge is more than compensated for by a predicted 2. 5 % reduction in DCS risk due to intermittent recompression. 15 minutes at 80 % O 2, 6. 0 PSIA prior to a 4. 3 PSIA EVA prevents supersaturation in the brain and spinal cord (5 - 10 minute half-time compartments) and reduces tissue tensions in 40 min compartments, where most of the body s inert gas is located, to approximately the same levels (4. 39 vs 4. 00 PSIA) as achieved during a 40 min 95 % O 2 prebreathe at 10. 2 PSIA. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent recompressions between lunar EVAs may enable reductions in suit purge and prebreathe requirements, decompression stress, and/or suit operating pressures...|$|R

40|$|A zero-dimensional {{model of}} cockpit and <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression</b> with cockpit {{security}} door is presented. The hinged panels {{in the security}} door were modeled {{to account for the}} pressure-equalization dynamics in the case of cockpit decompression. A comprehensive isentropic and isothermal theoretical analysis is presented with many closed-form and asymptotic solutions. New analytical estimates for the total decompression time and the pressure half-time were derived. The simulations for typical corporate and large-transport-category airplanes with different cabin geometries, discharge coefficients, rupture cross-sectional areas, pressure altitudes, and cabin altitudes have been obtained. The case in which the cockpit depressurizes first and its effect on the <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression</b> and on the security door integrity has been extensively studied. The recently required cockpit doors may be hazardous for flight crew in the case cockpit depressurizes first and other venting and blowout panels malfunction or are too slow to respond. The resulting pressure differential between the cockpit and the cabin can create instantaneous forces in excess of 80 kN on the cockpit security door. In addition, this puts the crew in danger due to explosive decompression on the time scale of 100 ms and increases the possibility of the security door being blown out of the frame...|$|E

40|$|A partial {{pressure}} suit was evaluated during tests in an F- 104 and F- 15 as a protective garment for emergency descents. The garment is an pressure jerkin and modified anti-g suit combined with an oronasal mask. The garment can be donned and doffed at the aircraft to minimize thermal buildup. The oronasal mask was favored by the pilots due to its immobility on the face during high g-loading. The garment was chosen to provide optimum dexterity for the pilot, which is not available in a full pressure suit, while protecting the pilot at altitudes up to 18, 288 meters, during a <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression,</b> and subsequent aircraft descent.

40|$|Aircraft with flight {{capability}} above 1. 4 {{normally have}} an RPM lockup or similar feature to prevent inlet buzz that would occur at low engine airflows. This RPM lockup {{has the effect}} of holding the engine thrust level at the intermediate power (maximum non-afterburning). For aircraft such as military fighters or supersonic transports, the need exists to be able to rapidly slow from supersonic to subsonic speeds. For example, a supersonic transport that experiences a <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression</b> {{needs to be able to}} slow/descend rapidly, and this requirement may size the cabin environmental control system. For a fighter, there may be a desire to slow/descend rapidly, and while doing so to minimize fuel usage and engine exhaust temperature. Both of these needs can be aided by achieving the minimum possible overall net propulsive force. As the intermediate power thrust levels of engines increase, it becomes even more difficult to slow rapidly from supersonic speeds. Therefore, a mode of the performance seeking control (PSC) system to minimize overall propulsion system thrust has been developed and tested. The rapid deceleration mode reduces the engine airflow consistent with avoiding inlet buzz. The engine controls are trimmed to minimize the thrust produced by this reduced airflow, and moves the inlet geometry to degrade the inlet performance. As in the case of the other PSC modes, the best overall performance (in this case the least net propulsive force) requires an integrated optimization of inlet, engine, and nozzle variables. This paper presents the predicted and measured results for the supersonic minimum thrust mode, including the overall effects on aircraft deceleration...|$|E
40|$|The shuttle crew {{wears the}} Advanced Crew Escape Spacesuit (ACES) to protect {{themselves}} from <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression</b> and to support bail out during landing. ACES is cooled by a liquid-cooled garment (LCG) that interfaces to a heat exchanger that dumps heat into the cabin. The ACES outer layer is made of Gore-Tex(Registered TradeMark), permitting water vapor to escape while containing oxygen. The crew can only lose heat via insensible water losses and the LCG. Under nominal landing operations, the average cabin temperature rarely exceeds 75 F, which is adequate for the ACES to function. Problem A rescue shuttle will need to return 11 crew members if the previous mission suffers a thermal protection system failure, preventing it from returning safely to Earth. Initial analysis revealed that 11 crew members in the shuttle will increase cabin temperature at wheel stop above 80 F, which decreases the ACES ability to keep crew members cool. Air flow in the middeck of the shuttle is inhomogeneous and some ACES may experience much higher temperatures that could cause excessive thermal stress to crew members. Methods A ground study was conducted to measure the cooling efficiency of the ACES at 75 F, 85 F, and 95 F at 50 % relative humidity. Test subjects representing 5, 50, and 95 percentile body habitus of the astronaut corps performed hand ergometry keeping their metabolic rate at 400, 600, and 800 BTU/hr for one hour. Core temperature was measured by rectal probe and skin, while inside and outside the suit. Environmental chamber wall and cooling unit inlet and outlet temperatures were measured using high-resolution thermistors (0. 2 C). Conclusions Under these test conditions, the ACES was able to protect the core temperature of all test subjects, however thermal stress due to high insensible losses and skin temperature and skin heat flow may impact crew performance. Further research should be performed to understand the impact on cognitive performance...|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} {{acquired through}} historic failure investigations involving rapid <b>cabin</b> <b>decompression</b> (e. g. Challenger, Columbia and Soyuz 11) show that full evacuation {{of the cabin}} atmosphere may occur within seconds. During such an event, the delta-pressure between the sealed suit ventilation system and the cabin will rise {{at the rate of}} the cabin depressurization; potentially at a rate exceeding the capability of the suit relief valve. It is possible that permanent damage to the suit pressure enclosure and ventilation loop components may occur as the integrated system may be subjected to delta pressures in excess of the design to pressures. Additionally, as the total pressure of the suit ventilation system decreases, so does the oxygen available to the crew. The crew may be subjected to a temporary incapacitating, but non-lethal, hypoxic environment. It is expected that the suit will maintain a survivable atmosphere on the crew until the vehicle pressure control system recovers or the cabin has otherwise attained a habitable environment. A common finding from the aforementioned reports indicates that the crew would have had a better chance at surviving the event had they been in a protective configuration, that is, in a survival suit. Making use of these lessons learned, the Constellation Program implemented a suit loop in the spacecraft design and required that the crew be in a protective configuration, that is suited with gloves on and visors down, during dynamic phases of flight that pose the greatest risk for a rapid and uncontrolled cabin depressurization event: ascent, entry, and docking. This paper details the evaluation performed to derive suit pressure garment and ventilation system performance parameters that would lead to the highest probability of crew survivability after an uncontrolled crew cabin depressurization event while remaining in the realm of practicality for suit design. This evaluation involved: (1) assessment of stakeholder expectations to validate the functionality being imposed; (2) review/refinement of concept of operations to establish the potential triggers for such an event and define the response of the spacecraft and suit ventilation loop pressure control systems; and (3) assessment of system capabilities with respect to structural capability and pressure control. 1 Crew and Thermal Systems Division, NASA Johnson Space Center, Mail Code: AES 29, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston...|$|E
