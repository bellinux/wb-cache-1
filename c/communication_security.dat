In this method, a three-dimensional security evaluation index system was built through positions of index on the external of spherical shell. Evaluation index weights of the top two levels were obtained through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), with sphere radius and the retractable angles. Then, security components’ values of communication content, <b>communication</b> load and <b>security</b> vulnerability of XML communication protocol were calculated. Finally, the security evaluation result of XML communication protocol was obtained through quantization calculation and comprehensive analysis method.
