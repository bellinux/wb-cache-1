2500|$|Quentin Letts of The Daily Mail {{gave the}} show a {{negative}} review, stating that it [...] "is as slow to motor as a lawnmower at spring's first cut". He also criticised {{the show for}} lacking in storytelling and romance, stating that it [...] "assumes that we understand the attraction these two dullards [...] have for the beautiful Christine. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> no better? ... In the end you conclude that she simply seeks out suffering to improve her art." [...] Letts praised the performances and the orchestration but concluded that the show was not a hit: [...] "But {{if it is a}} miss, it is ... a noble miss, noble because Lloyd Webber’s increasingly operatic music tries to lift us to a higher plane." [...] Susannah Clapp of The Observer was also critical of the book and called the show [...] "drab" [...] and [...] "about as tension-filled as winding wool." [...] Even the musical numbers, she wrote, [...] "never meld with the visual splendours, never give the effect, which is Lloyd Webber's gift, of the music delivering the scenery." [...] Sam Marlowe of Time Out London gave the show one out of five stars, calling it [...] "ghastly" [...] and [...] "an interminable musical monstrosity". He observes: [...] "With its sickening swirls of video imagery, pointless plot, and protracted, repetitive songs, Love Never Dies ... is punishingly wearisome." ...|$|E
60|$|Patty {{went downstairs}} and {{stood for a}} moment in the hall, rapt in reflection. If she had been at home, she verily {{believed}} she would have sat down and cried. Oh, it was too bad, too disappointing! Clifford would certainly lose all chance of the permanency, even if the irate news editor did not discharge him at once. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> anything? She must do something.|$|E
60|$|Alas for Ariel! She {{had lived}} for the Master--what more <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> now the Master was gone? She could die for him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Marrying?" [...] {{broke in}} the first, [...] "it {{was the best}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> couldn't stop to ask questions. Some corpses must be buried quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Nancy Shott," [...] said Willy, [...] "you know she's been doin' {{for other}} people all her life {{whenever}} <b>she</b> <b>could!</b> <b>She's</b> <b>done</b> for you more than once, as I happen to know,--and <b>she's</b> <b>done</b> for other neighbors and friends. And, more than that, she's gone abroad to do good, and that's {{more than anybody else}} in this town's done, as I know of!" ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{nothing as}} long as the emperor {{remained}} with his wife night and day, and she began to wonder what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to get him away from her.|$|R
6000|$|What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> but weep too? And is it {{not known}} to all men--certainly it is to all women--how {{dangerous}} are such tears? ...|$|E
60|$|What {{was to be}} done? What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> For {{two minutes}} or more she {{buried her face in}} her wet hands and thought wildly and despairingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, I'm {{not afraid}} of {{anything}} she can say; and what <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> She can't part us, unless you let her, and then I should let her, too." ...|$|E
60|$|Har. Jun. I forced her. What {{resistance}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> but 'twas in vain; I bound her, as I told you, to a tree.|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> see <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not care}} if he saw Griffiths or not. Now that she was there {{he wanted her to}} go quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>did</b> {{not think}} <b>she</b> {{would have gone}} to Aylmer Castle,--though I dare say it is the best thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> seemed to me to dislike the Aylmers,--that is, Lady Aylmer,--so much! But I suppose she is right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|These {{were days}} of formless imaginings and ambitions. [...] "I will do! I will do!" [...] was her ceaseless cry to herself, but what <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> What should she do? ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> to {{make her}} friend and playfellow well and happy again? There was the {{question}} which Zo asked herself, after having seen Carmina carried insensible out of the room.|$|E
6000|$|What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> therefore, {{she seemed}} to ask him, but repeat her {{question}} of a moment before?--which indeed presently she {{made up her mind}} to. [...] "Do you want to marry me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Broadwood {{saw what}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> {{admitted}} that she might make a deplorable mess of things if she were mistaken, but the need was serious enough to justify some risk. She had courage and she was fond of Beatrice.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> teach dancing--but <b>she</b> couldn't dance {{particularly}} well. And {{that was}} all that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “There’s naebody {{thinking}} of you, Hermiston!” cried the offended woman. “We {{think of her}} that’s out of her sorrows. And <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>done</b> waur? Tell me that, Hermiston—tell me that before her clay-cauld corp!” ...|$|R
60|$|He {{turned a}} scarred formless muddle of paint towards Maisie, {{and the eyes}} {{strained}} as though they would catch her wonder and surprise. One thing and one thing only <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> for him.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly a cold fear gripped her. She {{could not}} believe her senses. She was terrified and bewildered. She stared at her father, believing him to be delirious, or mad, or drunk. What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|A maid came in {{now with}} a blue silk gown very thick and soft. <b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} for Miss Freeland? No, thanks, she could not; only, did she know where Mr. Freeland's room was? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, how <b>could</b> <b>she</b> be? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> do?" [...] cried Jill, forgetting her own {{troubles}} {{to look up}} with an open, eager face again.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's naebody {{thinking}} of you, Hermiston!" [...] cried the offended woman. [...] "We {{think of her}} that's out of her sorrows. And <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>done</b> waur? Tell me that, Hermiston--tell me that before her clay-cauld corp!" ...|$|R
60|$|Charley did not analyse his feelings, nor did Katie analyse hers. It {{would have}} been {{impossible}} for her to <b>do</b> so. But <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have <b>done</b> it, and had <b>she</b> <b>done</b> it, <b>she</b> would have found that her gratitude was but the excuse which she made to herself for a passionate love which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not have excused, even to herself, in any other way.|$|R
60|$|This pretty bird, O! how she {{flies and}} sings,[20] But <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> so {{if she had}} not wings? Her wings bespeak my faith, her songs my peace; When I believe and sing my doubtings cease.|$|E
60|$|But Dolly {{could say}} nothing; no, not when Emma kissed her cheek a hundred times, and {{covered it with}} tears, <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> more than hang upon her neck, and sob, and clasp, and hold her tight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I inquired {{whether she}} were also content, and she replied, 'Certainly not'; but what <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> to {{regenerate}} her people, she who {{was nothing but}} a woman, and the last of an endless line of rulers? ...|$|E
50|$|Ken and Minatsu's classmate. She is cute {{but failed}} to garner votes in the {{popularity}} poll due to defects in her character. Subsequently, she became an idol to show them what <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> made a film with Ken starring in it, to which the audio from the film was misunderstood by the girls of the student council about Ken's identity.|$|R
60|$|She was so confounded that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{nothing but}} blink {{for a long}} time.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{this because}} Crosby {{did not have}} on {{a full head of}} steam.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Why, there isn't {{anything}} she wouldn't do. Why, once...." [...] Eustace broke off. The anecdote {{which he had}} been about to tell contained information which, on reflection, he did not wish to reveal.|$|E
6000|$|With such a confederacy against her--with a {{knowledge}} so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself, which at last, though long {{after it was}} observable to everybody else--burst on her--what <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What could I do with Lady Penwether, Duke? Or what <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> with him? A man won't {{care for}} what his sister says to him. And I don't suppose she'd {{undertake}} {{to speak to}} Lord Rufford on the subject." ...|$|E
60|$|Mark's happy-go-lucky way {{of taking}} things did not {{convince}} his sister; but as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing, <b>she</b> submitted {{and made her}} friends as comfortable as <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then Mrs. St. Clare {{began to}} cry, and say every one was unkind to her, and Miss Ophelia {{saw it was}} no use saying {{anything}} more. There was only one other thing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> wrote to Mrs. Shelby, telling her that poor Uncle Tom was going to be sold again. She asked her to send money to buy him back, as soon as possible.|$|R
60|$|How was she to {{give him}} the purse? It was burning a hole in her pocket till <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so; and yet how was she {{to get it out of}} her {{possession}} into his, and make her little speech, here in the public garden? <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> it easily enough at home in the drawing-room at Surbiton Cottage.|$|R
