500|$|Although {{geographically}} {{the largest}} of the Solomon Islands, Bougainville was politically part of Australian New Guinea and Prime Minister John Curtin desired that Australia should contribute to the garrison. Savige’s IICorps was ordered to [...] "reduce enemy resistance on Bougainville Island as opportunity offers without committing major forces". [...] "To a commander like General Savige, who was not only deeply imbued with the doctrine of aggressiveness which was an AIF article of faith in both world wars but also burning to end his military career in a swirl of action,"" [...] wrote <b>correspondent</b> <b>John</b> Hetherington, Savige's orders [...] "were invitingly flexible." [...] GHQ reckoned that there were no more than 12,000Japanese left on Bougainville, while LHQ estimated 25,000.

His ensuing investigative reports into Colt's downfall earned him a local Emmy, and eventually a correspondent position at The Daily Show.

Perone compared it to the '90s American dance music scene and commented on how the [...] "techno aspect of the piece is muted; however, Selena's voice is electronically processed {{for part of the}} recording." [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] incorporates [...] "rhythmic shifts from accentuation on off-beats to accentuation on the beat".

50|$|Still, it was CNN whose {{coverage}} {{gained the}} most popularity and indeed its wartime coverage {{is often cited}} {{as one of the}} landmark events in the network's history, ultimately leading to the establishment of CNN International.

The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau.

After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq.|$|R
