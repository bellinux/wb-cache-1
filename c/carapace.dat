5|$|Adults {{are mostly}} white, but the front {{half of the}} rostrum, and {{the sides of the}} abdomen, are pink. Bright red bands extend across the base of the rostrum, the {{posterior}} edge of the <b>carapace,</b> the chelipeds, and each of the abdominal segments. The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal <b>carapace.</b>|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum is longer than that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the <b>carapace</b> only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the <b>carapace</b> is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|Adult Potamon fluviatile {{may reach}} a <b>carapace</b> length of , with females being {{generally}} smaller than males. As with other crabs, {{the body is}} roughly square, with the reduced abdomen tucked beneath the thorax. The thorax bears five pairs of legs, {{the first of which}} is armed with large claws.|$|E

5|$|Females of the {{jumping spider}} Portia fimbriata have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. The Queensland variety is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} Northern Territory variety. The cephalothorax is about 4millimetres long and 3millimetres wide, and the abdomen about 4millimetres long and 2.2millimetres wide. The front of the cephalothorax is large and angular, and the face is broad, high and flat. In Australia and Taiwan, both sexes have a generally dark brown <b>carapace,</b> reddish brown chelicerae ("jaws"), a brown underside, and dark brown palps with white hairs. Both sexes also have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair. However, the female has a white fringe just above the chelicerae, while the back half of the male's cephalothorax has a white band round the bottom edge and a white groove down the back. While male spiders' palps are larger than females', the palps of P.fimbriata females have a fringe of hair that makes them look about as larger as males'. The abdomens of both sexes are dark brown, with white spots on the upper side. Wanless' female from New Guinea has an orange <b>carapace</b> and chelicerae with sooty markings, palps mainly light yellow, legs orange-brown legs, and abdomen light yellow. Wanless also found a male from the Amboina area in Indonesia, showing an orange-brown <b>carapace</b> and chelicerae, yellow-brown to orange-brown palps, orange-brown legs and a light yellowish abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown <b>carapace,</b> with a predominantly white abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction {{occurs in}} winter; the male stands over the female and forms a cage {{with his legs}} {{protecting}} her while she moults. Internal fertilisation takes place before the hardening of the new <b>carapace,</b> {{with the aid of}} two abdominal appendages (gonopods). After mating, the female retreats to a pit on the sea floor to lay her eggs. Between 250,000 and 3,000,000 fertilised eggs are held under the female's abdomen for up to eight months until they hatch.|$|E
50|$|The Tunisian spur-thighed {{tortoise}} {{is a relatively}} small tortoise. The adult males usually have <b>carapaces</b> that seldom exceed 13 cm (about 4.5 in), whilst the adult females' <b>carapaces</b> {{are no more than}} 16.5 cm (some 6.5 in) long. The geographically closest population of the T. graeca group, from Morocco, is decidedly larger.|$|R
50|$|Structures {{have several}} nicknames such as blobs, beetles, scarabs, turtles, insect <b>carapaces,</b> {{computer}} mice.|$|R
5000|$|Trace fossils are {{associated}} with many Burgess Shale-type deposits. [...] They are often associated with the innards of soft-bodied organisms, and are particularly prevalent under the <b>carapaces</b> of bivalved arthropods. [...] Burrowing organisms seem to have used the high-sulfur decay fluids as a nutrient source when farming bacteria in the microenvironment under the <b>carapaces,</b> indicated by their repeated uses of individual burrows.|$|R
5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular <b>carapace.</b> All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk for other purposes, including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} {{crustacean}} {{is composed}} of segments, which are grouped into three regions: the cephalon or head, the thorax, and the pleon or abdomen. The head and thorax may be {{fused together to form}} a cephalothorax, which may be covered by a single large <b>carapace.</b> The crustacean body is protected by the hard exoskeleton, which must be moulted for the animal to grow. The shell around each somite can be divided into a dorsal tergum, ventral sternum and a lateral pleuron. Various parts of the exoskeleton may be fused together.|$|E
5|$|The {{cephalothorax}} of Z.sexpunctatus is {{bronze to}} black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the <b>carapace,</b> ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E

5000|$|Before the Pleistocene, Glyptodon’s osteoderms were {{attached}} by syntoses and {{were found in}} double or triple rows {{on the front and}} sides of the <b>carapace’s</b> edges, {{as well as in the}} tail armor and cephalic shield. The <b>carapace’s</b> osteoderms were conical with a rounded point, while the ones on the tail were just conical. The sulci between these raised structures were deep and wide with parallel lines.|$|R
50|$|Some {{invertebrates}} use calcium compounds {{for building}} their exoskeleton (shells and <b>carapaces)</b> or endoskeleton (echinoderm plates and poriferan calcareous spicules).|$|R
5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past the margins of the <b>carapace.</b> Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (ramus) of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is made up}} {{of twelve}} body {{segments}}, the last of which is fused to the first segment of the abdomen. There is no <b>carapace,</b> but each of the eleven free segments bears a pair of phyllopodia, which have a series of bristles pointing along the animal's midline. The abdomen consists of seven segments without appendages, and a slender telson which bears a pair of caudal rami.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{belongs to the}} family Emydidae. The {{specific}} name, insculpta, refers to the rough, sculptured surface of the <b>carapace.</b> This turtle species inhabits aquatic and terrestrial areas of North America, primarily the northeast of the United States and parts of Canada. Wood turtle populations are under high conservation concerns due to human interference of natural habitats. Habitat destruction and fragmentation can negatively impact the ability for wood turtles to search for suitable mates and build high quality nests.|$|E

5|$|Turtles are {{notable for}} their {{protective}} shells. They have an inflexible trunk {{encased in a}} horny <b>carapace</b> above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth {{have been replaced by}} sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi is {{a species}} of mud crab that is native to the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also become {{established}} outside its native range, living in Swansea Docks since 1960, the Mediterranean Sea since the 1970s, the North Sea since 2007 and the Black Sea since 2010. It can reach a <b>carapace</b> width of , and has black tips to its unequal claws. It feeds on bivalves and barnacles, and is in turn eaten by predators including the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. Eggs are produced from spring to autumn, the offspring reach sexual maturity the following summer, and individuals can live {{for up to two}} years. The closest relative of D.sayi is D.texanus, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico; the two species differ in subtle features of the genitalia and the last pair of walking legs.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the <b>carapace</b> and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective <b>carapace.</b> Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
5|$|Leptostraca is {{the only}} extant order of Phyllocarida, the other two orders, Archaeostraca and Hoplostraca being extinct. Leptostracans {{are thought to be}} the most {{primitive}} of the malacostracans and date back to the Cambrian period. They range in length from , most being suspension feeders though some are carnivores or scavengers. They have a two part <b>carapace</b> which encloses the head, the whole thorax and part of the abdomen and are the only malcostracans with seven abdominal segments. Three families are known with several genera and about twenty species. They are found worldwide from the intertidal zone to the deep ocean, all but one species being benthic (living on the seabed).|$|E
5|$|Portia fimbriata, {{sometimes}} called the fringed jumping spider, is a jumping spider (family Salticidae) found in Australia and Southeast Asia. Adult females have bodies 6.8 to 10.5millimetres long, while those of adult males are 5.2 to 6.5millimetres long. Both sexes have a generally dark brown <b>carapace,</b> reddish brown chelicerae ("fangs"), a brown underside, dark brown palps with white hairs, and dark brown abdomens with white spots on the upper side. Both sexes have fine, faint markings and soft fringes of hair, and the legs are spindly and fringed. However, specimens from New Guinea and Indonesia have orange-brown carapaces and yellowish abdomens. In all species of the genus Portia, the abdomen distends when the spider is well fed or producing eggs.|$|E

5000|$|The {{flesh of}} Trionyx was eaten from Predynastic times to {{as late as}} the Old Kingdom, and later the flesh of turtles began to be {{considered}} an [...] "abomination of Ra" [...] and the role of these animals became an evil one. Turtle <b>carapaces</b> and scutes from Red Sea Turtles (Chelonia Imbricata) were used in rings, bracelets, dishes, bowls, knife hilts, amulets, and combs. Land tortoise <b>carapaces</b> from Kleinmann's tortoise were used as sounding boards for lutes, harps and mandolins. Turtle shells were also used to make norvas, an instrument resembling a banjo.|$|R
