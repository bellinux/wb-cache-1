40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> {{prophylaxis}} reduces {{morbidity and}} mortality in HIV- 1 -infected children, but mechanisms for these benefits are unclear. METHODS: CHAP was a randomized trial comparing <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis with placebo in HIV-infected children in Zambia where background bacterial resistance to <b>cotrimoxazole</b> is high. We compared causes of mortality and hospital admissions, and antibiotic use between randomized groups. RESULTS: Of 534 children (median age, 4. 4 years; 32 % 1 - 2 years), 186 died and 166 had one or more hospital admissions not ending in death. <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis was associated with lower mortality, both outside hospital (P = 0. 01) and following hospital admission (P = 0. 005). The largest excess of hospital deaths {{in the placebo group}} was from respiratory infections [22 / 56 (39 %) placebo versus 10 / 35 (29 %) cotrimoxazole]. By 2 years, the cumulative probability of dying in hospital from a serious bacterial infection (predominantly pneumonia) was 7 % on <b>cotrimoxazole</b> and 12 % on placebo (P = 0. 08). There was a trend towards lower admission rates for serious bacterial infections in the <b>cotrimoxazole</b> group (19. 1 per 100 child-years at risk versus 28. 5 in the placebo group, P = 0. 09). Despite less total follow-up due to higher mortality, more antibiotics (particularly penicillin) were prescribed in the placebo group in year one [6083 compared to 4972 days in the <b>cotrimoxazole</b> group (P = 0. 05) ].

40|$|Bacterial {{resistance}} {{has increased}} in the AIDS era and is attributed to {{the widespread use of}} <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. In Tanzania, <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis has been used for more than ten years. Little is known, however, about its impact on the spread of antibiotic resistance in HIV positive patients. This cross-sectional study was done to compare magnitude of bacterial resistance to <b>cotrimoxazole</b> and other antimicrobials among isolates from HIV infected patients on <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis and those not on prophylaxis and non-HIV patients attending Bugando Medical Centre (BMC). Susceptibility testing on obtained urine and swab specimens followed Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute, 2010, Guidelines. Of 945 samples collected, 155 had positive bacterial growth after 24 hours of incubation. Of the positive samples (72), 46. 4 % were from HIV positive patients.

40|$|Objectives: To conduct two {{economic}} analyses addressing whether to: routinely monitor HIV-infected children on antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinically or with laboratory tests; continue or stop <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis when children become stabilized on ART. Design and methods: The ARROW randomized trial investigated alternative strategies to deliver paediatric ART and <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis in 1206 Ugandan/Zimbabwean children. Incremental cost-effectiveness {{and value of}} implementation analyses were undertaken. Scenario analyses investigated whether laboratory monitoring (CD 4 tests for efficacy monitoring; haematology/biochemistry for toxicity) could be tailored and targeted to be delivered cost-effectively. <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> use was examined in malaria-endemic and non-endemic settings. Results: Using all trial data, clinical monitoring delivered similar health outcomes to routine laboratory monitoring, but at a reduced cost, so was cost-effective. Continuing <b>cotrimoxazole</b> improved health outcomes at reduced costs. Restricting routine CD 4 monitoring to after 52 weeks following ART initiation and removing toxicity testing was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 6084 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) across all age groups, but was much lower for older children (12 + years at initiation; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio =  769 dollars/QALY). Committing resources to improve <b>cotrimoxazole</b> implementation appears cost-effective.

In this study we evaluated {{the efficacy of the}} long- term low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis with <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> and Nalidixic-acid in the patients with recurrent UTI. Materials & Methods: This study is a before and after clinical trial without control group done on 100 patients with recurrent UTI who had referred to Ekbatan Hospital. These patients had no urologic findings in clinical and para-clinical evaluations. These patients were treated by <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> or Nalidixic-acid in long term-low dose Antibiotic prophylaxis method according to urine culture and antibiogram. These patients followed with urine cultures in the therapeutic and 6 month follow-up periods. Also, we evaluated the differences between age, gender, type of microorganism, marital status, re-infection time and number of recurrences before treatment. Results: Our study includes 100 patients (83 % female and 17 % male). The mean+/-SD age of the patients in the group treated with <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> (group A) was 15. 57 +/- 13. 03 and in the patients treated with Nalidixic-acid (group B) was 13. 67 +/- 10. 9 years. 74 % of the patients who were treated with <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> were single and this number was 66 % for the nalidixic-acid group. E. coli, kelebsiella and proteous account for 80 %, 18 % and 2 % of infections in the <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> group, respectively. These microorganisms account for 62 %, 34 % and 4 % of infections in the nalidixic-acid group respectively. The re-infection rate for the <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> group was 18 % which 82 % of them were successfully treated.

40|$|Background: Trimethoprim is {{considered}} as a trimethoxy benzyl pyrimidine, the action mechanism {{of which is to}} block the synthesis of tetrahydrifolate. Sulfamethoxazole is an antibacterial drug from the sulfanamide group, this drug prevents from synthesis of dihydrofolic acid. Trimethoprim which is consumed along with sulfonamide controls the metabolic oxidants which in turn increases the anti microbial effect of each drug. In this research the effects of <b>cotrimoxazole</b> on the biochemical blood factors in adults male rats were studied. Materials and Methods: The animals used in the experiment were 50 male wistar rats each weighting 250 grams. The rats were divided into 5 groups of 10 randomly.

All groups receiving <b>cotrimoxazole</b> showed no significant difference in FBS and uric acid compared with the control and sham groups (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Likely <b>cotrimoxazole</b> increases cholesterol concentration which probably due to thyroid hormones decrease and cholesterol liver reabsorption. <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> increases creatinine concentration probably due to inhibited creatinine tubular secretion. Cotrimonazole increases BUN concentration probably due to liver failure induced by the drug...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{retrospectively}} reviewed a 10 -year {{experience of}} administration of <b>cotrimoxazole</b> alone in 31 patients compared with 109 {{patients who received}} conventional eradication therapy (<b>cotrimoxazole</b> plus doxycycline). The baseline characteristics, the clinical manifestations, the initial intravenous antibiotic treatments, and the mean duration of eradication therapy {{between the two groups}} were similar. The culture-confirmed recurrences among the patients who received <b>cotrimoxazole</b> alone and those who received the conventional regimen were not significantly different (1 / 31 [3. 2 %] versus 5 / 109 [4. 5 % odds ratio = 0. 69 [95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0. 08 – 6. 17]). Gastrointestinal side effects were more common among the conventional regimen group (28 / 109 [25. 7 %] versus 2 / 31 [6. 5 %], P = 0. 02) and the proportion of patients who could complete at least 20 weeks of therapy without having switched to the other regimen was significantly lower (91 / 109 [83. 5 %] versus 31 / 31 [100. 0 %] P = 0. 01). <b>Cotrimoxazole</b> alone is as effective as and better tolerated than <b>cotrimoxazole</b> plus doxycycline for the eradication treatment of melioidosis...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} collaborative HIV/TB activities recommended by the World Health Organization in the Littoral Province of Cameroon from 2007 to 2009. Methods: Data from the tuberculosis (TB) and HIV registers of 30 health facilities (basic management units for TB) from 2007 to 2009 were analysed. During this time period, standard operating procedures for antituberculous therapy, HIV testing of TB patients, and <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis for HIV positive TB patients, had been introduced and monitored. Measures had been taken to ensure the continuous availability of HIV test reagents and <b>cotrimoxazole,</b> and charges for HIV tests and <b>cotrimoxazole</b> had been abolished. Results: The HIV testing rate rose from 55. 0...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report a}} 60 -year-old immunocompetent patient with chronic biliary {{isosporiasis}} {{who failed to}} re-spond to orally administered <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis and orally administered treatment with nitazoxanide, a 5 -nitrothiazole benzamide compound. Severe malabsorption was regarded as responsible for the subtherapeutic levels of nitazoxanide in plasma and bile, resulting in treatment failure. Intravenously administered <b>cotrimoxazole</b> stopped the shedding of Isospora belli oocysts in bile within 5 days, excluding initially suspected resistance to <b>cotrimoxazole.</b> Patients with malabsorption and cholangitis due to Coccidia such as Isospora belli and Cryptosporidium spp. or due to protozoa that cause microsporidiasis seem to be predisposed to fail to respond to otherwise effective treatment...|$|E

Bacterial resistance has increased in the AIDS era and is attributed to {{the widespread use of}} <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients. In Tanzania, <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis has been used for more than ten years. Little is known, however, about its impact on the spread of antibiotic resistance in HIV positive patients. This cross-sectional study was done to compare magnitude of bacterial resistance to <b>cotrimoxazole</b> and other antimicrobials among isolates from HIV infected patients on <b>cotrimoxazole</b> prophylaxis and those not on prophylaxis and non-HIV patients attending Bugando Medical Centre (BMC). Susceptibility testing on obtained urine and swab specimens followed Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute, 2010, Guidelines. Of 945 samples collected, 155 had positive bacterial growth after 24 hours of incubation. Of the positive samples (72), 46. 4 % were from HIV positive patients. The common isolates were E. coli 41. 3 % (64 / 155), Klebsiella pneumoniae 17. 5 % (27 / 155), and Staphylococcus aureus 16. 1 % (25 / 155). Overall, bacterial resistance to <b>cotrimoxazole</b> was 118 (76. 1 %); among isolates from HI...|$|E
