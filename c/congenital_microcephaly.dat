40|$|Abstract Introduction: in 2015 an {{increasing}} number of <b>congenital</b> <b>microcephaly</b> cases were associated to maternal infection due to Zika virus. Some of these patients presented other alterations and arthrogryposis was the most frequently found. Arthrogryposis is defined as congenital joint contractures involving at least two different areas of the body. Description: arthrogryposis was found in 18 patients with <b>congenital</b> <b>microcephaly</b> due to Zika virus. 67 % of the cases were vaginal deliveries. 50 % of resuscitation performed in the delivery room was necessary. The mean birth weight was 2. 371 g, gestational age was 39 weeks and the head circumference was 28. 3 cm, 15 (83 %) of these patients presented severe microcephaly. All the neonates resulted in concomitant hip joints and some also had knees, ankles and wrists affected. Nine neonates (50 %) presented an early respiratory distress and four (22 %) died due to respiratory failure. Discussion: the neurological result found in patients with Congenital Zika Syndrome seems to be associated to the maternal infection period. During the early stages of embryogenesis, in addition to microcephaly, could be related to the peripheral motor nerves leading to fetal akinesia, joint stiffness and arthrogryposis. These neonates tend to present greater morbimortality with the worst prognosis...|$|E

40|$|Background: Autosomal {{recessive}} defects {{of either}} the B 1, E 1, M 1 or S 1 subunit of the Adaptor Protein complex- 4 (AP 4) are characterized by developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, spasticity, and occasionally mild to moderate microcephaly of essentially postnatal onset. Case presentation: We report on a patient with severe microcephaly of prenatal onset, and progressive spasticity, developmental delay, and severe intellectual deficiency. Exome sequencing showed a homozygous mutation in AP 4 M 1, causing the replacement of an arginine by a stop codon at position 338 of the protein (p. Arg 338 X). The premature stop codon truncates the Mu homology domain of AP 4 M 1, with predicted loss of function. Exome analysis also showed heterozygous variants in three genes, ATR, MCPH 1 and BLM, which are known causes of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly. Conclusions: Our findings expand the AP 4 M 1 phenotype to severe microcephaly of prenatal onset, and more generally suggest that the AP 4 defect might share mechanisms of prenatal neuronal depletion with other genetic defects of brain development causing <b>congenital,</b> primary <b>microcephaly.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Defects in {{cholesterol}} synthesis {{result in}} a wide variety of symptoms, from neonatal lethality to the relatively mild dysmorphic features and developmental delay found in individuals with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. We report here the identification of mutations in sterol-C 4 -methyl oxidase–like gene (SC 4 MOL) as the cause of an autosomal recessive syndrome in a human patient with psoriasiform dermatitis, arthralgias, <b>congenital</b> cataracts, <b>microcephaly,</b> and developmental delay. This gene encodes a sterol-C 4 -methyl oxidase (SMO), which catalyzes demethylation of C 4 -methylsterols in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. C 4 -Methylsterols are meiosis-activating sterols (MASs). They exist at high concentrations in the testis and ovary and play roles in meiosis activation. In this study, we found that an accumulation of MASs in the patient led to cell overproliferation in both skin and blood. SMO deficiency also substantially altered immunocyte phenotype and in vitro function. MASs serve as ligands for liver X receptors α and β (LXRα and LXRβ), which are important in regulating not only lipid transport in the epidermis, but also innate and adaptive immunity. Deficiency of SMO represents a biochemical defect in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, the clinical spectrum of which remains to be defined...|$|R

We present three pairs of affected siblings with MICRO syndrome, who were born with <b>congenital</b> <b>microcephaly,</b> microcornea, and cataracts. MICRO syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndrome consisting of <b>congenital</b> <b>microcephaly,</b> cortical dysplasia, microcornea, cataracts, optic atrophy, severe mental retardation, hypotonic diplegia, and hypogenitalism. At birth, MICRO syndrome resembles Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal (COFS) syndrome, but it differs in the lack of the rapidly progressive neurologic features leading to severe brain atrophy with calcifications. Patients with MICRO syndrome manifest frontal cortical dysplasia, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, cortical blindness with optic atrophy, profound mental retardation, and progressive joint contractures with growth failure. COFS syndrome shares also many clinical and cellular similarities with Cockayne syndrome (CS), and cultured cells in both conditions demonstrate hypersensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to impaired nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER studies in cultured fibroblasts from MICRO patients give normal results, so MICRO syndrome should be considered in children with features resembling COFS syndrome and CS, but who have normal NER. MICRO should be distinguished from other similar clinical disorders with normal NER by the presence of significant visual impairment and cortical blindness despite early surgery for congenital cataracts, frontal polymicrogyria, thin corpus callosum, and cortical atrophy by MRI.

40|$|Microcephaly {{is defined}} as a head {{circumference}} more than two standard deviations below the mean for gender and age. <b>Congenital</b> <b>microcephaly</b> is present at birth, whereas postnatal microcephaly occurs later in life. Genetic abnormalities, syndromes, metabolic disorders, teratogens, infections, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal injuries can cause both congenital and postnatal microcephaly. Evaluation of patients with microcephaly begins with a thorough history and physical examination. In cases of worsening microcephaly or neurological signs or symptoms, neuroimaging, metabolic, or genetic testing should be strongly considered. Any further studies and workup should be directed by the presence of signs or symptoms pointing to an underlying diagnosis and are usually used as confirmatory testing for certain conditions. Neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often the first diagnostic test in evaluating children with microcephaly. Genetic testing is becoming more common and is often the next step following neuroimaging when there is no specific evidence in the history or physical examination suggesting a diagnosis.

At birth, the facial appearance and brain MRI scan were characteristic of MCPHA, with the additional features of partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and a closed spinal dysraphic state. Urine levels of alpha-ketoglutaric acid were normal at birth and during metabolic crisis, but were markedly elevated {{during a time of}} metabolic stability.
