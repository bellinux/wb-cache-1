This paper focuses on taking a more musical {{approach to the}} design of warnings and alarms than has been the case in the past. We present an experimental pilot study in which we explore the possibilities of using short musical pieces as warning signals in a vehicle cab. In the study, 18 experienced drivers experienced five different driving scenarios with different levels of urgency. Each scenario was presented together with an auditory icon, a traditional abstract warning sound, and a musical warning sound designed in collaboration with a composer. The test was carried out in an ``audio-only'' environment. Drivers were required to rate the perceived urgency, annoyance and appropriateness for every sound. They also had a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> freely <b>about</b> the different warning signals. The results indicate interestingly that drivers may be able to understand the intended meaning of musical warning signals. It seems like the musical warning signals may prove useful primarily in situations of low and medium levels of urgency...|$|R

In order to define the topic and stick to the relevant information two questions were elected. What motivation orientation drives the participants in their own training? What behavior is reflected in their role as an instructor? Interviews with 10 individuals were performed. A semi-structured interview guide was designed to give participants a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> freely <b>about</b> the subject, but through structured questions stick to the topic. Interview responses were analyzed and interpreted with the Theory of self-determination. The {{results show that the}} training instructors/coaches found their motivation for self-training through partial goals and fitness goals.

This project focused on men’s perceptions since men tend to be more vulnerable in the face of divorce and separation than women are. The methods used are semi-structured interviews and the findings indicated that the coping strategies prevalent in the workshops are active coping, focus on and venting of emotions, seeking social support, and positive reinterpretation and growth. The analysis showed that seeking social support and positive reinterpretation and growth are associated with an increase in psychological well-being of the men. On the other hand, active coping and focus on and venting of emotions are beneficial in some situations but not in others...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The {{aim of this study}} was to achieve a better understanding of: the role played by urban regeneration in altering the degree and distribution of socio-economic variations in mental health; the impact of socio-economic changes on people with differential vulnerability to the development of common mental illness; the measurement of subjective well-being in urban settings and what factors contribute to its improvement or maintenance during socio-economic change. Main Topics : This data collection is made up of three distinct parts: The first part consists of data collected from a postal survey carried out at baseline and follow up 18 months later. Information was collected about the individuals' mental health, quality of life (QOL), personal circumstances and consulting behaviour. Samples were taken randomly from the electoral register for the Index and Control Areas of the study. The second part consists of data from face-to-face structured interviews carried out one year after the initial questionnaire was sent out and again twelve months later. The individuals were asked to comment on noticed changes to their locality and any changes they believed were needed. Information was also collected about their mental health and QOL. Samples were taken randomly from those individuals who had completed the postal survey and lived in the Index Area. The third part consists of data from in-depth qualitative interviews completed towards the end of the study. The individuals involved at this stage were a sub-group of the structured interviews. These were identified as individuals who had reported changes taking place and had experienced a change in their mental health and well-being. In this interview the individuals were given the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> freely <b>about</b> their experiences which allowed the researchers to explore the mechanisms at work from their perspective...|$|R

2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band {{in the world right}} now. And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because you feel like a veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice <b>to</b> have the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them <b>about</b> their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper - „Possibilities for {{studying}} reception. Based on {{the reception of}} text that contains a charge” – dealt {{with the question of}} how different methods are suitable for reception studies. In order to make any conclusions, three types of experiments were conducted. All of them used students as participants. The total number of participants was 40. In the first type of experiment a self-written narrative of the given story by the participants, a questionnaire with semantic differential and a group-discussion were used as methods in order to study reception (number of participants in this experiment: 21). The second one used a questionnaire with semantic differential and a group-discussion (number of participants in this experiment: 9). The third one included a questionnaire with semantic differential and an in- depth interview (number of participants in this experiment: 10). The conclusions based on those experiments were as follows: • using an in-depth interview doesn’t make it possible to judge the impact that other people may have on the participant, but it gives the most thorough answers per person to the questions asked by the researcher, • a group that includes people, who are befriended, gives good results when used in group-discussion. These people are already used to speak out in front of eachother and one can imagine, that in a everyday-situation people discuss articles they have read foremost with their friends or aquaintances, • by a group-discussion thoughts of introvert individuals might be left unheard, because other participants will not give them a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> • questions <b>about</b> reading-habits of the participant are more useful asked orally than in a questionnaire, • using a commentarium before the reception experiments, proved to be a good opportunity to form hypotheses for judgements given by the participants, • no firm conclusions can be made about the participants personal judgements based on their written narratives. The participants seem to focus on retelling the facts provided in the lead, • the semantic differential is effective only when the participants predicate their judgements. Otherwise the numbers will be hard to explain. Based on the three variations of the reception experiment it is my personal belief that in terms of methodology the best possible combination is as follows: discourse analysis of the story + analysis of the commentarium + questionnaires using the semantic differential + in-depth interviews + group experiments. Having used a text containing a charge (SLÕL „Imik sai kodus raskeid vigastusi) in its original form and a version altered using the criteria of objectivity by in-depth interviews and group interviews I concluded, that participants tended to take an accusing attitude towards the mother of the child in both cases. The altered text seemed boring to the participants. It could not touch them on a personal level like the original text did. It also appeared, that opinions are affected by previous experience...|$|R
