The stimulations rates are proportional to the light intensity measured by sensors on the right and left sides of the mobile robot. The mobile robot has two wheels that receive velocity commands proportional to the population spike rates recorded by two electrodes in the spinal cord. Therefore, the natural stabilizing behavior—in which the lamprey tracks the vertical axis—correspond, in the hybrid system to tracking a source of light.

40|$|The {{synchronous}} {{family of}} languages (Lustre, Esterel, Signal, Statecharts) provide {{a great deal of}} support for verifying a control program at the design and compilation stage. However, a common aspect of embedded systems is that significant properties of the system can not be verified by formally analysing the controller (software) on its own. To analyse the system one requires to state and document assumptions on the environment. Furthermore, proving timeliness properties necessitates justifying a sampling interval and relating the synchronous step to metric time. Support for these activities is generally missing from current formal methods tools. In this paper we exploit simulation models [...] based on physical modelling of the environment [...] together with theorem proving, to prove properties of a <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> system.

40|$|Nonoverlapping <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> {{of around}} 25 - 35 amino acids formed via nonlocal {{interactions}} at the loop ends {{have been proposed}} as an important unit of protein structure. This hypothesis is significant as such short loops can fold quickly and so would not be bound by the Leventhal paradox, giving insight into the possible nature of the funnel in protein folding. Previously, these <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> have been identified either by sequence analysis (conservation and autocorrelation) or studies of the geometry of individual proteins. Given the potential significance of the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> hypothesis, we have explored a new strategy for determining <b>closed</b> <b>loops</b> from the insertions identified by the structural alignment of proteins sharing the same overall fold.

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{expected}} that the intelligent controlling mechanism of a robot is a computer system. Research is however now ongoing in which biological neural networks are being cultured and trained to act as the brain of an interactive real world robot - thereby either completely replacing or operating in a cooperative fashion with a computer system. Studying such neural systems can give a distinct insight into biological neural structures and therefore such research has immediate medical implications. In particular, the use of rodent primary dissociated cultured neuronal networks for the control of mobile `animals' (artificial animals, a contraction of animal and materials) is a novel approach to discovering the computational capabilities of networks of biological neurones. A dissociated culture of this nature requires appropriate embodiment in some form, to enable appropriate development in a controlled environment within which appropriate stimuli may be received via sensory data but ultimate influence over motor actions retained. The principal aims of the present research are to assess the computational and learning capacity of dissociated cultured neuronal networks {{with a view to}} advancing network level processing of artificial neural networks.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that {{subspace}} identification methods that assume open loop data without correlations between the input and noise, may give biased estimates when applied to <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> data. The effect of the controller gain parameters {{on the quality of the}} identified model is studied when <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> data are used. Several subspace identification methods (both open <b>loop</b> and <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> methods), and different simulated data sets ranging from ideal 2 x 2 linear systems, to a fairly realistic nonlinear debutanizer process simulator, are considered. The results show that up to a point, higher controller gain during the identification experiment gives more accurate models than with lower controller gain, for both open and <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> subspace identification methods. It is observed that the sensitivity to the controller gain is very small for the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> sub-space method tested for the ideal cases when its assumptions are satisfied. An explaination for this is that in this case there will be no bias, while the open loop methods may have a bias that depends on the controller parameters. Another interesting observation is that for the debutanizer example, the nonlinearities seem to lead to biased estimates also with the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> subspace method, and the choice of controller gain appears to be just as important as the use of a <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> subspace identification method for the accuracy of the estimates...|$|R
