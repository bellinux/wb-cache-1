5|$|The competences of sejmiks varied over time, {{and there}} were also {{geographical}} differences. Often, numerous different types of sejmiks coexisted in the same governance structure. Almost always presided over by the marshal, sejmiks could often elect delegates to the national sejm, and sometimes <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> binding instructions. Sejmiks attained the peak of their importance {{at the turn of}} the 18th century, when they effectively supplanted the inefficient national sejm.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a sense of financial and personal independence. Women {{who are able to}} work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|When {{they reach}} the summit, they are confronted by Ronyx J. Kenny and Ilia Silvestri, two crew members of the Earth Federation (Terran Alliance in the PSP remake) {{starship}} Calnus. They inform them that the disease {{was sent to the}} planet by a foreign race called the Lezonians, whom the Earth Federation has been at war with. Roddick and Millie go with them on their spacecraft to help them find a cure. They learn that Fellpool blood could be used to process a special, invisible material which <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a massive advantage in the war. Upon coming in contact with Lezonians, they reveal that they were being forced into war by a shadowy, powerful third party with a disgust for the Federation.|$|E

25|$|Midway through 1941, Phibun sought British and American {{guarantees}} of effective support if Japan invaded Thailand. Neither Britain nor the United States <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them,</b> although British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was {{in favour of}} a public warning to Japan that an invasion of the Southeast Asian kingdom {{would result in a}} British declaration of war.

25|$|After {{hearing the}} band play and meeting with Robertson, Dylan invited Helm and Robertson {{to join his}} backing band. After two concerts backing Dylan, Helm and Robertson told Dylan of their loyalty to their bandmates, {{and told him that}} they would {{continue}} with him only if he hired all of the Hawks. Dylan accepted and invited Levon and the Hawks to tour with him. The group was receptive to the offer, knowing it <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the wider exposure they craved. They thought of themselves as a tightly rehearsed rock and rhythm and blues group and knew Dylan mostly from his early acoustic folk and protest music. Furthermore, they had little inkling of how internationally popular Dylan had become.|$|E

500|$|Through several fliers {{issued in}} Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, a drug {{trafficking}} organization offered a $600,000 peso (roughly US$46,000) reward to anyone that <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> {{information on the}} whereabouts of the administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas, or to identify any of his family members, whether they are his parents, brothers and sisters, children or wife. The flier included the phone number (834)-104-7370, which has the area code of Tamaulipas. The administrator responded by saying that [...] " [...] not playing at being a hero, [...] doing what [...] {{to do as a}} citizen." [...] He also thanked the visitors who contributed to the page and gave him support throughout the project, and asked the Mexican Armed Forces to continue their fight against organized crime. The administrator said, too, that he would continue to his crime reporting at Valor por Tamaulipas even if that might cost him his life. On its page the administrator stated that after hearing about the threat, his wife and children left to the United States for security reasons. He also asked his visitors to refrain from using their personal Facebook or Twitter accounts when uploading information to the page since that could put them at risk. He believes that the Mexican criminal organization known as Los Zetas or state officials working for them are probably responsible for this threat.|$|E

Once on the box of your auto, he'd be out of this and <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>'em</b> the slip for a bit. It's the only way I can think of, to get him near the game." ...|$|R

2500|$|Mack saw {{baseball}} as a business, {{and recognized}} that economic necessity drove the game. He explained to his cousin, Art Dempsey, that [...] "The {{best thing for}} a team financially {{is to be in}} the running and finish second. If you win, the players all expect raises." [...] This was one reason he was constantly collecting players, signing almost anyone to a ten-day contract to assess his talent; he was looking ahead to future seasons when his veterans would either retire or hold out for bigger salaries than Mack <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While {{the band}} sold out venues in London in early 1978, {{they still had}} {{problems}} getting the right recording contract that <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> [...] "complete artistic control".

A NME review hailed it as [...] "a bright, vivid narrative, something like snapshots {{from the window of}} a speeding Japanese train, power charged by the most original, intoxicating guitar playing I heard in a long, long time".|$|E
2500|$|It {{begins in}} the year 2005 when Sae is {{traveling}} to her birthplace of Peggys Cove, Nova Scotia in Canada. On the bus, she looks at a photo, and the scene immediately goes back to 1996. Sae and Kouhei met on a train ride to their respective college entrance examinations. The train hit a deer, causing Sae to worry about being late for the examinations. They went to a nearby house to ask if the owners <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a lift. Sae spotted a key in the truck parked at the porch. She asked Kouhei if he would [...] "borrow" [...] the truck {{to take her to}} the exam center. However, when Kouhei tried to overtake a slow cow truck, he narrowly avoided an incoming crane, and went off the road into a ditch. They were brought to a police station and Sae was disqualified from her examinations.|$|E

50|$|In {{later years}} these {{catalogues}} could be over-branded {{to reflect a}} distributor’s corporate image and distributors <b>could</b> then <b>give</b> <b>them</b> to their end user customers as their own.

2500|$|In February 2008, the Republican Movement {{suggested}} electing the Governor-General as {{an interim}} step to a republic, arguing [...] "Electing the Governor-General allows for easier {{transition to a}} republic, because the populace is used to electing someone as a ceremonial de facto head of state." [...] With {{the introduction of the}} Governor-General Act 2010, Green MP Keith Locke suggested Parliament recommend the next Governor-General's appointment to the Queen, with a recommendation endorsed by three-quarters of parliament. In its submission to the select committee considering the Bill, the Republican Movement suggested parliament appoint the next Governor-General with a three-quarters majority plus a majority of party leaders in parliament, with a similar dismissal process and a fixed five-year term. National MP Nikki Kaye queried whether several one-member parties in parliament could veto the decision, which <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> too much power if an appointment was based on one vote per leader. The Republican Movement responded that the method would ensure appointments were made that most MPs and parties found acceptable.|$|E
2500|$|Tony's {{relationship}} with Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) was often strained by Jacqui's desire for children. Tony and Jacqui agree to adopt. Pickard commented that adoption is [...] "not something [...] even considered until Jacqui suggested it. Now he’s really into it though. They were both heartbroken when she lost {{the baby and}} found out she can never have children. Adoption <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the family they desperately want". Pickard explained that the couple love each other and do not [...] "necessarily" [...] need a child to seal their relationship {{but they want to}} begin a family together. Pickard stated that despite Jacqui's past, his character [...] "sees some very good qualities in her". The actor revealed that Tony tries to stay positive that the couple will be able to adopt despite Jacqui's criminal record. When the couple are told they can not adopt, Pickard said they are [...] "devastated". He went on to add that the couple's desire for children is [...] "very strong" [...] so they may go down other routes such as surrogacy. When questioned if Jacqui is the one for Tony, his portrayer stated: [...] "He's committed to her and wants them to be together. They have a connection even though they’re constantly splitting up and getting back together. Jacqui could well be his Mrs Right at last". Pickard teased that [...] "maybe [...] already has a child – or maybe he’ll get someone pregnant by accident..." [...] He went on to add that [...] "even by soap standards, Tony's had shocking luck".|$|E
