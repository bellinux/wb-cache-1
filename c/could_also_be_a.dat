5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends. His enormous correspondence shows that he <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> witty writer in German and English– sometimes accompanied by humorous sketches and cartoons in the text.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> health hazard for the soldiers, {{mainly because of the}} difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|In Celtic folklore, {{the bird}} {{appears on the}} {{shoulder}} of the dying Cú Chulainn, and <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> manifestation of the Morrígan, the wife of Tethra, or the Cailleach. This idea has persisted, and the hooded crow is associated with fairies in the Scottish highlands and Ireland; in the 18th century, Scottish shepherds would make offerings to them to keep them from attacking sheep. In Faroese folklore, a maiden would go out on Candlemas morn and throw a stone, then a bone, then a clump of turf at a hooded crow – if it flew over the sea, her husband would be a foreigner; if it landed on a farm or house, she would marry a man from there, but if it stayed put, she would remain unmarried.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{replaced}} {{a different}} script Whithouse {{had planned to}} write, and {{was designed to be}} a romantic episode that <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good introduction to the show. Whithouse chose the setting to be Venice, and vampires soon entered the plot as he felt they belonged in the setting. The episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia in late 2009, with the old-fashioned village portraying Venice. The episode was seen by 7.68 million viewers in the UK and received an Appreciation Index of 86. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the comedy, production design, and acting of guests Helen McCrory and Alex Price, but thought that the plot elements were somewhat similar to a couple of other recent episodes.|$|E
5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, {{but there has been}} no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E

25|$|Animals <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{source of}} income for the military: already under the French, the {{fortress}} authorities sold off the grazing rights on the grassy areas of the Glacis.

25|$|Nucleiform bifaces—It is {{difficult}} to distinguish a true biface from a core with modified edges that was occasionally used as a tool.

At Auckland in 1972-73, Collinge scored 68 not out for New Zealand against Pakistan; {{this was}} the highest score ever made by a number 11 in a Test match at the time.

25|$|On 2 May 2008, a level-1 {{warning was}} issued after GNS {{scientists}} who were monitoring the lake found irregular signs of volcanic activity. This included increased chemical changes, gases and temperature. The warning {{was used to}} let visitors know the potential of an explosion was higher than usual and could happen at any time.

25|$|Processors {{that have}} a RISC {{architecture}} typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture (such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers), which improves cost, power consumption, and heat dissipation. These characteristics are desirable for light, portable, battery-powered devicesincluding smartphones, laptops and tablet computers, and other embedded systems. For supercomputers, which consume large amounts of electricity, ARM <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> power-efficient solution.|$|E
25|$|He was {{convinced}} {{of the need to}} make an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock. He and the Secret Service were concerned that he <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> target of a conspiracy, and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from Dallas and return him to Washington. This was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power.|$|E
25|$|Another circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the Jain origins proposal is {{the discovery of}} Jaina images inside as well as near the massive Puri temple complex, including those carved into the walls. However, this <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> later addition, or suggestive of tolerance, mutual support or close relationship between the Jains and the Hindus. According to Starza, the Jain influence on the Jagannath tradition is difficult to assess given the sketchy uncertain evidence, but nothing establishes that the Jagannath tradition has a Jain origin.|$|E

25|$|Believing {{the game}} <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{success on the}} PC, Interplay's Feargus Urquhart and David Perry {{contacted}} Polish developers CD Projekt. As Poland was known for only developing PC games, Urquhart and Perry believed Projekt {{would be the perfect}} team to port Dark Alliance to PC. Sebastian Zieliński, developer of Mortyr 2093-1944, which Interplay had published, was placed in charge of the project, with Adam Badowski, a film storyboard artist, hired as designer. A PlayStation 2 development kit was smuggled from Interplay's offices in London to Poland, and work on the port began. However, almost immediately, Interplay cancelled development.|$|E
25|$|Initiation is a rite {{of passage}} marking {{entrance}} or acceptance into a group or society. It <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> formal admission to adulthood in a community or one of its formal components. In an extended sense it can also signify a transformation in which the initiate is 'reborn' into a new role. Examples of initiation ceremonies might include Hindu diksha, Christian baptism or confirmation, Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, acceptance into a fraternal organization, secret society or religious order, or graduation from school or recruit training. A person taking the initiation ceremony in traditional rites, such as those depicted in these pictures, is called an initiate.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 1939, Litvinov was {{dismissed}} and Vyacheslav Molotov, who had strained relations with Litvinov, {{was not of}} Jewish origin (unlike Litvinov), and had always been in favour of neutrality towards Germany, {{was put in charge}} of foreign affairs. The Foreign Affairs Commissariat was purged of Litvinov's supporters and Jews. All this could well have purely internal reasons, but it <b>could</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> signal to Germany that the era of anti-German collective security was past, or a signal to the British and French that Moscow should be taken more seriously in the tripartite alliance negotiations and that it was ready for arrangements without the old baggage of collective security, or even both.|$|E
