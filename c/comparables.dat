2500|$|Naples' {{historic}} city centre is the largest in Europe, covering [...] and enclosing 27 centuries of history, and is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Naples {{has long been a}} major cultural centre with a global sphere of influence, particularly during the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras. In its geographical area are located numerous culturally and historically significant sites, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties (Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, Vesuvius, etc.), <b>comparables</b> to those of Rio de Janeiro. Culinarily, Naples is synonymous with pizza, which originated in the city. Neapolitan music has furthermore been highly influential, credited with the invention of the romantic guitar and the mandolin, as well as notable contributions to opera and folk standards. Popular characters and historical figures who have come to symbolise the city include Januarius, the patron saint of Naples, the comic figure Pulcinella, and the Sirens from the Greek epic poem the Odyssey.

50|$|This is the {{approach}} most {{commonly associated with}} the use of <b>comparables.</b> The appraiser seeks enough <b>comparables</b> (as few as three in a residential analysis, many more in a non-residential appraisal) and makes adjustments to the comparables' selling prices according to the various factors of comparison. For example, if a subject residence is 1000 sq ft, but a comparable is 1,100, then the selling price of the comparable will be adjusted downward to account for this difference in value. The downward adjustment may be very small, since marginal prices of comparable factors are usually much lower than average prices over small ranges of values.|$|E

Other data sources used are sometimes misleading due to concealed incentives in recorded sales prices (e.g. Land Registry).
