5|$|Reconfigurable {{computing}} {{is the use}} of a field-programmable {{gate array}} (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer <b>chip</b> <b>that</b> can rewire itself for a given task.|$|E
5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 <b>chip</b> <b>that</b> {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. In retrospect, audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue <b>chip</b> <b>that</b> had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was his refusal to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

25|$|Nebraska and Colorado share a disputed rivalry, {{sometimes}} {{considered a}} one-sided rivalry with Colorado placing more importance on the rivalry than Nebraska. The teams first met in 1898 and have met 69 times, with Nebraska winning a significant {{majority of the}} games (49). The rivalry became a conference match up with Colorado's joining of the Big Eight in 1947 and would continue through {{their time in the}} Big 12. The rivalry briefly had a trophy, a mounted buffalo head named Mr. <b>Chip,</b> <b>that</b> was exchanged from 1951 until 1961; the exchange ended after Colorado misplaced the trophy. The rivalry is currently dormant, following both Colorado and Nebraska's departure from the Big 12 in 2011, but to different conferences. Future non-conference games are planned for 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024.|$|E
25|$|The PS3 {{supports}} numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from 480i/576i up to 1080p) and connectivity options (such as HDMI 1.3a and component video). In {{terms of}} audio, the PS3 supports {{a number of}} formats, including 7.1 digital audio, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and others; audio output is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), optical digital cables, or HDMI. The PS3 slim features an upgraded HDMI <b>chip</b> <b>that</b> allows bitstreaming of lossless audio codecs to an external receiver (earlier versions had to decode the signal internally before outputting it via LPCM). For the optical disc drive, {{a wide variety of}} DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as Blu-ray Discs. A 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, or 500GB 2.5-inch SATA 150 hard disk is preinstalled. In the early 60GB and 80GB configurations, flash memory can also be used, either Memory Sticks; CompactFlash cards; or SD/MMC cards. All models support USB memory devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the FAT32 file system. For communication, the system sported four USB 2.0 ports at the front on the 20 and 60GB models as well as the NTSC 80GB model, but the 40GB and 80GB PAL models only have two USB ports. All models (80 and 160GB) released after August 2008 have been reduced to two USB ports, as well as dropping CompactFlash and SD card support. One Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0 support, and built-in Wi-Fi (except CECHBxx).|$|E
