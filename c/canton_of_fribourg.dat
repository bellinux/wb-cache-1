25|$|In {{the north}} and northwest, the Swiss Plateau is sharply delimited {{geographically}} and geologically by the Jura Mountains. In the south, {{there is no clear}} border with the Alps. Usually, the rising of the terrain to altitudes above 1500 metres AMSL (lime Alps, partly sub-alpine molasse), which is very abrupt in certain places, is taken as a criterion for delimitation. Occasionally the regions of the higher Swiss Plateau, especially the hills of the <b>canton</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fribourg,</b> the Napf region, the Töss region and parts of the Appenzell region are considered to form the Swiss Alpine foreland in a narrow sense. However, if a division into the three main regions Jura Mountains, Swiss Plateau and Alps is considered, the Alpine foreland belongs clearly to the Swiss Plateau. In the southwest, the Swiss Plateau is confined by Lake Geneva, in the northeast, by Lake Constance and the Rhine.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century, the {{municipality}} suffered several outbreaks of livestock diseases. [...] To protect the dairy industry, non-local herds were forbidden from passing through {{the municipality}}. [...] Cheese was no longer allowed to be carried across the mountains but was now transported on local draft horses. [...] Due to customs taxes with the neighboring <b>Canton</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fribourg,</b> cheese was carried on a route over the Col de Chaude to Villeneuve (VD) {{and from there to}} the shores of Lake Geneva, without crossing the Fribourg border. [...] The abolition of the inter-canton customs and taxes in 1848 led to the demolition of the Fribourg customs station on the main road that had linked Château-d'Œx with the grain and livestock markets. [...] Changes in markets and improvements in animal husbandry led to more Simmental cattle being raised for meat rather than cheese production. [...] The construction of the road over the Col des Mosses (1865–71) and {{the construction of a new}} road to Bulle (1895) eased transportation.|$|E
