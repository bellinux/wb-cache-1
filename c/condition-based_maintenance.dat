40|$|AbstractMaintenance and {{its cost}} continue, over the years, {{to draw the}} {{attention}} of production management since the unplanned failures decrease {{the reliability of the}} system and also the return of investments. Advanced maintenance techniques that capture and process shop-floor information can reduce costs and increase the sustainability of an enterprise. This paper presents a <b>condition-based</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> approach integrated into a machine monitoring framework. The latter acquires data from shop-floor machine tools and analyses them through an information fusion technique to support the <b>condition-based</b> preventive <b>maintenance</b> operations. The proposed approach is developed into a software service, deployed on a Cloud environment. The service gathers and processes data, such as their actual processing time and machining time per tool, related to the operation of machine tools and equipment and calculates the expected remaining useful life of components. Moreover, it provides notifications to machine tool operators and maintenance departments, as well as it enables the communication among them using mobile technology.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyTaking {{a general}} {{investigation}} of maintenance activities in various industries, three maintenance philosophies are commonly applied, which are corrective maintenance, time-based periodic <b>maintenance</b> and <b>condition-based</b> predictive <b>maintenance.</b> Corrective maintenance which is implemented after {{breakdown of the}} equipment could lead to great losses in personnel safety, environment and assets. Therefore, the application and development on preventive <b>maintenance</b> – especially <b>condition-based</b> predictive <b>maintenance</b> – have been continuously optimized to reduce failures {{as much as possible}} so that equipment downtime and maintenance cost can be reduced while reliability and safety level of machinery enhanced. Besides, e-maintenance is an emerging maintenance management concept that makes use of information and communication technology (ICT) to assistant maintenance activities by linking supports from experts of different parties. By adopting such technique, advantages such as fast response, integration of resources, remote monitoring and decision making can be realized. Compared with first-class industrial companies where the relatively sophisticated maintenance philosophy covering both condition monitoring and e-maintenance has been applied, COSL until now is still in the primary stage in developing systematic maintenance system centering the importance of condition monitoring. Also e-maintenance is rarely employed. This study will discuss the development, characteristics, and relevant impacts of several techniques commonly used in condition monitoring {{as well as those of}} e-maintenance. Moreover, combined with current practices of maintenance methodologies in COSL, possible improvement in maintenance system will be explored...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{standard}} gamma {{process is}} widely used for cumulative deterioration modeling purpose and to make prediction over the system future behavior. However, this process may be restrictive within an applicative context since its variance-to-mean ratio is constant over time.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate benefits of using an extended gamma process for modeling the system evolution instead of a standard gamma process, from a reliability point of view. With that goal, we propose a <b>condition-based</b> dynamic <b>maintenance</b> policy and evaluate its performance on a finite planning horizon.

50|$|Along with <b>condition-based</b> <b>{{maintenance}},</b> {{planned maintenance}} comprises preventive maintenance, {{in which the}} maintenance event is preplanned, and all future maintenance is preprogrammed.

A good example of a planned maintenance program is car maintenance, where time and distance determine fluid change requirements.

40|$|International audienceMaintenance is an {{important}} activity in industry. It is performed either to revive a machine/component or {{to prevent it from}} breaking down. Different strategies have evolved through time, bringing maintenance to its current state: <b>condition-based</b> and predictive <b>maintenances.</b> This evolution was due to the increasing demand of reliability in industry. The key process of <b>condition-based</b> and predictive <b>maintenances</b> is prognostics and health management, and it is a tool to predict the remaining useful life of engineering assets. Nowadays, plants are required to avoid shutdowns while offering safety and reliability. Nevertheless, planning a maintenance activity requires accurate information about the system/component health state. Such information is usually gathered by means of independent sensor nodes. In this study, we consider the case where the nodes are interconnected and form a wireless sensor network. As far as we know, no research work has considered such a case of study for prognostics. Regarding the importance of data accuracy, a good prognostics requires reliable sources of information. This is why, in this paper, we will first discuss the dependability of wireless sensor networks, and then present a state of the art in prognostic and health management activities...|$|R
