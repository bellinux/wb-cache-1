40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} legal {{regulation}} of lands affected by mining activities. These activities, predominantly {{the extraction of}} minerals are by their nature very closely related to soil and land. The thesis offers a comprehensive view of the legal relations {{in the process of}} mining - from prospecting and exploration of mineral deposits to mine closure - while it discusses the key issues {{from the perspective of the}} land owner as well as the mining companies. Legal relations arising from mining activities are significantly influenced by the character of mining. Mining interferes with rights and interests related to land and ownership of land which gives rise to certain <b>conflicts.</b> <b>Mining</b> companies' interests come very often into conflict with interests of the owner of the land where the mineral deposit is located. The legal relations are further complicated by the position of the state who acts as an owner of mineral wealth and an authority defending public interests. The introductory chapter of the thesis defines the terms that are essential for the selected topic. The content of the next chapters corresponds with phases of mining activities as they are carried out in reality. Prospecting and exploration of exclusive deposits represents the first phase of mining activity. In the chapter [...] ...|$|R

To our knowledge, our encoding is {{the first}} one that is linear in the number of variables, domain size and constraint size w. r. t. the size of the SAT instance. Nevertheless, our encoding has the same attractive properties as the well-known hidden variable encoding when comparing the performance of (i) the Davis-Putnam procedure with the Forward Checking and Maintaining Arc Consistency algorithms on the encoding, and (ii) the local search methods WalkSAT and GSAT with the <b>Min</b> <b>Conflicts</b> algorithm.

50|$|Although not {{specified}} in the algorithm, a good initial assignment can be critical for quickly approaching a solution. Use a greedy algorithm with some level of randomness and allow variable assignment to break constraints when no other assignment will suffice. The randomness helps min-conflicts avoid local minima created by the greedy algorithm's initial assignment. In fact, Constraint Satisfaction Problems that respond best to a min-conflicts solution do well where a greedy algorithm almost solves the problem. Map coloring problems do poorly with Greedy Algorithm as well as Min-Conflicts. Sub areas of the map tend to hold their colors stable and <b>min</b> <b>conflicts</b> cannot hill climb {{to break out of}} the local minimum. The CONFLICTS function counts the number of constraints violated by a particular object, given that the state of the rest of the assignment is known.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the benefit of}} Tabu Search for satisfiability (SAT) and constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) and {{compare it to the}} more frequently used random walk heuristic. We argue, that a more deterministic direction of search as done with Tabu Search is worth considering also for SAT and CSP. We give experimental evidence that Tabu Search can be used to efficiently guide local search procedures like GSAT and WSAT for SAT and the <b>min</b> <b>conflicts</b> heuristic for CSP. The algorithms are tested on randomly generated problems and hard graph coloring instances from the DIMACS benchmark test set. Additionally, we give some explanation on the value of Tabu Search. 1 Introduction Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and satisfiability (SAT) are central problems in Artificial Intelligence. Many practical problems like machine vision, spatial and temporal reasoning, and scheduling can be represented as CSP.

40|$|Understanding {{complex systems}} {{begins with an}} {{appreciation}} of uncertainty. ” – B. Russell Abstract: Current flight path predictions for climb and descent phases of flight have much larger path uncertainty than during cruise segments. The uncertainty errors in path prediction are a major concern for development of decision support tools such as arrival and departure managers for hub airport traffic flow planning and for medium term (10 - 30 <b>min)</b> <b>conflict</b> detection in congested terminal and transition airspace. This paper outlines a trajectory synthesis methodology with emphasis on accuracy and integrity of trajectory predictions for decision support tools. The paper examines the specification of top level user requirements such as prediction accuracy, integrity, and availability, and {{the means by which}} such specifications could be realized by suitable technology development and integration of redundant source data. This paper extends the Required System Performance (RSP) concepts to trajectory synthesis, and uses Required Navigation Performance (RNP) as a direct analogy for development of trajectory prediction systems...|$|R
40|$|Papua New Guineans {{and mining}} have {{become synonymous with}} civil {{conflict}} and turmoil. Numerous works, mainly from the anthropological perspective, have documented the conflict-ridden industry and offered explanations {{for the development of}} community antagonism (see, eg, Filer 1990; Connell and Howitt 1991; Rumsey and Weiner 2001). However, the existing literature on mining is somewhat sparse {{when it comes to the}} participation of Papua New Guineans as employees in the mines. The major aim of this paper is to discuss local employment in Papua New Guinea mines. It does so by examining some of the challenges and conflicts that Papua New Guineans have confronted since their first con-tact with mining in the late 1800 s as adventurers and assistants to their participation as full-fledged paid workers in the current period. A central theme of this paper is that, although they first embraced mining as an adventure, the inevitable imposition of a capitalistic mode of mining operation compelled them to render their labor for a wage. Like miners everywhere, this paper argues, many Papua New Guineans now view mining employment as “the only way ” rather than as one of many ways of making a living. Labor, <b>Conflict,</b> and <b>Mining</b> in Premodern Papua New Guinea Papua New Guineans have had contact with the international mining industry since the late 1800 s. Colonial officials, planters, soldiers, and missionaries provided other major avenues of contact with westerners (West 1958; Waiko 1993, 34). However, early engagement of locals with independent expatriate miners took the form of casual laboring in iso-lated alluvial goldfields around the country. From about the late 1870 s...|$|R
40|$|This thesis will assess {{influential}} guerrilla doctrine advising optimal insurgent (1) operational environment, (2) organizational structure, (3) logistical capacity, and (4) dependent tactics - {{items of}} consistent, yet incomplete analysis in counter-insurgency (COIN) analytics {{and civil war}} scholarship. Following a review of five of the most infamously disseminated guerrilla doctrine and training manuals, this thesis derives a model of advised guerrilla war production. The derived model illustrating the strategic and operational principles of reviewed doctrine presents an organizational hybrid between guerrilla hierarchies and networks, positing optimal organizational structure {{as a function of}} operational environment. Logistical capacity, tactics, target set, and military classification are in turn best determined by organizational structure. An otherwise unobserved operational dynamic relating each of the above four enumerated strategic considerations is thereby illustrated, with implications for COIN theory and praxis. To present a more systematic evaluation of reviewed guerrilla doctrine, the derived model is evaluated against a qualitative case-study of Peru's Shining Path insurgency. Case-study empirics are drawn from the Uppsala/PRIO Armed Conflicts Dataset (ACD) on dyadic <b>conflict</b> (Cederman, <b>Min,</b> Wimmer 2010), Arc Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial analysis software, declassified Peruvian intelligence reports, and captured Shining Path documents and directives from the Peruvian insurrection between 1969 - 1989. This study finds that evaluated guerrilla doctrine accurately reflects the material conditions of insurgency. There is one caveat: The global trends of increasing urbanization, dissolution of state power, and decline in politically motivated insurgency, may contribute to an observed shift in non-state actor war production from rural to increasingly urban and civilian-centric economies of violence.

40|$|This study {{examines}} physical and perceived landscape {{change in a}} mining area in northern Peru. <b>Mining</b> <b>conflicts</b> between companies and local people have intensified; this highlights {{the necessity of a}} better understanding of environmental and social consequences of mining activities. Landscape studies could be relevant to understand such problematic. I aim to assess the landscape change in a mining area by (1) mapping the physical landscape change and (2) surveying the local landscape people’s perception of the physical landscape change. I approach the material dimension through spatial-regional interpretation of diachronic aerial-photos to produce Land cover-Land use maps and to allow further temporal comparison towards change detection in a GIS environment. The mental dimension was surveyed through the analysis of semi-structured interviews {{of the people who were}} living in the area of the mine and who lives now on its surroundings. The material landscape analysis shows a change rate of 75 % in seven years (1993 - 2000) in the whole study area; and of 52 % in areas outside the mining facilities. This is mainly from the conversion of seminatural grassland into mining and sparse grassland. These results correlated positively with local people’s perception of environmental transformations, as the dramatic reduction of basic livelihood resources such as grassland and water. Most informants report loss of practices, customs and identity. The study provides empirical and theoretical support to approaches combining GIS mapping and perception surveys in the study of landscape change...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mining</b> <b>conflicts</b> in Guatemala “provide {{sites for}} {{exploring}} how things {{that used to}} be fused together [including] identity, entitlement, territoriality, and nationality are being taken apart and realigned in innovative relationships and spaces” within neoliberal contexts (Ong, 2006, p. 5). The municipality of San Miguel Ixtahuacán, in the Western Highlands of Guatemala, is currently home to a nearly decade-old mining conflict between Indigenous communities against mining development, and a Canadian-owned mining project, the Marlin mine. The primary objective of this thesis is to highlight the reasons why Indigenous people still resist mining development despite corporate efforts to engage with them through corporate social responsibility measures and corporate citizenship practices. The ethnographic fieldwork pursued in the Maya-Mam communities surrounding the Marlin mine revealed how Indigenous political actors imagine and navigate experiences with mining development. The resistance of Indigenous actors to mining in this study is strongly linked to a lack of consultation, environmental damage, and an increase in inter-community conflict. These issues have made the presence of the mining company to be seen by Indigenous actors as a barrier to the full realization of both their rights as political citizens and their own development interests. This thesis hopes to contribute to understandings of corporate power and corporate-Indigenous engagement by adding a new dimension to understandings of citizenship and political rights between corporations, communities and the state: the meaning that the emergence of the corporate citizen in Mayan Guatemala takes from the perspective of historically marginalized, yet politicized, Maya-Mam actors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{develops}} {{an operational}} concept and requirements for en route Free Flight using a simulation of the Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center, and develops requirements for an automated conflict probe {{for use in}} the Air Traffic Control Centers. In this paper we present the results of simulation studies and summarize concepts and infrastructure requirements to transition from the current air traffic control system to mature Free Flight. The transition path to Free Flight envisioned in this paper assumes an orderly development of Communication /Navigation /Surveillance technologies based on results from our simulation studies. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to provide an overall context and methodology for evaluating airborne and ground-based requirements for cooperative development of the future Air Traffic Control system. This study is limited to Free Flight implementation concepts which enable en route User Preferred Trajectories (UPT). Inherent in these concepts is the notion of intent. We assume an aircraft is flying a strategic flight plan, or will provide to air traffic control some level of intent whenever an aircraft deviates from its intended flight plan. Those concepts of Free Flight operation that do not require any knowledge of aircraft intent (other than that provided by radar surveillance) may tend to increase controller workload. This study assumes that controller workload is the primary limiting factor in managing airspace, and that any concept for removing flight restrictions must also address controller workload. Aircraft intent is essential in this study for enabling more efficient use of Center resources, off-loading controller workload through automation concepts such as medium term (10 - 30 <b>min)</b> <b>conflict</b> probe and conflict resolution across sector boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Individuals vary {{in the way}} {{in which}} they cope with {{stressful}} situations. It has been suggested that ‘active’ coping behaviour, characterised by aggression and territorial control, is more effective in moderating the stress associated with social defeat than ‘passive’ coping behaviour, as characterised by immobility, decreased reactivity, and low aggression. We used the rodent ‘resident/intruder’ paradigm to determine whether individual differences in coping behaviour modulate the acute adrenocortical response to social defeat. During the 10 <b>min</b> <b>conflict</b> episode, behaviours displayed by the intruder were recorded and subsequently scored. Intruders that engaged in large numbers of fights and/or frequently used physical structures to block the resident 2 ̆ 7 s approach (a behaviour referred to as ‘guarding’), displayed smaller corticosterone responses to defeat than other intruders. Corticosterone responses to defeat were unrelated to a measure of coping style preferences (defensive burying test) obtained prior to the defeat encounter. We further chose to investigate the neurobiological basis of this observation by comparing the patterns of defeat-induced neuronal activation in the forebrains of intruders that displayed high versus low numbers of defensive behaviours during the defeat episode. The results of this analysis indicated that ‘low fight’ and ‘low guard’ intruders, i. e. those that achieved a fight or a guard score below the 20 th percentile, had significantly higher numbers of Fos-positive neurons in forebrain regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala than did control animals exposed to an empty resident 2 ̆ 7 s cage. In summary, the present data suggest that ‘active’ coping behaviour is associated with both a smaller adrenocortical response and a lower level of ‘neural activation’ following social defeat. This outcome differs from that of earlier studies, a difference that we suggest is due to the fact that the present study is the first to assess coping on the basis of behaviour actually displayed during the conflict interaction. <br /...|$|R
