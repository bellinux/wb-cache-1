50|$|To save {{valuable}} space, depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> on Type 051 were eliminated. Instead, the two mine rails for {{mine laying}} were modified to also function as depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks.</b> A total of 20 - 28 mines {{or up to}} 42 depth charge can be carried (depending on types).|$|R

50|$|The {{class was}} {{probably}} equipped {{with one or}} two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> each for anti-submarine convoy escort missions in World War I.|$|R
50|$|The {{as-built}} anti-submarine armament of two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> was {{augmented by}} up to six K-gun depth charge throwers during the war.|$|R
5000|$|... c 1943: Due to {{the need}} for greater light {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) protection that emerged following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the [...]50 cal MGs and Mount 53 were replaced by 20 mm and 40 mm AA weapons. The type and quantity varied from ship to ship depending on when and where they were refitted. Also, roll-off depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> were added to the stern, along with four K-gun depth charge throwers. One source states the depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> were added in 1936.|$|R

25|$|As {{with their}} contemporaries, the Gridleys' anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{armament}} started with two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> aft. Photographs show {{that these were}} augmented during World War II by four K-gun depth charge throwers.|$|R
50|$|As {{with their}} contemporaries, the Bagleys' anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{armament}} started with two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> aft. Photographs show {{that these were}} augmented during World War II by four K-gun depth charge throwers on at least some ships.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the ship}} was armed with one 3"/50 caliber dual purpose gun, two single Bofors 40 mm guns, six 20 mm Oerlikon guns, 1 Hedgehog depth charge projector, four depth charge {{projectiles}} (K-guns) and two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
25|$|During 1942 Vetehinen was {{upgraded}} {{with new}} 12-hydrophone listening arrays and {{equipped with a}} depth <b>charge</b> <b>rack</b> capable of carrying four depth charges. The submarine was further modified by streamlining the tower and moving the 20mm gun up to the tower.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} Flower {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} 4-inch (102mm) gun on the bow, depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> carrying 40 <b>charges</b> on the stern, a minesweeping winch, and a 2-pounder (40mm) pom-pom gun on a [...] "bandstand" [...] over the engine room.|$|R

5000|$|Acoustiguide gained {{popularity}} in museum education with [...] "blockbuster" [...] exhibitions in the 1980s.

50|$|As delivered, {{they were}} {{equipped}} with depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> and Mk6 K-Gun’s aft; and a Mk10 Hedgehog forward. These were removed during the Iran-Iraq War. A ZU-23 anti-aircraft gun was added in 1982; {{this in turn}} was replaced by an Oerlikon 20 mm gun in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Staten Island had her {{designed}} heavy armament {{reduced to}} four single 3"50cal., eight single 40mm., and two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> for Soviet service. After her return {{she received a}} single 5"38 cal. mount forward and a helicopter deck aft. In USCG service she had the forward mount removed.|$|R
50|$|The Temptress {{class were}} {{armed with a}} 4-inch gun forward, a 3 in/50 dual-purpose (DP) gun aft, two 20 mm {{anti-aircraft}} guns, 2 depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks,</b> and 4 depth charge throwers. The Action class replaced the 4-inch gun with another 3-inch/50 cal. DP gun, and added a Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar.|$|R
5000|$|The vessels were {{designed}} as fast attack crafts, but designated [...] "missile boats" [...] in the Finnish Navy, as {{to tone down}} their offensive capabilities. They were armed with up to eight RBS-15 SSMs, one dual-purpose Bofors 57 mm gun, two SAKO 23 mm double-barreled anti-aircraft guns and two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1916, all {{had their}} single torpedo tubes {{replaced}} by twin mounts (with no reloads) while one 3-inch gun was removed. This {{was an easy}} upgrade, as the new design twin mounts actually weighed less than the older single mounts. They were equipped {{with one or two}} depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> for convoy escort during World War I.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} armament for {{the class}} was two 5 in dual purpose guns, four 40 mm and ten 20 mm anti-aircraft guns, and three 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. It also carried two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks,</b> eight K-gun depth charge projectors and one hedgehog projector as secondary weapons. The ships had a maximum speed of 24 kn.|$|R
5000|$|Following World War II most of {{the class}} had their AA and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{armament}} upgraded. The 40 mm and 20 mm guns were replaced by 2-6 3 in/50 caliber guns in up to two twin and one single mounting. One depth <b>charge</b> <b>rack</b> was removed and two Hedgehog ASW mortar mounts added. The K-guns were retained. Nine additional (for a total of 35) ships were converted to radar picket destroyers (DDR) in the early 1950s; these typically received only one 3-inch/50 caliber twin mount to save weight for radar equipment, as did the wartime radar pickets. Nine ships were converted to escort destroyers (DDE), emphasizing ASW. [...] was the most thorough DDE conversion, with 4 3-inch/70 caliber guns in twin enclosed mounts, two Weapon Alpha launchers, four new 21-inch torpedo tubes for the Mark 37 ASW torpedo, and one depth <b>charge</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
25|$|After Kitakami {{was damaged}} in 1944, she was {{converted}} into a kaiten carrier, with all of her armament removed, and replaced by two Type 89 single gun turrets (fore and aft), a total of 67 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns(12 triple, 31 single), two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> and eight Model 1 Kaiten. Removal of the aft turbine engines reduced her speed to 23 knots.|$|R
500|$|They {{were armed}} with three [...] 50-caliber guns in single mounts, {{one on the}} bow and two at the stern on the centerline. They also carried a battery of lighter weapons, {{including}} two 3-pounder [...] guns, two 1-pounder ( [...] guns and four [...]30 Lewis MGs. Tulsa later had a depth <b>charge</b> <b>rack</b> installed, giving her some manner of anti-submarine capacity.|$|R
50|$|During World War I {{the class}} was {{equipped}} {{with one or two}} depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> for the convoy escort mission. Also during World War I, the single torpedo tubes were replaced with two twin torpedo tubes on Truxton and Worden, with the number of torpedoes remaining at four. Whipple was modified with one twin torpedo tube mount and four torpedoes at this time.|$|R
50|$|After Kitakami {{was damaged}} in 1944, she was {{converted}} into a kaiten carrier, with all of her armament removed, and replaced by two Type 89 single gun turrets (fore and aft), a total of 67 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns(12 triple, 31 single), two depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> and eight Model 1 Kaiten. Removal of the aft turbine engines reduced her speed to 23 knots.|$|R
2500|$|... was {{the third}} and final vessel in the [...] of {{medium-sized}} minelayers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which was in service during World War II. She was designed as an improved version of Shirataka netlayer. However, during the Pacific War, due to the critical shortage of patrol ships for convoy escort duties, she was fitted with depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks</b> and her minelaying rails were removed.|$|R
25|$|Extra depth <b>charge</b> storage <b>racks</b> were fitted at the stern. Later, {{more depth}} charges stowed along walkways.|$|R
500|$|The ships mounted four 4.7-inch (120mm) Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, {{they had two}} quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts for [...] torpedoes. One depth <b>charge</b> <b>rack</b> and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|R
2500|$|... was {{the lead}} vessel in the [...] of {{medium-sized}} minelayers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which was in service during World War II. She was designed as an improved version of [...] anti-submarine netlayer. However, during the Pacific War, due to the critical shortage of escort patrol ships, she was fitted with depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks,</b> her minelaying rails were removed, and she was used primarily for convoy escort duties.|$|R
50|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939 the Cutty Sark was requisitioned by the Admiralty, still captained by Cdr Mack, and sent to Thorneycroft's at Southampton to be fitted out and armed as an Anti-Submarine vessel. Armament included a 4 in gun, a 2-pounder AA, two 0.5 in AAs, two 0.5 in MGs, and some depth <b>charge</b> <b>racks.</b> Most of her peacetime equipment was put into store at Thorneycroft's.|$|R
