5|$|Castle is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} <b>catch-all</b> term {{for all kinds of}} fortifications and, as a result, has been misapplied in the technical sense. An example of this is Maiden Castle which, despite the name, is an Iron Age hill fort which had a very different origin and purpose.|$|E
5|$|In early {{editions of}} , many {{well-known}} legendary creatures were included {{such as the}} phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, which Linnaeus collected into the <b>catch-all</b> category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays. For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, {{but they did not}} find any signs of its existence. Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.|$|E
5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial restructuring in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the <b>catch-all</b> COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The restructuring took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E
5|$|This <b>catch-all</b> {{category}} {{refers to}} other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up. Kleptoparasites are seabirds {{that make a}} part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically. The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of the}} diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises, as will giant petrels. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.|$|E

25|$|There was a sixpenny (£0.025) <b>catch-all</b> {{ticket for}} dogs, bicycles, items of luggage and prams. Apparently the EKLR did not forward luggage.|$|E
25|$|Some LGBT people {{disapprove}} of using queer as a <b>catch-all</b> because they consider it offensive, derisive or self-deprecating, given its continuous {{use as a}} form of hate speech in English.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fonts intended for Japanese text and Unicode <b>catch-all</b> fonts (like Arial Unicode MS), many fonts intended for Chinese (such as MS Song) and Korean (such as Batang) also include katakana.|$|E
25|$|The next {{significant}} steps towards resolution {{were the}} Repeal of the Population Registration Act, {{the repeal of}} the Group Areas and the Native Land Acts and a <b>catch-all</b> Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act was passed. These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.|$|E
25|$|Under Nehru's leadership, the Congress {{emerged as}} a <b>catch-all</b> party, {{dominating}} national and state-level politics and winning consecutive elections in 1951, 1957, and 1962. He remained popular {{with the people of}} India in spite of political troubles in his final years and failure of leadership during the 1962 Sino-Indian War. In India, his birthday is celebrated as Bal Diwas (Children's Day).|$|E
25|$|The word Canaanites {{serves as}} an ethnic <b>catch-all</b> term {{covering}} various indigenous populations—both settled and nomadic-pastoral groups—throughout the regions of the southern Levant or Canaan. Canaanite {{is by far the}} most frequently used ethnic term in the Bible. In the Book of Joshua, Canaanites are included in a list of nations to exterminate, and later described as a group which the Israelites had annihilated.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of lab work and research in pathology concerns the development of disease in humans, pathology is of significance throughout the biological sciences. Two main <b>catch-all</b> fields exist to represent most complex organisms capable of serving as host to a pathogen or other form of disease: veterinary pathology (concerned with all non-human species of kingdom of Animalia) and phytopathology, which studies disease in plants.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{every new}} version of Microsoft Windows has {{introduced}} its own additions and changes to the Windows API. The name of the API, however, remained consistent between different Windows versions, and name changes were kept limited to major architectural and platform changes for Windows. Microsoft eventually changed {{the name of the}} then current Win32 API family into Windows API, and made it into a <b>catch-all</b> term for both past and future API versions.|$|E
25|$|In a {{competitive}} market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use <b>catch-all</b> titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves {{with a wide range}} of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy, 1796), the medicinal (The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen, 1730), the festive or feast (A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies, 1746), the curious (A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies, 1751–82), and the curatorial (The Foundling Hospital for Wit, 1743–64).|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of dry red wines {{has been steadily}} increasing since the late 20th century spurred on, in part, by {{the creation of the}} Anjou-Villages AOC in 1987 for premium red wine production. Made predominantly from Cabernet Franc, some of the most ideally situated vineyards located south of Angers in the Coteaux de l'Aunbance AOC was given their own distinct sub-appellation in 1998 known as the Anjou-Villages Brissac AOC. The Gamay grape of Beaujolais still has a presence here and its own appellation of Anjou Gamay AOC. Gamay, as well as a variety of other red wine grape varieties, can also be produced under the <b>catch-all</b> appellation Anjou Rouge AOC.|$|E
25|$|TRW {{suggested}} building three bases with thirty missiles each, {{and estimated}} {{that one of}} the three bases would survive an all-out counterforce attack. To ensure that 600 warheads would survive, each missile would have to carry about 20 warheads. These studies led to the Missile, Experimental, or MX, project, which started in 1971. The design rapidly firmed up, emerging with ten-warheads on more missiles in order to raise the survivors to 1,000 warheads. But the basing became not so much a specific concept as a <b>catch-all</b> program for every possible concept, from railway deployments, to underground racetracks, to mobile systems. A review of the options written in the mid-1970s ran into hundreds of pages.|$|E
25|$|The {{former leader}} of Democratic Force, François Bayrou became the natural {{leader of the}} New UDF. He {{conceived}} {{of it as the}} embryo of a future centrist party which would include politicians from both the left and right. Bayrou ran for president in the 2002 presidential election, but some UDF leaders supported Chirac. Chirac won reelection comfortably, with Bayrou being eliminated after the first round, having gained only 6.8% of the vote. Bayrou subsequently refused Chirac's invitation to his group, to join the newly forimed centre-right <b>catch-all</b> party, the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) for the oncoming June 2002 parliamentary elections. Other UDF members, led by Philippe Douste-Blazy, Jacques Barrot and Pierre Méhaignerie, joined the UMP, leaving Bayrou somewhat isolated.|$|E
25|$|Fianna Fáil {{is seen as}} {{a typical}} <b>catch-all</b> party. R. Ken Carty wrote of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that they were 'heterogeneous in their bases of support, {{relatively}} undifferentiated in terms of policy or programme, and remarkably stable in their support levels'. Evidence from expert surveys, opinion polls and candidate surveys all fail to identify strong distinctions between the two parties. Many point to Ireland's civil war politics and feel that the basis for the division is the disagreement about the strategy to achieve a united Ireland. Kevin Byrne and political scientist Eoin O'Malley rejected this and have argued that {{the differences between the two}} parties goes much further back in Irish history. They linked the parties to different nationalist traditions (Irish Enlightenment and Gaelic Nationalist) which in turn could be linked to migrations of Anglo-Norman and new English into Ireland and the native Gaelic population.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the writ of coram nobis is {{unavailable}} when a litigant {{has some}} other remedy at law. A writ of coram nobis {{is not available}} where the defendant had a remedy by (a) appeal or (b) motion {{for a new trial}} and failed to avail himself of such remedies. The writ of coram nobis is not a <b>catch-all</b> by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. In the vast majority of cases a trial followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. The writ of coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. It will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. But it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not available.|$|E
500|$|Rob Mahoney of The New York Times {{called the}} model [...] "a novel {{execution}} of a productive thought", but cited the [...] "one-of-a-kind" [...] <b>catch-all</b> position and the substantial number of players categorized within it as weak points. ESPN TrueHoop's Jim Calvan criticized Alagappan's Sloan conference presentation for its lack of data showing how team reconfiguration to cover the 13 positions results in more wins.|$|E
500|$|Bailey's writings, {{along with}} American writer Marilyn Ferguson's 1980 book The Aquarian Conspiracy, contributed to {{conspiracy}} theorists of the Christian right viewing the New Age movement as the [...] "false religion" [...] that would supersede Christianity in a New World Order. Skeptics {{argue that the}} term [...] "New Age movement" [...] is a misnomer, generally used by conspiracy theorists as a <b>catch-all</b> rubric for any new religious movement that is not fundamentalist Christian. By this logic, anything that is not Christian is by definition actively and willfully anti-Christian.|$|E
500|$|Bringing {{elements}} of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less [...] "dangerous" [...] styles, new wave artists became very popular {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic. New wave became a <b>catch-all</b> term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone [...] "beyond punk before punk even properly existed". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation. However, the music was often derided at the time as being silly and disposable.|$|E
500|$|With its {{pioneering}} use {{of themes}} of scientific ambition and discovery, A Trip to the Moon is sometimes {{described as the}} first science fiction film. A Short History of Film argues that it codified [...] "many of the basic generic situations that are still used in science fiction films today". However, several other genre designations are possible; Méliès himself advertised the film as a pièce à grand spectacle, a term referring to a type of spectacular Parisian stage extravaganza popularized by Jules Verne and Adolphe d'Ennery {{in the second half}} of the nineteenth century. Richard Abel describes the film as belonging to the féerie genre, as does Frank Kessler. It can also be described simply as a trick film, a <b>catch-all</b> term for the popular early film genre of innovative, special-effects-filled shorts—a genre Méliès himself had codified and popularized in his earlier works.|$|E
500|$|Alternative rock (also called {{alternative}} music, alt-rock {{or simply}} alternative) is {{a style of}} rock music {{that emerged from the}} independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. In this instance, the word [...] "alternative" [...] refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, DIY ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, [...] "alternative" [...] {{has been used as a}} <b>catch-all</b> description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).|$|E
500|$|The often uneasy {{relationship}} between the larger, wealthier ranches and smaller ranch settlers became steadily worse after the harsh winter of 1886–1887, when a series of blizzards and temperatures of -50 to -40°F (-45 to -40°C) followed by an extremely hot and dry summer, ravaged the frontier. Thousands of cattle were lost and the large companies began appropriating land and the water supply in the area. Some of the harsher tactics included forcing settlers off their land, setting fire to their properties, and excluding them from participating in the annual roundup. They justified these excesses on what was public land by using the <b>catch-all</b> allegation of rustling. Hostilities worsened when the Wyoming legislature passed the [...] "Maverick Act," [...] which stated that all unbranded cattle in the open range automatically belonged to the cattlemen's association. The cattlemen also held {{a firm grip on}} Wyoming's stock interests by limiting the number of small ranchers that could participate.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, President John Patrick Crecine {{pushed through}} a {{restructuring}} of the university. The Institute at that point had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the <b>catch-all</b> COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal Arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine never asked for input regarding the changes and, consequently, many faculty members disliked his top-down management style; despite this, the changes passed by a slim margin. Crecine was also instrumental in securing the 1996 Summer Olympics for Atlanta. A large amount of construction occurred, creating most {{of what is now}} considered [...] "West Campus" [...] for Tech to serve as the Olympic Village, and significantly gentrifying Midtown Atlanta. The Undergraduate Living Center, Fourth Street Apartments, Sixth Street Apartments, Eighth Street Apartments, Hemphill Apartments, and Center Street Apartments housed athletes and journalists. The Georgia Tech Aquatic Center was built for swimming events, and the Alexander Memorial Coliseum was renovated. The Institute also erected the Kessler Campanile and fountain to serve as a landmark and symbol of the Institute on television broadcasts.|$|E
500|$|In an {{additional}} legal issue, on February 8, 2005, Trump had closed on a construction loan of $640million from Deutsche Bank for the project. He also obtained a $130–135million junior mezzanine loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investment Group. As {{part of these}} contracts, Trump had included a $40million personal guarantee. The contracts also mandated partial repayments for each closed unit sale, and minimum sale prices. In September 2008, due to slow unit sales, Trump sought to extend both loans until mid-2009 because he {{felt that it was}} necessary in the business environment and expected from the outset of the contract. On November 10, Deutsche Bank demanded the outstanding loan payment and the $40million guarantee. Trump filed suit later that month against Deutsche Bank in New York State Supreme Court in an effort to excuse a repayment of more than $330million that had been due November 7, and to extend the construction loan for an unspecified period of time because of extenuating circumstances arising from the financial crisis of 2007–2010. Trump cited a [...] "force majeure" [...] clause that allowed the borrower to delay completion of the project under a <b>catch-all</b> section covering [...] "any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower". Trump not only sought an extension, but sought damages of $3billion from the bank for its use of predatory lending practices to undermine the project and damage his reputation, which he claimed [...] "is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations." [...] At the end of November, Deutsche Bank countersued Trump to force him to uphold his personal payment guarantee from February 2005, after he failed to repay the amount due November 7—a date that already had been extended. The suits did not interfere with Trump's ability to continue drawing on the credit line provided by Deutsche Bank, because without the project's continued financing, Deutsche Bank may have had to assume the role of developer. In March 2009, both parties agreed to suspend litigation and resolve the disagreement amicably in an effort to help the project to succeed. In September 2010, an amended loan agreement stopped the litigation and extended the term on an approximately $600million construction loan for five years.|$|E

2500|$|Conduct {{prejudicial}} to {{good order}} and discipline is an offence against military law in many countries.

2500|$|The <b>catch-all</b> {{nature of}} new wave {{music has been}} a source of much {{confusion}} and controversy. The 1985 discography Who's New Wave in Music listed artists in over 130 separate categories. The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock calls the term [...] "virtually meaningless", while AllMusic mentions [...] "stylistic diversity".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the fifth}} {{cycle of the}} address phase (or earlier if all other devices have medium DEVSEL or faster), a <b>catch-all</b> [...] "subtractive decoding" [...] is allowed for some address ranges.

2500|$|The term Mission School {{has been}} criticized for being too {{geographically}} specific (many artists outside of San Francisco share this aesthetic, while others living in the Mission District do not), {{while at the same time}} being a vague <b>catch-all,</b> with many artists who are referred to as Mission School having a hard time seeing how they are part of this [...] "school".|$|E
2500|$|This kind of offence {{was first}} {{introduced}} to English military law in the 17th century, the law having previously been [...] "minute in its details" [...] with no <b>catch-all</b> article. [...] However such articles were found in continental military law such as the Swedish Articles of Gustavus Adolphus issued in 1621 which allowed for [...] "whatsoever is not contained in these articles, and is repugnant to military discipline ... shall the several commanders make good, or see severally punished". [...] A form of this <b>catch-all</b> article was introduced to England in the Articles of War for 1625 which stated that [...] "all other disorders whatsoever are to be punished, as these formerly nominated". [...] This had been expanded on in the 1627 articles stated that [...] "all other abuses and offences not specified in these orders shall be punished according to the discipline of war and opinions of such officers and others shall be called to make a Councell of Warr".|$|E

The word is a <b>catch-all</b> term, as Moro {{may come from}} several distinct ethno-linguistic {{groups such as the}} Maranao people. The term was introduced by Spanish colonisers, and has since been appropriated by Filipino Muslims as an endonym, with many self-identifying as members of the Bangsamoro [...] "Moro Nation".|$|E
