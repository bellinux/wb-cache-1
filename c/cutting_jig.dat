40|$|Most {{orthopedic}} surgeons use conventional {{instruments to}} achieve accurate bone cuts in total knee arthroplasty. An intramedullary alignment rod is usually used {{to place the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> at a valgus correction angle so that the distal femoral cut is made perpendicular to the mechanical axis of the femur. Over the tibial side, many surgeons use an extramedullary alignment guide to place the <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> perpendicular to the tibial mechanical axis; some surgeons prefer to use an intramedullary guide. The criticism is that outliers are not uncommon with conventional instruments, even in experienced hands. If the mechanical lower limb alignment within 3 ° valgus and 3 ° varus from neutral was considered as normal, 20 – 33 % of total knee arthroplasty would be outside of this range with conventional instruments [1 – 4].

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} development of a prototype of a knee surgery <b>cutting</b> <b>jig,</b> the jig holder, and the jig injection mold by Rapid Prototyping (RP). The {{aim of this study}} is to design a jig and a jig holder that allow surgeons to correctly, precisely, and consistently perform knee replacement surgery. The design concept for the surgery jig and jig holder was selected using the Pugh method with medical-grade 316 L stainless steel for material fabrication. A rapid prototype model was built directly from its CAD model in stereo lithography (STL) format by using the Fused Deposition Method (FDM). MasterCAM and Moldflow simulation were performed to generated G-codes and a possibility of jig fabrication using Metal Injection Molding (MIM), respectively. The Moldflow result provided an enhanced interpretation of the injection mold design. A conceptual mold design was again developed by the FDM. The prototype of the <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> and its holder underwent a machining process. The prototype was then tested on dummy bones to determine the functional performance and efficiency of the said prototype.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} for the residual malalignment. Firstly, the transfer from the virtual plan to the actual realignment and fixation might leave room for error. Although in half of the patients, we used patient-specific <b>cutting</b> <b>jigs</b> to transfer the planned correction onto the patients’ radius and used a jig to indicate {{the angle of the}} osteotomy, reduction and fixation were done in a freehand manner with K-wires. Although cutting guides generally show beneficial in reconstructive surgery [18], based on our results we cannot yet draw conclusions on its added value. For accurate bone repositioning in future corrective osteotomy treatment, we recommend using reduction guides [15] or patient-specific fixation plates [19].|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{this study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the quantity of intercondylar bone removed during femoral box osteotomy for implantation of three contemporary posterior stabilized (PS) total knee arthroplasty designs: Sigma PS (DePuy), Vanguard (Biomet) and Persona (Zimmer). Methods: we compared the maximum volumetric bone resection required for the housing of the PS mechanism of these three designs. Bone removal by each PS box <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> was three-dimensionally measured. The differences between the three designs were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for pairwise comparisons. The level of significance was set at p< 0. 05. Results: for small-size implants, the average box osteotomy volume of Persona was significantly smaller than the Vanguard and Sigma PS volumes (p= 0. 003). The mean difference between Vanguard and Sigma PS (p= 0. 01) was also significant. For medium size implants, the mean difference between Persona and Sigma PS (p= 0. 008) and the mean difference between Vanguard and Sigma PS (p= 0. 01) were statistically significant. For large size implants, the mean difference between Vanguard and Sigma PS (p= 0. 01) and the mean difference between Sigma PS and Persona (p= 0. 008) were statistically significant. Conclusions: irrespective of implant size, the Persona <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> always resected significantly less bone than did Vanguard and Sigma PS. Clinical Relevance: although this study does not establish any clinical relevance of removing more or less bone at primary TKA, its results suggest that if a PS design is indicated, it is preferable to select a model which resects less distal femoral bone...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundHigh tibial {{osteotomy}} (HTO) is {{a well-established}} treatment for unicompartmental gonarthrosis of the knee, but its durability and complications remain controversial. We previously introduced a novel dome-shaped HTO, {{and the long-term}} follow-up results using this technique are analyzed in this study. MethodsWe treated 25 varus knees in 22 patients with medial gonarthrosis, using a specially designed calibrated <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> along with rigid external fixation and early joint motion postoperatively. A total of 16 patients (19 knees) completed the study protocol and were followed up for 13 - 16 years (mean, 15 years). ResultsThe surgery attempted to obtain 8 ° valgus; the actual postoperative alignment averaged 12. 4 ° valgus, which decreased significantly to 7. 8 ° valgus after 5 years. The outcome as assessed by the Hospital for Special Surgery knee score was excellent or good in 18 knees at 5 years postoperatively, and in 13 knees at the final follow-up, showing a significant deterioration with time. Loss of correction with time was not correlated with the postoperative alignment achieved: at 5 years, loss greater than 2 ° was found in 12 knees, but their mean corrected angle (11. 8 ° valgus) was {{not significantly different from}} that of the others (13. 3 ° valgus). Nor was the loss of correction correlated with the knee scores. The mean amount of joint motion after surgery did not change significantly with time: 124 ° preoperatively and 114 ° at the final follow-up. The patellar position also did not change from preoperative values during postoperative follow-up: mean Insall-Salvati index was 0. 88 before and 0. 90 5 years after surgery, neither showing patella baja. ConclusionDome-shaped HTO is a durable time-buying procedure for patients with unicompartmental medial gonarthrosis, and can avoid subsequent development of patella baja that may complicate further prosthetic arthroplasty...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Osteonecrosis may be {{triggered}} by bone temperatures above 47 °C during routine orthopaedic bone cuts using power-driven saws with potentially negative impacts on bone healing. A new oscillating-tip saw blade design (Precision®; Stryker, Kalamazoo, USA) has been recently developed with a saw blade design that may influence the amount of heat generated. We have, therefore, sought to compare the bone temperature achieved using this new blade design with a standard oscillating saw during a standardized cutting task. Method: Six human cadaveric femora were obtained. Each femur was clamped and a distal femoral <b>cutting</b> <b>jig</b> was applied. An initial cut was performed to visualize the distal metaphyseal bone. The cutting block was then moved 2 mm proximal and a further cut performed, measuring {{the temperature of the}} bone with an infrared camera. This was repeated, moving the block 2 mm proximal with each cut, alternating between a standard oscillating saw blade (12 cuts) and the Precision® saw blade (12 cuts). The bone density at the level of each slice was established from a CT scan of each specimen which had been performed prior to the experiment. Results: The two blades did not differ with respect to the integrated mean temperature calculated for each cut (p= 0. 89). The average peak temperatures were not significantly different between blades (p= 0. 14). There {{was no significant difference between}} blades for peak heating rate (p= 0. 7), although the area of bone heated above the 47 deg osteonecrotic threshold was significantly (p= 0. 04) less for the standard saw blade. Conclusions: The Precision® blade may have advantages over standard oscillating blade, but reduced heat generation was not observed in this study. Indeed, the Precision® blade generated heat that exceeded the bony osteonecrosis threshold in a greater proportion of bone than the standard blade, questioning its use for osteotomy or uncemented knee arthroplasty. Further work should examine modifications to the blade design to better optimize the requirements of speed, accuracy and heat generation...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of a patient-specific instrumentation (PSI) as assessed by the intraoperative use of knee navigation software during the surgical procedure. METHODS: Fifteen patients with primary gonarthrosis were selected for unilateral total knee arthroplasty. The first three patients were excluded from this study, as they were considered to be a warm up to set-up the procedure. All patients were operated on with a cemented posterior-stabilised prosthesis cruciate ligament-sacrificing by the same surgeon using the patient matched <b>cutting</b> <b>jigs.</b> The size of the implant, level of resection, and alignment in the coronal and sagittal planes were evaluated. An unsatisfactory result was considered an error ≥ 2 ° in both planes for each component as a possible error of 4 ° could result in aggravation. RESULTS: On the coronal plane the mean deviation of the tibial guide from the ideal alignment was 1. 2  ±  1. 5 (range 0 - 5 °) and in the sagittal plane was 3. 8  ±  2. 4 (range 0 - 7. 5 °). On the coronal plane the mean deviation of the femoral guide from the ideal alignment was 1. 2  ±  0. 6 and in the sagittal was 3. 7  ±  2. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this preliminary experience the PSI system based only on data acquisition with A-P radiograms and RMN cannot be defined as accurate. In cases of the use of the custom made <b>cutting</b> <b>jigs</b> it is recommended to perform an accurate control of the alignment before making the cuts, for any step of the procedure.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel surgical approach via intraoral {{access to the}} Inverted L osteotomy utilizing virtual surgical planning (VSP) and patient-specific customized mandibular fixation. VSP in orthognathic surgery {{has been well documented}} in its ability to increase preoperative and intraoperative efficiency, decrease cost and operating room time, and improve predictability and patient outcomes. In addition to occlusal splints, the adjunctive cutting guides and reference templates generated through computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing further aids in the precise transfer of the virtual plan to the intraoperative procedure. As the application of VSP is becoming more prevalent in the surgical treatment dentofacial deformities, 3 -D virtual planning is moving beyond <b>cutting</b> <b>jigs</b> and guides and into the fabrication of patient-specific customized mandibular reconstruction plates in both the orthognathic and reconstructive arenas. Orthognathic surgery can be essential for the establishment of sound function and ideal esthetics for individuals who possess a dentofacial deformity. VSP and customized mandibular reconstruction plates have great potential to help safely guide the inverted L osteotomy and produce predictable functional and esthetic results while improving efficiency preoperatively as well as intraoperatively...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The {{key to a}} {{successful}} total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is {{the restoration of the}} mechanical axis with balanced flexion and extension gaps. Patient-specific cutting block technique has been the latest development in total knee arthroplasty. This technique uses a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the patient's symptomatic knee to create bone models and <b>cutting</b> <b>jigs.</b> This study was designed to evaluate the intraoperative accuracy of the patient-specific cutting block as compared to the preoperative template. Methods. Visionaire (Smith and Nephew, Genesis 2 Knee Arthroplasty) patient-specific TKA was used in all patients. An independent research officer was responsible for measuring all the resected articular surfaces of femur and tibia during surgery and compared it to the cutting block manufactured according to the preoperative template. Seven different measurements from each patient were obtained; four different measurements from the femur and three from the tibia were recorded. The differences between the actual resections made intraoperatively, as compared to the original pre-operative templates, were noted as the error. The surgical team was blinded to the measurements of the resections and the calculations of the errors. Results. Twenty-six Visionaire patient-specific TKA were included in the study. A total of 182 readings of bone resections made intraoperatively (seven for each patient). Eighty five percent of all collected readings were below the error margin of ≤ 1. 5 [*]mm. Size of resection had no effect on the error margin. All patients had satisfactory post-operative alignment, and at discharge all 26 patients achieved more than 90 ° of knee flexion. Conclusion. This observational study provides evidence that patient-specific TKA is comparable to other forms of TKA and may have some distinct advantages. In addition, we have shown that the cutting blocks are able to consistently deliver accurate cuts that are reproducible. We recommend intra-operative measurement of the bone resection and its comparison with the cutting block as a routine surgical step to confirm the MRI scan data, block placement, and instant validation of the bony resection before implant placement.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of VISIONAIRE (Smith & Nephew Inc., Memphis, TN, USA) Patient Matched <b>cutting</b> tibial <b>jigs</b> in comparison with extramedullary (EM) tibial instrumentation by analysing data as detected by intra-operative use of VectorVision knee navigation software from BrainLAB (Redwood City, CA, USA). Twelve patients were selected for unilateral total knee replacement (TKR). They underwent a full-length weight-bearing anteroposterior (AP) radiograph and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). During surgery, once the EM guides were placed and fixed on the tibia, the orientation in the coronal and sagittal planes was checked by the navigator and then compared with the data obtained by measuring the orientation of VISIONAIRE Patient Matched <b>cutting</b> tibial <b>jigs.</b> An unsatisfactory result was considered an error a parts per thousand yen 2 A degrees in both coronal and sagittal planes for the tibial component as a possible error of 4 A degrees could result. In the coronal plane the mean deviation of the EM tibial guides from the ideal alignment (0 A degrees) was 0. 7 A +/- 0. 39 A degrees and of the VISIONAIRE was 129 A +/- 1. 55 A degrees (P = 0. 22). In the sagittal plane the mean deviation of the EM tibial guides from 3 A degrees of posterior slope was - 1. 62 A +/- 1. 78 A degrees and of the VISIONAIRE was + 1. 16 A +/- 4. 29 A degrees (P < 0. 05). Negative values indicate a more posterior slope from the ideal and positive values an anterior slope. This preliminary study documented only a fair accuracy of the method with a consistent risk of error of more of 3 A degrees especially in the sagittal plane. We could speculate that the problem in the sagittal plane was due to the fact that the pre-operative protocol does not include a lateral X-ray projection of the knee and only includes an AP standing X-ray of the straight leg and MRI...|$|R
40|$|Computer-assisted {{surgical}} {{techniques in}} knee replacement procedures {{have been shown}} to increase the accuracy of implant positioning and reduce the incidence of alignment and soft-tissue balancing “outliers”. The use of this technology as a training tool is less widely reported. However, the recent implementation of the EWTD 48 -hour working week for junior doctors has focussed attention on the issues of surgical training and experience. Recent evidence from trainee logbooks has shown a significant downward trend in operative exposure and this is forcing changes in the principles of how training should be delivered. Trainees are actively required to demonstrate operative competence in order to progress but are increasingly faced with limited opportunities to acquire these skills. On the other hand, trainers also face difficulties with the prospect of supervising less accomplished trainees which raises ethical issues of patient protection. We present a trainee’s perspective of experience gained in a unit routinely using computer-assisted technology and highlight the potential to enhance the learning process. Navigation systems provide constant visual and numerical feedback via a computer simulated interpretation. Initially this displays relevant functional anatomy, helps in the identification of anatomical landmarks and demonstrates sagittal and coronal plane deformities which can be difficult to accurately assess “by eye”. Computer-assisted systems have the benefit of displaying only bony anatomy which improves visualisation. This can then be compared to the palpable, clinical deformity on the table. The geometry of the native knee is also made clear with the navigation system leading to a better understand of the objectives of TKR. There are some aspects of the biomechanics of the knee which are difficult to appreciate, such as the changes in varus-valgus alignment during flexion and extension. This may be very subtle and difficult to pick up manually but can look quite dramatic on the computer. The position of <b>cutting</b> <b>jigs</b> which are held to the bone by pins can be altered by inadvertently lifting or hanging on them with the saw, when making the bone cuts. Additionally the cut can be altered by advancing the cutting block closer to the bone, for example if cutting the tibia with a posterior slope. Both these effects can be quantified by using the navigation tools to confirm the cut that has been made. Trainers can have the benefit of seeing the alignment and confirming the cuts made by a trainee without having to get closely involved with the operation. Cementation technique is also open to scrutiny with the ability to compare pre and post cementation alignment. The positive feedback obtained from computer assisted surgery is educational to the trainee, by giving an undisputable computer generated graphic of what they are doing during the different stages of total knee arthroplasty. It also shows what has been achieved {{at the end of the}} procedure. This can give both the trainer and trainee more confidence in the procedure and ensures patient safety...|$|R
30|$|Depending on the {{complexity}} of the malunion, patients were treated with an open-wedge osteotomy or an oblique single-cut rotation osteotomy (OSCRO) [14]. Both osteotomy types were planned by using virtual or physical synthetic models of both radii and/or assisted by intra-operative use of patient-specific <b>cutting</b> guides and <b>jigs</b> (Fig.  2). In the latter method, the sterilised surgical guide was positioned at the specific bone surface and was fixated with Kirschner wires, using the planned fixation holes. In the case of an oblique single-cut rotation osteotomy (OSCRO), the guide was removed after the osteotomy and a stainless steel jig served to set the angle between the proximal and distal bone segment [14]. Rotational alignment was achieved by rotating the malunited distal bone segment over the planned angle. Regular plate and screw fixation was performed to maintain the position. Postoperative management varied from direct mobilisation to 2  weeks of plaster of Paris immobilisation.|$|R
