During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules—including Bindia Naik (Shilpa Shukla), his most experienced player. In response, Bindia repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at McDonald's. During the lunch, local boys make a pass at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting {{one of the women}} from behind with a cricket bat, telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the tub and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize.

25|$|Some {{argue that}} {{overpopulation}} {{and lack of}} access to birth control leads to population increase to exceed food production and other resources. Better education for both men and women, and more control of their lives, reduces population growth due to family planning.

25|$|In nature, {{males and}} females usually differ in {{reproductive}} fitness optima. Males generally prefer to maximize their number of offspring, and therefore their number of mates; females, on the other hand, tend to care more for their offspring and have fewer mates. Because of this, there are generally more males available to mate at a given time, making females a limited resource. This leads males to evolve aggressive mating behaviors which <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> acquire mates.|$|E

25|$|The Senior Project is {{a program}} that began at Uni in the Spring of 2014. The project was {{developed}} by Assistant Director of Student Life Karl Radnitzer, who got the idea from a similar program at New Trier High School in Winnetka, IL. The project's goal is to allow second semester seniors to explore interests in a more career-oriented way than they would in a typical classroom setting. The project connects students with mentors in the Champaign-Urbana community who <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> explore their academic interests outside of the school building. Students come up with ideas for projects and submit them for approval to a Senior Project committee. If a project is approved, students then spend their second semester doing work for their project around three times a week. Students have worked in various labs at the University of Illinois, at the Crisis Nursery, at Carle Hospital, and at Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.|$|E

In an English-speaking tradition, [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you" [...] are taught to children {{at a very early}} age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, [...] "give me the bread" [...] and another responds with, [...] "that was rude. What do you say?", and the person responds with [...] "please", the child may not know the meaning of [...] "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying [...] "please".|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} this time, {{the heyday of the}} French Revolution, that Barbauld {{published}} her most radical political pieces. From 1787 to 1790, Charles James Fox attempted to convince the House of Commons to pass a law granting Dissenters full citizenship rights. When this bill was defeated for the third time, Barbauld wrote one of her most passionate pamphlets, An Address to the Opposers of the Repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts. Readers were shocked to discover that such a well-reasoned argument should come from a woman. In 1791, after William Wilberforce's attempt to outlaw the slave trade failed, Barbauld published her Epistle to William Wilberforce Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade, which not only lamented the fate of the slaves, but also warned of the cultural and social degeneration the British could expect if they did not abandon slavery. In 1792, she continued this theme of national responsibility in an anti-war sermon entitled Sins of Government, Sins of the Nation which argued that each individual is responsible for the actions of the nation: [...] "We are called upon to repent of national sins, because we <b>can</b> <b>help</b> <b>them,</b> and because we ought to help them." ...|$|E
