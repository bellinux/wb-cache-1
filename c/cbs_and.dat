40|$|PURPOSE – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to explore, define, {{reconcile}} and depict corporate identity (CI), corporate brand (<b>CB)</b> <b>and</b> corporate reputation (CR) in a framework that reflects the dimensions of these constructs, discriminates between them and represents their inter-relatedness.

ORIGINALITY/VALUE – The article reconciles disparate views from a number of theoretical streams that have investigated CI, <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> CR and develops a comprehensive framework that shows that although the management and measurement of the constructs may overlap, the constructs themselves are not interchangeable.

40|$|Adult {{stem cells}} are finding {{increased}} therapeutic potential not least in tissue regeneration protocols. The cell sources being proposed for such protocols include embryonic, umbilical cord blood (<b>CB)</b> <b>and</b> adult bone marrow (BM). Although embryonic sources are controversial, <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> marrow are available immediately. The appropriate cells of use in these sources {{are considered to be}} extremely rare and a characterisation of the starting cell source is important for the development of adult stem cell protocols and ex vivo expansion. Umbilical <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM mononuclear cells were labelled for the antigens CD 34, CD 133, CD 117, CD 164, Thy- 1 or CD 38, and additional intracellular CD 34 antigen. Three dimensional flow-cytometric analyses were carried out together with dual laser confocal microscope analysis for antigen profile expression. Variable levels of immaturity were detected on <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM populations using internal and external CD 34 antigen. For <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM cells, internal CD 34 (intCD 34 +) could be detected on co-expressing CD 133 + cells before expression of external CD 34 antigen (extCD 34 +). CD 38 co-expression analysis also showed that a small but distinct group of cells expressing low CD 38 and no external CD 34 antigen could be detected. Additional phenotyping of these cells using CD 117, Thy- 1, CD 164 and CD 133 demonstrated variable primitive status detectable within the external CD 34 - population. Newly harvested primary <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM populations were shown to contain not only cellular populations of known standard sequential maturity but also populations of more extreme rarity. The presence of cells which lacked extracellular CD 34 antigen, in both <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> BM, but which possessed CD 133, has important implications for purification of human stem cells in clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} intraduodenally {{administered}} cattle bile (<b>CB)</b> <b>and</b> Na-taurodeoxycholate (TDC) on basal pancreatic secretion and plasma levels of secretin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and gastrin were investigated on two separate days in 10 fasting volunteers. Doses of 2 - 6 g <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> 20 & 600 mg TDC were given intraduodenally at 65 -min intervals. Volume, bicarbonate, lipase, trypsin, amylase, and bilirubin were measured in 10 -min fractions of duodenal juice, and GI peptides determined by radioimmunoassay. <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> TDC enhanced significantly and dose-dependently volume, bicarbonate and enzyme secretion, and plasma secretin and PP levels. In contrast, plasma gastrin showed only a marginal increase. We {{conclude that the}} hydrokinetic effect of intraduodenal <b>CB</b> <b>and</b> TDC is at least partially mediated by secretin. Gastrin could be ruled out as a mediator of the ecbolic effect, whereas other GI peptides, primarily CCK, and/or neural mechanisms must be considered possible mediators.
