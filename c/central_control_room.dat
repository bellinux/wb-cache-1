25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> and had to be routed with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, the {{development}} of complex surveillance systems has captured the interest of both the research and industrial worlds. Strong and challenging requirements of modern society {{are involved in this}} problem, which aims to increase safety and security in several application domains such as transport, tourism, home and bank security, military applications, etc. At the same time, fast improvements in microelectronics, telecommunications, and computer science make it necessary to consider new perspectives in this field. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate, discuss, and evaluate the impact of distributed processing and new communication techniques on multimedia surveillance systems, which represent the so-called third-generation surveillance systems (3 GSSs). In particular aspects related to the distribution of intelligence among multiple-processing and wide-bandwidth resources are discussed in detail. It is shown how distribution of intelligence can be obtained by a hierarchical architecture that partitions, in a dynamic way, the main logical processing tasks (i. e., representation, recognition, and communication) performed in a 3 GSS physical architecture made lip of intelligent cameras, hubs, and <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>rooms.</b> The advantages of this solution are pointed out in terms of: 1) increased flexibility and reconfigurability and 2) optimal allocation of available processing and bandwidth resources. Finally, a case study is analyzed that allows one to gain a deeper insight into a distributed surveillance system...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{thesis is}} concerned with the human factors aspects of industrial alarm systems within human supervisory control tasks. Typically such systems are located in <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> and the information may be presented via visual display units. The thesis develops a human, rather than engineering, centred approach to the assessment, measurement and analysis of the situation. A human factors methodology was employed to investigate the human requirements through: interviews, questionnaires, observation and controlled experiments. Based on the analysis of current industrial alarm systems in a variety of domains (power generation, manufacturing and coronary care), it is suggested that often designers do not pay due considerations to the human requirements. It is suggested that most alarm systems have severe shortcomings in human factors terms. The interviews, questionnaire and observations led to the proposal of 'alarm initiated activities' as a framework for the research to proceed. The framework comprises of six main stages: observe, accept, analyse, investigate, correct and monitor. This framework served as a basis for laboratory research into alarm media. Under consideration were speech-based alarm displays and visual alarm displays. Non-speech auditory displays were the subject of a literature review. The findings suggest that care needs to be taken when selecting the alarm media. Ideally it should be chosen to support the task requirements of the operator, rather than being arbitrarily assigned. It was also indicated that there may be some interference between the alarm initiated activities and the alarm media, i. e. information that supports one particular stage of alarm handling may interfere with another...|$|R

40|$|In data center, telco {{equipment}} {{station and}} some <b>central</b> <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{there are some}} cases with cooling requirement all the year, their temperatures are usually controlled strictly whenever in summer or in winter. Moreover, due to clearness and safety requirement, the chiller should provide cooling water all the time even the outside environment is very cold. There had been some considerations about provide cooling capacity in cold climate with free environmental air by various heat exchangers directly. Without operating chillers, annual energy consumption on temperature control could be decreased. This paper proposed a system combined a chiller with an air-cooled heat exchanger, shown as Fig 1., there is one evaporator to provide cooled water, two condensers for the chiller and the separate type heat pipe alternatively. In warm climate, the chiller operates normally with the compressor and its condenser, the air cooling heat pipe is blocked by switching valves. In cold climate, the system is switched to the no compressor mode, the air-cooler heat exchanger could connect with the evaporator directly, the work pattern follows the separated type heat pipe, the working medium is the refrigerant still, the air cooling heat exchanger serves as the condenser of the separated type heat pipe, therefore, the evaporator is the evaporating part of the separated type heat pipe as well, the cooled water could be delivered through normal pipelines. In application of the combined refrigeration, they operation strategy for refrigeration and the heat pipe should be discussed in different climate zones. Therefore, {{in this paper we}} discussed energy consumption for cooling requirement in data center at several typical regions based on the combined cooling system. In different regions, their climates condition are different, the switching between the normal refrigeration and the heat pipe results to various annual energy consumptions...|$|R
50|$|One of the <b>central</b> focuses of <b>Control</b> <b>Room</b> is on {{the alleged}} {{friendly}} fire attack against the Baghdad headquarters of Al Jazeera, on 8 April 2003.

40|$|In this thesis, a {{particular}} class of agent is {{singled out for}} examination. In order to provide a guiding metaphor, we speak of <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agents. Our focus is on rational decision- making by such agents, where the circumstances obtaining are such that rationality is bounded. <b>Control</b> <b>room</b> agents, whether human or non-human, need to reason and act in a changing environment with only limited information available to them. Determining {{the current state of}} the environment is a <b>central</b> concern for <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agents if they are to reason and act sensibly. A <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent cannot plan its actions without having an internal representation (epistemic state) of its environment, and cannot make rational decisions unless this representation, to some level of accuracy, reflects the state of its environment. The focus of this thesis is on three aspects regarding the epistemic functioning of a <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent: 1. How should the epistemic state of a <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent be represented in order to facilitate logical analysis? 2. How should a <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent change its epistemic state upon receiving new information? 3. How should a <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent combine available information from different sources? In describing the class of <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agents as first-order intentional systems hav- ing both informational and motivational attitudes, an agent-oriented view is adopted. The central construct used in the information-theoretic approach, which is qualitative in nature, is the concept of a templated ordering. Representing the epistemic state of a <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent by a (special form of) tem- plated ordering signals a departure from the many approaches in which only the beliefs of an agent are represented. Templated orderings allow for the representation of both knowledge and belief. A <b>control</b> <b>room</b> agent changes its epistemic state according to a proposed epistemic change algorithm, which allows the agent to select between two well-established forms of belief change operations, namely, belief revision and belief update. The combination of (possibly conflicting) information from different sources has re- ceived a lot of attention in recent years. Using templated orderings for the semantic representation of information, a new family of purely qualitative merging operations is developed. School of ComputingPh. D. (Computer Science...|$|R
