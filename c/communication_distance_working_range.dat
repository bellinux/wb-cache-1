40|$|Abstract — The {{transmission}} energy {{required for}} a wireless communication increases superlinearly with the <b>communication</b> <b>distance.</b> In a mobile wireless network, nodal movement can be exploited to greatly reduce the energy required by postponing communication until the sender moves close to a target receiver, subject to application deadline constraints. In this paper, we characterize the fundamental performance limit, namely the lower bound expected <b>communication</b> <b>distance,</b> achievable by any postponement algorithm within given deadline constraints. Our analytical results concern mainly the random waypoint (RWP) model. Specifically, we develop a tight analytical lower bound of the achievable expected <b>communication</b> <b>distance</b> under the model. In addition, we define a more general map-based movement model, and characterize its lower bound distance by simulations. We also address the practical attainment of distance reduction through movement-predicted communication. Specifically, whereas prior work has experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness a least distance (LD) algorithm, we provide an absolute performance measure of how closely LD can match the theoretical optimum. We show that LD achieves an average reduction in the expected <b>communication</b> <b>distance</b> within 62 % to 94 % of the optimal, over a realistic range of nodal speeds, for both the RWP and map-based models.

As was widely applied in the radar and sonar, the beamforming method was not used to extend the <b>communication</b> <b>distance</b> between buoys so far. The POB method overcomes the unstable position of buoys caused by waves by implementing the orientation filter. The whole process includes two steps: First, the real-time attitude of the antenna array is calculated by the orientation filter. With the known relative direction of the destination node to the antenna array, the second step is to control phased array antenna beamforming parameters, directing the beam at the destination node. The POB scheme has been simulated under the condition of regular waves. The results reveal that POB provides significant power gains and improves the distance between two communicating nodes effectively...|$|R

RAVE mimics a natural acoustical environment by transmitting the speaker’s voice signal only to receivers within a given radius, the distance of which is calculated by considering the speaker’s vocal effort {{and the level of}} background noise. To create a genuine RAVE, it is necessary to understand and model the speech production process in noise while wearing HPDs.
