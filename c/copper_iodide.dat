5000|$|A unified {{explanation}} of these phenomena required {{a theory of}} solid-state physics which developed greatly {{in the first half}} of the 20th Century. In 1878 Edwin Herbert Hall demonstrated the deflection of flowing charge carriers by an applied magnetic field, the Hall effect. The discovery of the electron by J.J. Thomson in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. Karl Baedeker, by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that <b>copper</b> <b>iodide</b> had positive charge carriers. Johan Koenigsberger classified solid materials as metals, insulators and [...] "variable conductors" [...] in 1914 although his student Josef Weiss already introduced the term Halbleiter (semiconductor in modern meaning) in PhD thesis in 1910. Felix Bloch published a theory of the movement of electrons through atomic lattices in 1928. In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by Alan Herries Wilson and the concept of band gaps had been developed. Walter H. Schottky and Nevill Francis Mott developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a metal-semiconductor junction. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the p-n junction and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.|$|E

These novel furanopyrimidine nucleosides bear unusual bicyclic base moieties and exhibit complete specificity for VZV. Limited in vitro cytotoxicity has been detected and the bicyclic nucleosides are now well established as a new family of potent antivirals. Our initial studies revealed an absolute requirement of a long alkyl side-chain, with an optimal chain length of C 8 -C 10, for antiviral activity. Following further studies, we recently reported a significant enhancement of both antiviral potency and selectivity by the inclusion of a phenyl group within the alkyl side-chain of these compounds. The new lead p-alkylphenyl analogues displayed EC 50 values below 1 nM versus VZV and selectivity index values > 1000000. We herein report the synthesis and characterization of a further series of alkylaryl analogues bearing terminal phenyl groups with varying n-alkyl side-chain lengths.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Heterocyclic synthesis via processes involving single electron transfer, namely aromatic SRN 1,reactions and copper metal- and cuprous halide-promoted substitutions have been investigated. The cyclisation step in all the 'syntheses is effected by an intramolecular aromatic nucelophilic substitution on a halogen atom which is ortho to the side chain bearing the nucleophilic species (generally an amide or thioamide moiety). The process of entrainment {{has been shown to}} be a valuable technique for effecting reactions performed' under SRN 1 conditions. The mechanisms of, and the mechanistic relationships between the substitution processes, were investigated using well documented diagnostic probes for the SRN 1 reaction and by conducting series of experiments on simple reaction systems whose behaviour under SRN 1 conditions was already known. Ring systems prepared by the methods noted above include benzoxazoles, benzothiazoles, 1, 3 -benzothiazines, indoles and a tricyclic system. Attempts to prepare seven-membered heterocycles by increasing the length of the side chain proved unsuccessful. When the side chain bears a carbonyl function adjacent to the aromatic ring, an intramolecular SNAr reaction takes place and cyclisation of N-(2 -haloaroyl) -N'-phenylthioureas occurred under mild conditions. Quinazolinones and a 1, 3 -benzothiazinone have been synthesised in this manner which appears to have little precedent in the chemical literature. The preparation of seven-membered heterocycles by an SNAr cyclisation proved fruitless extension of the side chain length by one carbon atom (effected by the preparation of an N-cinnamoyl-N-phenylthiourea) resulted in the cyclisation of the side chain.

This thesis documents the recent research concerning the synthesis, the anticancer and antibacterial activity of the ß-acid lupulone 1, its naturally occurring congeners 1 a-d and further, novel, non-naturally occurring compounds. We resumed the group's previous collaboration with the Golston and Pirianov research group at St Georges, where the anticancer studies were performed. The synthesis centred on a Friedel-Crafts acylation of phloroglucinol 32, followed by a C-trialkenylation reaction between the acylphloroglucinol and an allyl bromide. We conducted experiments that focused upon the choice of base and solvent for the trialkenylation reaction, concluding that liquid ammonia as both the base and solvent offered the most efficient route to the ß-acids. It was shown that aliphatic allylic bromides lend themselves to the' reaction,. although some derivatives require purification by column chromatography in addition to recrystallisation. In contrast, aromatic allyl bromides did not participate in the alkenylation reaction. We further investigated an alternate G-alkenylation reaction involving the di¬lithiation of 1, 3, 5 -trimethoxybenzene.
