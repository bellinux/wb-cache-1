5|$|As of May 2015, {{the federal}} {{government}} in conjunction with UNSOM was working toward establishing a comprehensive, international standards and obligations-compliant ammunition and weapons management system. To this end, <b>capacity-building</b> for the physical management of arms and bookkeeping was being developed, and new storage facilities and armouries for weapons and explosives were being constructed.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, {{the federal}} Ministry of Defence {{launched}} its new Guulwade Plan (Victory Plan), {{which provides a}} roadmap for long-term development of the military. It was formulated with technical support from UNSOM. The framework stipulates that international partners are slated to provide <b>capacity-building</b> as well as assistance for joint operations to 10,900 Somali national army troops, with these units drawn from various regions in the country.|$|E

25|$|The KCLC {{developed}} a Right to Organize Plan in 1999 for the Seattle Unions Now (SUN) program. SUN was a KCLC sponsored {{organization dedicated to}} <b>capacity-building,</b> multi-union efforts, ambitious unions and labor campaigns. The Right to Organize Plan focused on mobilizing, community and religious outreach, political accountability and organizing contingent workers.|$|E
25|$|Strategic assets {{under the}} purview of the Indian Nuclear Command Authority provide a {{credible}} second-strike capability beyond strengthening land borders and securing unrestrained access to air/sea lanes of communications. Transformation efforts, through infrastructure modernisation and skills <b>capacity-building,</b> are under-way in all branches of the Indian Armed Forces to acquire air-sea-land dominance capabilities necessary to exercise control over the 15,200km (9,445mi) land frontier and 7,517km (4,671mi) coastline.|$|E
25|$|With {{its goal}} of {{preserving}} the rainforest, Rainforest Foundation Norway advocates {{for the rights of}} its indigenous inhabitants, by providing project-related grants, <b>capacity-building</b> expertise and direct technical assistance to its local partners on the ground, including indigenous communities and grassroots organizations. In addition to working with these groups directly through program activities in local communities, RFN support them indirectly through policy, advocacy, and information activities aimed at securing rights, establishing indigenous territories and protecting the rainforest.|$|E
25|$|Infrastructure {{rehabilitation}} and modernization is complemented by improving {{the management of}} irrigation schemes to ensure effective and sustainable use of irrigation systems. The <b>capacity-building</b> aspect of the Peruvian model includes strengthening the operation and maintenance requirements of the systems, and improvement of financial performance through increased volumetric metering, water tariff structure, and collection rate. Improving financial performance of the WUBs is linked to increasing farm incomes and therefore farmers' capacity to contribute to O costs as well as irrigation improvement investments.|$|E
25|$|In both Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea, RFN {{has sought}} to support {{community}} organizations {{on the basis of}} traditional governing principles and the introduction of culturally adapted education so as to contribute to the empowerment of forest peoples. Its long-term support for strategically placed organizations has been a central aspect of its strategy for strengthening civil society - as exemplified by its contribution to the formalization of , the Indigenous Peoples Network of Malaysia, which acts as an umbrella organization for a large number of community-based organizations and provides them with support and <b>capacity-building</b> expertise.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Burkina Faso {{adopted a}} National Policy for Scientific and Technical Research, the {{strategic}} objectives {{of which are}} to develop R and the application and commercialization of research results. The policy also makes provisions for strengthening the ministry’s strategic and operational capacities. One of the key priorities is to improve food security and self-sufficiency by boosting capacity in agricultural and environmental sciences. The creation of a centre of excellence in 2014 at the International Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou within the World Bank project provides essential funding for <b>capacity-building</b> in these priority areas.|$|E
25|$|AmeriCorps State and National members {{engage in}} direct service activities, such as after-school {{tutoring}} or homebuilding, and <b>capacity-building</b> activities, such as volunteer recruitment, for the organizations they serve. After successfully completing their term of service, AmeriCorps State and National members may receive an Education Award {{of up to}} $5,750. The Education Award can pay for additional college or graduate school courses, or it can pay off existing student loans. Full-time members typically complete 1,700 hours of service over 11 months; these members additionally receive a living allowance, health benefits, and child care assistance during their term.|$|E
25|$|At the 2001 Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai, APEC leaders {{pushed for}} {{a new round of}} trade {{negotiations}} and support for a program of trade <b>capacity-building</b> assistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks later. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United States, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and capacity building. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and implement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade transaction costs in the Asia-Pacific region by 5 percent over 5 years, and pursue trade liberalisation policies relating to information technology goods and services.|$|E
25|$|In general, we {{absolutely}} condemn {{acts of violence}} and human rights violations committed against individuals in Iraq because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This {{is an issue that}} we've been following very closely since we have been made aware of these allegations, and we are aware of the allegations. Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian <b>capacity-building</b> efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
25|$|The PNG {{government}} subsequently {{imposed a}} blockade on Bougainville. It was enforced using UH-1 Iroquois helicopters and Pacific-class patrol boats {{that had been}} supplied to PNG as aid by the Australian government in the late-1980s {{as part of a}} defence co-operation program underway since independence. Other Australian support, as part of its <b>capacity-building</b> effort, included funding for the PNGDF, provision of arms and ammunition, logistics, training, and some specialist and technical advisors and personnel. Similar assistance was also provided to the police. The helicopters had been provided by Australia without weapons and on the provision {{that they would not be}} used for combat; however, the PNGDF subsequently fitted machine-guns in contravention of the agreement and later used them as gunships. The blockade would remain in effect until the ceasefire in 1994 (although it was informally continued for some parts of Bougainville until 1997).|$|E
25|$|The ICTR {{delivered}} {{its last}} trial judgement on 20 December 2012 in the Ngirabatware case. Following this milestone, the Tribunal's remaining judicial work now rests solely with the Appeals Chamber. As of October 2014, only one case comprising six separate appeals is pending before the ICTR Appeals Chamber. One additional appeal from ICTR trial judgement was delivered in December 2014 in the Ngirabatware case by the appeals {{chamber of the}} Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, which started assuming responsibility for the ICTR's residual functions on 1 July 2012. The ICTR's formal closure is scheduled {{to coincide with the}} return of the Appeals Chamber's judgement in its last appeal. Until the return of that judgement in 2015, the ICTR will continue its efforts to end impunity for those responsible for the Genocide through a combination of judicial, outreach, and <b>capacity-building</b> efforts. Through these efforts, the ICTR will fulfil its mandate of bringing justice to the victims of the Genocide and, in the process, hopes to deter others from committing similar atrocities in the future.|$|E

2500|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered {{to address the problem}} of food security. An example is the [...] "Community Area-Based Development Approach" [...] to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. In an analysis of the programme by the Overseas Development Institute, CABDA's focus on individual and community <b>capacity-building</b> is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{technology}} transition & human capital <b>capacity-building</b> initiated in India during the 1960s started bearing its fruits in the mid-1990 and dove-tailed neatly with {{the adoption of}} economic reforms rendered inevitable {{after the end of}} the Cold War. Reduced venture capital facilities forced educated entrepreneurs to leverage intra-familial/neighbourhood angel investors to create technology start-ups right from the beginning of the digital Revolution, many of which have matured into niche/sectoral leaders (Biocon, Reddy Labs, Sun-Ranbaxy, Dishman, Wipro, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, Welspun, Suzlon, Vedanta, Reliance). Prudent opening-up of the Indian economy has allowed long established domestic business conglomerates (Tata, Mahindra, Birla, Bajaj, Kirloskar, Godrej, TVS, Essar) to select optimums in production–possibilities in preparation for competition in the domestic markets from global heavy-weights. Corporate India is increasingly using the public-private partnership model to cater to India's vast public infrastructure requirements.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1975 Germany has {{supported}} the Kenyan water sector through the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development, which operates through GIZ in charge of technical co-operation and KfW in charge of financial co-operation. KfW has been nominated as the sector coordinator. Germany's ongoing programmes amount to approximately €80 million. The main development aid objective of the bilateral co-operation is to support sector institutions in ensuring sustainable and equitable access to safe water and sanitation in urban settings and to safeguard water resources. For example, GIZ contributes to the state target within its [...] "Water Sector Reform Programme" [...] from 2003 to 2013: The Project has several components such as: a) supporting the water ministry in sector reform b) regulation of the water sector and poverty-oriented financing commercialisation of {{water supply and sanitation}} c) commercialisation of water supply and sanitation d) <b>capacity-building</b> for the Water Resources Management Authority e) introduction of recycling-oriented sanitation (Ecosan).|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2012 investigative {{piece by}} the Somalia Report, the OBP paper {{and other similar}} reports that attempt to {{calibrate}} the global cost of piracy produce inaccurate estimates based {{on a variety of}} factors. Most saliently, instead of comparing the actual costs of piracy with the considerable benefits derived from the phenomenon by the maritime industry and local parties capitalizing on <b>capacity-building</b> initiatives, the OBP paper conflated the alleged piracy costs with the large premiums made by insurance companies and lumped them together with governmental and societal costs. The report also exaggerated the impact that piracy has had on the shipping sector, an industry which has grown steadily in size from 25,000 billion tonnes/miles to 35,000 billion tonnes/miles since the rise of Indian Ocean piracy in 2005. Moreover, the global costs of piracy reportedly represent a small fraction of total maritime shipping expenses and are significantly lower than more routine costs, such as those brought on by port theft, bad weather conditions or fuel-related issues. In the United States alone, the National Cargo Security Council estimated that between $10–$15 billion were stolen from ports in 2003, a figure several times higher than the projected global cost of piracy. Additionally, while the OBP paper alleged that pirate activity has had a significantly negative impact on regional economies, particularly the Kenyan tourism industry, tourist-derived revenue in Kenya rose by 32% in 2011. According to the Somalia Report investigation, the OBP paper also did not factor into its calculations the overall decline in successful pirate attacks beginning {{in the second half of}} 2011, a downward trend largely brought about by the increasing use of armed guards. According to Admiral Terence E. McKnight, ransom demands and payments have risen exponentially and the financers and pirates decided they are willing to wait as long as it takes to receive [...] "high seven-figure payouts".|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. World-wide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Nearing the century mark of the Bahá'í community in Germany, the Bahá'ís in Germany have begun efforts in diverse fields of interest. An estimated 500,000 people visited the Bahá'í pavilion at the Hanover Expo 2000. The 170 square-meter Bahá'í exhibit, hosted by the Bahá'í International Community and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Germany, featured development projects in Colombia, Kenya and Eastern Europe that illustrated the importance of grassroots <b>capacity-building,</b> the advancement of women, and moral and spiritual values in the process of social and economic development. The German community organized a national Bahá'í Choir in 2001 which tours various events in Germany and Europe. In 2002 the director of the Ernst Lange-Institute for Ecumenical Studies held a meeting {{under the auspices of the}} German Federal Environment Ministry titled [...] "Orientation dialogue of religions represented in Germany on environmental politics with reference to the climate issue" [...] for the interfaith community including the Bahá'ís. In 2005 former federal Minister of the Interior, Otto Schily, praised the contributions of German Bahá'ís to the social stability of the country, noting [...] "It is not enough to make a declaration of belief. It is important to live according to the basic values of our constitutional state, to defend them and make them secure in the face of all opposition. The members of the Bahá'í Faith do this because of their faith and the way they see themselves." [...] However the Bahá'ís have been excluded from other dialogues on religious issues. In 2007 a new memorial was unveiled replacing the one that had been taken down in Bad Mergentheim during Nazi Germany. Bahá'ís from much of Europe were among the more than 4,600 people who gathered in Frankfurt for the largest ever Bahá'í conference in Germany in February 2009.|$|E
