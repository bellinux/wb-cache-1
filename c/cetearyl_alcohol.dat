50|$|The {{ingredients}} for Emulsifying Wax NF are: <b>Cetearyl</b> <b>Alcohol,</b> Polysorbate 60, PEG-150 Stearate, and Steareth-20. It has {{the characteristics of}} cetyl alcohol combined with the viscosity building effect of stearyl alcohol as an effective thickener and helps form stable emulsions.|$|E
50|$|Cetostearyl alcohol, <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> or cetylstearyl {{alcohol is}} a mixture of fatty alcohols, {{consisting}} predominantly of cetyl and stearyl alcohols and is classified as a fatty alcohol. It is used as an emulsion stabilizer, opacifying agent, and foam boosting surfactant, as well as an aqueous and nonaqueous viscosity-increasing agent. It imparts an emollient feel to the skin and can be used in water-in-oil emulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, and anhydrous formulations. It is commonly used in hair conditioners and other hair products.|$|E
50|$|Most lotions are oil-in-water {{emulsions}} using {{a substance}} such as <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{to keep the}} emulsion together, but water-in-oil lotions are also formulated. The key components of a skin care lotion, cream or gel emulsion (that is mixtures of oil and water) are the aqueous and oily phases, an emulgent to prevent separation of these two phases, and, if used, the drug substance or substances. A wide variety of other ingredients such as fragrances, glycerol, petroleum jelly, dyes, preservatives, proteins and stabilizing agents are commonly added to lotions.|$|E
5000|$|Detergents {{are another}} class of surfactants, and will {{physically}} interact with both oil and water, thus stabilizing {{the interface between}} the oil and water droplets in suspension. This principle is exploited in soap, to remove grease {{for the purpose of}} cleaning. Many different emulsifiers are used in pharmacy to prepare emulsions such as creams and lotions. Common examples include emulsifying wax, <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> polysorbate 20, and ceteareth 20. Sometimes the inner phase itself can act as an emulsifier, and the result is a nanoemulsion, where the inner state disperses into [...] "nano-size" [...] droplets within the outer phase. A well-known example of this phenomenon, the [...] "Ouzo effect", happens when water is poured into a strong alcoholic anise-based beverage, such as ouzo, pastis, absinthe, arak, or raki. The anisolic compounds, which are soluble in ethanol, then form nano-size droplets and emulsify within the water. The resulting color of the drink is opaque and milky white.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{research}} into new skin- and environment-friendly surfactants. This paper focuses on a natural surfactant of an alkylpolyglucoside type, which can form both thermotropic and lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases. The {{aim of this study}} was to relate some physicochemical properties (characterised by polarisation and transmission electron microscopy, thermal analysis and rheology) of the three formulations based on cetearyl glucoside and <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> to the results of in vitro and in vivo bioavailability of hydrocortisone (HC). The three formulations contained oils of different polarity (medium chain triglycerides: MG, isopropyl myristate: IPM and light liquid paraffin: LP), respectively. In vitro permeation was followed through the artificial skin constructs (ASC), while the parameters measured in vivo were erythema index: EI (using instrumental human skin blanching assay), transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH). The vehicles based on cetearyl glucoside and <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> showed a complex colloidal structure of lamellar liquid-crystalline and lamellar gel-crystalline type, depending on oil polarity. Rheological profile of the vehicle was directly related to the in vitro profile of the HC permeation. In vivo results suggested that the vehicle with MG retarded the HC permeation, whereas less polar IPM and non-polar LP enhanced it. It is suggested that the enhancement is achieved either by a direct interaction with lipid lamellae of the SC or indirectly by improving skin hydration. There were no adverse effects during in vivo study, which indicates a good safety profile of this alkylpolyglucoside surfactant...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} Was to Examine the lyotropic {{potential}} of an alkylpolyglucoside mixed Emulsifier (Cetearyl Glucoside & <b>Cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol),</b> Which Belongs to the new generation of natural (sugar) surfactants, and to elaborate the stabilization mechanism and relation Between the colloid microstructure and water distribution Within the systems. Polarization and ordinary light as well as transmission electron microscopy, wide angle X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and rheological measurement, as well as in vivo hydration potential Were employed for testing the systems Characterization. A comparison of results Obtained from Isothermal thermogravimetry and in vivo short-term application study served to Recognize Within water distribution systems and the dynamic of water evaporation, ie to consider in the Possibility of Formulation and Prolonged water emulsion with controlled release. It Was Suggested That Cetearyl glucoside & <b>Cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> stabilizes the o / w creams by synergistic effects of Viscoelastic Hydrophilic Lamellar type of gel and lipophilic gel network built up from semi-Cetostearyl alcohol hydrates as well as by Lamellar liquid crystalline bilayers surrounding the oil droplets. Generally, in creams based on the non-ionic Emulsifier alkylpolyglucoside MontanovÒ 68 PHA four fractions of water Could Be Met: 1) free - bulk water, 2) Within lipophilic gel bonded water (secondary water), 3) water interlamelarilly Between fixed crystalline lipid bilayers (Hydrophilic gel) and 4) water Between fixed lipid layers in liquid-crystalline state. It is Also Showed That Additions oil into The Chosen binary system microstructure Significantly Influences the creams, Which Reflects Particularly onto the mode of water distribution and consequently Their creams Within The potential of skin hydration. Thus, the model with Emulsifier cream / water ratio of 1 : 10 : 43 and 20...|$|E
30|$|As a {{negative}} control, the cream containing the same basal formulation in Table  1 without only the photosynthetic bacteria extract was used since this formulation {{is commonly used}} for the base of most topical creams in Korea (Yu et al. 2004). For a positive control, commercial product (expressed as a control product in this work), a Atopalm® mile cream (ATOPALM, Daejeon, Korea) {{was used in the}} experiments, and the composition of major components was as follows: glycerin, propanediol, myristoyl, capric tryglyceride, polyglyceryl- 10 distearate, glyceryl stearate, <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> grape seed oil (3 %, v/v), jojoba seed oil, Portulacae Herba extract (5 %, v/v), sorbitan stearate, olive oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, phytosterol, sodium hyaluronate (1 %, w/v), tocopheryl acetate, allantoin, stearic acid, carbomer, arginine, dimethicone, 1, 2 -hexanediol, and caprylyl glycol, tropolone, etc.|$|E
40|$|Emulsions are {{the most}} common form of skin care products. However, these systems may exhibit some instability. Therefore, when {{developing}} emulsions for topical application it is interesting to verify whether they have suitable physical and mechanical characteristics and further assess their stability. The aim of this work was to study the stability of emulsion systems, which varied in the proportion of the emulsifying agent <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (and) sodium lauryl sulfate (and) sodium cetearyl sulfate (LSX), the nature of the oily phase (decyl oleate, cyclomethicone or dimethicone) and the presence or absence of pumice (5 % w/w). While maintaining the samples at room temperature, rheology studies, texture analysis and microscopic observation of formulations with and without pumice were performed. Samples were also submitted to an accelerated stability study by centrifugation and to a thermal stress test. Through the testing, it was found that the amount of emulsifying agent affects the consistency and textural properties such as firmness and adhesiveness. So, formulations containing LSX (5 % w/w) and decyl oleate or dimethicone as oily phase had a better consistency and remained stable with time, so exhibited the best features to be used for skin care products...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the vehicle on the release and permeation of fluconazole, a topical antifungal drug dissolved in Jojoba oil was evaluated. Series of Cutina lipogels (Cutina CPA [cetyl palmitate], CBS [mixture of glyceryl stearate, <b>cetearyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> cetyl palmitate, and cocoglycerides], MD [glyceryl stearate], and GMS [glyceryl monostearate]) in different concentrations as well as gel microemulsion were prepared. In-vitro drug release in Sorensens citrate buffer (pH 5. 5) and permeation through the excised skin of hairless mice, using a modified Franz diffusion cell, were performed. The rheological behavior and the apparent viscosity values for different gel bases were measured before and after storage under freezing conditions at − 4 °C and were taken as measures for stability of network structure. Candida albicans {{was used as a}} model fungus to evaluate the antifungal activity of the best formula achieved. The results of in vitro drug release and its percutaneous absorption showed that the highest values from gel microemulsion were assured. The rheological behavior of the prepared systems showed pseudoplastic (shear-thinning) flow indicating structural breakdown of the existing intermolecular interactions between polymeric chains. Moreover, the stability study revealed no significant difference between viscosity before and after storage for different formulae except for CPA Cutina lipogel (using analysis of variance [ANOVA] test at level of significance. 05). The antifungal activity of fluconazole showed the widest zone of inhibition with gel microemulsion. The gel microemulsion is an excellent vehicle for fluconazole topical drug delivery...|$|E
