[...] The dismantling, expected to cost USD$18million, {{was approved by the}} State Legislative Emergency Board in September 2006. The move was originally scheduled for 2007, but delays in the negotiations pushed the project back a year. Due to weather and surf conditions, the project had to be undertaken during the spring and summer months. [...] Titan Maritime Company, a subsidiary of Crowley Maritime Corporation, signed a USD$16.4million contract with the Oregon Department of State Lands. Titan Maritime used large jackup barges, Karlissa A and Karlissa B, for the New Carissa dismantling project. [...] Once the barges were in place, a cable car system was installed to allow the crews and their equipment access to the barges from the beach. The barges allowed the crews to access the wreck from 40ft (12.2m) above the surf. The crews cut New Carissa into removable pieces and then lifted them to the barges with cranes. The <b>cutting</b> <b>portion</b> of Titan's plan was largely completed by July 31, 2008, and the company then focused on pulling the stern from the sand, a process that was measured in inches. [...] The project's managing director expressed confidence that the removal deadline of October 1, 2008 would be met. [...] By September 2008, Titan had successfully removed the majority of the wreck; no part of the ship was visible from above the water, and only a few relatively small pieces remained submerged. Karlissa A and Karlissa B were relocated on October 12, 2008, and Titan's shore operations were completely removed by November 2008.|$|E

40|$|The laws {{determining}} {{the formation of}} force and power parameters of the coal cutting vibration-active process. The parameters have been investigated for coals {{for the first time}} and have been determined, with search for a rational amplitude-frequency range taken into account. Analytical dependences have been obtained to calculate the power consumed by the vibration exciter drive; the power is determined considering the drive design and loading on the function element. A mathematical model of the <b>cutting</b> <b>portion</b> drive has been developed; at its development, Rayleigh's method has been applied, and the elastic properties of separate elements of the transmission have been considered. The laws of forming the loads in the transmission system of the <b>cutting</b> <b>portion</b> drive have been found out, with the effect of the rigidity of the elastic coupling and rate of change of the torque from the vibration exciter on the working element taken into account. "Methods of selection of rational parameters of the exciter of torsional vibrations of the vibration-active function element of the mining combine" have been worked out.

40|$|Abstract. Drill wear or {{breakage}} often {{damages the}} work piece and/or machine tool. Spindle motor current reflects the cutting process and the signal can be easily and inexpensively obtained. This paper presents a strategy for on-line drilling tool wear and breakage monitoring. It employs Wavelet Transform (WT) of the spindle current signature to perform monitoring. A moving window technique is used to extract the <b>cutting</b> <b>portion</b> of data from the entire data sequence. A low pass de-nosing filter is employed to remove noise from the current signal. Features were extracted using WT node energy and selected based {{on their ability to}} detect tool wear and chipping. The Progression of tool wear based on feature of WT detail level 4 is analyzed and pointed out status of worn or chipped tool. Experimental results validate performance of the proposed algorithm...|$|E

However, they have nonuniformity in their mechanical, physical, chemical, and thermal properties at different portions. For this reason, long jute fiber was cut into three different portions and subsequently characterized using single fiber tensile test, differential scanning calorimetric, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and {{scanning electron microscopy}} according to top, middle, and <b>cutting</b> <b>portions.</b> The crystallinity and moisture content were measured by XRD data and moisture absorption test of the different portions of the raw jute fiber, respectively. The middle portion had better mechanical, thermal, chemical, and crystalline properties {{compared to the other}} two portions of the jute fiber. The diameter gradually became thinner from <b>cutting</b> to top <b>portions.</b> Thus the middle portion of jute fiber would be the better choice while being used as reinforcement in composites...|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: Heat {{pretreatment}} {{can improve}} the cyclic fatigue life of nickel–titanium (NiTi) instruments. This study evaluated the effects of two different heat treatments on the cyclic fatigue resistance and cutting efficiency of ProTaper Universal F 2 files. Materials and methods: The files were divided into three groups: no treatment (control), heat treatment at 400 °C (HT 400) and heat treatment at 600 °C (HT 600). The phase transformation of the files was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. In cyclic fatigue tests, the differences in file performance in four simulated canals among the three groups were assessed. The cutting efficiency was tested at four cutting portions (3  mm, 6  mm, 9  mm, and 12  mm) {{from the tip of}} the file. Results: Differential scanning calorimetry showed a prolonged phase transformation of the files only after 600 °C treatment. At 3  mm <b>cutting</b> <b>portion,</b> 400 °C heat-treated files had significantly better cutting ability than those in the control group. However, the files in the HT 600 group had significantly lower cutting efficiency than those in the other two groups at the four tested positions. In the cyclic fatigue test, fatigue lives of the files after 400 °C and 600 °C treatment were prolonged from 2. 1 to 2. 8 times and from 1. 7 to 5. 5 times, respectively. Conclusion: Although 600 °C treatment increased resistance to cyclic fatigue, it reduced the cutting efficiency of the files. The 400 °C treatment maintained the cutting ability and prolonged the cyclic fatigue life of the files. Therefore, for clinical use of ProTaper Universal F 2 files, 400 °C pretreatment is a better choice than 600 °C pretreatment...|$|E
