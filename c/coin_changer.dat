5000|$|The {{court held}} that the {{circumstances}} of the Mars case—altering a <b>coin</b> <b>changer</b> so that it would operate for UK coinage by altering the software—did not warrant invocation of the non-derogation doctrine. The court brushed aside Teknowkedge's public policy arguments: [...] "I therefore conclude that there is no overwhelming public policy reason entitling those who purchase machines changing coins to use Mars copyright and database rights to convert those machines for new coins." ...|$|E
5000|$|In Mars U.K. Ltd. v. Teknowledge Ltd., the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, {{considered}} the non-derogation doctrine {{in the wake}} of Green Cartridge. Mr. Justice Jacob interpreted Green Cartridge as holding that the British Leyland “spare parts exception applied only where it was plain and obvious that the replacement was analogous to a repair which an ordinary purchaser of an article would assume he could do for himself without infringing the manufacturer’s rights, or that the exercise of monopoly power by means of copyright would be against consumers’ interests." [...] The court held that the circumstances of the Mars case--altering a <b>coin</b> <b>changer</b> to operate for changes made in UK coinage--did not warrant invocation of the non-derogation doctrine.|$|E

50|$|From its {{beginning}} in 1969, PATCO used a magnetic ticket {{as the sole}} means of collecting fares. The plastic tickets may still be bought for single rides through vending machines in the stations. These machines once required <b>coins,</b> so bill <b>changers</b> were placed in stations. Each vending machine was capable of selling two types of tickets, which the rider chose by pushing a button after inserting the correct fare. Several machines were needed in each station, since different types of one-way and two-way tickets needed to be sold. After the ticket was purchased, it was inserted through a turnstile gate. To exit the station, it was inserted again, and if it had rides remaining, returned to the rider. A ticket with no rides was re- encoded by the system and returned {{to use in the}} vending machine. Tickets could also be purchased in ten-trip passes, but these were obtained through mail or in office.|$|R
