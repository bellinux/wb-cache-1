5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> {{abdominal}} pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes).|$|E
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
25|$|Between 2011 and 2012, 8 people <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> {{injuries}} from the ride. 6 people <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> neck injuries and 2 <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> back injuries.|$|R
30|$|Of the 31 {{patients}} who were followed up post-operatively, 20 patients <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> pain only, 8 <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> both pain and sub-fertility, and 3 <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> sub-fertility alone.|$|R
30|$|Their ages {{ranged from}} 17 to 50  years, {{with a mean age}} of 32  years. Of the 36 {{patients}}, 25 patients <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> pain only, 8 <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> both pain and sub-fertility and 3 <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> sub-fertility alone.|$|R
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Richard {{started to}} <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> {{pain in his}} left calf. The {{synthetic}} graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a surgical bypass in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just {{a little over two}} months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493strikeouts and a 3.15ERA in 238games and 1,606innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro Johnson of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
30|$|All 24 {{women in}} the study <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> {{superficial}} dyspareunia; one patient {{was not able to}} resume penetrative sex and another <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> loss of libido.|$|R
30|$|Fifty-eight of 59 {{extremities}} had anterior {{knee pain}} with activities preoperatively. One patient {{did not have}} complaints <b>of</b> pain but <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> severe torsion. One patient (one tibia) <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> a single prior dislocation of the patella. Five patients (seven tibias) <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> multiple prior episodes of patellar dislocation.|$|R
30|$|Of women questioned, 65 (43 %) <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> stress incontinence, 47 (31 %) <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> {{urgency and}} 41 (27.3 %) had both.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Greeks of Thessalonica sent an embassy to the Great Council to <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> {{violations}} {{of their rights}} by the duke and captain. Among other things, they insisted that the Venetians fortify Kassandreia on the western Chalcidice, to protect the Kassandra Peninsula from Ottoman raids. In response, Michiel occupied the fort of Kassandreia, which he refortified and strengthened by the construction of two smaller forts in the area. He also captured the Platamon Castle, {{on the opposite side}} of the Thermaic Gulf, by storm, after setting fire to its main bailey as the Ottoman garrison refused to surrender. Platamon was repaired but probably abandoned soon after, for it is not mentioned again. Following Michiel's request, the Great Council sent 200 men from Padua to man Thessalonica and the forts of Kassandreia, and authorised the captain-general to maintain four galleys in the area. From his letters to the Great Council, Michiel was also engaged in negotiations with the Ottomans, as part of which he offered 20,000 aspers a year to the Ottoman governor of Thessaly, Turahan Bey, and to the Grand Vizier. At the same time, according to the Codex Morosini, a pretender claiming to be Mustafa Çelebi arrived in Thessalonica, and gathered a growing following of Turks who considered him to be the true son of Sultan Bayezid. Pseudo-Mustafa launched raids against Murad's forces from the city, but after both Mustafa and the Venetian captain were almost captured during one of these raids, on 3 September the Great Council issued instructions to stop such raids, and keep the gates of the city shut.|$|E
25|$|Other {{signs of}} ascites {{may be present}} due to its {{underlying}} cause. For instance, in portal hypertension (perhaps due to cirrhosis or fibrosis of the liver) patients may also <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> leg swelling, bruising, gynecomastia, hematemesis, or mental changes due to encephalopathy. Those with ascites due to cancer (peritoneal carcinomatosis) may <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> chronic fatigue or weight loss. Those with ascites due to heart failure may also <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> shortness of breath as well as wheezing and exercise intolerance.|$|E
25|$|Sufferers <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A {{sense of}} paralyzing {{ambiguity}} predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This limbo is the threshold for mental prostration.|$|E
25|$|In {{more recent}} years, Canadian {{officials}} have <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> drug, cigarette, and firearms smuggling from the United States, while U.S. officials have <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> drug smuggling from Canada.|$|R
30|$|In the {{patients}} undergoing vaginal hysterectomy and McCall culdoplasty, four patients also <b>complained</b> <b>of</b> heavy menstrual bleeding.

50|$|The {{programme}} {{reported that}} the archives of Parliament contain letters to Lloyd George, from Winston Churchill <b>complaining</b> <b>of</b> having been offered a bribe of £5,000, and from King George V <b>complaining</b> <b>of</b> the honour having been granted.|$|R
25|$|Many {{patients}} first <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> {{pain that}} may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity {{and may have been}} occurring for some time. Teenagers who are active in sports often <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> pain in the lower femur, or immediately below the knee. If the tumor is large, it can present as overt localised swelling. Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom, because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma. In cases of more deep-seated tumors that are not as close to the skin, such as those originating in the pelvis, localised swelling may not be apparent.|$|E
25|$|Both {{government}} and independent newspapers warned that civil war could {{break out in}} Egypt unless Muslims and Christians close ranks. Newspapers also urged the Egyptian government {{to focus on the}} situation of the Copts, who often <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Mild ascites {{is hard to}} notice, but severe ascites {{leads to}} {{abdominal}} distension. Patients with ascites generally will <b>complain</b> <b>of</b> progressive abdominal heaviness and pressure as well as shortness of breath due to mechanical impingement on the diaphragm.|$|E
