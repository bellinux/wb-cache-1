50|$|There {{is no one}} defined way to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vexel, however, one archetypal way to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> vexel follows. Instead {{of using}} vector-based lines, shapes, and polygons to <b>create</b> <b>an</b> image, a vexel is {{typically}} <b>created</b> using <b>a</b> raster program's support for transparent layers. Each transparent layer is given a solid (or sometimes gradient) shape and a display ordering that when displayed together with other near shape layers appears to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stepped-but-gradual color transition. In some cases, for more realism, gradients are used that remove the stepping in the color transitions to <b>create</b> <b>a</b> smoother, photo-realistic image.|$|R

[...] This question generates a dilemma. The being can either <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stone it cannot lift, or it cannot <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stone it cannot lift. If the being can <b>create</b> <b>a</b> stone that it cannot lift, then it seems that it can cease to be omnipotent.

5|$|Reach {{features}} updated {{versions of}} old weapons, plus new weapons fulfilling various combat roles. In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; hologram, which <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} wear and tear on the wings.|$|E

When a train travels around a box-section track, it <b>creates</b> <b>a</b> distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E
