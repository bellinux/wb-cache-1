Combining with the system status, this paper brings forward constructing a variable frequency water intaking control system with PLC and inverter as the core, and by means of fuzzy PID control. During operation of the system, PLC will get the standard inlet flow required for the <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> through PID operation according {{to the difference between}} the set water level and actual water level of the <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank.</b> Then, PLC will compare the standard inlet flow and actual inlet flow of the <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> output control signals through fuzzy PID operation, control the working frequency of inverter, and then control the rotation rate of water pump, adjust the inlet flow of <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank,</b> and realize stable liquid level of <b>clean</b> <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> in water supply workshop.

Foram inspecionados 38 pulverizadores de arrasto e automotrizes e 45 conjuntos de pontas de pulverização. O levantamento a campo foi realizado em parceria com a DuPont do Brasil S. A. Foram feitas inspeções em componentes e equipamentos determinantes para o controle e a qualidade da pulverização: tacômetro, manômetro, Sistema de Posicionamento Global (GPS), tanque de água limpa e reservatório para lavagem de embalagens e pontas de pulverização. A avaliação da vazão de 12 pontas por conjunto foi realizada com o uso de provetas graduadas. Os resultados indicaram que a frota da região norte do Estado possui menor idade que a frota da região sul, onde o tempo de uso médio calculado foi de 7, 1 anos.

Testing was divided into two sections that were experimental study and simulation study. First, experimental study conducted to test the performance of four different types of tanks and results are recorded. After that, simulation study conducted and data was recorded. The parameters of the study were the effect of depth of water and design of the <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> towards pressure and volume flow rate of the water.

40|$|Abstract Background A 5 -day {{fathead minnow}} (FHM) {{spawning}} assay {{is used by}} industry to monitor pulp mill effluent quality, with some mill effluents capable of completely inhibiting spawning. The purpose of this report is to characterize the effect of an inhibitory effluent on egg and milt production in FHM. Methods Eight tanks were treated with an inhibitory effluent while eight were kept with <b>clean</b> <b>water.</b> Each <b>tank</b> contained two males and four females as per the 5 -day FHM spawning assay used by industry. Females were stripped of ovulated eggs and males of milt in four effluent-exposed and four control tanks. Eggs oviposited in every tank were also counted and checked for fertilization and data analyzed with 2 -way ANOVA. Results We show that female, but not male, fathead minnow reproductive function is impaired in the 5 -day fathead minnow spawning assay used by industry to evaluate pulp mill effluent quality in Canada. Milt production was not changed in the control or exposed males mid-way {{and at the end}} of the five day exposure (p[*]>[*] 0. 05; n[*]=[*] 8). Total egg production (stripped[*]+[*]oviposited) was impaired (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in fathead minnows exposed to effluent (288 eggs/tank, n[*]=[*] 4 tanks) compared to those in control tanks (753 eggs/tank, n[*]=[*] 4 tanks). Conclusions Our results indicate that males are able to detect female signals and prepare appropriately for spawning while in females inhibition of ovulation is occurring somewhere along the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad reproductive axis. These results suggest female-specific neuroendocrine disruption and provide mechanistic insight into an assay used by industry to assess pulp mill effluent quality...|$|R
