40|$|Abstract. Draft CEN (and ISO) {{standards}} for hot-box U value measurements of windows and insulated glazing units require calibration measurements {{to be carried}} out with glazed <b>calibration</b> <b>panels</b> of known thermal conductance. This panel design has been validated by five European partner laboratories (under the leadership of theNational Physical Laboratory,Middlesex,UK) which each made panels to an agreed specification and carried out the calibration procedures specified in prEN 12412 - 1. The panels were then circulated to the other partner laboratories who measured their thermal transmittance, U, values using the CEN procedure. The work demonstrated that the uncertainty of the subsequent U value measurements made by the calibration data were within 7 %. The sensitivity of the CEN measurement procedures to the calculated conductance and temperature measurement accuracy is discussed and some improvements are suggested for the draft standards. The experience gained from the comparison on the <b>calibration</b> <b>panels</b> provides the chance to establish improved measurement as well as calibration procedures. ...|$|R

The new method will include procedures for the following (and other) aspects: " the production of <b>calibration</b> <b>panels</b> " <b>calibration</b> of the hotbox " determination of surface thermal resistance in the hotbox " determination of the thermal resistance of windows. A round robin calibration within the Nordic countries has therefore been arranged, in order to obtain experience and knowledge of the various elements of ISO/DIS 12567. Using common instructions, the laboratories have each manufactured and determined the thermal resistance of two <b>calibration</b> <b>panels,</b> after which the various hotboxes have been calibrated. Two different types of windows were used as the test items: a basic double glazed wooden casement window with a U value of about 2. 5 W/(m²K), and a linked casement triple glazed window having two low emission coated surfaces, with a U value of about 1. 2 W/(m²K). All the participating laboratories were sent one window of each type. Before the windows were sent out, SP measured the U values of all of them, from which it could be ascertained that the differences between nominally identical windows were very small. The laboratories reported that they measured U values in the range 2. 4 2. 7 W/(m²K) for the Type A windows, and 1. 1 1. 2 W/(m²K) for the Type B windows.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} preliminary analyses {{conducted over}} two specific cotton plots shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1. AVIRIS low altitude imagery and experimental cotton plots. October is typically {{the time of}} the year for cotton picking in the SJV. About three weeks prior to picking the irrigation is stopped in preparation for the application of a defoliant agent. Defoliated cotton is more easily harvested. The flight date of 10 October was after irrigation had stopped, but before application of the defoliant agent. In practice, this would be too late in the season to affect any economic benefit. Also, because irrigation was stopped, the onset of water stress affects the data. However, these data provide great scientific value by allowing development and testing of analysis techniques that may be used to map subtle localized conditions across plots of specific crops. 3. Ground Work Throughout the growth season which started in late May 1998, multispectral imagery was collected over the fields using the Shafter Airborne Multispectral Remote Sensing System (SAMRSS) instrument.

40|$|In {{support of}} hyperspectral imaging system design and {{parameter}} trade-off research, an analytical end-to-end model {{to simulate the}} remote sensing system pipeline and to forecast remote sensing system performance has been implemented. It is also being {{made available to the}} remote sensing community through a website. Users are able to forecast hyperspectral imaging system performance by defining an observational scenario along with imaging system parameters. For system modeling, the implemented analytical model includes scene, sensor and target characteristics as well as atmospheric features, background spectral reflectance statistics, sensor specifications and target class reflectance statistics. The sensor model has been extended to include the airborne ProspecTIR instrument. To validate the analytical model, experiments were designed and conducted. The predictive system model has been verified by comparing the forecast results to ones obtained using real world data collected during the RIT SHARE 2012 collection. Results include the use of large <b>calibration</b> <b>panels</b> to show the predicted radiance consistent with the collected data. Grass radiance predicted from ground truth reflectance data also compare well with the real world collected data, and an eigenvector analysis also supports the validity of the predictions. Two examples of subpixel target detection scenario are presented. One is to detect subpixel wood yellow painted planks in an asphalt playground, and the other is to detect subpixel green painted wood planks in grass. To validate our system performance, the detection performance are analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in a comprehensive scenario setting. The predicted ROC result of the yellow planks matches well the ROC derived from collected data. However, the predicted ROC curve of green planks differs from collected data ROC curve. Additional experiments were conducted and analyzed to discuss the possible reasons of the mismatch including scene characterization inaccuracy. Several subpixel target detection parameter trade-off analyses are given, including relative calibration error vs SNR, the relationship among probability of detection, meteorological range, pixel fill factor, relative calibration error and false alarm rate. These trade-off analyses explain the utility of this model for hyperspectral imaging system design and research...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{two types of}} {{processing}} are included in this product. First, the Radiance Scaling operation converts the camera's digital number output to a measure of energy incident on the front optical surface. The measurement is expressed in units called radiance (energy per unit area, wavelength, and solid angle) {{as defined by the}} International Standard (SI). Second, Radiance Conditioning modifies the radiances to remove instrument-dependent effects. Specifically, image sharpening is applied, and focal-plane scattering is removed. Additionally, all radiances are adjusted to remove slight spectral sensitivity differences among the 1504 detector elements of each spectral band and each camera. In addition to the Level 1 B 1 radiometric product for MISR's Global Mode imagery, there is a separate Level 1 B 1 product for each high-resolution Local Mode scene. The Radiometric Product contains spectral radiances for all MISR channels (four spectral bands and nine cameras). Each radiance value represents the incident radiance averaged over the sensor's total band response. Processing includes both radiance scaling and conditioning steps. Radiance scaling converts the Level 1 A data from digital counts to radiances using coefficients derived in combination with the On-Board Calibrator (OBC) and vicarious calibrations. The OBC contains Spectralon <b>calibration</b> <b>panels</b> which are deployed monthly and reflect sunlight into the cameras. The OBC detector standards then measure this reflected light to provide the calibration. Vicarious field campaigns are conducted less frequently but provide an independent methodology useful for reducing systematic errors. Radiance conditioning removes undesirable instrument effects. Image enhancement is provided by deconvolving the scene with the sensor's point-spread-function. Additionally, in-band scaling adjusts the reported radiances to correspond to a nominal band response profile. This frees the Level 2 software from the need to correct for detector element non-uniformities. No out-of-band correction is done for this product, nor are the data geometrically corrected or resampled at this point. In summary, the Level 1 B 1 Product contains the Data Numbers (DNs) radiometrically-scaled to radiances with no geometric resampling.

40|$|Soil organic C (SOC) {{contents}} in arable landscapes {{change as}} a function of management, climate and topography (Johnston et al, 2009). Traditional methods to measure soil C stocks are labour intensive, time consuming and expensive. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} developing low-cost methods for monitoring SOC contents in agricultural soils. Remote sensing methods based on multi-spectral images may help map SOC variation in surface soils. Recently, the costs of both Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and multi-spectral cameras have dropped dramatically, opening up the possibility for more widespread use of these tools for SOC mapping. Long-term field experiments with distinct SOC contents in adjacent plots, provide a very useful resource for systematically testing remote sensing approaches for measuring SOC. This study focusses on the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted (UK). The Broadbalk experiment started in 1843. It is widely acknowledged to be the oldest continuing agronomic field experiment in the world. The initial aim of the experiment was to test the effects of different organic manures and inorganic fertilizers on the yield of winter wheat. The experiment initially contained 18 strips, each about 320 m long and 6 m wide, separated by paths of 1. 5 - 2. 5 m wide. The strips were subsequently divided into ten sections (> 180 plots) to test the effects of other factors (crop rotation, herbicides, pesticides etc.). The different amounts and combinations of mineral fertilisers (N,P,K,Na & Mg) and Farmyard Manure (FYM) applied to these plots for over 160 years has resulted in very different SOC contents in adjacent plots, ranging between 0. 8 % and 3. 5 %. In addition to large inter-plot variability in SOC there is evidence of within-plot trends related to the use of discard areas between plots and movement of soil as a result of ploughing. The objectives of this study are (i) to test whether low-altitude multi-band imagery can be used to accurately predict spatial patterns of SOC at a very high spatial resolution (< 10 cm) (ii) to quantify the uncertainties on the predictions and potential of the method for monitoring SOC changes in experimental plots. This study used multi-band images with wavelengths between 450 - 1000 nm taken at low altitude and at the landscape scale with a Tetracam Mini-MCA 6. Images were taken of plots on section 9 on Broadbalk (continuous wheat) in November 2013 using a UAV-platform (Octocopter) at an altitude of 120 m. The different images obtained were corrected for vignetting, noise and geometric deformation then stitched and georeferenced; the radiance was converted for reflectance with white <b>calibration</b> <b>panels.</b> Also, the vegetation effect (a cover mean of 10 %) was removed by linear spectral unmixing. Finally, the spectra was calibrated and validated with SOC (0 - 5 cm) measurements from 57 soil samples (37 calibration samples and 20 for the validation) taken along transect. The resulting map of SOC contents has a resolution of 10 cm and an associated error of about the same magnitude as that for routine laboratory analyses (i. e. 0. 2 %). The map shows clear differences between plots relating to the different long-term fertilizer and organic manure inputs...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the effects of imager source and panel positioning uncertainties on the accuracy of dual intensity-based 2 D/ 3 D image registration of cranial images. METHODS: An open source 2 D/ 3 D image registration algorithm has been developed for registration of two orthogonal x-rays to a 3 D volumetric image. The initialization files of the algorithm allow for nine degrees of freedom system calibration including x, y, z positions of the source and panel, and three rotational degrees of freedom of the panel about each of the three translational axes. A baseline system calibration was established and a baseline 2 D/ 3 D registration between two orthogonal x-rays and the volumetric image was determined. The calibration file was manipulated to insert errors into each of the nine calibration variables of both imager geometries. Rigid six degrees of freedom registrations were iterated for each panel or source positional error over a range of predetermined calibration errors to {{determine the}} resulting error in the registration versus the baseline registration due to the manipulated error of the <b>panel</b> or source <b>calibration.</b> RESULTS: <b>Panel</b> and source translational errors orthogonal to the imager/panel axis introduced the greatest errors in the registration accuracy (4. 0 mm geometric error results in up to 2. 7 mm registration error). Panel rotation about the imaging direction also resulted in errors of the registration (2. 0 ° geometric error results in up to 1. 7 ° registration error). Differences in magnification and panel tilt and roll, i. e., source and/or panel translation along the imaging direction and panel rotations about the orthogonal axes had minimal effects on the registration accuracy (below 0. 3 mm and 0. 2 ° registration error). CONCLUSIONS: While five of the nine imaging system variables were found to have a considerable effect on 2 D/ 3 D registration accuracy of cranial images, the other four variables showed minimal effects. Vendors typically provide simplified calibration procedures which aim to remove encountered geometric uncertainties by accounting for two panel translations. This study shows that at least the five relevant positional variables should be separately calibrated, if accurate alignment is required for 2 D/ 3 D registratio...|$|R

METHODS: A work group convened by the American Diabetes Association evaluated results for a panel of 39 single donor sera measured by 10 commercial insulin methods from 9 manufactures against an isotope dilution-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (IDMS) measurement procedure calibrated using purified recombinant insulin. We used a candidate primary (pure substance) reference material, pooled serum, and single donor sera to evaluate approaches to achieve improved agreement of results between the routine and reference measurement procedures. RESULTS: Four of 10 methods had >= 95 % of individual serum results within 32 % of the IDMS concentrations. However, the bias vs IDMS was more than 15. 5 % for 7 of 10 methods in 36 %- 100 % of individual samples. A purified recombinant insulin preparation used as a common calibrator did not improve harmonization of results among routine methods but was not used as instructed by all participants.

40|$|Large {{exploratory}} studies, including candidate-gene–association testing, genomewide linkage-disequilibrium scans, and array-expression experiments, {{are becoming}} increasingly common. A serious problem for such studies is that statistical power is compromised {{by the need to}} control the false-positive rate for a large family of tests. Because multiple true associations are anticipated, methods have been proposed that combine evidence from the most significant tests, as a more powerful alternative to individually adjusted tests. The practical application of these methods is currently limited by a reliance on permutation testing to account for the correlated nature of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) –association data. On a genomewide scale, this is both very time-consuming and impractical for repeated explorations with standard marker panels. Here, we alleviate these problems by fitting analytic distributions to the empirical distribution of combined evidence. We fit extreme-value distributions for fixed lengths of combined evidence and a beta distribution for the most significant length. An initial phase of permutation sampling is required to fit these distributions, but it can be completed more quickly than a simple permutation test and need be done only once for each panel of tests, after which the fitted parameters give a reusable <b>calibration</b> of the <b>panel.</b> Our approach is also a more efficient alternative to a standard permutation test. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach and compare its efficiency with that of permutation tests on genomewide SNP data released by the International HapMap Consortium. The estimation of analytic distributions for combined evidence will allow these powerful methods to be applied more widely in large exploratory studies...|$|R
