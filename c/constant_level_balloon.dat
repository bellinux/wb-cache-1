40|$|A {{comparatively}} unbiased set of wind statistics at jet-stream level from Japan eastward to the 180 th meridian may {{be obtained}} from the United States Navy <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> <b>balloon</b> (transosonde) flights launched from Japan in 1957 - 59. Wind speeds so derived are presented as a function of time of year and longitude at pressure surfaces of 300 and 250 mb. At these longitudes and heights the average speed is 103 kt. in fall, 123 kt. in winter, and 101 kt. in spring. A comparison with mean meridional cross sections indicates that at these levels in this area of the northwestern Pacific the mean wind speed heretofore may have been underestimated by an amount exceeding 25 kt. Since the days of World War 11, when United States bombers found themselves practically flying backwards over Japan, meteorologists have realized that the strongest tropospheric winds in the Northern Hemisphere (and perhaps in the world) occur over and to the east of Japan during the winter season [I]. It is not yet certain to what degree this {{is a reflection of the}} thermal wind resulting from large land-sea temperature differences on the eas...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method, based on routine meteorological data, to produce high-resolution wind analyses throughout the {{planetary boundary layer}} (PBL). It is {{a new way to}} interpolate wind measurements. According to this method, high-frequency information from surface wind measurements is extrapolated to greater heights by assuming that the vertical shear of the horizontal wind, that is, the differential vertical wind profile, is horizontally more homogeneous than the wind profile itself. Under this assumption, it is sufficient to combine high-resolution surface wind measurements with low-resolution vertical profiles of differential winds—for which high-resolution measurements usually do not exist—to yield high-resolution wind analyses throughout the PBL. The method can thus be viewed as a diagnostic downscaling of large-scale wind fields. Downscaling works best during daytime within a homogeneous air mass and in flat terrain. A validation against sodar wind measurements demonstrates that downscaling actually improves large-scale wind fields. A comparison of trajectories calculated from large-scale wind fields, from downscaled wind fields, and from wind fields produced by a conventional diagnostic wind field model, with daytime <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> <b>balloon</b> flights, again shows that the downscaled wind fields are most accurate. 1...|$|E

40|$|The EOLE {{experiment}} with 480 <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> <b>balloons</b> {{released in the}} Southern Hemisphere is described. Each balloon floating freely at approximately the 200 mb level, is a precise tracer of the horizontal motion of air masses, the accuracy of which is limited only by the laminated structure of the stratospheric flow, within an RMS uncertainty of 1. 5 m/sec. The balloons were found after 2 months to distribute at random over the whole hemisphere outside the tropics, irrespective of their original launching site. Early results of Eulerian and Lagrangian averages of the EOLE wind data are given for describing the mean 200 mb zonal and meridional circulations. The effect of the small scale eddies of two-dimensional turbulence has been studied {{with respect to the}} relative eddy diffusion of pairs of balloons and the relative dispersion of triangular clusters.

40|$|An {{analysis}} is present. ed of low-level trajectory {{data obtained by}} means of <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> <b>balloon</b> flights from Cape Hatteras, N. C., during September and October 1959. An approximately constant floating level was obtained by flying the nearly constant volume Mylar balloons (tetroons) with an internal superpressure of about 100 mb. The metalized tetroons were positioned at 1 -min. intervals {{by means of a}} manually operated SP- 1 M radar. From knowledge of these positions, overlapping 5 -min. average velocities were determined for flight durations of up to 5 hr. On some of the flights the radar return was enhanced by the addition of a radar reflective mesh to the tetroon. With the addition of this mesh, flights at altitudes of less than 5, 000 ft. were tracked as far as 92 n. mi. from the radar, or approximately to the radar horizon. Spectral analysis of the velocity data obtained from the four best flights shows some evidence for a (Lagrangian) wind speed periodicity of 26 -min. period, a vertical motion periodicity of 13 -min. period, and a cross-stream velocity periodicity of 17 -min. period. Cross spectrum analysis shows that, with the exception of oscillations of 45 -min. period, the wind speed is at a maximum ahead of the trough in the trajectory. Thus, if the large-scale air flow is nearly geostrophic, there is evidence that kinetic energy and momentum are transported down the pressure gradient by these small-scale oscillations. The maximum upward motion of the tetroon tends to take place near the trajector...|$|E
40|$|AbstractÐThis paper validates trajectories {{calculated}} from ECMWF analyses against {{the tracks of}} constant volume balloons (CVBs) released during the European tracer experiment (ETEX). The altitudes of the calculated trajectories were adjusted to the altitudes of the respective balloons in short intervals to allow direct comparisons. The agreement between the calculated trajectories and the balloon tracks was very good for the Þrst experiment (individual errors from 1 to 26 %, average 15 %), and excellent (errors from 2 to 11 %, average 6 %) for the second one. The agreement for the second experiment was probably partly better because the CVBs travelled above the planetary boundary layer, but the small errors also indicate that the ECMWF Þelds of the horizontal wind were of exceptionally good quality in the second experiment. This is {{in sharp contrast to}} the results of the dispersion models which all failed in the prediction of the perßuorocarbon tracer dispersion for the second experiment. A likely explanation for this is that vertical motions, possibly on small scales, were not correctly captured by the ECMWF analyses, but it is not possible to clarify this with the CVB data.

40|$|International audienceThe PYREX {{program is}} a major field study of the {{dynamical}} influence of the Pyrénées mountains (on the border between France and Spain) on the atmospheric circulation. In October and November 1990 {{a large number of}} experimental means had been deployed in the area, including additional sounding systems, automated stations at high elevation sites, wind profilers, sodars, <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> <b>balloons,</b> and four research airplanes. The main focus was on the quantification of the retardation of the cross-mountain flow by the range, but a number of related mesoscale phenomena had been captured, e. g. the formation of lee waves, lee eddies, sheltering areas, and local surface winds. The data interpretation was supported by an extensive effort in meso-scale numerical modelling, and it is argued that only numerical models, conveniently qualified by observations, can document the momentum budget in a consistent way. Improvements in the field of mountain waves and mountain roughness representation in the large-scale atmospheric models are expected from the PYREX results, as well as improvements in the performance of mesoscale models for the operational forecasts. The present paper presents a broad introduction to the experiment. It reviews the experimental set-up and the available data sets. Finally, two more specific topics are discussed in depth, as examples of the available data and modelling strategy: the lee wave event of 15 October 1990 is presented with both experimental and model results.

40|$|A new {{airborne}} backscatter lidar, {{has been}} developed by CNRS (Service d'Aeronomie, (SA) Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique (LMD) and the Institut des Sciences de 1 'Univers) {{in the frame of}} the LEANDRE research program. It has been qualified on board the ARAT in autumn 1989 and spring 1990 and was involved in its first cooperative campaign during PYREX in October and November 1990. During this campaign, lidar observations of the perturbations induced on tropospheric flow and boundary layer structure were performed, and results are presented. A large number of experiments were performed, for synoptic situation description (meteorological radiosoundings, <b>constant</b> <b>level</b> <b>balloons)</b> and local flow analysis (aircrafts, radars, sodars). For the first time in such an experiment, a lidar has been flown on a research aircraft to perform altitude resolved observations of these perturbations, and we will present here results obtained for deflected flow structure. In the presence of a synoptic northerly flow, part of it is deflected to the east by the Pyrenees, and accelerated over the Mediterranean by the mountain surroundings. In this case, a low level wind is generated (the Tramontane) bringing cold and dry air over the Mediterranean Sea. As the sea is still at a warm temperature in November (around 17 degrees), an Internal Marine Boundary Layer rapidly grows over the first tens of kilometers and stabilizes at about 1 km depth, corresponding to an altitude just below the Lifting Condensation Level. The whole Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) is characterized by highly turbulent motions bringing large humid particles from the surface up to its top. The lidar signal due to scattering by these particles is then representative of the turbulent kinetic energy in this layer...|$|R
