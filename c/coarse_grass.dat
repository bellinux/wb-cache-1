5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly {{during the day}} and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet {{consists}} of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. Its nest consists of long <b>coarse</b> <b>grass,</b> twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It {{is one of the first}} birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.|$|E

In former times, men wore grass socks and folded grass insoles inside their water boots; in cold weather sealskin socks were worn. <b>Coarse</b> <b>grass,</b> gathered in October, was used for insoles.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} fell is an upland plateau {{of about}} , {{predominantly}} clad in <b>coarse</b> <b>grass</b> and heather. There are few paths on the fell itself. One track follows the watershed, being marked in places by old iron fenceposts. Bridleways cross the ridge {{to the north and}} south of Ullscarf, providing access from Wythburn, Thirlmere, Stonethwaite and Watendlath. The summit is marked by a large cairn on a small rocky outcrop, the old fenceposts marching past (intermittently) in either direction.|$|E

25|$|The {{landscape}} is rocky moorland with a covering of <b>coarse</b> <b>grass</b> and bracken. Several spinneys of woodland (pine and mixed deciduous) are enclosed by stone walls {{and are not}} accessible to the public. There {{are a number of}} magnificent specimens of ancient oaks several hundreds of years old. The park is home to herds of red deer and fallow deer. Birdlife is profuse – the reservoir attracts many species of wildfowl, as does the river and the spinneys provide secluded nesting areas for many other species, including large colonies of rooks. Species such as yellowhammer, reed bunting, skylark and meadow pipit are a common sight in the open areas of the park. Deadly nightshade is allowed to grow within the ruins of Bradgate House, having been originally established there during World War II by Leicester Polytechnic's School of Pharmacy for medicinal purposes.|$|E

500|$|The feral ponies in both herds {{separate}} {{themselves into}} small bands, with most {{consisting of a}} stallion, several mares and their foals. [...] Ponies on Assateague have a diet that consists mainly of cordgrass, a <b>coarse</b> <b>grass</b> that grows in salt marshes, which makes up around 80 percent of their food. This diet is supplemented by other vegetation such as rose hips, bayberry, greenbriar, American beach grass, seaweed and poison ivy. Chincoteague ponies require up to twice as much water as most horses require due to the saltiness of their diet. The increased amount of water that they drink contributes to many ponies appearing to be bloated or fat.|$|E

500|$|The nest is most {{commonly}} located [...] {{above the ground}} in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches, and is built by the female alone. The outer foundation consists of long <b>coarse</b> <b>grass,</b> twigs, paper, and feathers. This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other soft materials. A new nest is built for each brood, and in northern areas the first clutch is usually placed in an evergreen tree or shrub while later broods are placed in deciduous trees. The American robin does not shy away from nesting close to human habitation and will frequently construct nests under eaves or awnings on human homes when such locations provide adequate shelter. Robins are not cavity nesters, and so will generally not use a bird house, but will take advantage of artificial nesting platforms.|$|E
2500|$|The town's {{name was}} {{recorded}} in about 1091 as Halyfax, from the Old English halh-gefeaxe, meaning [...] "area of <b>coarse</b> <b>grass</b> in the nook of land". [...] This explanation is preferred to derivations from the Old English halig (holy), in hālig feax or [...] "holy hair", proposed by 16th century antiquarians. [...] The incorrect interpretation gave rise to two legends. One concerned a maiden killed by a lustful priest whose advances she spurned. Another held {{that the head of}} John the Baptist was buried here after his execution. The legend is almost certainly medieval rather than ancient, although the town's coat of arms carries an image of the saint. Another explanation is a corruption of the Old English hay and ley a clearing or meadow. This etymology is based on Haley Hill, the nearby hamlet of Healey (another corruption), and the common occurrence of the surnames Hayley/Haley around Halifax. The erroneous derivation from halig has given rise to the demonym Haligonian, which is of recent origin and not in universal use.|$|E
2500|$|From Josiah Gregg's journal, Commerce of the Prairies: [...] "Of all {{the prairie}} animals, {{by far the}} most curious, and by no means the least celebrated, is the little prairie dog. ...The flesh, though often eaten by travelers, is not esteemed savory. It was {{denominated}} the 'barking squirrel', the 'prairie ground-squirrel', etc., by early explorers, with much more apparent propriety than the present established name. Its yelp, which resembles that of the little toy-dog, seems its only canine attribute. It rather appears to occupy a middle ground betwixt the rabbit and squirrel—like the former in feeding and burrowing — like the latter in frisking, flirting, sitting erect, and somewhat so in its barking. The prairie dog has been reckoned by some naturalists a species of the marmot (arctomys ludoviciana); yet it seems to possess scarce any other quality in common with this animal except that of burrowing. ...I have the concurrent testimony of several persons, who have been upon the Prairies in winter, that, like rabbits and squirrels, they issue from their holes every soft day; and therefore lay up no doubt a hoard of 'hay' (as there is rarely anything else {{to be found in the}} vicinity of their towns) for winter's use. A collection of their burrows has been termed by travelers a 'dog town,' which comprises from a dozen or so, to some thousands in the same vicinity; often covering an area of several square miles. They generally locate upon firm dry plains, coated with fine short grass, upon which they feed; for they are no doubt exclusively herbivorous. But even when tall <b>coarse</b> <b>grass</b> surrounds, they seem commonly to destroy this within their 'streets,' which are nearly always found 'paved' with a fine species suited to their palates. They must need but little water, if any at all, as their 'towns' are often, indeed generally, found in the midst of the most arid plains—unless we suppose they dig down to subterranean fountains. At least they evidently burrow remarkably deep. Attempts either to dig or drown them out of their holes have generally proved unsuccessful. Approaching a 'village,' the little dogs may be observed frisking about the 'streets'—passing from dwelling to dwelling apparently on visits—sometimes a few clustered together as though in council—here feeding upon the tender herbage—there cleansing their 'houses,' or brushing the little hillock about the door—yet all quiet. Upon seeing a stranger, however, each streaks it to its home, but is apt to stop at the entrance, and spread the general alarm by a succession of shrill yelps, usually sitting erect. Yet at the report of a gun or the too near approach of the visitor, they dart down and are seen no more till the cause of alarm seems to have disappeared.|$|E

50|$|The nest, {{built by}} the female, is a bulky cup of plant {{material}} hidden in <b>coarse</b> <b>grasses,</b> bamboo or a thickly-foliaged tree 0.7-4.6 m above the ground. The female lays two brown-blotched white or pale blue eggs, which she incubates for 12-14 days.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s {{invasion}} of <b>coarse</b> <b>grasses</b> were managed largely by rabbit grazing. The spread of myxomatosis resulted in rabbit population decline and consequent encroachment of species rich turf by scrub {{species such as}} privet Ligustrum vulgare and heather Calluna vulgaris. Decline in species diversity was exacerbated through the introduction of sea buckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides by the military. This attempt at dune stabilisation was implemented after preparations for the Normandy landings caused widespread erosion. Deep rooted species such as bramble, hawthorn and willow were also able to flourish and resulted in several sallow carr communities These species were maintained and species rich turf later established {{through a combination of}} management techniques.The burning of deep rooted species often made the soil more fertile but led to the spread of <b>coarse</b> <b>grasses.</b> These grasses were later managed by mowing in combination with grazing by soay sheep and cattle.|$|R
