5|$|During Marshall's tenure, the Supreme Court had no general appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> review criminal convictions {{from the state}} courts, but not the lower federal courts, via writs of error. It only did so twice. The <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> hear original habeas petitions, but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post-conviction unless the sentence had already been completed. Thus, {{the majority of the}} Marshall Court's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} on appeal before the Seventh Circuit {{was whether the}} Illinois district <b>court</b> <b>could</b> properly exercise personal jurisdiction over Hemi.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court had other, limited {{sources of}} appellate {{jurisdiction}} in criminal cases. The <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> hear criminal appeals {{from the state}} courts by writ of error, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789. The <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> hear federal criminal appeals by certificate of division, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1802, original habeas petition, as authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and mandamus, as authorized by the same act. Between 1867 and 1868, and after 1885, the Court had jurisdiction to hear writs of error from habeas petitions (a civil action) in the circuit courts. Beginning in 1850, the Court also entertained such appeals from the territorial courts. Attempts to utilize other prerogative writs as sources of jurisdiction were unsuccessful.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} whether English Magistrates' <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> {{serve as}} a model for French lower criminal courts. The article concludes that, if it is not possible to simply transfer this model of criminal courts into the French judiciary, many of the characteristics of the Magistrates' <b>Courts</b> <b>could</b> be easily adapted to the French court system...|$|R
50|$|In addition, the <b>Courts</b> <b>could</b> grant {{possession}} on {{any other}} ground it considered satisfactory.|$|R
50|$|Judges {{of lower}} <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> {{not be subject}} to an Administrative Tribunal of the executive.|$|R
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the <b>court</b> <b>could</b> not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion. However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the <b>court</b> <b>could</b> still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal <b>court</b> <b>could</b> not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. He advised the Republicans to seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question be raised in such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised.|$|E

50|$|In the 1978 case of Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, the Supreme Court, in a 6-2 opinion {{authored}} by Justice William Rehnquist concluded that tribal courts {{do not have}} jurisdiction over non-Indians (the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at that time, Warren Burger, and Justice Thurgood Marshall filed a dissenting opinion). But the case left unanswered some questions, including whether tribal <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> use criminal contempt powers against non-Indians to maintain decorum in the courtroom, or whether tribal <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> subpoena non-Indians.|$|R
5|$|The court {{eventually}} {{declared that}} they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|Two Supreme Court justices had {{previously}} disagreed {{on this question}} while riding circuit. In United States v. Ravara (C.C.D. Pa. 1793), an indictment for sending anonymous and threatening letters to a foreign minister {{with a view to}} extort money, Justice James Wilson argued that the circuit <b>court</b> <b>could</b> be given concurrent jurisdiction; Justice James Iredell argued that it could not; Judge Richard Peters, of the District of Pennsylvania, sided with Wilson, and the case continued.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the <b>court</b> <b>could</b> not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, France {{refused to}} accept the idea that <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> quash {{legislation}} enacted by Parliament (though administrative <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> quash regulations produced by the executive). This goes back to the French revolutionary era: pre-revolutionary courts had often used their power not to register laws and thus prevent their application for political purposes, and had blocked reforms. French courts were then prohibited from making rulings of a general nature. Also, it seemed that if <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> quash legislation after it had been enacted and taken into account by citizens, it would introduce legal uncertainties: how could a citizen plan his or her actions according to what is legal or not if laws could a posteriori be found not to hold? Yet, in the late 20th century, courts, especially administrative courts, began applying the consequences of international treaties, including law of the European Union, as superior to national law.|$|R

5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the <b>court</b> <b>could</b> hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it {{would not be able to}} hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, Musharraf instituted {{emergency}} rule {{for six weeks}} (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007), under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, {{a few days after}} Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari. Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law. Before the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Leaders of the ACLU {{were divided}} on the best tactics to use to promote civil liberties. Felix Frankfurter felt that {{legislation}} was the best long-term solution, because the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> not (andin his opinionshould not) mandate liberal interpretations of the Bill of Rights. But Walter Pollack, Morris Ernst, and other leaders felt that Supreme Court decisions were the best path to guarantee civil liberties. A series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1920s foretold a changing national atmosphere; anti-radical emotions were diminishing, {{and there was a}} growing willingness to protect freedom of speech and assembly via court decisions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> suspend recent {{possession}} orders, could {{suspend the}} execution of an order for possession for up to twelve months and could impose certain conditions and terms.|$|R

25|$|Previously, {{under section}} 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act ("SCA"), when a {{constitutional}} question arose in proceedings before the Subordinate <b>Courts,</b> the <b>Courts</b> <b>could</b> refer {{the question to}} the High Court and, meanwhile, stay the proceedings. However, this {{did not mean that}} the Subordinate <b>Courts</b> <b>could</b> not decide constitutional questions at all. In Johari bin Kanadi v. Public Prosecutor (2008), the High Court held that the Subordinate Courts may decide such questions where the relevant constitutional principles have already been set out by superior courts. Where the principles have not been decided, the question should be referred to the High Court.|$|R
5|$|Music and minstrels {{were very}} popular at Edward's court, but hunting {{appears to have}} been a much less {{important}} activity, and there was little emphasis on chivalric events. Edward was interested in buildings and paintings, but less so in literary works, which were not extensively sponsored at court. There was an extensive use of gold and silver plates, jewels and enamelling at court, which would have been richly decorated. Edward kept a camel as a pet and, as a young man, took a lion with him on campaign to Scotland. The <b>court</b> <b>could</b> be entertained in exotic ways: by an Italian snake-charmer in 1312, and the following year by 54 nude French dancers.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1835, {{tensions}} and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney {{and his three}} sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood with a pen knife and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the United States Supreme Court. At {{the time of the}} conflict it was not established that the Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, again through federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} the {{exercises}} of discretion by the President and the Minister under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA are reviewable by the courts because the subjective test that had been adopted in the 1969 Malaysian case Karam Singh v. Menteri Hal Ehwal Dalam Negeri (Minister of Home Affairs), Malaysia, which had been adopted locally in 1971 in Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, {{could no longer be}} supported and should be replaced by an objective test. Furthermore, although a court would not question the executive's decision as to what national security required, the <b>court</b> <b>could</b> examine whether the executive's decision was indeed based on national security considerations.|$|E
50|$|Vigilance {{committees}} {{were generally}} abandoned when the conditions favoring their creation ceased to exist. In the west, as governmental jurisdiction increased {{to the degree}} that <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> dispense justice, residents abandoned the committees.|$|R
25|$|The {{genesis of}} the court {{can be traced back}} to the middle of the 19th century. Before the {{establishment}} of the High Court, appeals from the state Supreme <b>Courts</b> <b>could</b> be made only to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which involved the great expense of travelling to London. For this reason some politicians in the colonies wanted a new <b>court</b> that <b>could</b> travel between the colonies hearing appeals.|$|R
25|$|Australian <b>courts</b> <b>could</b> permit {{an appeal}} to the Privy Council on {{constitutional}} matters. The right of appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council was only abolished in 1975, and from State courts in 1986.|$|R
5|$|The Fountain Court lies to {{the west}} of the Pitched Stone Court, and is named after a marble {{fountain}} that once stood in the centre of it, featuring a white horse on a black marble base, complete with a flow of running water. The fountain was probably installed somewhat after the initial construction of the court in the 1460s, dating instead to Edward Somerset in the late 16th century; the horse symbolised Edward's prestigious role as Master of the Horse. The Fountain Court was built to provide luxurious accommodation for the family and guests – by the 15th century, it was important to be able to provide private chambers for visitors, and this <b>court</b> <b>could</b> hold up to four distinct groups of visitors in comfort. The Fountain Court as a whole is marked by what Augustus Pugin described as extremely fine, elegant and delicate stonework.|$|E
5|$|The Minister {{had decided}} that the Jehovah's Witnesses' {{doctrine}} prohibiting its adherents from taking part in military service was contrary to national security and, thus, to public order and the public interest. Notably, the Court held that because {{the basis for the}} Minister's conclusion clearly could not be disputed, {{there was no need for}} any hearing or inquiry as no purpose would have been achieved. The appellants had not shown that the Minister had based his conclusions on false or unfounded facts; thus, unless the conclusions were irrelevant, the <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> not interfere with the Minister's opinion since his discretionary power had been exercised within statutory limitations.|$|E
5|$|The court {{eventually}} {{declared that}} they could not issue a writ, because the Habeas Corpus Act 1862 prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional <b>Court</b> <b>could</b> not act. Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien. Three days later, Hastings took the case to the Court of Appeal, who declared that the internment orders were invalid since the Restoration of Order Act was no longer applicable. The Government was forced to introduce a Bill to Parliament giving itself retrospective immunity for having exceeded its authority, and the whole incident was a political and legal triumph for the party and for Hastings personally.|$|E
