40|$|Mandatory {{disclosure}} of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) reporting forces supply chain members to consider CSR issues in developed countries. Researchers have viewed CSR content within different themes, such as human (social), ethical and environmental perspectives. So far, in India, very {{little research has been}} done to study the impact of human issues in employment (social), ethical issues in business operations and pollution (environmental) issues at both regional and speciﬁc sector level. This paper emphasises the perspective view of supplier selection, considering CSR issues as opposed to traditional methods using conventional selection criteria such as cost, quality, delivery and service. It employs six CSR criteria such as discrimination, abuse of human rights, child labour, long working hours, unfair competition and pollution to assess small- and medium-sized suppliers who produce and deliver products to the automotive and textile industry sectors. The results {{of this study indicate that}} to prevent discrimination against pay variation, minimise cases of abuse of human rights and incidence of child labour, suppliers must put in place proper policies and procedures regarding employment <b>contract,</b> <b>identiﬁcation</b> and veriﬁcation records. Furthermore, to reduce unfair competition, suppliers of both automotive and textile sectors may introduce processes for investigating reports of unethical conducts and take severe disciplinary action. The suppliers of both automotive and textile sectors believe that the competitive advantage can be achieved through environmental oriented business practices. However, they differ in their approaches in attaining this objective...|$|E
40|$|The first {{paper of}} {{this thesis uses}} a unique data set to assess the {{determinants}} of inflows and outflows in the fund industry. The higher frequency of the data allows to examine whether recent past performance affects the flow-performance relation. I find that the latter is concave for the worst-performing funds and convex for the best-performing funds. This is {{in stark contrast to}} previous studies in the literature that document a strict convex relationship. The disaggregation by inflows and outflows further indicates that the concavity is mainly due to outflows, which react much quicker to bad performance than previously assumed, whereas the convexity is driven by inflows. Finally, I also compare how the type of client affects the flow- performance relationship. I show that investors deemed less sophisticated care more about short-term performance than other investors, and more about raw returns than risk-adjusted returns. The second paper investigates how funds shift risk as a function of past performance. In contrast to the literature, I manage to disentangle the implicit incentive generated by the flow-performance relationship from the direct incentive generated by the portfolio manager remuneration <b>contract.</b> <b>Identification</b> is only possible because I focus on funds that pay bonus every six months instead of every year. I show not only that contracts have an asymmetric effect on risk, but also that the tournament within the fund family is the main driver of risk shifting. This is consistent with families actively engaging in the tournament by transferring not only performance, as suggested by the literature, but also risk from their worst- to their best-performing funds. The last paper is joint with Pedro A. Saffi and uses a data set of Brazilian hedge funds holdings to examine the impact of long and short positions on performance. In particular, we test if changes in long/short positions and their risk can forecast future performance. While we find that funds with large increases in the risk of long-only positions risk relative to the previous 24 months underperform by about 3...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{organizational}} <b>identification</b> of <b>contract</b> {{workers who are}} associated with two organizations, their primary employer and their client. We conducted a study of contract workers in the information technology industry to address three questions: (1) What are the antecedents of <b>contract</b> workers' <b>identification</b> with the work organizations {{with which they are}} associated? (2) Do these antecedents differentially predict identification with each of the target organizations? and (3) What is the relationship between <b>contract</b> workers' <b>identification</b> with their employing organization and their identification with their client organization? Results indicate that contract workers identify with both the employing and client organizations based on perceived characteristics of the organization as well as social relations within the organization. Perceived characteristics of the organization are more closely related with identification with the employer, and social relations variables are more closely related with identification with the client. Contract workers are more likely to identify with both their client and their employing organization when the two are perceived to be similar on key attributes. © 2005 by Johnson Graduate School, Cornell University...|$|R

A very well known requirement, such as for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items (in which no R&D would be needed {{and there are no}} high risk aspects) would be best acquired using a fixed-price contract, in which a price is fixed and includes the contractor's profit; all risk of cost overrun is transferred to the contractor. A higher risk, more unknown requirement is more suited for cost reimbursement type contracts, in which the contractor is reimbursed for all costs, and is paid a fee above that amount.

Such papers include copies of marriage <b>contracts,</b> <b>identification</b> papers, and financial and religious papers. Some documentation is from members of related families, including the Weinbach, Gump, and Weiskopf families. Some material is available on the Bankhaus Weiskopf. Papers of Gretl Schwabe parents, Jakob and Bella Spanier, contain documentation of Jakob Spanier's civil service and Bella Spanier's reminiscences of Kristallnacht. Many of the notes of books from Series II, which have been removed to the LBI Library, include genealogical notes in Hebrew, such as lists of family members. Some material on Jewish communities where family members resided is also present in this collection. Series I contains some material on the Jewish communities of Krumbach, where the Spaniers lived, and Harburg. Additional material on Krumbach, including articles on anti-Semitism and the events of the Holocaust, will be found among the published material of Series III.

40|$|Borrowing and lending between {{sovereign}} {{parties is}} modeled as intertemporal barter that smoothes {{the consumption of}} a risk-averse party subject to endowment shocks.

40|$|AbstractRisk, as {{a factor}} {{adversely}} affecting the project, is taken into account as early as at {{the first stage of}} the investment process when the tender is won for a contract. The risk level, identified for a particular construction contract, is a serious factor influencing the decision about accepting the contract or not. The key issue is proper <b>identification</b> of <b>contract</b> risk. The risk factors which {{have a significant impact on}} the success of the project, and are most common ones, are then analyzed. The method of verification depends on the company's experience in the construction industry. The task of the article is to present the results of studies focused on separating and determining the frequency of financial risk factors in construction projects and their impact on project implementation. We have analyzed 30 construction projects (office buildings, production halls, educational buildings, demolition works, etc.) completed in north-western Poland. The degree of risk (planned and real) for the contract was set as a percentage in relation to the size of contract (costs in million PLN). The aim of the study was to verify the existence of relationship between the kind of structure, the size of contract, and the scope and degree of risk. Statistical approach has been used.

40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE To {{purpose of}} this study was to {{critically}} examine the impact the violation of the psychological contract has on employee intention to quit, commitment, loyalty, and employee identification with the bank (Mutual Alliance Mortgage Bank, Nigeria). DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The research adapted both a collaborative action research methodology developed by Pellerin (2011) and a quantitative methodology utilising questionnaire. These research methods adapted, were a fit for the financial services industry. The researcher investigated Mutual Alliance Mortgage Bank, Nigeria. Two focus groups with seven employees each were set up. The focus groups acted as the Collaborative Professional Development Meetings (CPDM) to capture feedbacks and reflections as well as to develop actionable outcomes. Questionnaires were sent to all seventy employees of the bank to measure employee identification with organisational and organisational loyalty. FINDINGS The findings indicate that a positive relationship exists between psychological contract violation and loyalty in bank employees and a negative relationship exists between psychological <b>contract</b> violation and <b>identification</b> with the bank in bank employees. Also, interestingly “Promotions” was the most violated item of psychological contracts because employees interpreted and associated “Promotions” with ‘immediate cash (pay) or financial gain. The results also highlighted that a positive relationship exists between intention to quit behaviour and the Nigerian culture in bank employees. The research further illustrates the moderating role of national cultural values (i. e., Nigerian culture – families/communities) on employee views towards an intention to quit behaviours. ACTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE The Bank implemented new culture-specific policies that tackled economic and socio-emotional breaches; these included the establishment of a loss of breadwinner insurance scheme; giving employee’s foodstuffs at Christmas; Christmas parties for employees and families; birthday gifts to spouses of employees and monthly podcast on the bank's activities. On the issue of promotions (“pay”), the banks’ payroll was redesigned to include different salary scales within each grade level to accommodate pay increases without necessarily promoting employees to the next grade level; and the introduction of bi-monthly appraisals of employees that could result in salary increment for performing staff. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS This research utilised data solely from Mutual Alliance Mortgage Bank, Nigeria thus its results cannot be generalised to other sectors or countries characterised by different contexts, cultures, and values. However, the approach utilised in this research can be applied in a wide range of situations consequently enabling the examination of its external validity.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{decentralized}} development approaches have gained {{prominence in the}} agricultural sector. A host of community based watershed management projects have been implemented that encourage community organizations to undertake management of previously government controlled irrigation systems and forests. Community organizations {{have been given the}} responsibility of managing water distribution, collection of irrigation service fees and undertaking routine maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. In this context analysis of irrigation management has argued that groups that are relatively homogeneous may fare better than heterogeneous groups in facilitating collective action. However, this paper argues that analysis of the influence of group heterogeneity on collective action is complicated because of its multi-dimensional nature and the presence on non-monotonic effects in mechanisms linking heterogeneity and collective outcomes. We emphasize therefore, the importance of context specification in analysis of group heterogeneity through a discussion of elements of a joint management <b>contract</b> in Haryana, <b>identification</b> of key variables with a potential to explain collective action in irrigation management and construction of household endowment and water interest scores to account for the influence of group heterogeneity in facilitating collective action.

40|$|The {{business}} case for CSR {{has long been}} debated and researched, with inconsistent results. The impact of CSR on employee behaviour is {{one way in which}} CSR may improve businesses performance. Engendering organisational commitment from employees promises many benefits to businesses, including improved job performance and reduced employee turnover. Affective commitment, an emotional attachment to the organisation, is proposed to be the element of commitment that has the most influence on these positive outcomes, and is underpinned by social <b>identification</b> and social <b>contract.</b> Via the processes of social <b>contract</b> and social <b>identification,</b> employees’ perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR) are expected to increase their affective commitment, either through fulfilling a psychological contract with the organisation, or identifying with their goals and values. This will encourage them to remain a member of the organisation and act to uphold their side of the contract, bringing about the positive outcomes outlined above. This dissertation researches employees’ perceptions of CSR and affective commitment within Midlands Co-operative Society, a UK co-operative business with strong ethical values. The results showed that there was a significant positive relationship between primary stakeholder perception and affective commitment. Involvement in CSR activities was also found to be positively correlated to affective commitment. Recommendations for managers include increasing employee involvement in CSR activities, and improving their perceptions of the organisation’s CSR. These are both aimed at increasing employees’ affective commitment...|$|R

In {{the lack of a}} centralized controller, the design and deployment of coordination and/or regulatory mechanisms is a way to improve system-wide efficiency while preserving the distributed nature of the decision making setting, and facilitating cooperation among institutionally independent decision-makers. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in index-based insurance contracts as mechanisms for sharing hydro-meteorological risk in complex and heterogeneous decision making context (e. g. multiple stakeholders and institutionally independent decision makers). In this study, we explore the potential for index-based insurance contracts to mitigate the conflict in a water system characterized by (political) power asymmetry between hydropower companies upstream and farmers downstream. The Lake Como basin in the Italian Alps is considered as a case study. We generated alternative regulatory mechanisms in the form of minimum release constraints to the hydropower facilities, and designed an insurance contract for hedging against hydropower relative revenue losses. The fundamental step in designing this type of insurance <b>contracts</b> is the <b>identification</b> of a suitable index, which triggers the payouts as well as the payout function, defined by strike level and slope (e. g., euros/index unit). A portfolio of index-based contracts was designed for the case study and evaluated in terms of revenue floor, basis risk and revenue fluctuation around the mean, both with and without insurance. Over the long term, the insurance proved to be capable to keep the minimum revenue above a specified level while providing a greater certainty on the revenue trend. This result shows the possibility to augment farmer's supply with little loss for hydropower companies, thus helping in mitigating the conflict between the stakeholders...|$|R

Several of these pollutants have been linked with the deterioration and blackening of monuments. The paper reports the results of an investigation on the causes of the soiling of cultural remains at important archaeological sites in the provinces of Khuzestan and Fars, in southern Iran, assumed to be an effect of the Persian Gulf oil well fires of 1991. Different analytical techniques were applied to characterize the mineralogical composition of the damage layers, investigate the deposition of atmospheric particles, measure the anion concentrations, and identify and quantify the carbon components. The results showed that the black deposits on the surfaces of the Iranian monuments considered are mainly microbiotic crusts produced by cyanobacterial growth.
