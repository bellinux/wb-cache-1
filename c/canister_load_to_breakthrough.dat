Occupational exposure estimates for typical MPC loading, closure, on-site movement operations, and ISFSI inspections are provided. An off-site dose assessment for a typical ISFSI is also discussed.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) began {{studying}} Yucca Mountain in 1978 {{to determine whether}} it would be suitable for the nation’s first long-tem geologic repository for over 70, 000 metric tons of spent (or used) nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The purpose of the continuing Yucca Mountain study, or project, is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended in 1987 and develop a national disposal site for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste disposal. In 2005, DOE shifted the design of the proposed repository from a concept of unloading spent nuclear fuel from transportation <b>canisters</b> and <b>loading</b> into disposal <b>canisters</b> (which required a great deal of handling radioactive material at the repository site) to a “clean” facility, unveiling the transportation, aging, and disposal (TAD) canister system. The TAD waste system consists of a <b>canister</b> <b>loaded</b> with commercial spent nuclear fuel. This review paper provides a comprehensive review on the status of TAD, technical and licensing requirements, the work that has been done so far, and the challenges and issues that must be addressed before TAD can be successfully implemented. Though the future of the Yucca Mountain project is bleak at this point, the progress that has come in the field of TAD will be one of its lasting legacies...|$|R
40|$|This {{disposition}} of excess plutonium {{is determined by}} the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Environmental Impact Statement (SPD-EIS) being prepared by the Department of Energy. The disposition method (Known as ''can in canister'') combines cans of immobilized plutonium-ceramic disks (pucks) with vitrified high-level waste produced at the SRS Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). This is intended to deter proliferation by making the plutonium unattractive for recovery or theft. The envisioned process remotely installs cans containing plutonium-ceramic pucks into storage magazines. Magazines are then remotely loaded into the DWPF canister through the canister neck with a robotic arm and locked into a storage rack inside the canister, which holds seven magazines. Finally, the canister is processed through DWPF and filled with high-level waste glass, thereby surrounding the product cans. This paper covers magazine and rack development and <b>canister</b> <b>loading</b> concepts...|$|R

500|$|Dr. R. Cecil Gentry {{became the}} {{director}} of Stormfury in 1968. [...] There were no more near-seedings until 1969. In the interim, equipment was improved. What once was the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket <b>canisters</b> <b>loaded</b> with silver iodide, and then gun-like devices mounted {{on the wings of}} the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds. Observation equipment was improved. Additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis. The new theory took cumulus towers outside the eyewall into account. According to the revised theory, by seeding the towers, latent heat would be released. This would trigger the start of new convection, which would then cause a new eyewall. Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart. In addition, since the new eyewall was broader than the old one, the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference.|$|R
50|$|Another new {{development}} in field artillery was {{the introduction of}} rifling. Although rifled guns provided greater range and accuracy, smoothbores were generally more reliable and faster <b>to</b> <b>load.</b> Rifled ammunition was semifixed, so the charge and the projectile had <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> separately. In addition, the <b>canister</b> <b>load</b> of the rifle did not perform {{as well as that}} of the smoothbore. Initially, some smoothbores were rifled on the James pattern, but they soon proved unsatisfactory because the bronze rifling eroded too easily. Therefore, most rifled artillery was either wrought iron or cast iron with a wrought-iron reinforcing band.The most commonly used rifled guns were the 10‑pound Parrott and the Rodman, or 3‑inch ordnance rifle. The Parrott rifle was a cast‑iron piece, easily identified by the wrought‑iron band reinforcing the breech. The 10-pound Parrott was made in two models: model 1861 had a 2.9-inch rifled bore with three lands and grooves and a slight muzzle swell, while model 1863 had a 3‑inch bore and no muzzle swell. The Rodman or ordnance rifle was a long‑tubed, wrought‑iron piece that had a 3‑inch bore with seven lands and grooves. Ordnance rifles were sturdier and considered superior in accuracy and reliability to the 10-pound Parrott.|$|R

40|$|In {{the design}} of a spent nuclear fuel {{disposal}} system, one necessary condition is to show that the configuration remains subcritical at time of emplacement but also during long periods covering up to 1, 000, 000 years. In the context of criticality safety applying burn-up credit, k-eff eigenvalue calculations are affected by nuclear data uncertainty mainly in the burnup calculations simulating reactor operation and in the criticality calculation for the disposal <b>canister</b> <b>loaded</b> with the spent fuel assemblies. The impact of nuclear data uncertainty {{should be included in the}} k-eff value estimation to enforce safety. Estimations of the uncertainty in the discharge compositions from the CASMO 5 burn-up calculation phase are employed in the final MCNP 6 criticality computations for the intact canister configuration; in between, SERPENT 2 is employed to get the spent fuel composition along the decay periods. In this paper, nuclear data uncertainty was propagated by Monte Carlo sampling in the burn-up, decay and criticality calculation phases and representative values for fuel operated in a Swiss PWR plant will be presented as an estimation of its impact...|$|R
