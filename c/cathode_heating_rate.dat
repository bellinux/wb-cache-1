A one-dimensional analysis of acoustic waves is applied to a transversely excited laser. The influences of <b>heating</b> in the <b>cathode</b> fall, <b>heat</b> transfer to the cathode, flow through both the anode and <b>cathode,</b> and bulk <b>heating</b> of the plasma are included. The analysis is used to relate the bulk <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> to observable features of the pressure and density waves. Data obtained from interferograms and reported elsewhere are used to infer the bulk <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> in a pulsed CO laser. Results are presented for CO/Ar, CO/N 2, and N 2 plasmas. Comparison of the data with recent theoretical results for the heating due to electron/ neutral collisions and the anharmonic defect associated with V-V energy transfer shows substantial differences at lower values of total energy deposition. The change of heating with E/N is in fairly good agreement with predicted values...|$|R

Magnetrons are well known and more utilized High Power (HP) Radiofrequency (RF) Vacuum Tube (VT) oscillators. In order to generate high power signals, they employ thermoelectric cathodes which can reach very high temperatures, necessary to produce the enough surface charge density [1].

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{starting}} powder particle size and <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> on spark plasma sintering of Fe-Ni alloys was investigated, with the particle powder size varying from 3 to 70 μm and <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> from 50 to 150 °C/min. The {{effect of the}} starting powder particle size was more obvious when comparing 3 -FeNi and 70 -FeNi at all <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> with the former having better density and hardness than the latter. Sintered densities close to theoretical (≥ 99 %) were achieved for a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 °C/min for the different starting particle size powders, and decreased with increasing <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> The average grain size of alloys sintered at 150 °C/min was ~ 34 % smaller than those sintered at 50 °C/min. The porosity content of the sintered samples increased with increasing heating for the same particle size. The shrinkage rate depends on both <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> and particle size. At a particle size of 3 μm and a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 50 oC/min, three peaks were observed indicative of the phenomena responsible for good densification. As the <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> increases, only two peaks and one peak are observed at <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> of 100 and 150 oC/min, respectively. This suggests that, unlike high <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> the longer processing time at low <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> allows the three phenomena to take place. The hardness measurement revealed a steady decrease with increasing <b>heating</b> <b>rate.</b> At a <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 150 °C/min the particles were well packed but no typical dimple structure of a ductile material was observed.

Although the effect of <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> has been scarcely explored by the scientific community, recent researches have unraveled its important effect on the thermal {{resistance of}} different species of vegetative bacteria.

The aim {{of this research was}} to explore the effect of different <b>heating</b> <b>rates,</b> such as those currently achieved in the heat exchangers used in the food industry, on the heat resistance of Escherichia coli. A pilot plant tubular heat exchanger and a thermoresistometer Mastia were used for this purpose. Results showed that fast <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> had a deep impact on the thermal resistance of E. coli. <b>Heating</b> <b>rates</b> between 20 and 50 ºC/min were achieved in the heat exchanger, which were much slower than those around 20 ºC/s achieved in the thermoresistometer. In all cases, these high <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> led to higher inactivation than expected: in the heat exchanger, for all the experiments performed, when the observed inactivation had reached about seven log cycles, the predictions estimates about 1 log cycle of inactivation; in the thermoresistometer these differences between observed and predicted values were even more than ten times higher, from 4. 07 log cycles observed to 0. 34 predicted at a flow rate of 70 mL/min and a maximum <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> of 14. 7 ºC/s.

40|$|The {{so-called}} micro {{fluidized bed}} reaction analyzer (MFBRA) and a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) were adopted to comparatively investigate the non-isothermal gasification of coal char with CO 2. Experimental results demonstrated that <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> obviously affected the coal char gasification reaction. Raising <b>heating</b> <b>rate</b> evidently increased the temperatures at the initiating reaction (T-i), the maximal reaction rate (T-m) and the finishing reaction (T-f).
