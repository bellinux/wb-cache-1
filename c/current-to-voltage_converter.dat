40|$|A wide {{dynamic range}} and a high {{sensitivity}} are often incompatible {{with each other in}} analog circuits, such as signal converters or amplifiers. In this paper, we present a method of developing <b>current-to-voltage</b> <b>converters</b> featuring both. It comprises two current-to-voltage conversions. One is to convert the DC component, i. e., the average level of the current input, into a voltage with a nonlinear compression. The other is to apply a ?linear? conversion to the signal component of the input current. This conversion is considered to be ?linear? as the gain is made to be almost constant if the varying signal is rippling at a given current level, and to increase if the level is changed to be lower. Hence, the gain is adaptive to the input current, i. e., getting stronger if the current signal is weaker, and vice versa. This adaptability is implemented by (a) an adaptive bias by means of the voltage converted from the DC component of the input current, and (b) the current-dependent finite drain-source resistances of MOS transistors. A low-pass current filter is used, in the proposed conversion operation, to separate the DC component of the input current from the signal one. We propose, in this paper, a basic structure of the filter and techniques to improve the filtering quality over a wide current range, also an approach to an effective reduction of the effect of the device mismatch as well. A design example of the proposed conversion is presented in this paper.

It is not obligatory for them to be linear; the only requirement is their characteristics to be mirrorlike (for example, in the BJT current mirror below, they are logarithmic and exponential). Usually, two identical converters are used but the characteristic of the first one is reversed by applying a negative feedback. Thus a current mirror consists of two cascaded equal converters (the first - reversed and the second - direct).|$|R
50|$|In electronics, a {{transimpedance}} amplifier (TIA) is a <b>current-to-voltage</b> <b>converter,</b> most often implemented using an operational amplifier. The TIA {{can be used}} to amplify the current output of Geiger-Müller tubes, photomultiplier tubes, accelerometers, photo detectors and other types of sensors to a usable voltage. Current-to-voltage converters are used with sensors that have a current response that is more linear than the voltage response. This is the case with photodiodes, where {{it is not uncommon for}} the current response to have better than 1% linearity over a wide range of light input. The {{transimpedance amplifier}} presents a low impedance to the photodiode and isolates it from the output voltage of the operational amplifier. In its simplest form a transimpedance amplifier has just a large-valued feedback resistor, Rf. The gain of the amplifier is set by this resistor and has a value of −Rf (because the amplifier is in an inverting configuration). There are several different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers, each suited to a particular application. The one factor they all have in common is the requirement to convert the low-level current of a sensor to a voltage. The gain, bandwidth, as well as current and voltage offsets, change with different types of sensors, requiring different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers.|$|E

40|$|A {{scanning}} tunneling microscope with a {{focus on}} digital instrumentation has been built. The aim of this project was to allow a digital signal processor full control over all essential microscope variables, especially simultaneous control of the vertical and horizontal tip position. Due to the fact that its operation is controlled by software, this system offers convenient operation and considerable flexibility, allowing different modes of operation, such as topographical and spectroscopic scans. Presently this microscope is the only one in New Zealand that allows the operator full software control over the tip position and bias voltage, thereby allowing it to become a powerful research tool. Atomic scale images on graphite were successfully recorded. The spatial resolution of the microscope was estimated to be 5 pm vertically and 40 pm horizontally. Two different imaging methods were demonstrated on a gold sputtered TEM grating with a scan area that was larger than 4 μm x 4 μm. One method has variable horizontal scan speed, while the other method can possibly be used for nanolithography. Both show the flexibility of this system. Although digital electronics is often perceived as being slower and noisier than analog electronics, in this instrument it did not decrease the data acquisition speed nor did it reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. The bandwidth of the closed-loop controlled microscope is currently about 1 kHz, limited by the bandwidth of the <b>current-to-voltage</b> <b>converter,</b> an analog component.
