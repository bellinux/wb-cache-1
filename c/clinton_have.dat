In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001 to December 2015 (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period. In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported {{that at the end of}} 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, the New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show they have made $109 million in the 8 years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.|$|E

MADD asked ESRB to change the rating of the game from [...] "M" [...] (for ages seventeen and up) to [...] "AO" [...] (for adults only) due to the player's ability to drive under the influence of alcohol.|$|E

2500|$|Barack Obama campaigned {{in favor}} of {{universal}} health coverage as early as January 2007. [...] A year later, Obama was differentiating his health care proposal from that of his main rival, Hillary Clinton, by saying [...] "he and [...] <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> a philosophical disagreement over her proposal to require Americans to purchase health insurance or face a penalty from the government." [...] By July 2008, Obama was saying he would [...] "lower the country's health care costs enough to [...] "bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family" [...] based on investments in electronic medical records, a reduction in administrative costs, and an improvement in prevention programs and management of chronic diseases.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Congressional Democrats {{were divided}} on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq: 147 voted against it (21 in the Senate and 126 in the House) and 110 voted for it (29 in the Senate, 81 in the House). Since then, many {{prominent}} Democrats, such as former Senator John Edwards, have expressed regret about this decision, and have called it a mistake, while others, such as Senator Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> criticized {{the conduct of the}} war but not repudiated their initial vote for it (though Clinton later went on to repudiate her stance during the 2008 primaries). Referring to Iraq, in April 2007 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid declared the war to be [...] "lost" [...] while other Democrats (especially during the 2004 presidential election cycle) accused the president of lying to the public about WMDs in Iraq. Among lawmakers, Democrats are the most vocal opponents of Operation Iraqi Freedom and campaigned on a platform of withdrawal ahead of the 2006 midterm elections.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Garner {{became an}} artist {{ambassador}} for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts. Since 2014, Garner {{has served on}} the board of trustees for Save the Children, the United States branch of the British children's charity, advocating for early education. She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years. In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: [...] "My husband and I have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> {{to make the world a}} better place for everyone." [...] In 2014, she joined the Invest in Us campaign., and in January 2015, she appeared in A Path Appears, a PBS documentary which focuses on rural poverty among children in West Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{divisions}} between Obama and Clinton that many observers had originally predicted, never happened. Indeed, {{a writer for}} The New York Times Magazine declared that [...] "Obama and <b>Clinton</b> <b>have</b> instead led the least discordant national-security team in decades, despite enormous challenges on almost every front." [...] In part, this was because Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. Nevertheless, there were limitations to her influence: Much of {{the handling of the}} Middle East, Iraq, and Iran was done by the White House or Pentagon during her tenure, and on some other issues as well, policy-making was kept inside the White House among Obama's inner circle of advisors. There were also differences of opinion. Clinton failed to persuade Obama to arm and train Syrian rebels in 2012, but overcame initial opposition to gain approval of her visit to Burma in 2011. Clinton's initial idea of having special envoys under her handling key trouble spots fell apart due to various circumstances. Clinton did find bureaucratic success in edging out the U.S. Commerce Department, by having the State Department take a lead role in sales pitches in favor of U.S. companies. In doing so, she helped negotiate international deals for the likes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Westinghouse Electric Company. Clinton believed, more than most prior secretaries, that the commercial aspects of diplomacy and the promotion of international trade were vital to American foreign policy goals.|$|E
