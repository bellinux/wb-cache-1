5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal sprouting, in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> and improving strength. Terminal sprouting may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II muscle fibers to type I muscle fibers.|$|E

2500|$|... "Consideration" [...] {{indicates}} {{the fact that}} all parties to a contract have exchanged something of value. Some common law systems, including Australia, are moving away from the idea of consideration as a requirement. The idea of estoppel or culpa in contrahendo, can be used to create obligations during pre-contractual negotiations. In civil law jurisdictions, consideration is not required for a contract to be binding. In France, an ordinary contract is said to form simply {{on the basis of a}} [...] "meeting of the minds" [...] or a [...] "concurrence of wills". Germany has a special approach to contracts, which ties into property law. Their 'abstraction principle' (Abstraktionsprinzip) means that the personal obligation of contract forms separately from the title of property being conferred. When contracts are invalidated for some reason (e.g. a car buyer is so drunk that he lacks legal <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>contract)</b> the contractual obligation to pay can be invalidated separately from the proprietary title of the car. Unjust enrichment law, rather than contract law, is then used to restore title to the rightful owner.|$|E

2500|$|In {{three main}} situations, English law allows people who lack legal <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> {{to escape from}} {{enforcement}} of agreements and recover property that was conveyed, to reverse unjust enrichment. First, a person may be {{too young to be}} bound by large or onerous contracts. Minors, under 18 years, can bind themselves to contracts for [...] "necessaries" [...] to pay a reasonable price, but only unusual contracts, such as for eleven luxury waistcoats will not be deemed [...] "necessaries". While the adult contracting party is bound, the minor has the option to rescind the contract, so long as one of the four equitable bars (lapse of time, affirmation, third party rights, counter-restitution possible) is not present. Second, people who are mentally incapacitated, for instance because they are sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 or they are completely , are in principle bound to agreements when the other person could not or did not know they lacked mental capacity. But if the other person did know or should have known, then the mentally incapacitated individual may no longer have agreements for non-necessaries enforced upon them. Third, companies can generally bind themselves to any agreement, even though many (particularly older) companies have a limited range of objects that their members (in most companies this means shareholders) have consented that the business is for. Under the Companies Act 2006 sections 39 and 40, if a third party contracting with the company in bad faith takes advantage of a director or officer to procure an agreement, that contract will be wholly void. This is a high threshold, and in practice no longer relevant, particularly since 2006 companies may elect to have unrestricted objects. It is more likely that a contract ceases to be enforceable because, as a matter of the law of agency the third party should have reasonably known that the person contracting lacked authority to enter an agreement. In this situation a contract is voidable at the instance of the company, and could only be enforced against the (probably less solvent) employee.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{creation}} of the flex-fuel technology under the perspective of Economy Transaction Cost (ECT).

We conclude that the automakers had the <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> elaborate <b>contracts</b> mixing hybrid relationships between markets and hierarchies.

The author explains variation in sectoral-level bargaining through {{an analysis of the}} different models of economic development, which are characterized as local entrepreneurialism and global integration for Zhejiang and Guangdong, respectively. Despite having different organizational forms, unions in both places suffer from a lack of credibility and <b>capacity</b> <b>to</b> enforce <b>contracts.</b> Given the ACFTU’s ongoing focus on sectoral-level bargaining, however, experiments will likely continue in various regions and industries throughout China...|$|R

5000|$|Group {{profiles}} {{can also}} be divided {{in terms of their}} distributive character [...] A group profile is distributive when its properties apply equally to all the members of its group: all bachelors are unmarried, or all persons with a specific gene have 80% chance <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> a specific disease. A profile is non-distributive when the profile does not necessarily apply to {{all the members of the}} group: the group of persons with a specific postal code have an average earning capacity of XX, or the category of persons with blue eyes has an average chance of 37% <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> a specific disease. Note that in this case the chance of an individual to have a particular earning <b>capacity</b> or <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> the specific disease will depend on other factors, e.g. sex, age, background of parents, previous health, education. It should be obvious that, apart from tautological profiles like that of bachelors, most group profiles generated by means of computer techniques are non-distributive. This has far-reaching implications for the accuracy of indirect individual profiling based on data matching with non-distributive group profiles. Quite apart from the fact that the application of accurate profiles may be unfair or cause undue stigmatisation, most group profiles will not be accurate.|$|R
