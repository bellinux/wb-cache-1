5000|$|Barry {{served as}} a clerk to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In the 1960s, he was {{associated}} with the left-wing Students for Democratic Society. In 1970, Barry and his father founded the Applied Housing Company. In 1971, Hoboken designated Applied Housing as their exclusive developer of Section 8 housing tasked with rehabilitating deteriorated buildings into affordable housing. Applied focused on renovating the existing housing stock rather than clearance and rebuild; they also believed in careful maintenance and management thereafter to preserve the stock. During the 1970s, Applied built and renovated thousands of units of affordable housing throughout New Jersey with a concentration in Hoboken, North Bergen, and Bayonne. The firm was given a great deal of credit for Hoboken's rebirth. In 1979, his father retired and Joseph Barry became president. He re-focused the company on constructing market-rate and luxury housing with a particular concentration on the Hoboken and Jersey City waterfronts including the $150 million, 1,160-unit Shipyard Development Project on Hoboken's waterfront; the 1,650 unit waterfront condominium <b>community</b> <b>Port</b> Liberté in Jersey City; and the 42-story luxury Palisades rental residence in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In 2001, Barry pleaded guilty to making five cash payments totaling $114,900 to former County Executive Robert Janiszewski to secure state and federal funding for the Shipyard project. Barry resigned from Applied Housing and handed the management of the now $108 million in sales company over to his two sons. Admitting guilt, Barry stated: [...] "I made a terrible mistake. I take responsibility for it, and will get on with my life." [...] Barry was sentenced to 25 months in federal prison, ordered to make $1 million in restitution payments, and fined $20,000. By 2004, Applied was the largest developer in Hoboken.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the development of <b>Community</b> <b>port</b> policy and analyze how and why certain factors have impeded progress in this sector of the EC. This paper will test the hypothesis that there are major economic, technological and political forces, outside of the EC, which are moving Community ports towards regional cooperation.

A new port-related organization to promote and direct this cooperative port effort will be proposed. Geographically this paper will focus on the North Sea port region from Le Havre to Hamburg...|$|E
40|$|Ports play {{a crucial}} role in {{international}} shipping and inland transport sectors as nodes in supply chain systems.. As the world is being transformed into a globalised economy, ports have been incorporated into a huge, changing and competitive system, providing commercially-oriented as well as customer centric services. The concept of &# 039;port generations&# 039; was first introduced in 1994 by UNCTAD (i. e. the third generation port). Since then it has been followed by several well-founded proposals for fourth generation ports. This paper suggests that a &# 039;four port generations&# 039; framework is not enough to reflect the port functions required by the community and the needs of port users in the rapidly evolving globalised economic system. This paper crims to develop a conceptual framework on Fifth Generation Ports characterized by the emergence of world-class customer-centric and <b>community</b> <b>port...</b>|$|E

40|$|Spanish Port Authorities {{currently}} face a {{wide range}} of complexities in their decision-making processes, as they have to satisfy several port management objectives that may conflict with one another. This paper examines these circumstances by using decision theory methodology with multiple objectives, which, through the Promethee method, makes the design of an index possible. This index combines different decision factors that shape the competitiveness of a port to rank the Spanish Port Authorities. This ranking serves {{as an alternative to the}} traditional ranking system by easily providing more information about port traffic. The Promethee method was chosen because it is reliable, the outcomes are easy for decision makers to understand and the parameters can be economically interpreted. To account for any subjectivity in the measures for different criteria, we developed three survey campaigns aimed at the following groups: members of the port <b>community,</b> <b>Port</b> Authority managers and academic researchers.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the effect of cannabis sativa smoking on some hematological characteristics on the male students consumers. Blood samples were collected in triplicates from twenty (10) randomly selected male voluntary marijuana smokers (test) and ten (10) voluntary male non-smokers (control) in Choba <b>Community,</b> <b>Port</b> Harcourt, Rivers State. The parameters considered were body temperature, pulse rate, Red blood cells (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, packed cell volume (PCV), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hemoglobin estimation (Hb). The research study revealed significant (p ≤ 0. 05) differences in the hematological parameters between the smokers (Test) and non-smoker (control) subjects. Faster pulse rate and lower body temperatures were seen among test subjects as compared to control. The values observed for total white blood cell (TWBC), ESR and RBC were lower in test subject (smokers) than the control (non-smokers), while the values observed for ESR, Hb, and RBC were relatively close.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, legislators and {{industry}} players {{have attempted to}} employ technology to restrict the availability to minors of sexually-themed Internet content. Legislative efforts have relied on adult verification and software filtering technology. The constitutionality of such schemes generally depends {{on the level of}} sophistication, efficacy, and deployment of adult verification technology, the burdens that the required use of such technology imposes on content providers and Internet end users, and availability of less restrictive but equally effective alternatives for achieving the government 2 ̆ 7 s interest. In the case of both the CDA and COPA, challengers pointed to the less restrictive alternative of software filters in convincing the Court to strike down these statutes as constitutionally infirm. Recently, an organization called CP 80 has proposed legislation (Internet <b>Community</b> <b>Ports</b> Act) that would require that all Internet content be classified by content providers into one of two categories - Adult/Inappropriate for Minors or Appropriate for Minors. This proposed legislation relies on port-filtering technology to restrict minors 2 ̆ 7 access to the former category of content. Under this proposed scheme, certain Internet ports would be designated as Adult Ports to transmit adult content while others would be designated as <b>Community</b> <b>Ports</b> to be used for all other content. Individual users would then direct their ISPs to provide content to them on all ports or only on <b>Community</b> <b>Ports.</b> In this Article, I scrutinize these attempts to use technology to remedy the problem of minors 2 ̆ 7 access to harmful Internet content, focusing on the relationship between the efficacy of the technology and the constitutionality of the legislation at issue. The more effective software filtering becomes in restricting minors 2 ̆ 7 access to harmful content, the less likely the courts will uphold other legislative means. I then analyze the foundational First Amendment jurisprudence regarding the regulation of minors 2 ̆ 7 access to sexually-themed content. Next, I examine the fate of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s recent efforts to regulate in this area, with particular emphasis on the current status of COPA. Finally, I analyze the constitutionality of the proposed Internet <b>Community</b> <b>Ports</b> Act in light of the scrutiny courts have imposed upon prior legislative efforts and the burdens the Act would impose on content providers and Internet users...|$|R
