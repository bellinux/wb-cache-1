40|$|A {{consolidation}} {{system is}} a type of an accounting information system that aims to facilitate <b>the</b> consolidation process <b>of</b> organisations that are comprised of a collection of entities, but that are required to produce one set of consolidated financial statements. Contingency theory postulates that organisational sub-systems should be designed in accordance with the contextual variables and that performance will result if a match is achieved between these contextual variables and <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems.</b> <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this research is to explain variations in <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consolidation system <b>of</b> listed companies in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships between a contingency variable and <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consolidation system. The contingency variable that was used by this research is <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> company decentralisation, while <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consolidation system are integration; formalisation; and sophistication. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consolidation system has been measured by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> accountant days that are required to complete the consolidation at the financial year-end. The quantitative data was collected by means of self-completion questionnaires. Four hypotheses were assessed by means of Pearson correlation coefficients and a research model was evaluated by means of a structural equation model. The qualitative data collected by means of semi-structured interviews provided a more in-depth view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manner in which consolidation systems are used at an organisational level. It was shown that organisational decentralisation is positively related to consolidation system integration, sophistication and formalisation. It is contended that <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> this research provide some support for contingency theory‘s central tenet of no universally appropriate consolidation system. The structural equation model that was developed fits the quantitative data very well, but the results were not entirely consistent with theoretical expectations, with only the system integration shown to influence the resources that are required to complete the year-end consolidation. This research extended contingency theory to this relatively new type of system and provided practitioners with evidence regarding <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> consolidation system that is appropriate to different organisations.

40|$|Currently, {{individual}} employees face serious {{challenges to}} its occupational {{health and safety}} due to <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> flexible work arrangements often labelled as precarious employment. Human organizations themselves face two major challenges: need for management improvement and demands accomplishment posed by the global emergence where issues like competition and environmental/social awareness are of utmost importance. Several organisational standards have been implemented and certified in order to fulfil these new requirements being the most reported ones ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OH&SAS 18001 standards. Occupational health and safety management system (OH&SMS) implementation and certification is, in our days, a consolidated reality among organizations due to the fact, that the previously existing management sub-systems were unable to cover all environmental and health and safety problems. Organizations found themselves implementing and certifying management <b>sub-systems.</b> <b>The</b> most common option is to integrate <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems</b> into a single management system. According to several authors, <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> a company should be consistent. Hence, managing through several management sub-systems do not seems a good management practice. Several authors emphasise <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> quality management system (QMS) in the integration process, assuming <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> OH&SMS and environmental management system (EMS) into a holistic quality management approach. Reported studies concerning the role that EMS and OH&SMS could play in this process are scarce. Management systems integration has been looked as the answer to sustainable development, corporate social responsibility and risk management challenges posed by society demands evolution. These concepts are embedded on environmental and OH&S referentials. Risk assessment and, in a broader sense, risk management have been reported as a viable approach to the integration process, putting OH&SMS as <b>the</b> “pivot” <b>sub-system</b> due to its intrinsically relation with risk concept. Several authors mentioned another common <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems</b> standards: preventive actions are more efficient than corrective actions.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is to demonstrate an integrated system design optimization approach for space system networks.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 This report investigates <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> wood to fuel a trimburner {{incorporated}} in a combined-cycle, biomass-fired power plant. The term "trimburner" applies to a ductburner {{which is designed}} to boost <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air stream entering the gas turbine. The work presented here {{is part of a larger}} biomass energy project at Oregon State University. Wood conversion processes capable of producing a clean synthetic fuel were investigated since direct wood combustion products are too "dirty" to be allowed to pass through <b>the</b> turbine blading. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> three wood conversion processes considered (pyrolysis, gasification, methanol production), gasification was selected as the most applicable process for the trimburner concept. Three wood-fueled trimburner systems were then developed employing an up-draft gasifier design. These sub-systems, designated A, B, and C, differ in the way the producer gas formed in the gasifier was compressed to the trimburner operating pressure. <b>Sub-system</b> A compresses <b>the</b> producer gas after the gasifier, thus simulating <b>the</b> operation <b>of</b> an atmospheric gasifier. Sub-systems B and C compress the inlet air entering the gasifier and, therefore, simulate a pressurized gasifer system. Subsystem B accomplishes the inlet air compression via a separate compressor whereas sub-system C bleeds some compressed air from the power plant's main compressor. <b>The</b> simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems</b> allowed for comparision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designs in terms of parameters such as efficiency and gas composition. In addition, <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> changing system variables such as wood moisture content and gasifier air/fuel equivalence ratio on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems</b> and <b>the</b> overall system were evaluated. It was determined that the most efficient operation <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> trimburner <b>sub-systems</b> occurred at <b>the</b> lowest allowable operating gasifier equivalence ratio. Also, increasing the wood moisture content decreased <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems.</b> In general, sub-system C exhibited superior subsystem efficiency values by about 2 percentage points over <b>the</b> entire range <b>of</b> equivalence ratios and moisture contents. Also, results for the entire plant indicate that sub-system C again maintains superiority in efficiency by about. 5 percentage points. However, results from <b>the</b> simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sub-systems</b> indicate a basic difference in the producer gas formed from pressurized and non-pressurized gasifiers. <b>The</b> atmospheric gasifier <b>of</b> <b>sub-system</b> A produces a gas higher in combustible gases but lower in temperature as compared to that from <b>the</b> pressurized gasifiers <b>of</b> <b>sub-systems</b> B and C. This indicates that sub-system C (and B) will be much more sensitive to the heat exchanger process used to recover the sensible energy in the dirty producer gas stream than sub-system A. Based on <b>the</b> apparent superiority <b>of</b> <b>sub-system</b> C, a simple economic analysis between this sub-system and a conventional oil-fired trimburner was conducted. Results of this analysis indicated that the oil-fired trimburner would yield a more attractive payback period than <b>the</b> wood-fueled <b>sub-system</b> C trimburner. <b>The</b> payback periods for the oil-fired and wood-fired trimburner systems were estimated at approximately one year and four years respectively...|$|R
