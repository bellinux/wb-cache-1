50|$|In 1997, Caterpillar {{decided to}} begin {{development}} of a 360 ST payload capacity haul truck {{to meet the demand}} from large-scale mine operators wanting to reduce operating costs at mines using 80 to 90 short tons (73 to 82 t) per pass shovels. Engineers at Caterpillar's Mining & Construction Equipment Division in Decatur, Illinois, created a new design for the 797 using computer-aided design technology. This was the first time CAD tools had been used extensively to design a <b>Caterpillar</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Snow {{grooming}} is {{the process}} of manipulating snow for recreational uses with a tractor, snowmobile, piste <b>caterpillar,</b> <b>truck</b> or snowcat towing specialized equipment. The process is used to maintain ski hills, cross country ski trails and snowmobile trails by grooming (moving, flattening, rototilling, or compacting) the snow on them. A snow groomer is usually employed to pack snow and improve skiing and snowboarding and snowmobile trail conditions. The resulting pattern on the snow is known as corduroy, and is widely regarded as a good surface on which to ski or ride. Snow groomers can also move accumulated snow made by snow machines as part of a process, called [...] "snow farming".|$|E

50|$|After {{production}} ceased in 1990 recultivation work began. The mine dumps {{were the}} largest task in this mining area. It {{was decided to}} relocate most of the dump material of the southern mining divisions (Schmirchau, Reust, Paitzdorf, Lichtenberg) into the open pit Lichtenberg and to relocate those of the Korbußen mine (part of the Beerwalde mining division) and Drosen to the major dump at Beerwalde. To accomplish this task, Wismut GmbH ordered and operated the largest fleet of <b>Caterpillar</b> mine <b>trucks</b> in Europe. After relocation was finished, the dumps were covered.

5000|$|Construction of San Luis Dam {{lasted from}} 1963 to early 1968. The dam was {{constructed}} in several zones with quarried local earth and rock averaging as much as [...] per day. The 100-ton <b>Caterpillar</b> dump <b>trucks</b> used during construction were, at the time, {{the largest in the}} US. The construction of the four water intake towers, each 284 ft high, involved the first use of tower cranes in the US. The work force peaked at 2,304 in October 1965 and declined thereafter; in January 1968, with construction almost completed, the first water was delivered through the California Aqueduct to begin filling the giant reservoir. The dam was officially dedicated on April 20, 1968 by Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall. However, it was not until May 31, 1969 when San Luis Reservoir filled for the first time.|$|R
25|$|The No. 24 truck {{entered as}} a {{research}} and development entry for BDR in 2005.

50|$|Batu Hijau is an open-pit mine. Ore {{is removed}} from the mining face using P&H 4100 {{electric}} shovels (pictured) and loaded into <b>Caterpillar</b> 793C haul <b>trucks.</b> Each haul truck can move a payload 220 t of ore. The trucks haul ore from the shovel to primary crushers. Crushed ore is sent by a conveyor 1.8 m wide and 6.8 km long to the mill. Daily production from the mine is an average of 600000 t ore and waste combined. Ore from the mine has an average copper grade of 0.49% and an average gold grade of 0.39g/t.|$|R

Leader was notable for being the first manufacturer to fit <b>Caterpillar</b> engines to <b>trucks,</b> to fit automatic transmissions to diesel trucks in assembly, and the first truck manufacturer in Australia to offer disc brakes. Leader boasted its components to be 80 percent Australian built with only the engine, transmission and steering box imported. By 1980, Leader had sold its 1000th truck in Australia and had also sold trucks to New Zealand, South Africa, Hong Kong, China and Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|The ore zone at the Kittilä mine (mined by {{what are}} known as the Suuri and Roura pits) is {{approximately}} 4.5 km long, 3.3 km wide, 1.1 km deep. Drilling is done using both Sandvik and Atlas Copco drill rigs, with ore being loaded into <b>Caterpillar</b> 777 dump <b>trucks</b> (pictured) by <b>Caterpillar</b> 385 hydraulic excavators. Mining in the pits is expected to last for up to five years. Proceeds from the pits are being used to finance the underground mining operation. The pit produces 65000 t of material per month, removing eight tons of waste per ton of ore. Provided they are able to acquire larger trucks, Agnico will increase their monthly tonnage to 100000 t.|$|R
50|$|NZG {{specializes in}} a wide variety of heavy {{equipment}} types ranging from hand pallet movers, forklifts, scissors lifts, reach stackers, power generators and skidsteers to front loaders, shovels, excavators, graders, and mammoth ore carrying dump <b>trucks.</b> <b>Caterpillar</b> and other engines and machinery are sometimes also made and displayed free-standing. Some offerings, like pavement profilers, road finishers, asphalt strippers, road rollers, pipelayers, large cranes and drill rigs have also been offered, and NZG seems to have the market corner in promoting many models for a variety of manufacturers (Toy Fair 2011). Considering the variety of commercial model vehicles and equipment, one sees that details are intricate and sometimes delicate. To call NZG models 'toys' is too simple - they are precise replicas of the real thing - and quite sophisticated.|$|R
40|$|Off-highway tire costs {{represent}} {{a significant portion}} of the total mining costs in openpit, truck-shovel operations. To extend the lives of tires, the site-specific factors influencing tire life should be investigated. Valuable data can be obtained by combining historical operational data captured by a mine dispatch system with detailed tire and maintenance histories. Assuming that failure counts satisfy a Poisson distribution, F-tests can be applied to determine significant deviations from desired or target counts. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to identify the haul routes and loading and dumping zones that have significantly higher incidences of tire failure. Corrective action can then be targeted at these zones by modifying the shovel or truck operator practices; changing the haul route maintenance and clean up practices; or altering the bench, ramp or waste dump design parameters. An example is given of the correlation of tire separation and tire impact failures with haul routes for a fleet of nine <b>Caterpillar</b> 793 C <b>trucks</b> in operation at the Chuquicamata Mine in northern Chile. A high incidence of impact failures was observed for the 2 ̆ 7 ex-pit ore crusher and for tires installed in the left outer rear position on the trucks. The latter was postulated to be due to a preference for drivers to execute right-hand turns prior to dumping. Recommendations were made to revise crusher and dump cleanup practices and investigate the feasibility of super-elevating the surface of dumping zones to reduce ground pressure on the left rear tires...|$|R
40|$|Accelerometers and {{pressure}} transducers, mounted in suspension components, {{can be used}} to monitor the ride of haulage trucks. Presently, it is difficult to tell what caused a jolt to the truck using either pressure or acceleration data alone. When information from a global positioning system (GPS) is recorded {{at the same time as}} shock pressures or acceleration data, the exact location of an event can be determined. Mine management can then determine what caused the jolt to the truck. This research is part of a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) project called "Engineering controls for reduction of jolting/jarring injuries in surface mines. " NIOSH is investigating how the work environment of haulage truck drivers can be improved. The US Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) notes that, between 1986 and 1995, 60 % of the back injuries were to haulage truck drivers in metal/nonmetal surface mining. Personnel from Phelps Dodge suggested that combining acceleration data with information obtained from a GPS could generate results with a variety of uses. Therefore, researchers at the Spokane Research Laboratory (SRL) began investigating how to tie acceleration and GPS data together. It was originally thought that this tool would be used primarily for road and truck maintenance. However, as research progressed, it became apparent that it would also be useful in providing feedback about equipment operations and identifying unusual causes of jolting. Experimental approach Available components that function well by themselves were linked for the purpose of proof of concept. Using a Modular Mining Systems (MMS) product called Vital Signs, SRL researchers took an Aero-Marine Products (AMP) acceleration recorder and hardwired it to MMS Dispatch equipment already installed on a truck. AMP is one of several manufacturers of acceleration recorders frequently used to monitor freight during shipping. MMS Dispatch is used for production accounting and truck dispatching and uses GPS tracking. Through Vital Signs, an analog or digital alarm signal can be recorded. Steve Rhoades, of MMS, wrote unique code that links the Vitals Signs data and GPS location and stores this data in an ASCII log file. SRL researchers installed the equipment in a <b>Caterpillar</b> 793 haul <b>truck.</b> The result was a working prototype. Figures 1 and 2 show the instrument installation in the truck. Discussion From 8 : 30 pm on Sept. 14, 1998 until 6 : 50 am on Sept. 15 1998, 899 jolts above a threshold of 2 g (1 g is the acceleration of gravity. It is either 9. 81 m/s 2 or 32. 17 ft/ s 2.) were measured on the test truck. Some sections of the haulage road produced most of the events, whil...|$|R
