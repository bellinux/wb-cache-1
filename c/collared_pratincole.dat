50|$|Although {{the dark}} underwing {{and lack of}} a white {{trailing}} edge to the wing are diagnostic, these features are not always readily seen in the field, especially as the chestnut underwing of the <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole</b> appears black unless excellent views are obtained.|$|E
50|$|The park {{accommodates}} 327 different species. Great spotted cuckoo, spoonbill, nightingale, <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole</b> and stone-curlew {{are among}} its many birds. The park offers seven hides and one tower for bird watchers. They are connected through a plain dirt track which allows wheelchairs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole</b> is a bird of open country, and {{is often}} seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects. It {{is found in the}} warmer parts of Europe, {{southwest}} Asia and Africa. It is migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, and is rare north of the breeding range.|$|E
50|$|Many short-legged {{shorebirds}} {{are also}} {{seen in a}} narrow band along the shifting shores {{of the lake and}} islands. These include plovers, the <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole,</b> ruff, dunlin, snipes and sandpipers. Larks, wagtails and lapwings are also found on the mudflats. Feeding in deeper water are the longer-legged avocets, stilts and godwits.|$|E
50|$|African skimmers nest {{in loose}} colonies on large sandbanks. The colonies {{typically}} consist {{of less than}} 50 pairs and each pair lays 2-3 (rarely 4) eggs in a scrape in the sand.

5000|$|The <b>collared</b> <b>{{pratincole}}</b> or common pratincole (Glareola pratincola) is a wader in the pratincole family, Glareolidae. The genus name is {{a diminutive}} of Latin glarea, [...] "gravel", referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name pratincola means an inhabitant of meadows, from Latin pratum, prati, [...] "meadow" [...] and incola, [...] "inhabitant", from incolere, [...] "to inhabit".|$|E
50|$|Animals {{found in}} the region include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, the golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, the red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, long-eared hedgehog, onager, mangar and the Euphrates {{softshell}} turtle. Birds include, the hooded crow, common starling,Eurasian magpie,European robin, water pipit, spotted flycatcher, namaqua dove, saker falcon, griffon vulture, little crake and <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole,</b> among others.|$|E

5000|$|Thanedar Wala is a {{game reserve}} and wetland Ramsar site, located 15 km east of Lakki, Lakki Marwat District (formerly in Bannu District), North-West Frontier Province, Pakistan. Most of the area {{consists}} of a complex of braided river channels and sandy or muddy islands up to 4 km wide. The site covers 4047 ha. It supports wintering great egret, ruddy shelduck, common teal, mallard, northern shoveller, common pochard and ferruginous duck. <b>Collared</b> <b>pratincole</b> and little tern breed on the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Kramer {{studied in}} Vienna (Austria) then practiced {{medicine}} in Bruck, {{close to the}} capital, for at least fourteen years. He published in 1756 a work entitled Elenchus Vegetabilium and Animalium per Austriam inferiorem Observatorum, a flora and fauna of Lower Austria noted especially because {{it was one of}} the first works to adopt the binomial nomenclature of Carl von Linné (1707-1778). In this book, Kramer created the name pratincola for the <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole</b> which was adapted in English in the following work of Thomas Pennant (1726-1798) in 1773. It is probably for him that Giovanni Antonio Scopoli (1723-1788) dedicated Psittacus krameri (today Psittacula krameri) in 1769. He is also known as an entomologist.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds have}} short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails. They have short bills, {{which is an}} {{adaptation}} to aerial feeding. The back and head are brown, and the wings are brown with black flight feathers. The belly is white. The underwings are chestnut.Very good views are needed to distinguish this species from other pratincoles, such as the very similar <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole,</b> which also has a chestnut underwing, and black-winged pratincole which shares the black upperwing flight feathers and lack of a white trailing edge to the wing. These features are not always readily seen in the field, especially as the chestnut underwing appears black unless excellent views are obtained.|$|E
50|$|Other British Birds rarities {{that have}} been sighted (single records unless {{otherwise}} indicated) are: Little bittern, glossy ibis, gyrfalcon (3 records), little and Baillon's crakes, <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole,</b> semipalmated (5 records), least (2 records), white-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's phalarope, laughing gull, bridled tern, Pallas's sandgrouse, great spotted, black-billed and yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European roller, olive-backed pipit, citrine wagtail, Alpine accentor, thrush nightingale, red-flanked bluetail, black-eared (2 records) and desert wheatears, White's, Swainson's (3 records), and grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and lesser grey shrikes, red-eyed vireo (7 records), two-barred crossbill, yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers, yellow-breasted (2 records) and black-headed (3 records) buntings, rose-breasted grosbeak (2 records), bobolink and Baltimore oriole (2 records).|$|E
50|$|Various aquatic species {{exist in}} the lagoons such as eels, grey mullet, fresh water shrimp and above all the Spanish toothcarp which is endemic to the Spanish Mediterranean region. But without any doubt the parks best known feature is the bird life. The most notable of the many species present in the park are the marbled duck and the white-headed duck with the park {{containing}} two of the largest worldwide populations. A large number of herons are present during the breeding season particularly the purple heron, the night heron and the squacco heron. It is also possible to find other species such as the avocet, the black-winged stilt, the <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole,</b> the crested coot, the European penduline tit and the moustached warbler. Birds of prey include osprey, marsh harrier and (in winter) greater spotted eagle. An Estonia-born greater spotted eagle wearing a transmitter has been hibernating {{in the park and}} its surroundings each winter since 2008/2009.|$|E
40|$|The <b>collared</b> <b>pratincole</b> Glareola pratincola is {{a declining}} wader species, but most aspects of its biology are poorly known. In this study, an attempt {{is made to}} {{characterize}} the basic behavioural repertoire of the species, searching for differences between sexes. Focal observations {{of the most common}} activities were obtained in a breeding colony in southwestern Spain. Pratincoles did not equally distribute their time among types of activity, but spent more time in alert behaviour than feeding and moving, and more time preening than moving in the colony site. Males devoted more time to vigilance for predators than females, and both sexes increased the time spent resting and decreased the time for vigilance as the breeding season progressed. These sex-related and seasonal effects on the vigilance behaviour suggest that competition for females and ambient temperature influence the daily activity pattern of collared pratincoles during breeding.

40|$|The <b>Collared</b> <b>Pratincole</b> (Glareola pratincola), {{which was}} once a typical {{breeding}} species of the sodic grasslands of the Great Plain, has become threatened with extinction from Hungary. It disappeared from the traditional grassland breeding sites before the 2000 and is currently breeding only in three sites in agricultural environments in Hungary. The objectives of our research were to find links {{between the use of}} shallow wetlands and the breeding behaviour of the species and to identify the characteristics of its breeding on ploughed fields. Data were collected between 2008 and 2016 as part of preparations for the conservation of the largest population which is found in the Nagykunság. We found a positive correlation between colony size and the area of the nearby wetland. We calculated the proportion of habitat-types used for nesting, and found that cultivated fields and fallow lands were the most important. Additionally, we also found that colony sizes were substantially smaller during the research period than those found earlier in the traditional grassland habitats. Finally, we found a positive trend {{in the size of the}} population during the research period...|$|E
