25|$|Planet Hollywood's {{architecture}} <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> {{as having}} a 'Hollywood hip' theme. It eschews the popular Art-Deco glamour of similarly imaged venues for a sleeker look that features plenty of glass, neon and reflective surfaces.|$|E

The period between 1989 and 1997 <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> {{as one of}} continuous refinement. Anti-lock brakes, GM's Quad-4 engine, airbags and composite materials all became standard on Pontiacs during this time.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} literary influence upon Kafka was Flaubert's. Flaubert who loathed pretty-pretty prose {{would have}} applauded Kafka's attitude towards his tool. Kafka liked to draw his terms from {{the language of}} law and science, giving them a kind of ironic precision, with no intrusion of the author's private sentiments; this was exactly Flaubert's method through which he achieved a singular poetic effect. The legacy of his work habits <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described,</b> therefore, as paving the way towards a slower and more introspective manner of writing.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hayakawa's {{on-screen}} roles <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as {{the honorable}} villain, a figure exemplified by {{his portrayal of}} Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Hayakawa earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor; he was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the role. After that film, Hayakawa largely retired from acting. Throughout the following years he performed guest appearances {{on a handful of}} television shows and films, making his final performance in the animated film The Daydreamer (1966).|$|E
25|$|Lima's {{climate is}} largely {{reflective}} of the variant climate of Ohio. The region's climate <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as a humid continental climate, according to the Koppen Climate Maps. The city lies roughly halfway between Toledo and Dayton, Ohio and weather is at a similar medium. Summers are hot and humid and winters are generally cool to cold, with moderate precipitation year-round. Due to the city's inland location the moderating effects of Lake Erie are diminished, causing the city to experience higher averages {{in the summer and}} colder plunges in the winter than Toledo. On average the city sees around 4 more inches of snow annually than Dayton. During the summer months, Lima is prone to smog and allergens lingering when heat indexes exceed 85°F.|$|E

500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as the NBA's new star-centered focus. [...] Falk's {{idea was}} that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan, Jordan himself should get {{a large proportion of}} the benefit."Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport", Falk is saying. [...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's what I believe as an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, {{and all other}} therapies <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as bridges to transplantation. [...] While liver transplantation {{is by far the}} best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS {{has been shown to be}} as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. [...] Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. [...] A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function. [...] Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.|$|E
500|$|The {{external}} appearance of Holkham <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> {{as a huge}} Roman palace. However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the {{external appearance}} is austere and devoid of ornamentation. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded [...] "commodiousness", which {{can be interpreted as}} comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a mezzanine would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a blind window, such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the facade. On the ground floor, the rusticated walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, Nigel Nicolson, has described the house as appearing as functional as a Prussian riding school.|$|E

This format can be summarized as a reviving industry coming together with advanced computer technology and low cost labor.|$|E
40|$|Empirical evidences {{from the}} extant {{literature}} reveals that if public tertiary institutions are {{to survive and}} achieve long-run viability in this contemporary era, they must be effective. Management argued that internal organizational competencies are safer in creating organizational competitive advantages. One of the internal organizational competencies is organizational innovativeness (ability of organizations to innovate). Organizational innovativeness has been penciled as an important tool for improving the effectiveness of tertiary institutions. The current business environment that tertiary institutions <b>are</b> <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>describe</b> as dynamic, turbulent as well as unpredictable. Their success largely depends {{on their ability to}} strategically innovate and timely respond to the rapidly changing environment. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the correlations between organizational innovativeness and effectiveness of public tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Thus, the paper looks at the two types of innovations (technical innovation and administrative innovation) and how they could be employed by the Nigerian tertiary institutions in order to enhance their effectiveness...|$|R

2500|$|Reginald Marsh {{rejected}} modern art, {{which he}} found sterile. Marsh's style <b>can</b> <b>best</b> <b>be</b> <b>described</b> as social realism.
