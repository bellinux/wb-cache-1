40|$|Sedimentation and {{deposition}} (LC) 19 ABSTRACT (Contfnue on reverse IF {{necessary and}} fdentffy by block number) An investigation of Gilbert Shoal, a typical nearshore linear shoal on the Florida Atlantic coast, was undertaken {{to determine if}} significant interchange of sediments occur between the shoal, the surrounding seafloor, and the adjacent beach. The principal technique of study made use of selected sediment particle types or particle characteristics as natural tracers. Seven tracer elements and two particle characteristics were of some use. It was found that some sediment from the shoal reaches the beach, but the amounts involved are small {{and most of the}} beach sediment comes from littoral drift, organic shell production on the lower beach and nearshore area, and breakdown of <b>coquina</b> <b>rocks</b> of the Anastasia Formation which crop out on the beach and in the nearshore zone. Gilbert Shoal and the surrounding seafloor apparently receive little, if any, sediment from the beach or nearby St. Lucie Inlet, Gilbert Shoal sediment appears to be derived from the nearby shelf floor and from in sit 11 shell production...|$|R

The ten bedroom house is composed of native <b>coquina</b> <b>rock,</b> and finished in the interior with teak, oak, and cedar. In the 1950s, the city of Cocoa obtained the house from the Porcher family and turned it into the City Hall. It is currently rented out for special occasions.|$|E
50|$|The first {{facility}} constructed was the 48 foot by 114 foot natural <b>coquina</b> <b>rock</b> bandshell which seats 4,500. This {{was begun}} in September, 1936, and {{was completed in}} time for the first program to be presented on July 4, 1937. Open air concerts, as well as other programs, are still presented in the bandshell. The other structures in the boardwalk area are a clock tower, kiosk, concession facilities, restrooms, subway entrances (now closed), and an elevated walk from Earl to Ora Streets.|$|E
2500|$|... 4D Basin {{analysis}} of the Santos Basin has revealed insights about the interplay among the elements and processes of the petroleum system to assess source rock potential (vertical and horizontal distribution), thermal evolution of the source rocks, transformation ratio, hydrocarbon generation and charge, timing of migration, oil origin, quality, and volume of petroleum in the main reservoirs. In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the <b>Coquinas</b> source <b>rock</b> {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the Barremian and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are. The charge and accumulation simulation model for the pre-salt province suggests a potential reserve in the Cluster area of Santos Basin much larger than that reported, getting numbers to 60 billion barrels of oil reserves.|$|R
40|$|The Fazzan Basin of {{south-west}} Libya is {{at present}} arid {{with less than}} 20 mm of rainfall per annum. However, regionally extensive limestones, lacustrine sands and <b>coquina</b> (fossiliferous carbonate <b>rock)</b> deposits show that the Fazzan Basin previously contained a large palaeolake, indicating that the climate in the past was more humid. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating techniques have been applied to key lacustrine deposits within the basin {{in an attempt to}} provide an internally consistent chronology for this humidity record. Results indicate that palaeolake sediments within the Fazzan Basin record a very long history of palacohydrological change, ranging from present day and conditions to humidity capable of sustaining a lake with an approximate area of 76, 250 km(2). The existence of humid periods in mid oxygen isotope stage 5 and the early Holocene is confirmed. An older lacustrine event, tentatively correlated to oxygen isotope stage 11, is also recognized. In addition, evidence is presented for at least two humid phases beyond the age range over which the conventional OSL dating technique is applicable. This study demonstrates that OSL dating of palaeolake sediments within the Fazzan Basin offers the potential to provide a detailed record of North African humidity spanning several glacial-interglacial cycles.

50|$|A {{redevelopment}} {{project that}} took place between 1986 and 1987 featured {{the construction of the}} Marriott Convention Hotel which caused the removal of several original structures in Oceanfront Park. The original structures that were demolished included the small rectangular pavilions, octagonal kiosks, bathhouse, <b>coquina</b> <b>rock</b> veneered shops and stores, and the concessions and game rooms. (The original underpasses were closed in 1974 and completely filled in with gravel and dirt to prevent vagrancy.) The surviving parts of the original park are the Daytona Beach Bandshell and its spectator seating area, the Edward H. Armstrong Monument, and the Daytona Beach Clock Tower and Fountain.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the first}} Anglo {{settlers}} {{of the area}} was Chauncey A. Bacon, an architect and Civil War veteran from New Britain, Connecticut, who in 1876 purchased 172 acre in present-day Ormond-by-the-Sea and named it the Number Nine Plantation. In her book Ormond-On-The-Halifax, Alice Strickland describes the site: [...] "The land {{was covered with a}} dense, tangled forest of palmettos, scrub oaks, and pine trees which Bacon cleared out with axe and grub hoe. The Bacon's first home was a palmetto cabin, but later Bacon built a small, two story house with a large <b>coquina</b> <b>rock</b> fireplace on top of the Indian shell mound." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sumter County donated 1000 acre for the park, {{which opened}} to the public in 1936. Many {{buildings}} still in use at the park were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps from locally quarried <b>coquina</b> <b>rock.</b> Coquina is a young limestone in which fossil seashells are still readily apparent. Poinsett State Park was the first of many parks built by the CCC in South Carolina. The park was closed in 1963 for a year, along with all of South Carolina's state parks, due to a Federal court order to desegregate the parks, and it wasn't until 1966 that all its facilities were reopened. [...] The park's historical elements were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E

5000|$|Rockledge {{was officially}} founded on August 7, 1887, {{making it the}} oldest {{incorporated}} municipality in Brevard County. The name Rockledge, attributed to Gardner S. Hardee, an early settler, comes from the many ledges of <b>coquina</b> <b>rock</b> that line the Indian River. Other sources refer to a man named Cephas Bailey Magruder, who built his home after settling {{in the area in}} 1876 near the Indian River. Magruder called his home [...] "the rockledge home" [...] and the name was eventually attributed to the whole town. It was originally referred to as Rock Ledge; the two-word name persisted through the 19th century.Early industry in the area was based on the citrus trade and accommodation for tourists traveling to South Florida via the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway of the Indian River.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{the sandy}} soil {{of most of}} the island lie layers of coquina, a shelly rock in various stages of consolidation. This rock is {{composed}} primarily of whole and fragmented shells of the donax, or coquina, clam admixed occasionally with scattered fossils of various marine vertebrates, including sharks' and rays' teeth. This deposition is known as the Anastasia Formation, and was formed during the Late Pleistocene epoch, in the period of successive glacial ages from about 110,000 years to 11,700 years ago. It is the only local natural source of stone, and was quarried by the Spanish and later the British to construct many of the buildings in St. Augustine (including the Castillo de San Marcos). An old well and chimney made of <b>coquina</b> <b>rock,</b> located on Old Beach Road, are all that remain of the Spanish barracks built to house the workers who mined the coquina for construction of the fort. These included quarry overseers, masons, and stonecutters. The years-long project (1672-1695) was accomplished with the help of Native American forced labor and African slaves.|$|E
50|$|On July 30, {{he heard}} that another {{fortress}} was being created, and he {{thought that it was}} unnecessary. Later, Hita y Salazar sent two letters to the Crown in which he explained the progress made at the Castillo de San Marcos and gave suggestions on the fort. He also explained that he thought any attacker who arrived in Saint Augustine would try to conquer it and hold Anastasia Island, cutting off resupply fleets and bombarding the castle. To protect the island and prevent an invasion, Hita y Salazar decided that its engineers build a four-armed redoubt, which would be placed on the coast of El Pinillo and would protect entry and access to Anastasia Island. It seemed that many of his decisions may have been influenced by a false idea that there was an army on Anastasia Island that could bombard the castle and cut off supply lines. There was no army there, however. After he came to reason and withdrew his theory of the invasion of the island, British General Oglethorpe did exactly that in 1739. The supply ships were prepared for the attack, and the castle was able to prevent the few cannonballs that were sent by Oglethorpe. Blocks and others elements (such as the <b>Coquina</b> <b>rock)</b> with which the castle was built, blocked the impact of the cannonballs. Consequently, the bombardment was ineffective. Hita y Salazar sent a plane to the Viceroy of New Spain, Payo EnrÃ­quez de Rivera, explaining the state the Fort was in and that his advance, foundations, tanks and bastions that were being built. Hita y Salazar, apparently, had reached economic and technical problems in certain parts of the work. The accounts and expenses always exceeded the budgeted amount. He faced an impeachment trial that was applied to him in 1678, but came out unscathed.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to observe {{the effect of the}} blue crab, Callinectes similis, on the habitat preference of its prey, pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides. It was hypothesized that the pinfish would prefer the most structurally complex habitat, the live oyster clumps, but {{in the absence of a}} predator, may not show a strong association with the live oyster. It was also thought that the addition of a predator would strengthen the association with the live oyster. The experiment consisted of placing pinfish in a pool containing four distinct habitat types. The habitats were sand bottom (the least complex), oyster shell, <b>coquina</b> <b>rock,</b> and living oyster (most complex). The proportion of time spent in each habitat was determined using frequency occurrence. It was found that pinfish alone preferred the oyster habitat. When the predator was added, there was no change in the preferred habitat, even though the predator remained within the live oyster during most observation periods. The oyster offers the most protection to the pinfish, and the mobility of fish is also much greater than that of crab, allowing the pinfish to remain amongst their preferred habitat more easily...|$|E
