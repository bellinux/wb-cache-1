5|$|String bikinis {{and other}} {{revealing}} <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> common in surfing, though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis. Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of Kymberly Herrin, Playboy Playmate March 1981, surfing in a revealing bikini, and eventually started an annual bikini issue. The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests, {{an issue that}} divides the female pro-surfing community into two parts. It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event.|$|E

5000|$|During World War II, the woman's {{wardrobe}} {{was reduced}} to a minimum. In 1942, [...] "utility" [...] <b>clothes</b> <b>were</b> introduced. The utility clothes included suits, dresses and top coats. The standard patterns for these <b>clothes</b> <b>were</b> produced by a committee of designers. The prices for these <b>clothes</b> <b>were</b> controlled. Something special about it was the label that looked like a double crescent, which all clothes carried. The [...] "utility" [...] clothes should create a uniform style for all civilians, even though the manufactures achieved differences in the clothes.|$|R
50|$|The {{experience}} of wearing <b>clothes</b> <b>is</b> a necessity {{in life that}} people {{need in order to}} protect their bodies from conditions in the world around them. As part of this experience, the need to feel comfortable and at ease in one’s <b>clothes</b> <b>is</b> required by some people, whether it is for health or personal reasons. The levels of comfort from wearing <b>clothes</b> can <b>be</b> determined under three of the five methods of perception.|$|R
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5|$|Unit {{types are}} identical, {{regardless}} of civilization (though certain civilizations may have improved variations of these units). So, for example, a Korean Choson broad swordsman {{is identical to}} a Persian or Phoenician one, as are bowmen, axemen, short swordsmen, cavalry, and so forth. Some armors and <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> historically inaccurate, with the long swordsman bearing more resemblance to a Roman praetorian. Some units were also available in the game to civilizations that never, historically, had them; hoplites can be trained by every civilization except Persia, and some middle-Asian civilizations can train Legions and Centurions, while Japanese Yamato can build triremes.|$|E
5|$|A 2001 {{article in}} the Star Tribune noted that Plato's Closet in 2001 stocked up on brand names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., Silver Jeans Co., Sean John, Express, Inc., and Dr. Martens that they sold at a {{markdown}} of between 50% and 75%. Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises because people {{were more likely to}} sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money.|$|E

She trained {{and worked as a}} teacher before marrying a wealthy doctor in 1910, at which point she started buying clothes from department stores in Bold Street, Liverpool, as well as having bespoke items made by a local dress maker. Her collection, which has been donated to the National Museums Liverpool, contains over 700 items and is the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom.

5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains {{a piece of his}} dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On the left of the mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{accepted}} {{leader of}} the first protests, Thomas Rees (Twm Carnabwth), wore women's clothes when leading attacks. Some versions of the story say that these <b>clothes</b> <b>were</b> borrowed from a woman called Rebecca living near his home {{at the foot of}} the Preseli Hills. The story states that this woman was an old maid and her <b>clothes</b> <b>were</b> borrowed because she was the only woman tall enough and large enough in the village.

25|$|Dog Clothing is {{a garment}} made by humans for their canine companions. Dog <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} in various price ranges from inexpensive to high-end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers {{are dressed in}} dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers can wear clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from the cold more due to their coats being less thick. Dog <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> made to be either functional or for show. Functional dog <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely for show would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions such as Halloween or weddings.|$|E

25|$|The {{program has}} its own theme song and logo. Conscripts are issued two pairs each of three {{different}} types of uniforms: a class uniform, a sports uniform, and a combat uniform. The combat uniform's design is of blue camouflage stripes, made out of light blue, dark blue, white, and black. The general color scheme for the class and sports uniforms is blue, and black. Criticisms against trainees' uniforms are apparent as blue <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> easily spotted in jungles and verdant vegetation areas except the sky and water.|$|E

25|$|The {{tradition}} to decorate paintings with clothes or revetment (riza) of precious metals {{may have been}} borrowed from Eastern Orthodox. The clothing of Our Lady is composed of three gilded silver parts, each completed by different artists at a different period.

25|$|Polypropylene, or 'polypro', {{has been}} used for the {{fabrication}} of cold-weather base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. Polypropylene is also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the skin. More recently, polyester has replaced polypropylene in these applications in the U.S. military, such as in the ECWCS. Although polypropylene <b>clothes</b> <b>are</b> not easily flammable, they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind. Polypropylene undergarments are known for retaining body odors which are then difficult to remove. The current generation of polyester does not have this disadvantage.|$|E
