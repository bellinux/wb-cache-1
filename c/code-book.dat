40|$|The Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) is {{becoming}} widely used for accurate representation of real-world material appearance. In this paper a novel BTF compression model is proposed. The model resamples input BTF data into a parametrization, allowing decomposition of individual view and illumination dependent texels into {{a set of}} multi-dimensional conditional probability density functions. These functions are compressed in turn using a novel multi-level vector quantization algorithm. The result of this algorithm {{is a set of}} index and scale <b>code-books</b> for individual dimensions. BTF reconstruction from the model is then based on fast chained indexing into the nested stored <b>code-books.</b> In the proposed model, luminance and chromaticity are treated separately to achieve further compression. The proposed model achieves low distortion and compression ratios 1 : 233 – 1 : 2040, depending on BTF sample variability. These results compare well with several other BTF compression methods with predefined compression ratios, usually smaller than 1 : 200. We carried out a psychophysical experiment comparing our method with LPCA method. BTF synthesis from the model was implemented on a standard GPU, yielded interactive framerates.

30|$|Most {{irreversible}} data embedding and extracting approaches can {{be classified}} into two classes—spread spectrum and quantization index modulation (QIM). Spread spectrum techniques treats the data hiding problem as the transmission of the hidden information over a communication channel corrupted by the covered data [22]. QIM techniques use different quantization <b>code-books</b> to represent the covered data with the selection of <b>code-books</b> based on the hidden information [23]. QIM-based techniques usually have higher capacities than spread-spectrum schemes. The capacity of any QIM scheme {{is determined by the}} design of the quantization schemes. In [24], the authors propose to hide large volume of information into the nonzero DCT terms after quantization. This method cannot provide sufficient embedding capacity for our application because surveillance videos have high temporal correlation with a very large fraction of DCT coefficients being zero in the intercoded frames. In [25], the authors propose to implement the embedding in both zero and non-zero DCT coefficients but only in macro blocks with low inter frame velocity. This framework deals only with minimizing perceptual distortion without considering the increase in bit rate. Our initial scheme in [16] embeds the watermark bits at the high-frequency DCT coefficients during the compression process. Similar to [25], this method works well in terms of maintaining the output video quality but at an expense of much higher output bit rate.|$|R

60|$|In {{signalling}} by {{the navy}} code, the sentence {{to be sent}} is looked up in the <b>code-book</b> and its corresponding number is obtained.

These flags represent the numerals from one to nine and cipher, and there is a triangular pennant termed a repeater, which is used in a combination where one or more numerals recur. The numbers refer to those found in the general signal-book, in which are printed all the words, phrases, and sentences necessary to frame an order, make an inquiry, indicate a geographical position, or signal a compass course. Answering, interrogatory, preparatory, and geographical pennants form part of this code; also telegraph, danger, despatch, and quarantine flags.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} a bidirectional relaying system which uses physical layer network coding and noncoherent multiinput multioutput (MIMO) signal processing.

5000|$|In a {{slightly}} more complex form, a sender and a receiver are linked [...] This second attitude of communication, {{referred to as the}} constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a speech act. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of [...] "noise" [...] on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a <b>code-book,</b> and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} the joint relay and pre-coder selection in the decode-and-forward (DaF) relay network, where multiple relays are employed with multiple antennas. Depending on the channel information, the destination informs the relay and precoder selection {{information to the}} source and relays with finite bits of information. The source and the selected relay use their own pre-coders to transmit the signal using orthogonal channels. We present a selection criterion based on an upper bound of the pair-wise symbol error probability and provide the conditions for the <b>code-books</b> to achieve the full diversity.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} new non-coherent space-time block code (STBC) designs, which achieve full {{transmit}} di-versity {{as well as}} high rates. We first present a search procedure to generate full-diversity non-coherent unitary space-time <b>code-books</b> {{for any number of}} transmit antennas (nt) and time slots (T ≥ 2 nt), using radial coordinates of points lying on the surface of a sphere in RT−nt. The search method generates codebooks having a specified minimum chordal distance, which allows flex-ibility in achieving coding gain. Further, we propose another unitary design using circulant matrices for any nt, by restrict-ing the search only to suitable constellation sets inR 2 for the case of T = 2 nt. For the latter design, we present two different op-timizations; i) to maximize the minimum chordal distance, and ii) to maximize the expected chordal distance. The proposed designs use an analytical design criterion which guarantees full diversity. The proposed designs are shown to outperform Jing and Hassibi codes reported previously in the literature...|$|R

40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} of multi-user distributed cooperative antenna (COOPA) systems to provide base sta-tions (BSs) with downlink channel information for transmit filtering (precoding). The analog pilot retransmission method is efficient in terms of resources but is vulnerable to noise enhancement effects. The precoder codebook based feedback schemes are not applicable since they are developed for single user cases. In this paper we propose a new feedback scheme via a subspace based channel quantization method. The pro-posed scheme adopts the chordal distance as a channel quan-tizer criterion so as to capture channel characteristics repre-sented by subspaces spanned by the channel matrix. We then develop a channel quantizer codebook construction method based on the Linde, Buzo and Gray (LBG) vector quantiza-tion algorithm.
