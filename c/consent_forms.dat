2500|$|In 1996, an {{outbreak}} of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives traveled to Kano, Nigeria to administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Local Kano officials report that more than 50 children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities. The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes {{were similar to those}} historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment. According to the news program Democracy Now!, [...] "esearchers did not obtain signed <b>consent</b> <b>forms,</b> and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug." [...] The lawsuits also accuse Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. While the specific facts of the case remain in dispute, both Nigerian medical personnel and at least one Pfizer physician have stated that the trial was conducted without regulatory approval.|$|E
2500|$|Scientists {{involved}} in the clinical trials published articles warning of birth defects {{at the same time}} the drug was launched in the US, but nonetheless isotretinoin was taken up quickly and widely, both among dermatologists and general practitioners. Cases of birth defects showed up in the first year, leading the FDA to begin publishing case reports and to Roche sending warning letters to doctors and placing warning stickers on drug bottles, and including stronger warnings on the label. [...] Lawsuits against Roche started to be filed. [...] In 1983 the FDA's advisory committee was convened and recommended stronger measures, which the FDA took and were that time unprecedented: warning blood banks not to accept blood from people taking the drug, and adding a warning to the label advising women to start taking contraceptives a month before starting the drug. [...] However use of the drug continued to grow, as did the number of babies born with birth defects. [...] In 1985 the label was updated to include a boxed warning. [...] In early 1988 the FDA called for another advisory committee, and FDA employees prepared an internal memo estimating that around 1,000 babies had been born with birth defects due isotretinoin, that up to around 1,000 miscarriages had been caused, and that between 5,000 and 7,000 women had had abortions due to isotretinoin. [...] The memo was leaked to the New York Times a few days before the meeting, leading to a storm of media attention. [...] In the committee meeting, dermatologists and Roche each argued to keep the drug on the market but to increase education efforts; pediatricians and the CDC argued to withdraw the drug from the market. [...] The committee recommended to restrict physicians who could prescribe the drug and to require a second opinion before it could be prescribed. [...] The FDA, believing it did not have authority under the law to restrict who had the right to prescribe the drug, kept the drug on the market but took further unprecedented measures: it required to Roche to make warnings yet more visible and graphic, provide doctors with informed <b>consent</b> <b>forms</b> to be used when prescribing the drug, and to conduct follow up studies to test whether the measures were reducing exposure of pregnant women to the drug. [...] Roche implemented those measures, and offered to pay for contraception counseling and pregnancy testing for women prescribed the drug - the program was called the [...] "Pregnancy Prevention Program".|$|E

30|$|The written, {{informed}} <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> (ICF) can be {{instrumental in}} enhancing subject comprehension. A study involving the {{informed consent process}} in cancer clinical trials showed that careful reading of the <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> was associated with improved knowledge scores [25]. Other studies have demonstrated greater comprehension in those subjects who have carefully read the <b>consent</b> <b>form</b> [32, 33], but these findings were associated with individuals with higher education levels.
