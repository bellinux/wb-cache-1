50|$|The {{following}} rules can {{be followed}} to calculate Cash Flows from Operating Activities when given only a two-year <b>comparative</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> and the Net Income figure. Cash Flows from Operating Activities {{can be found}} by adjusting Net Income relative to the change in beginning and ending balances of Current Assets, Current Liabilities, and sometimes Long Term Assets. When comparing the change in long term assets over a year, the accountant must be certain that these changes were caused entirely by their devaluation rather than purchases or sales (i.e. they must be operating items not providing or using cash) or if they are nonoperating items.|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that two balance sheets, one {{at the beginning and}} one {{at the end of the}} period, and an income statements, together with its related retained earnings reconciliation statement, are raw materials for preparing the funds flow statement. The author has developed a new practice of preparing the statement directly from the accounts record, without balance sheets and other financial statements, for the purpose of presenting a method of reporting the flow of funds over any shorter period than a fiscal year A trial balance is prepared over a period on which the fund flow statement is intended to be made that consists of only entries of increase and decrease in every account based upon transactions taken place over the period. This trial balance may be called a " Funds Flow Trial Balance," which is defferent from the trial balance prepared under the usual accounting practice in that the former does not involve the figure of the beginning balance in each account The funds flow trial balance is the basic data with which the funds flow statement is provided, because this trial balance involves the same figures as the <b>comparative</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> figures with which the funds flow statement is prepared under the traditional method. The funds flow trial balance can be prepared at any time, even in the middle of the fiscal year wherever the accounts record is available, without making financial statements, while it is only after the financial statements have been made that the <b>comparative</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> figures can be provided. This method can be applied to the preparation of the fiscal fund flow statement, and it opens the way of determining the net income for the year from the fiscal funds flow statement. The author illustrates this process on a work sheet through which the reader may understand in more real feature the relationship between the flow of funds and of the income in a certain business entity. If the flow of funds could be presented with the revenue and expense on the financial statements, the latter would more clearly disclose the process of coming out the net income than they do at present and the more real extent of distributable amount of income would be measured. The author illustrates a form of combining the funds statement with the income statement and the retained earnings reconciliation statement, and combining the "Changes of Working 1 Capital" with the balance sheet...|$|E

40|$|John J DoyleQuintiles, NY, USAAbstract: The drug {{development}} process is {{in dire need}} of transformation. Even after achieving regulatory approval, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly seeing their products subjected to health technology assessments (HTAs) by public and private payers. The cornerstone of HTA value appraisal, and thus reimbursability, is comparative effectiveness research (CER), a &lsquo;real-world&rsquo; comparison of a new product with the existing standard of care. Burgeoning demand for CER will fundamentally transform {{drug development}} by forcing biopharmaceutical manufacturers to view drug innovation from a holistic, 360 &deg; perspective. Specifically, drug and device developers must alter their existing approach to R&amp;D by: adapting experimental research design methods to address multiple stakeholder demands; demonstrating real-world value through a suite of post-market observational research methods; and creating a transparent CER evaluation protocol based on standard principles. In the long-term, CER is forecast to propel innovation by focusing R&amp;D on products that deliver real-world value to multiple customers and market stakeholders.

40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is {{the fifth}} most {{important}} cereal crop worldwide {{and it is the}} third most important crop in Ethiopia. The national average yield amounts 1302 kg/ha. In order to assess the achievement in farmer breeding various types of research were undertaken. These include survey research to quantify the trend in productivity, the level of and reasons for adoption of improved varieties, yield performance and preference evaluation of farmers’ varieties (FVs) and improved varieties (IVs). As per the trend analysis over the last four decades, total production and yield per hectare has increased by 11. 63 % and 14. 2 % respectively. However, area allocated to sorghum has decreased over years by - 2. 93 %. The lack of consistent productivity is attributed to the fluctuation of environmental factors. Sorghum production in Ethiopia is predominantly based on varieties developed by farmers. The share of IVs is very low. FVs and IVs are adopted by 87. 3 % and 12. 7 % of the farmers respectively. Besides, the adoption of IVs is limited to the lowland crop ecology. The comparative yield of FVs is higher than IVs by 132 %. On top of yield, farmers do prefer their varieties for other multipurpose values namely feed, fuel wood and construction material. FVs under production are identified in each wereda. Farmer breeding has been successful compared to four decades of formal breeding. On the other hand, both farmer and formal breeding are not without weaknesses; a <b>comparative</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> is outlined for both. Ideotypes for the three major crop ecologies are suggested and integrated plant breeding is anticipated to develop the proposed ideotypes thereby increase sorghum productivity in the region...|$|E
40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 49). BRAC EPL Investments Limited is a merchant bank and subsidiary of BRAC Bank Limited. It commenced operation under a new management team obtaining merchant bank license from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and became BRAC EPL from EPL in August 2009. BRAC Bank holds 76 % of the equity of BEIL, the rest held by {{a diverse group of}} international fund managers and capital market institutions at home and abroad. BEIL delivers a whole range of investment banking services including traditional merchant banking activities. It has already established itself {{as one of the top}} portfolio managers, serving more than 4600 clients country-wide from seven locations. In discharging professional services, BEIL makes concerted efforts to show ZERO tolerance towards non-compliance and emphasizes strict adherence to regulatory guidelines. The report focuses on “Assessing the stock market torment of BRAC EPL Investment Limited in term of Revenue escalation”. BEIL commenced its business just 4 years back. So it can be said that it is comparatively a new organization in the market. After only two years of its inception, the company faced the biggest capital market turbulence in the history of financial markets of Bangladesh. Its upward trend of net income got broken as soon as the capital market storm hit. The report is enriched in financial performance analysis of BEIL consisting of <b>comparative</b> <b>balance</b> <b>sheet,</b> comparative income statement, some important ratios, critical analysis of profitability, future projections etc. The financial performance analysis of BRAC EPL Investments Limited showed a significant deviation in the year 2011 in almost all the analyses. And in most the cases, such impact continued in 2012. So, we can say the capital market distress had a great impact on the profit growth of BRAC EPL. If 2011 were out of the picture the performance of the firm in terms of income shows a steady growth in both operating and total income. BRAC EPL faced a negative net profit only in 2011, which was the year of the capital market distress. One prerequisite of having a healthy investment climate in an economy is the availability of financing facility for the existing and potential borrowers. The two major sources of finance in any country are the banks and the capital market. So it is very important for BRAC EPL Investments Limited to cope up with the turmoil of capital market of Bangladesh to have a consistent profit growthMd. Mustafa ZamanB.
