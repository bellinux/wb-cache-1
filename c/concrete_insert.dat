40|$|Hydrophobic {{agents are}} surface {{protection}} materials capable {{of increasing the}} angle of contact between {{the water and the}} concrete surface. For this reason, hydrophobic agents reduce water (in liquid form) penetration in concrete. Therefore, many European construction regulating agencies recommend this treatment in their maintenance policy. Nonetheless, there continues to be a gap in the understanding about which transport mechanisms of the concrete are modified by the hidrophobic agents. The aim {{of this study was to}} fill this gap in regards to reinforced <b>concrete</b> structures <b>inserted</b> in a marine environment. To this end, certain tests were used: Two involving permeability mechanism, one determining capillary absorption, and the last, a migration test used to estimate the chloride diffusion coefficient in saturated condition. Results indicated the efficacy of the hydrophobic agents in cases where capillary suction is the mechanism of water penetration (reduced by 2. 12 and 7. 0 times, depending of the product). However, when the transport mechanism is permeability this product is not advisable.

30|$|Floor impact noises are {{considered}} as structure-borne sounds that {{are caused by}} either impacting on or vibrating directly on the structure, and then travelling through the entire building (Uno 1992). In general, one of the effective methods to lower the floor impact sounds is to separate or isolate the noise from its source. There {{are a number of}} approaches to lower the influence of floor impact noise, such as increasing the thickness of <b>concrete</b> slab, <b>inserting</b> sound absorptive materials, and creating space to isolate the sound sources. A number of studies point out {{that one of the most}} effective methods to separate the floor impact sounds in concrete structures is through the use of floating floors (Schiavi 2018; Miškinis et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2015; Faustino et al. 2012; D’alessandro et al. 2014; Sipari 2002). A floating floor is a combination of concrete slab and resilient, as well as sound absorbing, material, such as rubber (D’alessandro et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2006; Schiavi 2018). Neves e Sopusa and Gibbs (2011) compared both homogeneous concrete floors and floating floors in dwellings. In their study, the floating floor would be beneficial to insulate low frequency impact sound transmission. Schiavi (2018) tested various resilient materials, such as glass fibre, polyester fibre, cork, and rubber grains, to form floating structures in the concrete slab. Cho (2013) indicated that the concrete slab with resilient layers would be useful to insulate floor impact sound, compared to the normal concrete slab. In this study, the voided slab system, which is filled with lightweight expanded polystyrene (EPS), is suggested as one of the floating floor systems to isolate and separate the floor impact sounds in a commercial–residential complex building. The EPS void formers were designed as a means of isolating floor impact sound in the concrete structure. In order to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the voided slab systems for lightweight and heavyweight floor impact sound insulation, a field test was conducted to evaluate the sound insulation performance in the studied building.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Based {{upon the}} {{statistical}} distribution of flexural fatigue life data and flexural fatigue {{strength of the}} steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) containing blends of limestone powder (LP) and silica fume (SF), the influence of these inserts on the flexural fatigue performance of concretes is probed. Concrete mixes were proportioned to replace 30 % cement with these mineral inserts in different trends. The flexural fatigue performance of plain concrete (PC) and SFRC of comparable fibre size, as reported in previous studies is made to compare with the fatigue performance of present mixes to demonstrate the effect of addition of LP and SF as partial replacement of cement. It has been ascertained that distribution of fatigue life of concretes under study can be modeled by two-parameter Weibull distribution. The increased values of shape parameter for <b>concretes</b> containing mineral <b>inserts</b> correspond to its more homogenous microstructure as compared to control concrete. The pozzolanic and filler effect of SF in the cement improves the bulk matrix and strengthens the interfaces between fibre and cement paste and aggregate and cement paste. The modified pore structure of LP based concretes is attributed to its filler effect. The fatigue life data has also been presented {{in the form of}} S-N diagram and the two-million cycles fatigue strength/endurance limit for mixes was estimated...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{inspections}} of buildings, {{it is common}} to find structures that, well before reaching its useful life longer require repairs and reinforcements. This study examined the bond strength between concrete of different ages and between steel and concrete, focusing on the recovery of reinforced concrete structures. To analyze the bond between concrete of different ages, trials with specimens receiving three different types of treatments at the interface between the concrete were performed: brushing; brushing and mortar equal to concrete of substrate and brushing and epoxy layer. Indirect tensile tests and oblique and vertical shear tests at the interface were made. The bond stress between steel and concrete was evaluated by pull out test under the conditions of the bar inserted in the still fresh <b>concrete</b> and when <b>inserted</b> in the hardened concrete with epoxy. Results showed increased bond strength by indirect tensile stress of 15 % and 37 %; 4 % and 12 % for the adherence test by oblique shear, and 108 % and 178 %, for the testing of vertical shear, respectively, for the specimens whose interfaces have received, in addition to brushing, layer of mortar and epoxy bridge, compared to those who received only brushing. Insignificant loss (about 0. 52 %) of bond stress was noticed for pull out test of steel bar when compared with test results of the specimens that had steel bar <b>inserted</b> in the <b>concrete</b> in the hardened state with epoxy adhesion bridge, with those who had inserted steel bar in fresh concrete...|$|R

The principal and more characteristic concepts of the gadamerian thought (play, prejudice, the consciousness of historical determination, the history of effects, and so on), have been treated again, just according to the peculiar key of interpretation of the subjectivity.

2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank <b>concrete</b> wall and <b>inserted</b> alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is this going to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|R
