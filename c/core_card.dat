40|$|SummaryC-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that {{couple with}} the kinase Syk are major pattern {{recognition}} receptors for the activation of innate immunity and host defense. CLRs recognize fungi {{and other forms}} of microbial or sterile danger, and they induce inflammatory responses through the adaptor protein Card 9. The mechanisms relaying CLR proximal signals to the <b>core</b> <b>Card</b> 9 module are unknown. Here we demonstrated that protein kinase C-δ (PKCδ) was activated upon Dectin- 1 -Syk signaling, mediated phosphorylation of Card 9 at Thr 231, and was responsible for Card 9 -Bcl 10 complex assembly and canonical NF-κB control. Prkcd−/− dendritic cells, but not those lacking PKCα, PKCβ, or PKCθ, were defective in innate responses to Dectin- 1, Dectin- 2, or Mincle stimulation. Moreover, Candida albicans-induced cytokine production was blocked in Prkcd−/− cells, and Prkcd−/− mice were highly susceptible to fungal infection. Thus, PKCδ is an essential link between Syk activation and Card 9 signaling for CLR-mediated innate immunity and host protection...|$|E

40|$|Part 1 : Information & Communication Technology-EurAsia Conference 2014, ICT-EurAsia 2014 International audienceIn this paper, we {{consider}} power-aware task scheduling (PATS) in HPC clouds. Users request virtual machines (VMs) to execute their tasks. Each task is executed on one single VM, and requires a fixed number of cores (i. e., processors), computing power (million instructions per second - MIPS) of each core, a fixed start time and non-preemption in a duration. Each physical machine has maximum capacity resources on processors (cores); each core has limited computing power. The energy consumption of each placement is measured for cost calculating purposes. The power consumption {{of a physical}} machine is in a linear relationship with its CPU utilization. We want to minimize the total energy consumption of the placements of tasks. We propose here a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the PATS problem. The GA is developed with two versions: (1) BKGPUGA, which is an adaptively implemented using NVIDIA’s Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) framework; and (2) SGA, which is a serial GA version on CPU. The experimental results show the BKGPUGA program that executed on a single NVIDIA® TESLATM M 2090 GPU (512 <b>cores)</b> <b>card</b> obtains significant speedups in comparing to the SGA program executing on Intel® XeonTM E 5 - 2630 (2. 3 GHz) on same input problem size.

Moreover, the proposed BKGPUGA program can handle large-scale task scheduling problems with scalable speedup under limitations of GPU device (e. g. GPU’s device memory, number of GPU cores, etc.) ...|$|R
