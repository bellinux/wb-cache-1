5|$|A {{consistent}} {{shift from}} land based trade to sea based trade {{has been recorded}} since the last three millennia. The strategic advantages of port <b>cities</b> <b>as</b> trading centers are many: they are both less dependent on vital connections and less vulnerable to blockages.

5|$|A {{number of}} species are doing well in the {{increasingly}} urbanized Massachusetts. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger <b>cities</b> <b>as</b> nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas {{in the western part}} of Massachusetts, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|As more {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} the Pacific Northwest in the 1930s and 1940s, civic leaders advocated a system of hydroelectric dams on the Columbia River. They argued that the dams would improve navigation for barge traffic from interior regions to the ocean; provide a reliable source of irrigation for agricultural production; provide electricity for the World War II defense industry; and alleviate the flooding of downriver <b>cities,</b> <b>as</b> occurred in the 1948 destruction of Vanport City, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{significantly}} slower {{propagation of}} seismic waves {{compared to the}} near-speed-of-light transmission of Internet traffic, some Twitter users read about the earthquake seconds before feeling the tremors. For example, Twitter users in such <b>cities</b> <b>as</b> New York City and Boston reported reading tweets about the earthquake from users in Washington, D.C., or Richmond, Virginia, 15 to 30seconds before feeling the quake itself.|$|E
5|$|From mid-April Mussolini based {{himself in}} Milan, {{and he and}} his {{government}} took up residence in the city's Prefecture. At the end of the month, the partisan leadership, the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale Alta Italia (CLNAI), declared a general uprising in the main northern <b>cities</b> <b>as</b> the German forces retreated. With the CLNAI's assumption of control in Milan and the German army in northern Italy about to surrender, Mussolini fled the city on 25 April and attempted to escape north to Switzerland.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it has a}} {{reputation}} as a high-crime area, the crime rate in Union-Miles Park in 2004 was about the same <b>as</b> the <b>city</b> <b>as</b> a whole. The property crime rate was slightly lower than the city average, and tended to be concentrated in the industrial district on {{the western edge of the}} neighborhood. The rate of assault, domestic violence, illegal possession of a firearm, and use of a firearm in a crime were also comparable to that of the <b>city</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Again, they were much higher (double the citywide average) in the western industrial area. Drug crimes were 45 percent higher in Union-Miles Park than in the <b>city</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Drug activity, however, was concentrated on eastern and western edges of the area, rather than throughout the neighborhood. The violent crime rate in Union-Miles Park was slightly higher than in the <b>city</b> <b>as</b> a whole. Within the neighborhood, violent crime rates varied considerably. In the area along E. 116th Street south of Union Avenue, it was much higher than the <b>city</b> <b>as</b> a whole. In many other areas of the neighborhood, it was substantially lower than the <b>city</b> <b>as</b> a whole.|$|R

5|$|In 1948 floods {{swept through}} the Columbia watershed, {{destroying}} Vanport, then the second largest city in Oregon, and impacting <b>cities</b> <b>as</b> far north as Trail, British Columbia. The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950, authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms. By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects, and sought local control of new developments; a public utility district in Grant County, Washington, ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids.|$|E

5|$|Jews also {{spread across}} Europe during the period. Communities were {{established}} in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Most Jews were confined to the <b>cities,</b> <b>as</b> they {{were not allowed to}} own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europeâ€”pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Maeser also {{inspired}} a relationship between Meissen, where he was born, and Provo, Utah. Now, the two cities share a sister-city relationship. It is the hope of both cities that the relationship will grow to include the exchange of delegations, including manufacturers, youth, academicians, scientists, artists, associations, clubs, tourists, technicians and others, which will result in enriching the cultures of the respective <b>cities.</b> <b>As</b> of 2001, the two cities have been sending high school age students on a three-week-long exchange to gain more knowledge about their differences in society and culture.|$|E

40|$|The {{project is}} a city-level {{analysis}} on urban forms of Arnhem. It explores perspectives to capture and represent the spatial characteristics and eventually, character of the city.

The conclusion is a synthesised portrait of the spatial history of Arnhem, expressed through metaphor, analogy and myth. The central quest of the project is how to know something of such complexity and ambiguous definition <b>as</b> a <b>city.</b> To plan a future, the planner/designer must go through this quest, because the future is on a trajectory traced {{from the past and}} present, and constrained by the cityâ€™s own character.

In {{addition to the}} agora, the gymnasium, the theatre, and religious sanctuaries and temples dedicated to Greek gods and goddesses, {{one of the main}} markers of a true Greek city in the empire of Alexander the Great was the presence of an odeon for musical performances.

5|$|On the Swabian side, similar {{concerns}} existed. For {{the common people}} in Swabia, the independence and freedom of the Eidgenossen was a powerful and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern Swabia feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with <b>cities</b> <b>as</b> far away as Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).|$|E
