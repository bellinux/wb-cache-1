50|$|<b>Captodiame</b> (INN), {{also known}} as captodiamine, is an {{antihistamine}} sold under the trade names Covatine, Covatix, and Suvren which {{is used as a}} sedative and anxiolytic. It is a derivative of diphenhydramine.|$|E
50|$|The oxygen atom {{in these}} {{molecules}} can {{in many cases}} be dispensed with as well; substitution of sulfur for nitrogen affords a molecule whose salient biologic properties are those of a sedative and tranquilizer. Friedel-Crafts acylation of the n-butyl ether of thiophenol with benzoyl chloride gives the corresponding benzophenone. Reduction of the ketone with zinc/NaOH followed by treatment with HCl in ether affords the benzhydryl chloride. Displacement of the halogen with thiourea gives, by reaction of the last at its most nucleophilic center, the isothiouronium salt. Hydrolysis of the salt leads to the sulfur analog of a benzhydrol. Alkylation of the sodium salt of this last with N-(2-chloroethyl)dimethylamine affords <b>captodiame.</b>|$|E
