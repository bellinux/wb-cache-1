The tensile strength of technical fibre bundles was found to depend strongly on the <b>clamping</b> <b>length.</b> The tensile strength of elementary flax fibres was found to range between 1500 MPa and 1800 MPa, depending on the isolation procedure. The compressive strength of elementary flax fibres as measured with a loop test lies around 1200 MPa. However, the compressive strength can be lowered severely by the decortication process. The standard decortication process induces kink bands in the fibres. These kink bands are found to contain cracks bridged by microfibrils.

40|$|Self {{loosening}} of prestressed bolts ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} self loosening of high strength bolts has been assessed since the 1940 ’s. Still {{a lot of}} questions are unsolved. This is especially the case in the field of bolts for steel structures with diameters of 16 to 36 mm, where the number of results is low. At risk for self loosening are steel structures under cyclic loads, such as cranes, mast constructions, smokestacks and bridges. To protect connections against the self loosening several antiloosening devices were on the market. Recent results showed that unfortunately almost all of them were malfunctioning. Due to that in 2003 all German regulations for these elements were withdrawn. At the moment a research project is running at the Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany, to analyze the mechanism of self loosening. The aim is to find a constructive way to protect a bolted connection from self loosening. Therefore several tests to identify the important pa-rameters were performed, especially the variation of the <b>clamping</b> <b>length.</b> Within the paper the results of the project so far were presented. 1 SELF LOOSENING OF PRESTRESSED BOLTS 1. ...|$|R

40|$|Minor thesis [...] - Preload loss in {{pretensioned}} bolts is {{an inevitable}} phenomenon. This thesis {{focuses on the}} different causes for bolt relaxation and their relation to joint design. Investigating bolt relaxation is relevant {{because there is a}} direct relation between the bolt preload and the resistance of the connection. In order to assess the loss of preload in pretensioned bolts, test results of extended creep tests (cf. EN 1090 - 2) have been used. It was found that bolt relaxation is mainly a function of coating thickness of the joint members. The larger the coating thickness, the more bolt relaxation occurs. The influence of bolt relaxation due to flattening of surface roughness could not be quantified due to the governing influence of coating thickness, but the surface roughness is of large importance for the slip resistance. External static loading has an influence on short-term bolt relaxation which can be modelled using an equation derived in this thesis. Proper joint design is key to achieving a high strength friction grip connection with a high preload level and thus a high slip resistance over the entire service lifetime. Higher ratios of <b>clamping</b> <b>length</b> over bolt diameter lead to less bolt relaxation. The results of this thesis can be used to gain insight in the behaviour of preloaded connections, as well as to have an indication on how to achieve a preloaded connection with relatively small preload losses.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} the component-based approach – widely used to model structural joints – requires knowledge of the mechanical properties of the constitutive joint components, including an appropriate assembly procedure to derive the joint properties. This paper presents a component-method model for a structural joint component that {{is located in the}} tension zone of blind-bolted connections to concrete-filled tubular steel profiles. The model relates to the response of blind-bolts with headed anchors under monotonic loading, and the blind-bolt is termed the "Extended Hollo-bolt". Experimental data is used to develop the model, with the data being collected in a manner such that constitutive models were characterised for the principal elements which contribute to the global deformability of the connector. The model, based on a system of spring elements, incorporates pre-load and deformation from various parts of the blind-bolt: (i) the internal bolt elongation, (ii) the connector’s expanding sleeves element, and (iii) the connector’s mechanical anchorage element. The characteristics of these elements are determined on the basis of piecewise functions, accounting for basic geometrical and mechanical properties such as the strength of the concrete applied to the tube, the connection <b>clamping</b> <b>length,</b> and the size and class of the blind- bolt’s internal bolt. An assembly process is then detailed to establish the model for the elastic and inelastic behaviour of the component.

40|$|Pallets of {{automatic}} transfer lines {{serve as the}} technological and work-transfer equipment. However, their design {{is based on the}} general principles of designing machine accessories. Calculation of the basic design parameters of work based on their functioning features is fairly relevant. In pallet transfer movement over work positioning there is a mismatch between axes of the basic bushing of a pallet and the clamping locks of positioning. The paper identifies the factors influencing it, and defines the conditions to ensure the trouble-free clamping lock. The circular and rhombic clamping of pallet is simultaneous. Further, a clamping load is calculated from the pallet mass (together with the work-piece) and the geometric parameters of the pallet clamping. The paper reveals three movement stages of the clamping lock in a vertical plane when setting the pallet in work positioning: - a clamping lock free play till it encounters with the location bushing; - a <b>clamping</b> lock play <b>length</b> when the lead-in chamfer contacts the bushing chamfer; - a <b>clamping</b> lock play <b>length</b> over the circular surface of bushing. The study of this process has allowed us to calculate the time of pallet clamping and dynamic loads acting on the clamping lock. These calculations made it possible to calculate the required diameter of the clamping lock. The presented calculations allow a reasonable assigning the main design parameters of work positioning for the pallet automatic lines. </p...|$|R

The time course of the extra calcium for shortening steps at different times during the calcium transient is intermediate between those of free calcium and muscle force.

Therefore, the extra calcium probably comes from the activating sites on the myofilaments, possibly {{as a result of}} changes in calcium binding by the activating sites. The change in calcium binding may be due, in turn, to the change in muscle length and/or muscle force and/or cross-bridge attachment per se.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine whether Viso (the maximum speed of shortening extrapolated from force-velocity curves) equalled Vu (the unloaded speed of shortening determined by the slack test) in both living fibres from Rana temporaria and mechanically skinned fibres from Rana pipiens. In living fibres (R. temporaria) we obtained improved estimates of Viso by performing force <b>clamps</b> (isotonic) and <b>length</b> ramps (isovelocity) down to very low loads (0. 005 isometric tension, P 0). Force-velocity characteristics determined by force <b>clamps</b> and <b>length</b> ramps were the same. The hyperbolic Hill curves deviated from the force-velocity data at both high and low loads and underestimated Viso by varying degrees. A better estimate of Viso was obtained by linear extrapolation of data at loads from 0. 005 - 0. 02 P 0 and the mean Viso at 7. 5 degrees C was 4. 08 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 11 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). Improved estimates of Vu in living fibres were obtained by photographically calibrating the slack test. The mean Vu was 4. 05 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 13 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14) and the intercept was 0. 0156 fibre lengths (L 0) +/- 0. 0013 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). The step-ramp photographic method, in which the motor speed is matched to Vu, was developed as an independent way to measure Vu in living fibres. Vu measured in this way agreed well with Vu measured by the slack test. In all living fibres, the improved estimates of Vu agreed well with the improved estimates of Viso. Vu/Viso = 0. 99 +/- 0. 01 (mean +/- S. E., n = 14). In mechanically skinned R. pipiens fibres, force clamps were performed down to loads of 0. 01 mN. The force-velocity curve of the skinned fibres differed in shape {{from that of the}} living fibres. Although there was significant deviation from the Hill equation at low loads, the data at high loads were well fitted by the Hill curve. Viso determined by extrapolating the Hill equation to zero load was 5. 87 muscle lengths/s +/- 0. 38 (mean +/- S. E., n = 9) at 7. 5 degrees C. In five fibres, the linear extrapolation of low loads (0. 01 - 0. 05 P 0) showed that the Hill equation underestimated the true Viso by 6 %. The slack test with mechanically skinned fibres was calibrated by taking a series of photographic exposures of the fibre at various times following each length step.

OBJECTIVE: The {{objective was to}} identify predictors of weight loss and reversal of comorbidity in obese patients undergoing malabsorptive bariatric surgery. DESIGN: Morbidly obese men and women (n = 107) were studied before and 2 y after biliopancreatic diversion (BPD). Body composition, serum lipid profile, oral glucose tolerance, and blood pressure were measured. Insulin sensitivity was determined by use of a euglycemic <b>clamp.</b> The <b>length</b> of the small intestine was measured during surgery. RESULTS: Intestinal length was 671 +/- 99 cm, and the residual absorbing intestine after BPD ranged from 54 % to 24 % of initial length. Patients lost an average of 36 % of their initial weight, with approximately 50 % of them reaching a body mass index (in kg/m(2)) < 30. Serum cholesterol decreased (from 4. 58 +/- 1. 11 to 3. 34 +/- 0. 73 mmol/L; P < 0. 0001), as did serum triacylglycerols (from 1. 52 +/- 0. 59 to 0. 88 +/- 0. 35 mmol/L; P < 0. 0001), whereas insulin sensitivity rose 150 % (from 26 +/- 4 to 64 +/- 11 micromol. min(- 1). kg fat-free mass(- 1); P < 0. 0001). Diabetes (in 23 % of patients before surgery) and hypertension (in 83 %) were reduced (by 88 % and 96 %, respectively) after surgery. In a multivariate model (including sex, age, intestinal length, presence of diabetes, insulin sensitivity, and initial fat mass), age and diabetes were independent, negative predictors of weight loss, whereas initial fat mass was a strong positive predictor (r(2) = 0. 51).

Considering that young female patients are frequently operated on for atrial septal defects, a minimally invasive procedure avoiding sternotomy is convincingly desirable {{and led to the}} approach through a right anterolateral minithoracotomy. The recent clinical introduction of robotically assisted surgery further reduced skin incisions and enabled totally endoscopic procedures through ports. This article reports on a first series of atrial septal defect closures of which the first case was operated on August 24, 1999, in a totally endoscopic closed chest technique using a computer-enhanced telemanipulation system. MethodsWe performed totally endoscopic atrial septal repair using the da Vinci surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Mountain View, Calif) in 10 consecutive adult patients. Median age was 45. 5 ± 10. 0 years, and preoperative New York Heart Association functional class was 1. 8 ± 0. 1. Left ventricular ejection fraction was normal in all patients and mean pulmonary artery pressure amounted to 35 ± 7 mm Hg. Shunt volume ranged from 24 % to 70 %. All patients displayed a fossa ovalis type of atrial septal defect; 2 of them multiperforated. ResultsNeither intraoperative nor postoperative complications occurred. Two patients had to be converted to minithoracotomy due to endoaortic balloon <b>clamp</b> failure. <b>Length</b> of operation was 262 ± 37 minutes, and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 161 ± 26 minutes.

In the present article, we show that the amount of the extra calcium depends on the initial muscle length, declining at shorter lengths. This suggests length-dependent calcium binding. The relation between initial length and extra calcium, however, parallels that between initial length and peak active force. The ratio of extra calcium to active force is therefore virtually independent of initial length. These data do not distinguish between a direct effect of length on calcium binding and an indirect effect owing to changes in cross- bridge attachment and force through some geometrical factor. The amount of extra calcium increases with the size of the shortening step, tending toward saturation for steps of {{greater than or equal to}} 10 %. This experiment suggests that calcium binding depends on muscle force or cross-bridge attachment, not just length (if at all). There is much less extra calcium seen with shortening steps at high force when the high force results from stretch of the active muscle than when it results from increased stimulation of muscle.

The aerothermodynamics of spherical and toroidal towed ballutes are considered in the present study. A limiting case of zero towline <b>length</b> (<b>clamped</b> system) is also considered. A toroidal system can be designed (ignoring influence of the tethers) such that all flow processed by the bow shock of the towing spacecraft passes {{through the hole in}} the toroid. For a spherical ballute, towline length is a critical parameter that affects aeroheating on the ballute being towed through the spacecraft wake. In both cases, complex and often unsteady interactions ensue in which the spacecraft and its wake resemble an aero spike situated in front of the ballute. The strength of the interactions depends upon system geometry and Reynolds number. We show how interactions may envelope the base of the towing spacecraft or impinge on the ballute surface with adverse consequences to its thermal protection system. Geometric constraints to minimize or eliminate such adverse interactions are discussed. The towed, toroidal system and the clamped, spherical system show greatest potential for a baseline design approach. + Senior Research Engineer, Aerothermodynamics Branch, Associate Fellow AIAA # Graduate Student, Student Member AIAA Copyright 2002 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top clamping block that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top clamping block are <b>clamped</b> around a <b>length</b> of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a bending block that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The bending block contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block. Once the tube has been clamped between the clamping/ radius and top clamping blocks, the bending block is placed around the tube, the pivot holes are aligned, and a pivot pin is inserted through the pivot holes...|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this paper details {{the design of a}} facility for the water permeability testing of subsea drill-string riser buoyancy modules. The facility has been built and commissioned and is unique in the UK The only other test facility of this sort exists at the South Western Research Institute at San Antonio in Texas, USA. Buoyancy modules are used to reduce the effective weight of a subsea drill-string riser so as to avoid buckling and vibration problems in service. This weight reduction increases the natural frequencies of the riser well above typical frequencies of excitation as a result of drilling. The geometry of the modules depends on the particular riser design but generally approximates to a long, semi-circular section, sleeve which is <b>clamped</b> round the <b>length</b> of the riser. Many modules are used in service to surround the whole length of the riser from the sea bed to the surface. Individual module lengths vary but tend to be around the 5 m mark. The most important module performance characteristics are the effective buoyancy force in water and the ability of the module to resist water ingress at the high hydrostatic pressures encountered in deep water. These pressures can reach up to 345 bar in the deepest water, and are therefore potentially capable of forcing water into the material of the module. The concept behind the testing facility is a computerized data logging system that detects and computes minute weight changes in sample sections of the buoyancy riser module due to the ingress of sea water at very high hydrostatic pressures. The system simulates the hydrostatic conditions found in deep water, and provides a specific printout of pressure and buoyancy quantities over test periods of up to 100 hours; the format of the printout is to the standard generally required by industry. The work was carried out in recognition of the need for a UK facility which would enable manufacturers of the module material, and also customers purchasing the modules, to have confidence that the required buoyancy performance of the modules can be maintained under typical subsea conditions—without necessarily incurring the very high costs of testing in the US...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of [Ca 2 +] on the maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) was examined in mechanically skinned Rana pipiens and Rana temporaria fibres using improved force clamps and the slack test techniques. All measurements {{were made at}} 7. 5 degrees C. At low relative loads (P/P 0 less than 0. 1), maximally activated R. pipiens fibres shortened more rapidly than did submaximally activated fibres. At higher relative loads, however, little difference in the speed of shortening was observed. Vmax (determined by the slack test) of R. pipiens fibres increased {{as the level of}} activation increased. Over sarcomere lengths 1. 8 - 2. 1 microns it was 2. 28 muscle lengths/s (m. l. /s) (S. E. of mean +/- 0. 25, n = 5) at 20 - 35 % activation, 2. 89 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 22, n = 7) at 40 - 60 % activation, and 4. 18 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 25, n = 6) at 100 % activation. At longer sarcomere lengths (2. 2 - 2. 6 microns), higher Vmax values were observed at all levels of activation, but the {{influence of}} Ca 2 + on Vmax persisted. Vmax was 3. 54 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 41, n = 4) at 20 - 30 % activation and 5. 15 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 22, n = 5) at 100 % activation. In R. temporaria fibres, Vmax (determined by force <b>clamps</b> over sarcomere <b>lengths</b> 1. 8 - 2. 1 micron) also increased as the level of activation increased, from 3. 47 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 06, n = 6) at 13 - 29 % activation to 5. 62 m. l. /s (+/- 0. 17, n = 6) at 100 % activation. Vmax was also determined (using the slack test) in mechanically and chemically skinned rabbit soleus fibres. Vmax at 15 degrees C (1. 05 m. l. /s, +/- 0. 11, n = 5) at full activation decreased by more than 3 -fold as the level of activation was reduced to 10 %. We conclude that the level of activation influences the Vmax of skinned skeletal muscle fibres. This has now been demonstrated in three different preparations and by a variety of techniques. This effect is most pronounced at low relative loads, and might not be observed if there are experimental limitations which prevent making velocity measurements at low relative loads...|$|R
