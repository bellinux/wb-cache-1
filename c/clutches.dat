5|$|Females can lay five <b>clutches</b> per year, but two is {{a normal}} average after {{including}} the 30–50% of a population's females that do not produce any <b>clutches</b> in a given year. In some northern populations, no females lay more than one clutch per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch. Clutch sizes of the subspecies vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly subspecies, western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutch—11.9 and 7.6, respectively—than the two more southerly subspecies, southern (4.2) and eastern (4.9). Within subspecies, also, the more northerly females lay larger <b>clutches.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail. After finding a potential mate the male will inspect the female by flicking his tongue over her entire body. As in other species of snakes and many other reptiles, fertilization is internal and the intromittent organs of the males are {{in the form of}} hemipenes. Females lay <b>clutches</b> of eggs with an incubation period of some 80 to 90 days. Like most snakes female mambas are both oviparous and iteroparous. Egg-laying typically occurs during the middle of summer and egg <b>clutches</b> range from 6 to 17 eggs.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a mechanical <b>clutch</b> which limits transmission of torque to a desired, predetermined maximum torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate to a second <b>clutch</b> plate. More specifically, the mechanical <b>clutch</b> includes at least one stepper member, preferably three or more evenly spaced stepper members, which transmit the torque from a first <b>clutch</b> plate to a second <b>clutch</b> plate providing a desired maximum torque is not exceeded. However, if the desired maximum torque is exceeded, the stepper member will rotate and move between the <b>clutch</b> plates so that the torque to the second <b>clutch</b> plate does not exceed the desired maximum torque. The desired maximum torque is set by the axial force compressing the stepper member between the <b>clutch</b> plates and when the applied torque to the first <b>clutch</b> plate exceeds the desired torque, the stepper member will rotate between the <b>clutch</b> plates rather than transmit that torque to the second <b>clutch</b> plate...|$|R
5|$|<b>Clutches</b> contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, <b>clutches</b> are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in <b>clutches,</b> whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in <b>clutches,</b> but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E

5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations.
