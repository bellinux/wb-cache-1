5|$|Yuricich's {{previous}} {{work had been}} as Director of Photography for Photographic Effects on <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters,</b> and he and Trumbull reassembled the crew and equipment from the feature, adding more personnel and space. Time, not money, was the main issue; Trumbull had to deliver in nine months twice the effects as found in Star Wars or <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters,</b> which had taken years to complete. The Glencoe-based facilities the teams had used for <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters</b> were deemed insufficient, and a nearby facility was rented and outfitted with five more stages equipped with camera tracks and systems. Dykstra and his 60-person production house Apogee Company were subcontracted to Trumbull.|$|E

5|$|<b>Close</b> <b>Encounters</b> of the Third Kind is a 1977 American {{science fiction}} film written and {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg, and starring Richard Dreyfuss, Melinda Dillon, Teri Garr, Bob Balaban, Cary Guffey, and François Truffaut. It tells the story of Roy Neary, an everyday blue-collar worker in Indiana, whose life changes after an encounter with an unidentified flying object (UFO).|$|E
5|$|Early in pre-production, Spielberg {{hired the}} film title {{designer}} Dan Perri {{to design a}} logotype for <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters.</b> Perri, who had previously worked on The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), produced a logotype in Handel Gothic typeface, with only a script to work from. Spielberg was delighted with the result, and applied the logo to all production stationery and crew shirts. Unusually in filmmaking, Spielberg carried enough influence to maintain creative control over the film's entire branding, and asked Perri to design the advertising campaign and title sequence for <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters</b> based on his logo. Perri later went on to design titles {{for a number of}} other major Hollywood pictures, including Star Wars (1977), Raging Bull (1980), and Airplane! (1980).|$|E

5|$|All {{projections}} {{of the future of}} the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. <b>Close</b> <b>encounters</b> gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Careful {{measurement}} of {{the positions of the}} planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics. More recently the tracking of near-Earth objects will allow for predictions of <b>close</b> <b>encounters</b> or potential collisions of the Earth with those objects.|$|E

In 1985, Broccoli would return the favour by fulfilling Spielberg's request to use the James Bond theme music for a scene in his film, The Goonies (1985).|$|E
5|$|In {{partnership}} {{with her husband}} Michael, Julia Phillips {{was one of the}} most successful film producers in Hollywood during the 1970s. Their second film, The Sting, grossed almost $160million and won seven Academy Awards, making Julia the first woman to win a Best Picture Oscar. Their third film, Taxi Driver, brought them a second Oscar nomination and won the Palme d'Or in 1976. In 1977 they co-produced their most financially successful movie, Steven Spielberg's $300million-grossing <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters</b> of the Third Kind.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>Close</b> <b>Encounters</b> {{was filmed}} anamorphically, the visual effects {{sequences}} were shot on 70 mm film to better conform with the 35 mm film {{used for the}} rest of the movie. A test reel using computer-generated imagery was used for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be too expensive and ineffective since CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.|$|E

Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
