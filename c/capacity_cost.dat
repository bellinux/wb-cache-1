40|$|Sorption {{heat storage}} can {{potentially}} store thermal energy for long time periods {{with a higher}} energy density compared to conventional storage technologies. A performance comparison in terms of energy density and storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> of different sorption system concepts used for seasonal heat storage is carried out. The reference scenario for the analysis consisted of satisfying the yearly heating demand of a passive house. Three salt hydrates (MgCl 2,Na 2 S, and SrBr 2), one adsorbent (zeolite 13 X) and one ideal composite based on CaCl 2, are used as active materials in solid sorption systems. One liquid sorption system based on NaOH is also considered in this analysis. The focus is on open solid sorption systems, which are compared with closed sorption systems and with the liquid sorption system. The main results show that, for the assumed reactor layouts, the closed solid sorption systems are generally more expensive compared to open systems. The use of the ideal composite represented a good compromise between energy density and storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs,</b> assuming a sufficient hydrothermal stability. The ideal liquid system resulted more affordable in terms of reactor and active material costs but less compact compared to the systems based on the pure adsorbent and certain salt hydrates. Among the main conclusions, this analysis shows that the costs for the investigated ideal systems based on sorption reactions, even considering only the active material and the reactor material costs, are relatively high compared to the acceptable storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> defined for different users. However, acceptable storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> reflect the present market condition, and they can sensibly increase or decrease {{in a relatively short}} period due to for e. g. the variation of fossil fuels prices.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{restrict}} access to distribution channels or input suppliers is commonly {{thought to be}} a barrier to entry. Many have argued that a monopolist can use vertical integration as means of foreclosing entry. We consider a duopoly market and ask whether duopolists who control access to distribution can deter entry into upstream production. Specifically, we consider a model of capacity competition in which two incumbent firms each have access to distribution while a single entrant does not. We show that, absent collusion, access to distribution alone does not deter entry. After producing its own capacity the entrant induces the duopoly incumbents to bid against one another to acquire the capacity. The entrant takes advantage of a negative externality: each incumbent realizes that the entrant's capacity will be sold to the other firm if they don't buy it, so they ignore the effect of the additional capacity on the market price of the final good. Consequently, each incumbent may be willing to pay a premium for the entrant's capacity even though they would not have increased their capacity on their own. If <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> are sufficiently small, the incumbents can still deter entry by preemptively building greater capacity. For very small <b>capacity</b> <b>costs,</b> the incumbents share the entry deterrence equally. For larger <b>capacity</b> <b>costs,</b> entry deterrence is achieved only with asymmetric capacity commitments - one firm produces more than the other. If on the other hand <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> are sufficiently high, entry is accommodated and the firms produce the same capacity that they would have if the entrant had had equal access to distribution. The inability of the incumbents to commit not to buy the entrant's capacity causes the entrant to act as if it had equal access. ...|$|R
40|$|In many service industries, {{companies}} {{compete with}} each other {{on the basis of the}} waiting time their customers experience, along with the price they charge for their service. A firm’s waiting time standard may either be defined in terms of the expected value or a given, for instance 95 %, percentile of the steady state waiting time distribution. We investigate how a service industry’s competitive behavior depends on the characteristics of the service providers ’ queueing systems. We provide a unifying approach to investigate various standard single stage systems covering the spectrum from M/M/ 1 to general G/GI/s systems, along with open Jackson networks to represent multi-stage service systems. Assuming that the <b>capacity</b> <b>cost</b> is proportional with the service rates we refer to its dependence on (i) the firm’s demand rate and (ii) the waiting time standard as the <b>capacity</b> <b>cost</b> function. We show that across the above broad spectrum of queueing models, the <b>capacity</b> <b>cost</b> function belongs to a specific four parameter class of function, either exactly or as a close approximation. We then characterize how this <b>capacity</b> <b>cost</b> function impacts on the equilibrium behavior in the industry. We give separate treatments to the case where the firms compete in terms of (i) prices (only) (ii) their service level or waiting time standard (only), (iii) simultaneously in terms of both prices and service levels.

40|$|AbstractWithin the {{framework}} of IEA SHC Task 42 / ECES Annex 29, a simple tool for the economic evaluation of thermal energy storages has been developed and tested on various existing storages. On that account, the storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> (costs per installed storage capacity) of thermal energy storages have been evaluated via a Top-down and a Bottom-up approach. The Top-down approach follows {{the assumption that the}} costs of energy supplied by the storage should not exceed the costs of energy from the market. The maximum acceptable storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> depend on the interest rate assigned to the capital costs, the intended payback period of the user class (e. g. industry or building), the reference energy costs, and the annual number of storage cycles. The Bottom-up approach focuses on the realised storage <b>capacity</b> <b>costs</b> of existing storages. The economic evaluation via Top-down and Bottom-up approach is a valuable tool to make a rough estimate of the economic viability of an energy storage for a specific application. An important finding is that the annual number of storage cycles has the largest influence on the cost effectiveness. At present and with respect to the investigated storages, seasonal heat storage is only economical via large sensible hot water storages. Contrary, if the annual number of storage cycles is sufficiently high, all thermal energy storage technologies can become competitive...|$|R
