2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E

50|$|Semi-active {{suspensions}} include {{devices such}} as air springs and switchable shock absorbers, various self-levelling solutions, as well as systems like hydropneumatic, hydrolastic, and hydragas suspensions. Mitsubishi developed the world’s first production semi-active electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> system in passenger cars; the system was first incorporated in the 1987 Galant model. Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a magneto-rheological fluid, whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically, thereby giving variable control without switching valves, which is faster and thus more effective.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 was {{launched}} the Dedra Integrale. It {{used the same}} engine and transmission that the Delta Integrale 8v. The Delta Integrale 8v engine {{is one of the}} world's most competition proven power units, a 2-litre four-cylinder fuel injected twin cam engine, fitted with contra-rotating balancing shafts, and a Garrett T3 turbocharger and associated inter-cooler to aid volumetric efficiency that boost power output to 171 PS (127 kW) in catalyzed version. The Dedra Integrale also uses the same permanent four-wheel drive of the Delta Integrale, and includes the new Visco Drive 2000 traction control system. Also includes the electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> available as option in the 2.0 and upper versions.|$|E
5000|$|Mitsubishi {{developed}} {{its first}} high performance {{four-wheel drive vehicle}} in 1987, when it equipped the Galant VR-4 with [...] "Dynamic Four" [...] (Mitsubishi AWC), which featured a center differential-type full-time four-wheel drive system (this system incorporated a viscous coupling unit), a four wheel steering system, four-wheel independent suspension, and a four-wheel ABS (the first total integration of these systems {{in the world that}} were highly advanced at the time). The 1987 Galant also featured [...] "Dynamic ECS", a world’s first production semi-active electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> system (a means of actively controlling a vehicle’s cornering attitude (body roll) and dynamic performance) that Mitsubishi developed. Mitsubishi's active ECS enhanced ride comfort and kept body inclination to a minimum under all driving conditions by controlling the grip between the tires and the road surface.|$|E

50|$|At launch, the TR series {{comprised}} the Magna Executive sedan, SE sedan, and the automatic sedan-only Elite. Of the V6-engined Verada range, the Ei version was equipped {{to about the}} same level as a Magna SE, with the exception that air-conditioning was standard. The top of the range Verada Xi also included alloy wheels, keyless door entry, climate control, cruise control, an upmarket sound system, steering wheel controls for cruise and sound system, power windows, electrically adjustable driver's seat, power antenna, and security system. Furthermore, the Xi featured an electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> with four-way adjustable shock absorbers (dampers) and adjustable pneumatic springs in addition to the standard coil springs. This system automatically adjusts spring and damper rates commensurate with road conditions, speed and driving style. An anti-lock braking system (ABS) and driver's airbag became available {{for the first time on}} both Veradas.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} model incorporated many of Mitsubishi's contemporary performance-enhancing technologies, such as full-time four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering, active aerodynamics featuring automatically adjusting {{front and rear}} spoilers, sport/tour exhaust modes and electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> (ECS). These [...] "Active Aerodynamics" [...] were not used on the Dodge Stealth. Visually, both the GTO, 3000GT and Stealth featured pop-up headlights and noticeable [...] "caps" [...] on the hood to accommodate the ECS controllers {{at the top of}} the strut turrets. However the rest of factory body kit differed in styling with their respective badges. Most notable are the Dodge signature cross-hairs on the Stealth front bumper fascia, Ferrari inspired gills on the 3000GT rocker panels, Crescent shaped spoiler on the Stealth commonly referred to as the [...] "Banana Wing" [...] and front Active Aero air dam on 3000GT VR4 (later discontinued on newer models).|$|E
50|$|The Hyundai Dynasty is {{a premium}} {{executive}} sedan that debuted in 1996. The {{features of the}} Dynasty were electronically <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension,</b> dual climate control, and power memory seats (front and rear). In order to differentiate the Dynasty from its platform-shared smaller Grandeur, Hyundai used a different badge (stylized D logo) for Dynasty. The Hyundai Dynasty was produced in Ulsan, South Korea and it was discontinued in 2005. The Dynasty was the top level flagship at its introduction, {{but it was a}} front wheel drive vehicle. It had a higher level of luxury equipment and was available in extended length versions over the more basic Grandeur. When the joint luxury flagship Mitsubishi Proudia/Hyundai Equus was introduced, the flagship designation was then removed from the Dynasty and sales suffered as a result with cancellation. With the introduction of a separate rear-drive luxury channel launched called Genesis Motors, the market position formally held by the front-wheel drive Dynasty is being replaced by the Hyundai Aslan.|$|E

2500|$|Suspension {{choices for}} the base model C5 were limited to the {{standard}} suspension (RPO FE1), with options for either the autocross-inspired FE3 Sport Suspension (included with the Z51 Performance & Handling Package and standard on the 1999–2000 FRC); or the F45 Selective Ride <b>Control</b> <b>Suspension,</b> which permitted [...] "on-the-fly" [...] driver selection of different ride characteristics (sport or touring). Late in the production run (starting with the 2003 model year), the F55 Magnetic Selective Ride <b>Control</b> <b>Suspension</b> replaced the F45 as the third suspension choice. The racing-inspired FE4 suspension used for the Z06 is stiffer again than any offered on the base model C5, and is unique to that model with no optional suspensions offered. The C5's suspension consisted of independent unequal-length double wishbones with transverse fiberglass mono-leaf springs and optional magnetorheological dampers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} designing linear multivariable controllers in the frequency-domain for an intelligent <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> system for a quarter-car model. The design methodology uses singular value inequalities and optimal control theory. The vehicle system is augmented with additional dynamics {{in the form of}} an integrator to affect the loop shapes of the system. The measurements are assumed to be obtained in a noisy state, and the optimal control gain and the Kalman filter gain are derived using system dynamics and noise statistics. A combination of singular value analysis, eigenvalue analysis, time response, and power spectral densities of random response is used to describe the performance of the active suspension systems.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{identification}} of a nonlinear full vehicle model. The identification task is realized as a weighted nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which minimizes the 2 -norm of the errors between the power spectral density (PSD) of the measured sensor signals and that of the simulated sensor signals. Subsequently the parameterized vehicle model is reduced to a quarter vehicle model. This model is then utilized during the synthesis of an LPV controller employing semi-active dampers. Results from a four-post-test-rig showing the correlation of the identified full-vehicle model to the real vehicle are given {{at the end of the}} paper, followed by those from simulations and a road test demonstrating the performance of the LPV <b>controlled</b> <b>suspension</b> compared to passive suspension set-ups...|$|E
