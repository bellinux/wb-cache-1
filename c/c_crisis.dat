We examine data on agricultural production with a view to possible changes during the Third Millennium B. C. and well into the Second. Our results indicate that cereal and fruit- tree production continue at a constant level during this period and that there was no change in the agricultural economy. These findings do not support the hypothesis of a socio-economic rupture brought about by climatic deterioration. We also examined non-cultivated taxa from our data. However the level of identification combined with the fact that the presence of these plants results from human activities does not allow us use them as climatic indicators. Herveux Linda.

Employing an applied constructivist framework, the thesis argues that the impact of global norms at the domestic level has been contingent on a) the socializing actions of norm entrepreneurs, b) the domestic political context and <b>c)</b> <b>crisis.</b> In the case of China and the impact of global AIDS norms, the central argument is that key elements of China&# 146;s domestic political context minimized the socializing affects of the global AIDS regime until the SARS crisis in 2003 led to a reappraisal of AIDS in the context of political legitimacy, at which time global AIDS norms began to have increasing salience in China. This thesis begins by identifying the evolution of a global AIDS regime before moving on to an exploration of China&# 146;s domestic political context. The thesis then documents and analyses China&# 146;s governance of AIDS from 1985 to 2007 through the use of five indicators &# 150; political commitment, legislation and policy, representation of AIDS in the media, the participation of civil society, and international engagement. The findings demonstrate that there has been a significant change between China&# 146;s pre-SARS and post-SARS AIDS governance with China acting increasingly in accordance with global norms following the SARS crisis of 2003. The thesis proposes that the SARS crisis was catalytic in that it exposed the vulnerability of the Chinese government&# 146;s claims to legitimacy, and in so doing, enabled the domestic political context to shift, allowing health, and by extension AIDS, to be reframed as a political issue. Importantly however, when the Chinese government scaled up its response to the epidemic it was able to be guided by the normative framework prescribed by the global AIDS regime...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine current {{readiness}} plans of small colleges and universities through the eyes of Senior Student Affairs Officers and develop recommendations for institutional use. Plans were examined across both institutional size and type to gauge institutional readiness, and commonalities were sought in the areas of plan development and maintenance. This explanatory mixed-methods study utilized survey research methodology and phone interviews. Following the initial survey administration, five respondents participated in phone interviews focused on the development and maintenance of institutional crisis management systems. Unexpected delays in the research necessitated a second administration of the survey to provide more recent data. ^ The researcher focused on four primary indicators of institutional crisis preparedness: (a) identification of the types of crises addressed by institutional plans, (b) crisis phases addressed by institutional plans, (<b>c)</b> <b>crisis</b> management systems in place, and (d) level of stakeholder involvement in institutional plans. ^ The findings suggested that small colleges and universities generally are prepared to face crisis situations, as nearly every institution had a written crisis management plan and an established crisis management committee. Roughly three of every four small colleges and universities had taken a broad approach to their planning, as indicated by the presence of at least one written contingency plan in each of the four major categories of crises: natural, facility, criminal, and human. Additionally, the findings suggested that planning was reactive, rather than proactive, as noted by the limited attention given by institutions to the pre-crisis phase of planning. ^ Private institutions were more confident in their overall level of preparedness for campus crises than public institutions. Additionally, confidence in the level of preparedness was highest at the largest institutions in the study. Interview participants focused on the level of comfort among the team of individuals charged with leading through institutional crises as critical. Lastly, interview participants acknowledged the need for outside expertise to bring focus and experience to planning. ...|$|E

40|$|How do crises lead to change? Rationalist {{approaches}} to the question that emphasize inexorable structural responses {{and the pursuit of}} distributive preferences by newly dominant coalitions are inadequate because they obscure the social mediation of material events and the pervasive uncertainty that follows destabilization of the precrisis status quo. The latter constrains actors from fully grasping their distributive preferences. Until uncertainty is reduced, persuasion emerges as a key mechanism of change. Although constructivist approaches emphasize persuasive practices, they have yet to adequately specify the scope conditions underpinning the selection of new ideas. This article goes beyond much of the constructivist focus on domestic legitimacy and static notions of resonance by emphasizing external credibility and dynamic processes of resonance-building by norm entrepreneurs. The author specifies four features—what he calls the four <b>Cs</b> of <b>crisis</b> resolution—that shape the process of idea selection: carriers, composition, crossover appeal, and credibility. Developing these arguments {{in the case of the}} early years of New Order Indonesia, the article suggests that whenever a prominent and cohesive group of advocates promotes an idea that has sufficient ideational and distributive appeal and the endorsement of external actors whose seal of approval is perceived as important, intersubjective belief change, and thus institutional and policy change, is more likely...|$|R

Although trade in parts and components and final assembly within production networks ("“network trade"”) has generally grown faster than total world trade in manufacturing, the degree of dependence of East Asia on this new form of international specialization is proportionately larger than elsewhere in the world. Network trade has certainly strengthened economic interdependence among countries in the region with the People's Republic of China playing a pivotal role as the premier center of final assembly. However, contrary to popular belief, this has not lessened the dependence of the export dynamism of these countries on the global economy.

40|$|Soil {{contaminated}} with cadmium (Cd) {{is a heavy}} problem {{all over the world}} and especially in Japan, where many crop fields are contaminated. Applicative techniques are required for remediation such soils and reduction of Cd uptake in crops. To evaluate the Cd uptake of taro (Colocasia esculenta Schott cv. Dodare), Japanese radish (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Harunomegumi) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Dansyaku) a cultivation experiment was conducted in high Ca-contaminated field. The Ca concentration of the whole plants showed in the order of taro > potato > Japanese radish. In addition, the Cd concentration of the edible parts (daughter corm of taro, Japanese radish root and peeled potato) in each plant was the lowest in those of the other parts. The shoots of Japanese radish and potato accumulated Cd largely as compared with roots during the cultivation. It is concluded that the edible part of Japanese radish root is a safer food material with low cadmium content as compared with the other root crops. The experiment of pot culture was conducted to investigate the Cd, zinc, manganese and copper concentrations of Japanese radishes (Raphanus sativus L. cv. Harunomegumi, and Raphanus sativus L. cv. Akibutai) for 9 weeks with soil, whose cadmium and Zinc concentrations were 3. 26 and 67. 9 mg/kg (in dried soil), respectively. The Japanese radish plants grew normally through the growth period, and the weight of the shoots was 2. 8 times of the roots. The Cd concentrations of shoots increased for 6 weeks after sowing and the increase slowed down after 6 weeks from sowing. After 9 weeks, the cadmium concentrations of the shoots were "Harunomegumi" and “Akibutai”, respectively, 2. 37 and 1. 45 mg/kg. The cadmium concentrations of the shoot “Harunomegumu” were higher 0. 8 kg kg- 1 than those of "Akibutai". It seemed that the Cd concentrations of the shoots depended on the cultivars. The Cd concentrations of the roots were a quarter of those of the shoots. The zinc concentrations of the shoots were same as those of the roots through the growth period. The manganese concentrations of the shoots increased, however, those of the roots were constant values. The copper concentrations of the shoots were higher 1. 4 times than those of the roots. To evaluate the suppressive effect of five additives on cadmium (Cd) uptake by komatsuna (Brassica rapa L. var. perviridis cv. Early komatsuna), a pot experiment with Cd-contaminated acidic soil was conducted in a greenhouse. Autoclaved lightweight aerated concrete (ALC), lherzolite (Lherzo), gypsum made from waste plasterboard (Gyp-w), magnesia cement (Magwhite) and calcium carbonate containing less than 10 % pure gypsum (Cacar-G) were added to the soil (1 %, w/v). The shoot Cd concentrations of the plants were suppressed in the order; Magwhite ≧ Cacar-G > ALC > Lherzo. The order was in agreement with that of the soil pH increased by the application of the additives. The application of Gyp-w suppressed the shoot Cd concentration of the plants similar to Lherzo, however, it reduced the plant growth. It is concluded that Magwhite and Cacar-G are considerably effective soil amendments in the suppression of Cd uptake by the plants, and ALC and Lherzo are moderately effective, whereas Gyp-w is scarcely effective. The development of soil amendments, the improvement of cultivation techniques on the reduction of plant Cd uptake, and the phytoremediation on Cd contaminated soil will propose the avoidance of <b>Cd</b> <b>crisis.</b> 博士 (農学) 農学Iwate University 2010 - 3 - 23 乙　 140...|$|R

Two cases are considered: a smooth cylinder submerged in a {{turbulent boundary layer}} and a roughened cylinder immersed in a laminar uniform flow. In the former case, the Reynolds number Re d(≡U ∞d/v, with U ∞ being the free-stream velocity and m the fluid viscosity) was varied from 2. 61 × 10 4 to 2. 87 × 10 5, and two values of H/d (2. 65 and 5) were examined; in the latter case, Re d = 1. 24 × 10 4 - 1. 73 × 10 5 and H/d = 3, 5 and 7. In the subcritical regime, both the drag coefficient C D and the Strouhal number St are smaller than their counterparts for a two-dimensional cylinder and reduce monotonously with decreasing H/d. The presence of a turbulent boundary layer causes an early transition from the subcritical to critical regime and considerably enlarges the Re d range of the critical regime. No laminar separation bubble occurs on the finite-length cylinder immersed in the turbulent boundary layer, and consequently, the discontinuity is not observed in the C D-Re d and St-Re d curves. In the roughened cylinder case, the Re d range of the critical regime grows gradually with decreasing H/d, while the <b>C</b> D <b>crisis</b> becomes less obvious. In both cases, H/d has a negligible effect on the critical value of Re d at which transition occurs from the subcritical to critical regime. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

Experiments also show that the description of the extracted grain topics can be well explained with respect to a dataset including topics about recent global financial <b>crisis.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Many {{writers have}} {{argued for the}} {{benefits}} of a credible fixed exchange rate (a hard peg) as a commitment device in an open economy. But historically, fixed exchange rates have often been associated with large current account deficits and episodes of `over-borrowing'. This paper develops a model of capital inflows that are linked to the exchange rate regime because of endogenous fiscal policy. The key message of the paper is that a hard peg is undesirable in the absence of commitment in fiscal policy. In face of a credible fixed exchange rate, the fiscal authority subsidizes capital inflows. The economy will engage in inefficiently high international borrowing, and in welfare terms may end up worse off than under capital market autarky. To eliminate the incentive to subsidize borrowing, the monetary authority must follow a flexible exchange rate rule in which capital inflows lead to exchange rate appreciation. If fiscal policy must be financed by money creation rather than direct taxation, then a fixed exchange rate rule may cause both over-borrowing and a subsequent exchange rate <b>crisis.</b> (<b>c)</b> 2005 Elsevier B.
