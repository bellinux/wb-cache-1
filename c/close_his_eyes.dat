25|$|Indiana {{uses his}} {{knowledge}} of Shiva to defeat Mola Ram. In Raiders, however, he is wise enough to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{in the presence of}} God in the Ark of the Covenant. By contrast, his rival Rene Belloq is killed for having the audacity to try to communicate directly with God.|$|E
25|$|The Ranji final of 1984/85 {{turned out}} to be one of the finest matches in Indian {{domestic}} cricket history. A sleepy Gavaskar won the toss and batted. He could hardly <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> before Mumbai was 3 down for 42. Batting at No.5, he scored his 20th and last hundred in Ranji trophy and took Mumbai to 333. Shastri made 29 before he was bowled attempting to cut an arm–ball. Delhi was in early trouble before they were rescued by Chetan Chauhan, batting with a fractured finger in his last first class match. Ajay Sharma, in his first season, scored a hundred and took Delhi into the lead with nine wickets down.|$|E
25|$|The person {{called up}} to read from the Torah – the summons is called an aliyah and the person so honored is called an oleh – hastens from his seat to the desk, going {{directly}} to the desk without any interruptions. Although around the world, including North America, many congregations will have a trained scroll reader for the actual recitation, the very considerable honor of the reading is attributed to the oleh. If there was a previous portion read, the previous oleh then steps aside from the desk. The oleh takes his place at the desk facing the open scroll, the verse where his portion begins is pointed out for him, he may kiss the scroll (usually by kissing {{the corner of his}} prayer shawl or the Torah wrapping and then touching that to the margin – not the writing – of the scroll), and then he may <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> or avert his face, or otherwise indicate that the blessing he is about to recite is not being read from the text of the Torah. While reciting the blessings he holds both handles of the scroll, and if the actual scroll reading is done by someone else, the oleh steps to the side but continues to hold with one hand one of the scroll's handles.|$|E

500|$|At {{approximately}} 12 {{midnight on}} 21 September 1986, Wood {{went to the}} playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head. [...] Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood. [...] Wood then proceeded to play hide-and-seek with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which he led her into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly. He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) {{into the bathroom and}} told him to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head. Wood then bludgeoned the boy with a large ruler four or five times {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, Queen ElizabethII {{opened the}} western {{colonnade}} {{addition to the}} building designed by Utzon who had not returned to Australia since 1966. His son, Jan, took his place at the opening ceremony instead, saying his father was [...] "too old by now to take the long flight to Australia. But he lives and breathes the Opera House, and as its creator he just has to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to see it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sifre {{taught that}} when Moses saw the merciful manner of Aaron's death, Moses {{concluded}} {{that he would}} want to die the same way. The Sifre taught that God told Aaron to go in a cave, to climb onto a bier, to spread his hands, to spread his legs, to close his mouth, and to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and then Aaron died. At that moment, Moses concluded that one would be happy to die that way. And that is why God later told Moses in [...] that Moses would die [...] "as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people," [...] for that was the manner of death that Moses had wanted.|$|E

2500|$|Abdul-Rauf {{is perhaps}} best known for the {{controversy}} created when he refused to stand for [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] before games, stating that the flag was a symbol of oppression and that the United States had a long history of tyranny. He said that standing to the national anthem would, therefore, conflict with his Islamic beliefs. On March 12, 1996, the NBA suspended Abdul-Rauf for his refusal to stand, costing Abdul-Rauf $31,707 per missed game. Two days later, he worked out a compromise with the league, whereby he would stand during the playing of the national anthem but could <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and look downward. He usually silently recited Islamic prayer during this time for those who are suffering {{from all walks of life}} and ethnic backgrounds.|$|E

60|$|Joe {{insisted that}} he did not <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> while on duty, and Bob was equally certain that he kept {{vigilant}} watch; therefore there was no possibility of ascertaining when the theft had been committed.|$|E
60|$|Here he was {{protected}} from the chill wind, and as was only natural, here also he fell asleep even while saying to himself that nothing should tempt him to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> even for a single moment.|$|E

60|$|How horribly {{plain that}} fiend's intention! Gale tried to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> but could not. He prayed wildly for a sudden blindness--to faint as Thorne had fainted. But he was transfixed {{to the spot}} with eyes that pierced the red light.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a night}} {{never to}} be forgotten. The German snored peacefully, but Dick did not <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He watched Tom closely, to do all he could for his brother and make certain that the {{sufferer}} should not get away again.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>closed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> again, and I did not further disturb him.|$|R

6000|$|Nod {{alone could}} not <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> He watched his brother's great face; lower, lower would drop his chin, wheel round, and start up {{again with a}} jerk. [...] "Good dreams, old Thumb," [...] he whispered; [...] "dreams of Salem that bring him near!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{before he}} had time to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> there was a great noise in the trees near by, as if a big heavy body was {{crashing}} through them. The boy rose and turned his head, and saw a huge black bear coming towards him.|$|E
60|$|To {{follow this}} advice was {{entirely out of}} the question. It would have been {{impossible}} for the weariest of the party to <b>close</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> in slumber, and in silence and fear they waited for the long, dreary hours of the night to pass.|$|E
