Vauxhall Insignia, BMW 5, Skoda Octavia, Volvo V40, Volvo XC70 and the Ford Mondeo have all been used as <b>area</b> <b>cars</b> in recent years.

50|$|Shortly before W.W.I, the Post Office Department began {{assigning}} {{railway mail}} clerks to new Transfer Office positions which were established {{at many of}} the larger railroad junction points as well as passenger terminals in larger cities. These transfer clerks supervised mail exchanges between trains, served as the local liaison between the Railway Mail Service and the host railroad, and maintained detailed statistical records which were used to audit railroad charges for mail transportation and car usage. This latter task involved determining the amount of mail in baggage cars or storage mail cars, a unique process of estimating the <b>car</b> <b>area</b> occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been mailed at depot letter boxes and providing a hand-to-hand receipt for registered mail transferred between connecting railway post office routes. Many of the transfer offices had a unique postmark to cancel the mail which was sorted by the office, and these cancellations are still collected by philatelists and postal historians.|$|E

50|$|An FAA Master Plan for Fort Wayne International Airport, {{the first}} since 2003, was {{completed}} in 2012. The new rental <b>car</b> <b>area</b> (which will bring covered spaces for rental cars) and parking lot reconfiguration (which streamlined the exit for the short- and long-term parking lots) {{were among the first}} improvements to be carried out under the master plan. These occurred in 2014, coinciding with a parking management change from Standard Parking to Republic Parking System, the first such change at the airport in 45 years. Eight car rental agencies serve FWA. The previous car rental lot was modified into a dedicated drop-off and pick-up point for taxis and hotel shuttles. Uber is also authorized to serve the airport as of January 2016. Shortly after the change in parking vendors, the airport started offering airline miles or hotel points for parking, dining, and shopping by becoming a member of the Thanks Again loyalty program along with smartphone parking payments. Parking rates remained unchanged as the vendors changed and Thanks Again was introduced.|$|E

The high density area contains 100 cars/km/lane with only an approximately 10 -m gap between cars. The warning messages were randomly initiated by multiple broadcast senders (1, 2, 3, or 4) inside the collision area only once {{because we wanted to}} precisely measure the performance metrics by eliminating the adverse effect of mixed deliveries of the next broadcast and the current broadcast. Thus, the simulation time was 1 s to wait for all the broadcasts in the network to disappear. We repeated the 1 -s simulation run 1000 times with different random seeds to obtain the averaged value.|$|E

All routine laboratorial exams were normal, EUS revealed pancreatic lesion grade II without involvement of the pancreatic duct and an impressive superior mesenteric vein thrombosis.

30|$|IEEE 802.15. 4 Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN) are envisioned {{to support}} {{ubiquitous}} computing like wireless sensor networks. The standard defines the physical (PHY) layer and {{medium access control}} (MAC) layer specifications for low power devices that wirelessly communicate within Personal Operating Space (POS) around 10 meters or less at low data rates. WPANs are expected to find {{a very important role}} in the application centric ubiquitous networks. With the emergence of this technology, newer application scenarios of WPANs are also emerging. Body Area Networks (BANs) and <b>Car</b> <b>Area</b> Networks (CANs) are just the snapshots of what applications might evolve into the future. Whatsoever the diversification of these networks, one thing might be said with certainty about them—these networks would need to collaborate at various levels and degrees. Although the collaboration within a PAN is a widely studied area, little work can be found for collaboration across PANs. The focus of this work is inter-WPAN communication.|$|E
40|$|Engine {{overheating}} {{problems have}} been the major cause for vehicle breakdown during FSAE endurance runs. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} study the cooling performance, which is affected by the air flow through the side-pod. CFD is used as a tool for this study and simulation based on the complete race car 3 D model (NITK Racing 2012 formula student race car - NR XII) is carried out for different cases. Further, Wind Tunnel Experiment is carried out to validate these results. The results obtained for different cases are analyzed to decide the best configuration of the cooling duct. CFD analysis helped in calculating the mass flow rate through the radiator at various velocities. Pressure distribution and velocity distribution were also obtained {{along the length of the}} side-pod for different velocities of the <b>car.</b> <b>Area</b> of flow separation and turbulence is visualized and thus smooth airflow into the radiator core area is ensured. The amount of drag force generated due to the side-pod geometry and radiator configuration is also measured. This significantly increased the heat rejection and reduced drag...|$|E

40|$|Concealed cars {{extraction}} {{from point}} clouds data acquired by airborne laser scanning has gained its popularity in recent years. However, {{due to the}} occlusion effect, the number of laser points for concealed cars under trees is not enough. Thus, the concealed cars extraction is difficult and unreliable. In this paper, 3 D point cloud segmentation and classification approach based on full-waveform LiDAR was presented. This approach first employed the autocorrelation G coefficient and the echo ratio to determine concealed <b>cars</b> <b>areas.</b> Then the points in the concealed <b>cars</b> <b>areas</b> were segmented with regard to elevation distribution of concealed cars. Based on the previous steps, a strategy integrating backscattered waveform features and the view histogram descriptor was developed to train sample data of concealed cars and generate the feature pattern. Finally concealed cars were classified by pattern matching. The approach was validated by full-waveform LiDAR data and experimental results demonstrated that the presented approach can extract concealed cars with accuracy more than 78. 6 % in the experiment areas. </p...|$|R

The specialization in prostaglandin (PG) production previously described in cells from whole endometrium was reproduced in the CAR and ICAR areas: PGF 2 a and PGE 2 were produced in greater proportions, respectively, in epithelial and stromal cells. The relative produc-tion of PGE 2 was equivalent in epithelial cells from CAR and ICAR regions, but the production of PGF 2 a was higher (p, 0. 05) in the ICAR region (2. 2 6 0. 5 vs. 4. 0 6 0. 2 ng/mg DNA, re-spectively).

Quantitative diaries capturing psychosocial states were filled out on the evening before each study day as well as 45 min post-awakening on the study day. On each study day, salivary free cortisol was determined at 0, 15, 30, and 45 min post-awakening. Relationships between cortisol measures and psychosocial variables were analysed using correlation analyses and relative predictive input of independent variables was further determined using linear regression analysis. Significant relationships were found between psychosocial state variables and the dynamic of the <b>CAR</b> (<b>area</b> under increase curve; AUC(I)). The final regression model for the AUC(I) (explaining approximately 22 % of its variability), included an inverse relationship {{with the level of}} prior-day happiness and a positive relationship with study-day anticipations of the level of obligations/no leisure.

It is envisaged that it will allow for the replacement of the many propriety cables that connect one device to another with one universal radio link. Its key features are robustness, low complexity, low power and low cost. Designed to operate in noisy frequency environments, the Bluetooth radio uses a fast acknowledgement and frequency hopping scheme to make the link robust.
