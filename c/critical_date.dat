2500|$|After Prussia emerged victorious {{over the}} Austrian army at the Battle of Königgrätz (also known as Sadowa or Sadová) in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, {{negotiations}} {{were being held}} between Austria and Prussia in July and August of that year. It was during that period that Napoleon III first discovered that a bladder stone was causing him great pains, created from gonorrheal infection. His condition was so bad during those negotiations that {{he was forced to}} retire to Vichy to recuperate, removing himself from Paris. Although the emperor favored neutrality as to not upset events, certain members of his circle thought it was an unwise move, considering the opportunity to prevent Prussia from becoming too strong. One of these men, foreign minister Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys, convinced the emperor to plant 80,000 men on the eastern border to convince Wilhelm I to maintain {{the balance of power in}} Europe. Despite this important victory, de Lhuys was subverted by several other ministers, and Napoleon III changed his mind, reverting to a position of neutrality. This change of heart would end up causing de Lhuys to ultimately lose his position. Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugénie, who took an active part throughout his rule, referred to this time much later as [...] "the <b>critical</b> <b>date,</b> the Empire's fatal date; it was during these months of July and August that our fate was sealed! Of all that period, there is not a single fact, not a single detail that has not remained in my mind." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceStudies of intra-annual {{dynamics}} of cambial activity and wood formation share very similar data {{because they are}} based on classic concepts of xylem development and well-documented techniques of sample preparation. However, the way the data are produced is specific to each study or group of authors because there is not a real agreement or consensus about critical variable definitions and data processing. The consequence is that despite very similar data, these studies are difficult to compare. In order to improve this point, we proposed objective definitions of the main phenological events (<b>critical</b> <b>dates)</b> occurring during wood formation, i. e. the beginning and ending of the cell enlarging and maturing phases {{and the beginning of the}} cell mature phase. The beginning of a given phase was defined as the date at which 50 % of the observed radial files show at least one first cell in this phase, while the end of a given phase was defined as the date at which 50 % of the observed radial files show at most one last cell in this phase. Dedicated R package CAVIAR was developed in order to apply these definitions to the computation of <b>critical</b> <b>dates,</b> as well as to their visualisation and analysis. Several statistical tests (Student's t-test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and bootstrap tests on means and medians) were evaluated for comparing <b>critical</b> <b>dates</b> between two groups. Based on theoretical considerations and on study case analyses, it was shown that the bootstrap test on median is the best-suited statistical test for comparing <b>critical</b> <b>dates</b> when considering the peculiarities of the data at hand. Finally, the application of the presented definitions and methods was illustrated by the study of a real dataset obtained from five silver firs and five Scots pines grown under the same conditions and sampled weekly during the 2006 vegetation period. The results of this application showed that wood formation in pines started earlier, finished later and lasted longer than in firs, as documented by previous studies. We believe that the development of such objective definitions accompanied by ready-to-use tools for data processing, analysis and visualisation will reinforce the discipline by contributing efficiently to standardise concepts and methodologie...|$|R

5000|$|The circumnavigation of Madagascar {{opened an}} {{alternative}} route {{to get to}} India, which gave more flexibility in timing. The rule that quickly emerged was that if an outbound armada doubled the Cape of Good Hope before mid-July, then it should follow the old [...] "inner route" [...] - that is, sail into the Mozambique Channel, up the East African coast until the equator latitude (around Malindi, Seychelles), then take the southwesterly monsoon across the ocean to India. If, however, the armada doubled the Cape after mid-July, then it was obliged to sail the [...] "outer route" [...] - that is, strike out straight east from South Africa, go under {{the southern tip of}} Madagascar, and then turn up from there, taking a northerly path through the Mascarenes islands, across the open ocean to India. While the outer route did not have the support of African staging posts and important watering stops, it sidestepped sailing directly against the post-summer monsoon.Return fleets were a different story. The principal worry of the return fleets was the fast dangerous waters of the inner Mozambican channel, which was particularly precarious for heavily loaded and less maneuverable ships. In the initial decades, the return fleet usually set out from Cochin in December, although that was eventually pushed forward to January. January 20 was the <b>critical</b> <b>date,</b> after which all return fleets were obliged to follow the outer route (east of Madagascar) which was deemed calmer and safer for their precious cargo. [...] That meant they missed the important watering stop on Mozambique island on the return leg and had to put in elsewhere later, such as Mossel Bay or St. Helena. Between 1525 and 1579, all return fleets were ordered to follow the outer route. This rule was temporarily suspended between the 1570s and 1590s. From 1615, a new rule was introduced whereby return fleets from Goa were allowed to use the inner route, but return fleets from Cochin still had to use the outer route. [...] With the entry of Dutch and English competition in the 1590s, the start of the return legs were delayed until February and March, with the predictable upsurge in lost and weather-delayed ships.|$|E
