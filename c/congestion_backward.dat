40|$|Wireless links are {{characterized}} by high error rates and intermittent connectivity. TCP congestion control has been developed {{on the assumption that}} network congestion is the only cause for packet loss. Upon detecting a packet loss, TCP drops its transmit window resulting in an unnecessary reduction of end-to-end throughput which results in suboptimal performance. The sender has to be made aware by some feedback mechanism that some of the losses reported are not due to congestion. The Active Queue Management algorithms (AQM) are used to reduce congestion, and in this paper, we have analysed four AQM algorithms, Random Early Deduction (RED), Wireless Explicit Congestion Notification (WECN), Queue Management <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Control Algorithm (QMBCCA) and its enhanced version Extended Queue Management <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Control Algorithm (EQMBCCA). WECN, QMBCCA & EQMBCCA algorithms make use of feedback mechanisms. WECN gives feedback using the CE bit. QMBCCA and EQMBCCA make use of ISQ notifications and also the CE bit whenever the average queue size crosses minimum threshold value. EQMBCCA reduces the reverse ISQ traffic by introducing a configurable intermediate threshold value IntThres. The comparison is made in terms of Delay, HTTP packet loss percentage and fairness for FTP flows in a wireless environment. It is found that the performance of EQMBCCA is almost equal to that of QMBCCA and better than RED and WECN...|$|R
40|$|An {{explicit}} rate indication {{scheme for}} congestion avoidance in computer and telecommunication networks is proposed.

40|$|Abstract — IEEE 802. 1 {{standards}} committee {{is working on}} a new specification for congestion notification in Ethernet networks. The goal of this work is to enable application of Ethernet in backend datacenter applications. Such applications typically use Fiber Channel and Infiniband due to their loss-free characteristics. A <b>backward</b> <b>congestion</b> notification (BCN) scheme has been proposed to avoid long delays and minimize loss in Ethernet networks. This paper presents an analysis of this scheme. We develop an analytical model to analyze the stability and the rate of convergence of the scheme. It is shown that BCN achieves proportional fairness and not max-min fairness. Simulation results are presented that validate the analytical results. I...|$|R

TCP {{is used as a}} Transport Protocol for most of the applications on the Internet and is also responsible for adjusting to network congestion dynamically. The Active Queue Management algorithms (AQM) are used to reduce congestion, and in this paper two such AQM algorithms are considered. Here we look at the existing Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) algorithm and a Queue Management <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Control Algorithm (QMBCCA).

40|$|TCP {{tries to}} send {{as quickly as}} possible, yet react to {{congestion}} in the network by reducing its send rate when a packet is dropped. This function, however, only concerns {{one out of the}} two directions that TCP is operating on: from the data sender to the data receiver. The receiver acknowledges data packets, and if these acknowledgements (ACKs) create <b>congestion</b> along the <b>backward</b> path, this is not normally noticed and reacted upon. This thesis presents the first real-life implementation of RFC 5690 – an experimental mechanism that addresses this problem by performing “ACK congestion control”. Validations of this Linux kernel implementation against previously published simulations show that the mechanism performs correctly; various tests indicate under which conditions it is useful but also identify a few shortcomings in the original specification...|$|R
40|$|Microscopic and {{macroscopic}} dynamic traffic models {{not fast}} enough to run in an optimization loop to coordinate traffic measures over areas of twice a trip length (50 x 50 km). Moreover, in strategic planning there are models with a spatial high level of detail, but lacking the features of traffic dynamics. This paper introduces the Network Transmission Model (NTM), a model based on areas, exploiting the Macroscopic or Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). For the first time, a full operational model is proposed which can be implemented in a network divided into multiple subnetworks, and the physical properties of spillback of traffic jams for subnetwork to subnetwork is ensured. The proposed model calculates the traffic flow between to cell as the minimum of the demand in the origin cell and the supply in the destination cell. The demand first increasing and then decreasing as function of the accumulation in the cell; the supply is first constant and then decreasing as function of the accumulation. Moreover, demand over the boundaries of two cells is restricted by a capacity. This system ensures that traffic characteristics move forward in free flow, <b>congestion</b> moves <b>backward</b> and the NFD is conserved. Adding the capacity gives qualitatively reasonable effects of inhomogeneity. The model applied on a test case with multiple destinations, and re-routing and perimeter control are tested as control measures. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Ethernet is {{replacing}} the traditional storage networking technologies like Fiber Channel and Infiniband in Datacenters. The key feature of these traditional technologies {{that make them}} suitable for datacenter is their low-loss low-delay operation. Consequently IEEE 802. 1 standards committee is developing new specification for congestion management for Ethernet in datacenter networks. <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Notification (BCN) and Forward Explicit Congestion Notification (FECN) are two proposals. Each of the proposals has its own advantages and disadvantages. FECN outperforms BCN in fairness and response time while BCN is {{able to respond to}} sudden increases in load in less than a round trip time. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of FECN that takes the best of both proposals and adds BCN if there is a sudden severe congestion. It is shown that E-FECN performs better than the previous proposals. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>backward</b> explicit <b>congestion</b> notification (BECN) to an ATM LAN is investigated {{in order to}} support the dynamic sharing of bandwidth between high-speed, bursty, data traffic sources. The results of a simulation study are presented which suggest that a BECN mechanism may provide simple and effective traffic management for an ATM LAN or campus backbone network of up to at least 50 km diameter. Cell loss due to congestion may be prevented and a link utilization in excess of 80 % may be maintained with only 0. 08 % of the link bandwidth, per active source, carrying <b>backward</b> <b>congestion</b> notification traffic during a congestion event. 1 Introduction Over the last few years the physical topology of local area networks has migrated from the ring and the multidrop bus toward a star configuration [...] - the hub.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel fast <b>backward</b> <b>congestion</b> {{notification}} mechanism for TCP congestion control. The proposed method uses a simple implementation {{to inform the}} traffic source {{at a very early}} stage that the network is becoming overloaded or congested and ask the source to slow down its transmission rate. Since TCP uses acknowledgments (ACKs) to adjust the number of packets sent over the network, the basic idea of our scheme is to control (or delay) TCP ACKs in the access node where its forward connection through the network is congested. To shorten the control loop, the congested network node generates ICMP Source Quench to initiate ACK control at the access node at the onset of congestion. The mechanism is proven very effective to improve TCP throughput and fairness performance and reduce buffer occupancy, by theoretical analysis and simulations. In particular, formulae for buffer occupancy and average throughput are derived relative to the distance between the congested node and the source terminal. It {{is important to note that}} TCP behavior does not have to be amended in any way...|$|R

The BECN mechanism has previously been used in non-IP networks, {{but there has been}} limited experimental investigation into the application of the BECN scheme as congestion control mechanism in IP networks. In this paper, we consider an enhanced algorithm for BECN which uses Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Source Quenches for <b>backward</b> <b>congestion</b> notification in IP networks and undertake comparative performance evaluation of Random Early Detection (RED), Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) and our enhanced BECN mechanism using both longlived TCP bulk transfers and short-lived webtraffic workloads. Our results show that for webtraffic workloads, BECN offers only slight improvement in transfer delay while average goodput for bulk transfers is no worse than that of ECN. For paths that have a high bandwidth delay product our results show that not only can BECN offer significant improvement in average goodput for bulk transfers over the ECN mechanism, but packet drops and transfer delay for short-lived webtraffic connections are also comparatively reduced. Additional observations show that on such paths TCP (NewReno) with RED can offer higher goodput for bulk transfers compared to ECN...|$|R
40|$|At present, {{companies}} and standards organizations are enhancing Ethernet as the unified switch fabric {{for all of}} the TCP/IP traffic, the storage traffic and the high performance computing traffic in data centers. <b>Backward</b> <b>congestion</b> notification (BCN) is the basic mechanism for the end-to-end congestion management enhancement of Ethernet. To fulfill the special requirements of the unified switch fabric, i. e., losslessness and low transmission delay, BCN should hold the buffer occupancy around a target point tightly. Thus, the stability of the control loop and the buffer size are critical to BCN. Currently, the impacts of delay on the performance of BCN are unidentified. When the speed of Ethernet increases to 40 Gbps or 100 Gbps in the near future, the number of on-the-fly packets becomes the same order with the buffer size of switch. Accordingly, the impacts of delay will become significant. In this paper, we analyze BCN, paying special attention on the delay. We model the BCN system with a set of segmented delayed differential equations, and then deduce sufficient condition for the uniformly asymptotic stability of BCN.

40|$|AbstractRapid {{development}} of telecommunication technologies and the ever growing network users demands have made network congestion a prominent problem in today's Internet. Congestion brings significant performance degradation {{to the network}} the Quality-of-Service (QoS). The Active Queue Management algorithms (AQM) are used to reduce congestion. In this paper, two AQM algorithms Extended Queue Management <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Control Algorithm (EQMBCCA) and QMBCCA, which we have proposed earlier are taken in to consideration. QMBCCA makes use of ISQ (Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) Source Quench) signaling mechanism and also the CE (Congestion Experienced) bit whenever the average queue size crosses minimum threshold value. Both of them are redundantly used even for mild congestions. EQMBCCA introduces a configurable intermediate threshold value IntThres between the minimum and maximum values and generates ISQ signals only if the congestion crosses this threshold value. Therefore the generation of ISQ messages is significantly reduced here. There is also reliability since CE bits are also set in the packets once congestion occurs. The two algorithms are compared in terms of ISQ traffic, HTTP packet loss, fairness and average web object transfer delay for short lived web transfers. We {{have found that the}} performance of EQMBCCA is almost equal to that of QMBCCA and there is a significant reduction in the ISQ traffic in the reverse direction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{companies}} and standards organizations are enhancing Ethernet as the unified switch fabric {{for all of}} the TCP/IP traffic, the storage traffic and the interprocess communication(IPC) traffic in Data Center Networks(DCNs). <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Notification(BCN) is the basic mechanism for the end-to-end congestion management enhancement. To fulfill the special requirements of the unified switch fabric that being lossless and of extremely low latency, BCN should hold the queue length around a target point tightly. Thus, the stability of the control loop and the buffer size are critical to BCN. Currently, the impacts of delay on the performance of BCN are unidentified. When the link capacity increases to 40 Gbps or 100 Gbps in the near future, the number of on-the-fly packets becomes the same order with the shallow buffer size of switches. Thus, the impacts of delay on the performance of BCN will become significant. In this paper, we analyze BCN, paying special attention on the delay. Firstly, we model the BCN system with a set of segmented delayed differential equations. Then, the sufficient condition for the uniformly asymptotic stability of the BCN system is deduced.

30|$|Pharmacodynamics {{relates the}} drug {{concentrations}} to its specific effect. For fluids, the Frank–Starling relationship between cardiac output and cardiac preload {{is the equivalent}} of the dose effect curve for standard medications. Because of the shape of the Frank–Starling relationship, the response of cardiac output to the fluid-induced increase in cardiac preload is not constant [44]. The effective dose 50 (ED 50), in pharmacology, is the dose or amount of drug that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in 50 % of the subjects receiving it, whereas lethal dose 50 (LD 50) will result in death of 50 % of recipients. Translated to IV fluids, this would be the dose of fluid that induces, respectively, a therapeutic response or death in 50 % of the patients. The problem is that the therapeutic response varies from one patient to another. Fluid administration can be toxic (or even lethal) at a high enough dose, as demonstrated in 2007 when a California woman died of water intoxication (and hyponatremia) in a contest organized by a radio station ([URL] The difference between toxicity and efficacy is dependent upon the particular patient and the specific condition of that patient, although the amount of fluids administered by a physician should fall into the predetermined therapeutic window. Unanswered questions remain: what is an effective dose of IV fluids? What is the exact desired therapeutic effect? What is the therapeutic window? In some patients, volume expansion increases the mean systemic filling pressure (the backward pressure of venous return), but it increases the right atrial pressure (the forward pressure of venous return) to the same extent, such that venous return and, hence, cardiac output do not increase [45]. Hence, venous <b>congestion</b> and <b>backward</b> failure may even play a more important and currently underestimated role [46]. The probability of the heart to “respond” to fluid by a significant increase in cardiac preload varies along the shock time course, and thus, pharmacodynamics of fluids must be regularly evaluated. At the very early phase, fluid responsiveness is constant. After the very initial fluid administration, only one half of patients with circulatory failure respond to an increase in cardiac output [47].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Congestion is {{intrinsic}} {{to the operation}} of networks and is usually handled {{by a combination of}} algorithms at the link and network/transport layers. Link level algorithms alleviate “transient congestion ” caused by the temporary oversubscription of a link due to a burst of packets arriving at a switch or router buffer. Network or transport level algorithms alleviate “sustained congestion ” which occurs when the longterm arrival rate at a link exceeds its capacity. Algorithms at the two levels interact to provide a scalable, stable and fair bandwidth allocation to the flows passing through the network. Link level algorithms are typically very simple: drop or mark packets with increasing probability as buffer congestion increases; moreover, if a packet arrives at a full buffer, drop it. These dropped or marked packets are used by the transport algorithms to adjust the transmission rate of sources. In this paper we are concerned with networks in which packets cannot be dropped when there is congestion. In such networks a back-pressure mechanism “pauses ” the link or links feeding a congested buffer, thus preventing further packets from arriving at the buffer. The links are later unpaused when the buffer becomes uncongested. This paper is a theoretical study of the stability and fairness properties of network level congestion control when pause mechanisms operate at the link level to prevent packet drops. Our focus is on the <b>Backward</b> <b>Congestion</b> Notification (BCN) algorithm which is being considered by the IEEE 802. 1 standards body for deployment in switched Ethernet networks. I...|$|R
