5|$|Madonna also {{performed}} {{an excerpt of}} the song at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in 2012, where she was joined by Cee Lo Green and by a large marching band. The same year, the song was included on The MDNA Tour. Following an 8-minute monologue against intolerance, the song was reinvented and performed in a Basque, folk acoustic version, relying only on drums, which were played by the Basque band Kalakan, and Madonna's vocal harmony. Madonna's outfit during the performance consisted of an all-leather look, a <b>custom</b> <b>design</b> by Hervé Léger and Max Azria, with knee-high boots and a mini fur bolero, while her dancers were dressed as soldiers.|$|E

25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the <b>custom</b> <b>design</b> of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.|$|E
500|$|Further {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the car once the monocoque had been completed, which included replacing the entire Porsche front suspension setup with a <b>custom</b> <b>design.</b> [...] Bodywork modifications were also carried out by automotive designer Peter Stevens in an attempt to increase the overall downforce of the car on smaller circuits; a narrow wing devised by Lloyd and team manager Greene at the 1984 1000km of Brands Hatch was placed on two vertical struts, attached to the nose of the car between the headlights and fenders. In addition, the standard rear wing was replaced with a two element design at different angles of attack, with a narrow gap between the two. [...] The wings were also constructed from carbon fibre, lighter than the standard material used on 956s.|$|E

500|$|One of Emerson's {{earliest}} production models, the Commander (winner of Blade Magazines Overall Knife of the Year Award for 1999), {{is a large}} recurve {{folding knife}} based on a special <b>custom</b> <b>design,</b> the ES1-M, {{that he had made}} for a West Coast Navy SEAL Team. The Commander has a hook on the spine of the blade (originally designed as a blade catcher) which, when snagged {{on the edge of the}} pocket or sheath, causes the knife blade to open as it is drawn. Due to its visual aesthetic, Emerson called this innovation the [...] "Wave"and secured a patent for it in 1998. Since another knife and tool company, Leatherman, had trademarked the name [...] "Wave," [...] in March 1999 Emerson changed its name to the [...] "wave-shaped opening feature". Emerson's Wave made its way onto most of the knives in both the production and custom lines, with the exception of the Viper models. It is a required feature on all knives that Emerson supplies to military units, search and rescue units, and law enforcement agencies.|$|E
