40|$|G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{comprise}} the largest protein family and mediate {{the vast majority}} of signal transduction processes in the body. Until recently GPCRs were not considered to be voltage dependent. Newly it was shown for several GPCRs that the first step in GPCR activation, the binding of agonist to the receptor, is voltage sensitive: Voltage shifts the receptor between two states that differ in their binding affinity. Here we show that this shift involves the rate <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation.</b> We used the m 2 muscarinic receptor (m 2 R) a prototypical GPCR and measured directly the dissociation of [(3) H]ACh from m 2 R expressed Xenopus oocytes. We show, for the first time, that the voltage dependent change in affinity is implemented by voltage shifting the receptor between two states that differ in their rate <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation.</b> Furthermore, we provide evidence that suggest that the above shift is achieved by voltage regulating the coupling of the GPCR to its G protein...|$|E

Influence of {{the nature}} of a sorbent and acidity of {{solution}} of the irreplaceable coded amino acid – methionine on its interaction with phosphate ion exchangers KRF- 5 p and KF- 7 in the protonated form with use of calorimetric, sorption and spectroscopic methods is studied.

It is established that irrespective of number of functional groups in a cell of a polymeric matrix, coefficients of sorption balance for both cation exchangers are close, and values of sorption capacity on anion of methionine are slightly higher, than in a bipolar form. The direct calorimetric method determined enthalpies of sorption of methionine at various extents of filling of an ion exchanger, is shown that at identical extents of filling of sorbents of an enthalpy of sorption is one KF- 7 lower, than on KRF- 5 p. The conducted researches allowed to assume that from sour solution at low extents of filling the bipolar ion of methionine is absorbed, an ion of hydrogen of the protonated ion exchangers, not forced out in solution, and passes to carboxyl group of amino acid, neutralizing its negative charge. From the alkaline environment at low concentration of methionine ion-exchange sorption with transfer of a proton from ionogenic group of the cation exchanger to carboxyl group of methionine is most probable.

40|$|Human chitotriosidase (HCHT) is {{involved}} in immune response to chitin-containing pathogens in humans. The enzyme is able to degrade chitooligosaccharides as well as crystalline chitin. The catalytic domain of HCHT {{is connected to the}} carbohydrate binding module (CBM) through a flexible hinge region. In humans, two active isoforms of HCHT are found-the full length enzyme and its truncated version lacking CBM and the hinge region. The active site architecture of HCHT is reminiscent to that of the reducing-end exo-acting processive chitinase ChiA from bacterium Serratia marcescens (SmChiA). However, the presence of flexible hinge region and occurrence of two active isoforms are reminiscent to that of non-processive endo-chitinase from S. marcescens, SmChiC. Although the studies on soluble chitin derivatives suggest the endo-character of HCHT, the mode of action of the enzyme on crystalline chitin is not known. Here, we made a thorough characterization of HCHT in terms of the mode of action, processivity, binding, and rate constants for the catalysis and dissociation using α-chitin as substrate. HCHT efficiently released the end-label from reducing-end labelled chitin and had also high probability (95 %) of endo-mode initiation of processive run.

The quality of the functionalization procedure was validated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (surface chemical composition), AFM imaging (surface morphology in aqueous solution), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR, specific binding in aqueous solution). AFM force-distance curves recorded at a loading rate of 5000 pN/s between Fv- and Lyso-modified surfaces yielded a distribution of unbinding forces composed of integer multiples of an elementary force quantum of approximately 50 pN that we attribute to the rupture of a single antibody-antigen pair.

40|$|The phase equilibria of the glycine-KCl-NaCl-H 2 O {{system were}} {{determined}} in the concentrations up to 3. 33 mol. kg(- 1) over the temperature range from 283. 2 to 363. 2 K using a dynamic method. A rigorous chemical {{model for the}} glycine-KCl-NaCl-H 2 O system was established by the Pitzer model {{with the help of}} an OLI platform. With the equilibrium <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> reactions obtained by standard-state thermodynamic data, the new Pitzer model parameters were harvested by regressing solubility of the system. These newly obtained parameters were used to accurately predict the multiple saturated points at the temperature range from 283. 2 to 363. 2 K. The phase behavior of the ternary glycine-KCl-H 2 O and glycine-NaCl-H 2 O system at 298. 2 and 343. 2 K were successfully visualized with lucidity on an equilateral triangle. To investigate the effect of glycine on the morphology of KCl, the KCl crystals were produced from glycine solution with different concentration (17 - 25 % w/v) by evaporation at ambient temperature. The glycine (25 % w/v) -modified KCl crystal changed its morphology from native cubic to hexagonal prism form with the angle of repose from 32 degrees to 23. 8 - 25. 8 degrees, indicating a good flowability and anticaking characteristics. Finally, KCl supersaturation variation with evaporation time was simulated with aid of the chemical model established in present study to elucidate the influence of glycine concentration on the anticaking characteristics of KCl crystal. All the results generated from this study will provide the fundamentals for industrial application to produce crystals with anticaking characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Iodination of toxin II {{from the}} sea anemone Anemonia sulcata gives a labeled monoiododerivative that retains 80 % of the {{original}} neurotoxicity. This derivative binds specifically to rat brain synaptosomes at 20 degrees C and pH 7. 4 with a second-order rate constant of association ka = 4. 6 x 10 (4) M- 1 sec- 1 and a first-order rate <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> kd = 1. 1 x 10 (- 2) sec- 1. The binding occurs on the Na+ channel at a binding site distinct from that of other gating system toxins like batrachotoxin, veratridine, grayanotoxin, aconitine, and pyrethroids. The maximal binding capacity Bmax is 3. 2 pmol/mg of protein (i. e., about two sea anemone toxin binding sites per tetrodotoxin binding site) and the Kd is 240 nM for the monoiododerivative and 150 nM for the native toxin. Corresponding binding parameters for the association of a 125 I-labeled derivative of toxin II from the scorpion Androctonus australis Hector are Bmax = 0. 3 pmol/mg of protein and Kd = 1 nM, whereas the Kd of the unmodified scorpion toxin is 0. 6 nM. Competition experiments involving scorpion toxins, sea anemone toxins, and synaptosomes demonstrate that, although the sea anemone toxin is able to displace the scorpion toxin bound to synaptosomes, the scorpion toxin does not displace the sea anemone toxin. The sea anemone toxin but not the scorpion toxin binds to depolarized synaptosomes. Differences between binding properties of the two polypeptide toxins are analyzed in the discussion...|$|E
40|$|Actin-myosin subfragment- 1 (SF- 1) or actin-heavy meromyosin is dissociated by {{the binding}} of ADP and {{vanadate}} (Vi) under conditions such that ADP {{alone does not}} dissociate the complex. The association constant of the stable complex M. ADP. Vi, in which M indicates myosin [Goodno, C. C. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76, 2620 - 2624] with actin is smaller than the average association constant of the intermediate states of the actin-SF- 1 ATPase cycle. Actin-SF- 1 ATPase activity is 90 % inhibited by ADP plus vanadate. The reaction of actin with M. ADP. Vi produces a slow release of ADP and vanadate and quantitative recovery of ATPase activity. The rate of dissociation of ligands was almost linear in actin concentration; consequently, the rate <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> could only be roughly estimated as 0. 5 - 1 sec- 1. The rate of dissociation of ADP and vanadate is thus increased {{by a factor of}} 10 (5) compared to M. ADP. Vi. The rate of release of ligands by regulated actin (actin-tropomyosin-troponin) was reduced to 1 / 10 th to 1 / 20 th by removal of calcium ion. Therefore the M. ADP. Vi complex has the properties of a more stable analogue of the myosin-ADP-phosphate complex that is generated in the normal ATPase cycle. The activation of ligand release (ratio of rate of dissociation of ADP and vanadate from actomyosin relative to myosin) is much larger than the activation of myosin ATPase by actin, whereas the actual rates of the reactions are much slower...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Monoclonal {{antibody}} mAb 164 {{is directed}} against the TrpB 2 subunit of the Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase. It recognizes the synthetic peptide P 11, constituted of residues 273 - 283 of TrpB, with high affinity. We constructed a hybrid protein in which the C-terminal end of protein MalE was linked with the N-terminal end of P 11. Hybrid MalE-P 11 was produced in E. coli from a plasmidic gene and purified in one step as MalE. MalE-P 11 and the isolated P 11 had identical conformational and functional properties according to the following criteria. The NMR spectra of MalE and MalE-P 11 in TOCSY experiments showed that the P 11 moiety of MalE-P 11 moved independently from its MalE moiety. The chemical shifts of the protons for the P 11 moiety of MalE-P 11 and for the isolated P 11 were very close and did not show significant deviations from random coil values. The equilibrium <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> (KD) from mAb 164, measured by a competition ELISA, was identical for MalE-P 11 and the isolated P 11, around 6 nM. The change of the C-terminal residue of MalE-P 11 from Lys into Ala increased 37 -fold this dissociation constant. This increase showed that the P 11 moiety of MalE-P 11 was not degraded. The high molecular mass of MalE-P 11 allowed us to follow its kinetics of interaction with immobilized mAb 164 by surface plasmon resonance, using the BIAcore apparatus. The rates of association with mAb 164 were similar for MalE-P 11 and TrpB 2, but the dissociation was faster fo...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} further the statistical approach to chromatography initiated by Giddings and Eyring, and applied it to affinity chromatography. By {{means of a}} convenient expression of moments the convergence towards the Laplace-Gauss distribution has been established. The Gaussian character is not preserved if other causes of dispersion are taken into account, but expressions of moments can be obtained in a generalized form. A simple procedure is deduced for expressing the fundamental <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> the model in terms of purely experimental quantities. Thus, affinity chromatography {{can be used to}} determine rate <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> association and <b>dissociation</b> in a range considered as the domain of the stopped-flow methods...|$|R
40|$|Antibody mAb 164 is {{directed}} against the native form of the TrpB 2 subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan syn-thase. It recognizes a synthetic peptide, P 11, constituted of residues 273 – 283 of TrpB, with high affinity. We intro-duced 16 single and 3 double mutations {{in each of the}} two contexts, TrpB 2 and P 11, and used them as local probes to study the cross-reactivity of mAb 164 toward these two antigens. The equilibrium <b>constant,</b> KD, <b>of</b> <b>dissociation</b> from mAb 164 was measured for each of the mutant derivatives of TrpB 2 and P 11 by a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with the wild type one. The variation of the free energy of interaction, DDG, covered nearly 8 kcal/mol for the different mutations. The values of DDG for the mutant derivatives of TrpB 2 and for those of P 11 were close an...|$|R
40|$|Devoted to Prof. Rolando Guidelli on the {{occasion}} of his 65 th birthday. The apparent proton <b>dissociation</b> <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> a commercial alginic acid have been obtained in KNO 3 and NaCl at concentrations ranging between 0. 01 and 2 mol·L- 1. An analysis of the dependence on the ionic strength at a <b>constant</b> value <b>of</b> the <b>dissociation</b> degree was done by means of empirical functions derived from the Gibbs-Donnan formalism for polyelectrolytes and a specific ion interaction theory (SIT). Both functions were able to fit the experimental data, although SIT yielded rather high errors in the fitted parameters due to a problem of multicollinearity, in contrast to the function derived from the Gibbs-Donnan approach...|$|R
