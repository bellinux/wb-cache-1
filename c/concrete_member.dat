5000|$|Constructability - Reinforced {{concrete}} must be poured {{and left}} to set, or harden. After setting (typically 1-2 days), a concrete must cure, the process in which concrete experiences a chemical reaction between the cementitious particles and the water. The curing process is complete after 28 days; however, construction may continue after 1-2 weeks, depending {{on the nature of}} the structure. Concrete can be constructed into nearly any shape and size. Approximately half of the cost of using reinforced concrete in a structural project is attributed to the construction of the form-work. In order to save time, and therefore costs, structural concrete members may be pre-cast. This refers to a reinforced concrete beam, girder, or column being poured off site {{and left to}} cure. After the curing process, the <b>concrete</b> <b>member</b> may be delivered to the construction site and installed as soon as it is needed. Since the <b>concrete</b> <b>member</b> was cured off location beforehand, construction may continue immediately after erection.|$|E

50|$|In {{structural}} engineering {{and in particular}} concrete design the positive moment is drawn on the tension side of the member. This convention puts the positive moment below the beam described above. A convention of placing moment diagram on the tension side allows for frames {{to be dealt with}} more easily and clearly. Additionally placing the moment on the tension side of the member shows the general shape of the deformation and indicates on which side of a <b>concrete</b> <b>member</b> rebar should be placed, as concrete is weak in tension.|$|E
50|$|Shrinkage cracks {{occur when}} {{concrete}} members undergo restrained volumetric changes (shrinkage) {{as a result}} of either drying, autogenous shrinkage or thermal effects. Restraint is provided either externally (i.e. supports, walls, and other boundary conditions) or internally (differential drying shrinkage, reinforcement). Once tensile strength of the concrete is exceeded, a crack will develop. The number and width of shrinkage cracks that develop are influenced by the amount of shrinkage that occurs, the amount of restraint present and the amount and spacing of reinforcement provided.These are minor indications and have no real structural impact on the <b>concrete</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The tallest {{structures}} today (commonly called [...] "skyscrapers" [...] or high-rise) {{are constructed}} using structural steel due to its constructability, {{as well as its}} high strength-to-weight ratio. In comparison, concrete, while being less dense than steel, has a much lower strength-to-weight ratio. This is due to the much larger volume required for a structural <b>concrete</b> <b>member</b> to support the same load; steel, though denser, does not require as much material to carry a load. However, this advantage becomes insignificant for low-rise buildings, or those with several stories or less. Low-rise buildings distribute much smaller loads than high-rise structures, making concrete the economical choice. This is especially true for simple structures, such as parking garages, or any building that is a simple, rectilinear shape.|$|E

50|$|Structures {{consisting}} of both materials utilize {{the benefits of}} structural steel and reinforced concrete. This is already common practice in reinforced concrete in that the steel reinforcement is used to provide steel's tensile strength capacity to a structural <b>concrete</b> <b>member.</b> A commonly seen example would be parking garages. Some parking garages are constructed using structural steel columns and reinforced concrete slabs. The concrete will be poured for the foundational footings, giving the parking garage a surface to be built on. The steel columns will {{be connected to the}} slab by bolting and/or welding them to steel studs extruding {{from the surface of the}} poured concrete slab. Pre-cast concrete beams may be delivered on site to be installed for the second floor, after which a concrete slab may be poured for the pavement area. This can be done for multiple stories. A parking garage of this type is just one possible example of many structures that may use both reinforced concrete and structural steel.|$|E
50|$|Corrosion - Reinforced concrete, when {{constructed}} properly, has excellent {{corrosion resistance}} properties. Concrete {{is not only}} resistant to water, but needs it to cure and develop its strength over time. However, the steel reinforcement in the concrete must not be exposed {{in order to prevent}} its corrosion as this could significantly reduce the ultimate strength of the structure. The American Concrete Institute provides the necessary design specifications for an engineer to ensure there is enough concrete covering any steel reinforcement to prevent exposure to water. This cover distance must be specified because concrete will inevitable crack at locations carrying tension, or locations containing reinforcing bars for the purpose of carrying said tension. If the concrete cracks, it provides a path for water to travel directly to the reinforcing bars. Some reinforcing bars are coated in epoxy as a second order measure of preventing corrosion due to water contact. This method induces higher costs on the overall project, however, due to the higher cost of the epoxy coated bars. Also, when using epoxy coated bars, reinforced concrete members must be designed larger, as well as stronger, in order to balance the loss of friction between the reinforcing bars and concrete. This friction is referred to as bond strength, and it is vital to the structural integrity of a <b>concrete</b> <b>member.</b>|$|E

The paper focuses on degradation of reinforced <b>concrete</b> flexural <b>members</b> and shear walls due to the loss of steel reinforcing area and loss of concrete area (cracking/spalling). Loss of steel area is typically caused by corrosion while cracking and spalling can be caused by corrosion of reinforcing steel, freeze-thaw, or aggressive chemical attack.

This phenomenon, which happens early after a fire starts (about twenty minutes), {{is one of the}} most detrimental effects causing damage to <b>concrete</b> <b>members.</b> It can trigger an immediate degradation of concrete, exposure of steel reinforcements to high temperatures and then eventually can cause failure of the <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> during or after a fire by decreasing the residual mechanical properties and durability of the structure.

Hence, more comprehensive studies on simulating the behaviour of <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> exposed to fire to investigate the real physics involved and the affecting factors on this phenomenon are currently lacking. The current study at University of Melbourne is attempted to fill this gap.

40|$|CD-ROM included; A thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Civil Engineering for the MSc in Civil EngineeringReinforced concrete is a very versatile and durable building material. Reinforced concrete efficiently combines the best properties of concrete and reinforcing steel into a strong structural element. As a result of this, nowadays, we have vast number of reinforced concrete structures all over the world. At the same time, the deterioration of reinforced concrete structures has become a problem. Deterioration of concrete can {{take the form of}} corrosion of the internal reinforcing or degradation of the exposed surface of the material. Even though, the high alkalinity of concrete helps to protect the embedded steel from corrosion initially, this will occur with the degradation of the exposed surface of the material which causes excessive cracking. Despite of these deteriorations which reduce the structural performances, reinforced concrete structures are subjected to an abrupt usage during service lives. Quite often, this includes changing floor usage (Often increasing loads) and reusing abandoned structures. Also, both monumental as well as water retaining concrete structures which have long history of surviving should be assessed regularly to check safety against progressive weakening. Therefore, both cracking of exposed concrete surface and steel corrosion result to unpredictable behaviours of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> under loading and this may cause significantly for both capacity reduction of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> as well as loss of serviceability requirements. The use of finite element technique to look at the effect of concrete cracking and steel corrosion to ultimate load carrying capacities and serviceability requirements of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> has been well accepted because of capability of simulating concrete cracking and concrete-steel bond deterioration due to steel corrosion with other non linearities. Nowadays, there are advanced finite element packages {{that can be used for}} this type of modelling. But, unfortunately, the use of those in developing countries like Sri Lanka has been avoided since they are quite expensive. Therefore, this study aims to develop a finite element procedure in which concrete cracking and steel corrosion are simulated using available and relatively cheap computer package named “ANSYS”. The study deals with the non linear finite element analysis of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members.</b> <b>Concrete</b> and reinforcing steel are represented by separate material models and steel [iv] reinforcements are introduced in to the models by both discrete as well as smeared approaches. Both concrete and steel are treated as inelastic materials in which stress states continue beyond the initial elastic limit up to the final failure point and the modelling are done in the commercial package called “ANSYS”. The behaviour of cracked concrete is described by a system of orthogonal cracks, which follow the principal strain directions and are thus rotating during the load history. Crushing or cracking of concrete takes place when the strains lie outside the ultimate surface in the biaxial strain space. The finite element simulations are done for both damaged and undamaged reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members.</b> Damages include <b>concrete</b> flexural cracking and corrosion of steel reinforcements. Finally, correlation studies between analytical and experimental results and several parameter studies are conducted with the objective to investigate both crack initiations and propagations in reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> under applied loads as well as effect of damages to the load carrying capacities and serviceability conditions of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members.</b> Experiments on non corroded members are done while the experimental results on corroded reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> are collected from the literature. These studies show that the finite element models created in ANSYS could produce good agreements to the experimental results in terms of stiffness, initial cracking load, yield load, failure load, strain in reinforcement and yield line pattern etc. The normalized values of deflections determined using experimental data show that actual reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> are undergoing expected behaviours. The deflections in both actual and finite element model slabs are increased by more than 50 % after introducing the damage due to flexural cracking by an initial loading. Also, developed finite element model was able to simulate high localized corrosion in reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> and produced a good agreement to the experimental results. The finite element results prove that the corrosion of reinforcement below approximately 2 % of area loss doesn’t affect seriously on the load carrying capacities of reinforced <b>concrete</b> <b>members</b> whereas the corrosion beyond that reduces the interface bonding which results to a sudden capacity loss...|$|R
