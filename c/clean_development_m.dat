40|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, {{developed}} countries can only tap mitigation opportunities {{in developing countries}} by investing in projects under the <b>Clean</b> <b>Development</b> Mechanism. Yet <b>Clean</b> <b>Development</b> Mechanism investments have so far failed to reach many of the high-potential sectors identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This raises doubts about whether the <b>Clean</b> <b>Development</b> Mechanism can generate an adequate supply of credits from the limited areas where it has proved successful. This paper examines the current trajectory of mitigation projects entering the <b>Clean</b> <b>Development</b> Mechanism pipeline and projects it forward {{under the assumption that}} the diffusion of the <b>Clean</b> <b>Development</b> Mechanism will follow a path similar to other innovations. Projections are then compared with pre-Clean Development Mechanism predictions of the mechanism’s potential market size to discern whether limits on the types of projects entering the pipeline have limited the expected supply of certified emission reductions. Parameter tests suggest {{that this is not the}} case and that currently identified <b>Clean</b> <b>Development</b> Mechanism investments will generate offsets in excess of early model predictions. In particular, under favorable circumstances, the mechanism is on track to deliver an average annual flow of roughly 700 million certified emission reductions by the close of 2012 and nearly to 1, 100 million certified emission reductions by 2020.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} for Japan to support the development of desulfurization policies of China to solve global and local environmental problems. This study proposes a "double <b>clean</b> <b>development</b> mechanism" to reduce both CO 2 and SO 2 emissions at the same time. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the consequences for both countries' energy economies of following double <b>clean</b> <b>development</b> mechanism between Japan and China. A dynamic optimization model is developed to estimate the effects of Japanese investments in China for carbon dioxide recovery-disposal and emission desulfurization technologies. The simulation results suggest that a double <b>clean</b> <b>development</b> mechanism can effectively mitigate the damage caused by SO 2 emissions because the <b>clean</b> <b>development</b> mechanism itself can reduce SO 2 emissions, e. g. by switching to fuels. However, China might not be willing to accept restrictions on SO 2 emissions. This study also examines whether China will be able to maintain high growth rates with a <b>clean</b> <b>development</b> mechanism under the CO 2 and SO 2 restriction. The analysis shows that increasing the upper limit of investment from Japan to China can enhance the economies of the both nations. The effect of nuclear power installation on economic performance is also investigated for the both nations. ...|$|R
