40|$|Multi-storey timber {{buildings}} are becoming internationally {{more and more}} common. The thriving forces behind this trend involve the sustainable aspects of the material and the rapid development of innovative engineered timber elements. An example of an engineered timber element are crosslaminated timber (CLT) panels. CLT panels consist of cross-wise glued layers of timber to obtain panels {{that can be used}} as wall and floor elements. Another innovative trend is the modular construction method. This method is based on the prefabrication of modules as building compartments, which can be stacked on-site to form a cellular building type. Reasons for this trend, are the increased building speed and the benefits of repetitive fabrication in a controlled environment. The first application of a modular multi-storey timber building is Hotel Jakarta in Amsterdam, for which construction started in 2016. This building was the reason for this master thesis, in which the following question was formulated. What is the structural behaviour of a cross-laminated timber module system, how can it be designed and is it possible to construct a ‘self-supporting’ system of modules for a tall timber building? In order to answer the research question, a literature research has been done to investigate the aspects involved with tall timber buildings, modular construction, the material cross-laminated timber and the connections. Then a universally applicable module with a concrete floor slab and CLT walls and ceiling elements was specified. A design case of 8 modules in height and 8 modules in width, placed onto a concrete podium structure, has been investigated. To examine the structural behaviour of the modular assembly in terms of deformations and force distribution a 3 D finite element model was made. Then, by using the obtained knowledge, resistance calculations have been made to find the critical limits for this design case. For this design case it was proven that a multi-storey modular cross-laminated timber building composition is a structurally viable solution. The limiting factors for maximum building height and maximum slenderness are, the fire situation in relation to buckling of the side wall, the connection strength of the stabilization wall and the maximum deformation due to rotation of the stabilization wall involving bending of the floor and <b>ceiling</b> <b>element.</b> Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural EngineeringTimber Structures and Wood Technolog...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} damage {{assessment}} methodology for the non-structural <b>elements,</b> especially <b>ceiling</b> <b>elements</b> of a building, utilizing an inspection robot. The developed inspection robot {{equipped with a}} wireless camera and data processing function has a capability of providing valuable information for the repair and maintenance decision making of a damaged structure. The inspection robots {{will be able to}} estimate the damage condition without any process of engineers’ on-site-inspection involved. The robots also can gather the static data of the nonstructural elements from the sensor, which are distributed on the nonstructural elements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the inspection robot, the robot is utilized to estimate the ceiling of a real structure damaged by the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. And conceptual experiment is also conducted for the purpose of evaluating the proposed damage assessment methodology in cooperation with the smart sensor and the inspection robot. The proposed methodology will provide useful information to the maintenance and repair planning of a damaged structure...|$|R
50|$|An {{extensive}} expansion {{was done}} in 1704 by Lorenzo Fernandez de Iglesias, an important architect of the time, {{under the auspices of}} Archbishop Manuel Arias. The work joined together differing architectural styles, adorned with pilasters that are located on a broad base. The Main Hall (or Salon), painted by Antonio Mohedano, consists of four columns, two on each side of a ledge, adorned with two statues of saints. Mohedano was famous for the representations of natural objects such as birds, flowers and fruits. Hence, Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez in his Diccionario historico de los mas ilustres profesores de las Bellas Artes de Espana ("Dictionary of the most illustrious historical faculty of Fine Arts in Spain"), attributed to him the artistry of the ornamental <b>ceiling</b> <b>elements</b> in the Main Salon and the Prelate Gallery. In addition to the frescoed ceiling, there are 70 paintings exalting the Catholic Church. There is a mural of five Apostles by Juan de Zamora.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{creation}} of highly detailed components {{presented in this}} paper builds upon our previously introduced technique for creating complete models from {{only a small number of}} measured seed points. Here, we aim at increasing the level of automation in 3 D reconstruction of scenes from a small number of images. We build highly detailed model components, for example; windows, columns, groin-vaulted <b>ceilings</b> <b>elements,</b> and arches with large number of automatically created points. The components are created to be reusable in other parts of the model, or any other model, which are similar in shape, but may vary in dimensions. Our approach works directly on the images and performs accurate transformations and scaling automatically without trials and errors. We developed a copy and paste procedure that automatically re-triangulates the base model to account for the pasted element. By creating reusable higher-level building blocks that can be integrated to form a highly detailed model, a growing library of image-based reusable components will materialize. This will significantly reduce the effort, time, and expertise required to create detailed 3 D models from images. 1...|$|R

40|$|Non-structural {{components}} in most types of commercial building represent {{a major portion}} of the total cost of the building and, as such, will represent {{a large portion of the}} potential losses to owners, occupants, and insurance companies. Non structural components may be classified in three broad categories: architectural components, mechanical and electrical equipment, and contents. Non-structural components play a fundamental role about safety of human lives during seismic events: in fact the collapse of suspended light fixtures, hung ceilings or partition walls; the plunging onto the ground of failed cladding panels, parapets, signboards, ornaments, or glass panels; the overturning of heavy equipment, book-shelves, storage racks, or pieces of furniture; and the rupture of pipes or containers with toxic materials are all capable of causing serious injury or death. In this work seismic performance of suspended ceiling systems has been analyzed by plotting fragility curves obtained through real scale tests. In particular seismic assessment of suspended ceiling systems is carried out by performing shake table tests: in fact being <b>ceilings</b> <b>elements</b> not amenable to structural analysis, full-scale testing is the only feasible possibility to develop fragility curves. In particular single and double frame ceilings are tested on simulator platform (a 3 m × 3 m square table and two orthogonal horizontal degree of freedom system). The input to the table is provided through artificial time histories accelerations representative of expected/target ground motion and acting simultaneously along the two orthogonal directions of the platform simulator; these time histories are selected with the aim of matching the target or required response spectrum of non structural components. Three limit states are used in this study to characterize the seismic response of suspended ceiling systems, both single frame and double frame, and in particular: occupancy limit state (10 % damage), damage limit state (30 % damage) and safety limit state (50 % damage). From the first to the third one limit state considered, the damage in the ceiling increases: in fact when performing a damage analysis with fragility curves, the response is characterized as function of a damage state. Limit states are considered to be reached starting from visual detection of post-test condition of the specimen; indeed, at the end of shaking of each step in a test cycle, research team investigates accurately the physical conditions of components of ceilings in order to identify which limit state has been reached...|$|R
