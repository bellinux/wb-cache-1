40|$|Master of EducationThis {{study was}} {{commissioned}} as a formative {{evaluation of the}} Austin Hospital's Community Advisory <b>Committee</b> (CAC) <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> The CAC was the Hospital's attempt to establish and develop dialogue with its community. Also the structure provided {{a model for other}} Victorian hospitals attempting to establish interaction with their communities. The aim of the study was twofold: to investigate the successes and identify areas for improvement in the operation of the CAC; and to develop a provisional normative theory for the development and operation of a hospital and community advisory structure of this kind. Questionnaires and interviews of key informants were used to gather information. Content analysis was used to organise the data into meaningful categories. Findings from the questionnaire related to four areas: membership and structure of the CAC <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> parties; the terms of reference of the CAC; the mode of operation of the CAC <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> parties; <b>and</b> future directions of the CAC <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> Members found that the CAC provided a unique opportunity to discuss, debate and share information with a diverse range of health advisers, planners and providers. But a strong need was expressed for further consumer and community representation on the Committee. Perceptions differed about the success of the <b>Committee</b> <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> in meeting the terms of reference. Underlying these differences may be the need for stronger communication between the Hospital Board of Management, the <b>Committee</b> <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> to ensure members are equally informed. Members strongly valued the opportunity to act on issues rather than just discuss areas of concern. The <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> were perceived to be the main strength of the Committee structure due to their action orientation. Suggestions for future directions of the. <b>Committee</b> <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> ranged from improving service provision to issues such as consumer rights and resource allocation. The interviews gathered important additional information in three main areas: communication; commitment; and the direction of the <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> Analysis of this data flagged the following issues: i) the need for stronger communication between the CAC <b>and</b> the <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> including the vital role of the Chairs of the <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> in providing leadership and communication; ii) concern about the apparently centralised role of the Chair of the CAC; iii) the need for selection criteria for the Chairs and members of the CAC structure; and, iv) the importance of orientation, training and continuing education of members. Significantly, some of the most successful projects of the CAC were linked to the notion of the Hospital responding {{to the needs of the}} community. Following discussion of the findings, several conclusions were drawn. These include the need to: i) adequately resource the CAC <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> parties; ii) strengthen the role of the community in the areas of policy and planning, funding and service provision; iii) improve the consumer and broad community representation on the CAC <b>and</b> <b>working</b> parties; iv) strengthen linkages to the Hospital's Board of Management; v) address the issues of the balance of power on the CAC together with empowering CAC <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>party</b> members; vi) undertake annual planning and evaluation sessions, with the emphasis on actionorientation and responding to the needs of the community; vii) ensure the Chairs of the CAC <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> have adequate leadership skills; and, viii) develop orientation, training and continuing education programs for members. The evaluation provided the opportunity to propose a normative program theory for the development and operation of a successful hospital community advisory structure. The model was based on a concept map using the four levels of principles, structures, mechanisms and outcomes. This map is an overall conceptual framework for the development and operation of a hospital community advisory committee. Further it may be used to improve the function of a community advisory structure that is already operating. It was theorised that the successful development and operation of such a structure is based on the following principles: participation; accountability; equity; and access. The structure consists of a main committee, chaired by a committed, skilled senior hospital person, and relevant standing <b>and</b> ad hoc <b>working</b> <b>parties,</b> chaired by skilled and committed community leaders. Members of the <b>committee</b> <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> can include: members of the hospital board of management; consumer representatives; hospital and community managers; hospital and community service providers; and local government councillors and health care workers. Members of the <b>committee</b> <b>and</b> its <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> can take a range of actions to contribute to the desired outcomes for the hospital and the community. These include: assessing the needs and problems of the community; developing goals and objectives; planning and implementing policies, programs or services; evaluating projects; and participating in orientation, training and continuing education of members. These activities can be undertaken in the key areas of: policy making and planning; funding; and service provision. The activities in the aforementioned areas may be implemented in the fields of: health education and health promotion; patient care; rehabilitation, domiciliary and palliative care; and health care of disadvantaged groups. The desired outcomes can include: less inappropriate hospital admissions; improved discharge planning; enhanced continuity of care; and diminished duplication in service provision. Overall the result can be a more responsive, effective, efficient and higher quality health care for the consumers of health care services. Many of the aspects of this framework remain problematic. For example, the role of the hospital in health education and health promotion and member's level of participation in policy making and planning. Further, issues such as adequate resourcing of the committee structure, the skills and commitment of the key players and issues related to the balance of power on the <b>committee</b> <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> require discussion <b>and</b> debate. Addressing such issues remains crucial to the successful development and operation of a hospital community advisory structure and ultimately the outcomes for consumers of health care services.

5000|$|Beyond these general {{principles}} however, few details {{of an actual}} demoicracy are spelled out. To remedy this, Cheneval and Schimmelfenning {{with a team of}} researchers at ETH Zurich have embarked on a project intended 'to map and explain the development of demoicratic institutions.' A precious few examples of genuine demoicratic institutions have been identified by other researchers. Bohman celebrates the system of policy coordination through committees and agencies in the EU as a demoicratic mechanism. This is noteworthy, as from the traditional, that is demo-cratic, perspective the influence of numerous EU <b>committees</b> <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> is quite questionable. In the same vein, Michael Buess reconsiders the interaction between the EU agencies and their national counterparts from demoicratic perspective. [...] Another example of demoicratically interlinked institutions is the so-called ‘yellow card’ or Early Warning Mechanism introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. According to Vesco Paskalev this is an attempt to provide an institutionalized network which enables many demoi to deliberate together on substantive EU legislation.|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of a learning community in regional Tasmania {{from a third}} age perspective June Hazzlewood, PhD Candidate, Faculty of Education, University of Tasmania A study {{of a group of}} older adults crossing actual and virtual community boundaries as they learn about and via new technology in retirement, has enabled a picture to be formed of a vibrant multi-faceted learning community in northern regional Tasmania. These third age learners range along lifelong and lifewide learning pathways, which stretch from crystal set byways to crystal chip highways, as they come to terms with yet another of the many changes they have experienced over the past decades. A closer look at their community networks reveals the macro level strategies and visions which established and continue to shape Launceston as a learning city {{at the heart of a}} learning community. The paper also touches on some of the varied learning opportunities that are available in the adult community education (ACE) sector. As well as at formal and informal courses and classes, learning takes place at special interest groups, clubs, organisations and associations, through membership of peer networks and service on a range of government and non-government <b>committees</b> <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties.</b> As the first of the ‘baby boomers ’ are adding to the numbers in the third age learning community population, new approaches are called for. Risks and dilemmas facing service providers, policy makers, NGOs and individuals themselves are identified and strategies are sought to match new 21 st century needs and interests.

40|$|From the Introduction]. The European Institute of Public Administration is {{currently}} conducting a two-year research project on "Governance by Committee: the Role of Committees in European Policy Making and Policy Implementation". The research is partly {{funded by the}} key action "Improving Human Potential and the Socio-Economic Knowledge Base" within the Fifth Framework Programme for Research of the European Community. The proliferation {{of different types of}} committees performing different functions in the political process characterises contemporary governance at the national, sub-national (regional and local) and supranational (European) levels of government. The increasing role of committees {{can be seen as a}} response to the need for an ever-higher level of technical expertise, which stems from the growing complexity of regulating contemporary western societies. In multi-level governance systems such as federal political systems, committees also perform another function: they are mechanisms ensuring efficient co-ordination between the different levels of government. The growing regulatory tasks of the European Community and the need for multi-level co-ordination explain why the committee system is so highly developed in the EC [...] Committee structures and processes vary from one policy area to another. The research concentrates on five different policy fields (internal market – in particular telecommunications, the environment, research and development, social affairs and culture). Furthermore, it focuses on committees in the legislative process (the standing committees of the European Parliament and the <b>committees</b> <b>and</b> <b>working</b> <b>parties</b> of the Council) and in the policy implementation process (comitology committees). These three types of committees will be analysed in different subprojects. In addition, a forth subproject will focus on the legitimacy of as well as citizens’ perceptions of the EC Committee system...|$|E
