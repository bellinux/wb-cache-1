50|$|Derivatives {{are more}} common in the modern era, but their origins trace back several centuries. One of the oldest {{derivatives}} is rice futures, which have been traded on the Dojima Rice Exchange since the eighteenth century. Derivatives are broadly categorized by the relationship between the underlying asset and the derivative (such as forward, option, swap); the type of underlying asset (such as equity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, interest rate derivatives, <b>commodity</b> <b>derivatives,</b> or credit derivatives); the market in which they trade (such as exchange-traded or over-the-counter); and their pay-off profile.|$|E

The issue of convergence of securities and <b>commodity</b> <b>derivative</b> markets was discussed at various levels in the Government.

40|$|Liberalization in {{commodity}} markets {{has brought}} profound {{changes in the}} way price risks are allocated and managed in commodity subsectors. Price risks are increasingly allocated to private traders and farmers rather than absorbed by the government. The success of market reform depends on the ability of the emerging private sector to make full use of the available range of modern commodity marketing, price risk management and financing instruments. Because farmers do not generally have access to these instruments, intermediaries must be developed. Larger private traders and banks are {{in the best position to}} become these intermediaries. Preconditions needed for accessing modern commodity marketing, price risk management, and financing instruments are: a) creating an appropriate legal, regulatory, and institutional framework; b) reducing government intervention; c) providing training and raising awareness; and d) improving creditworthiness and reducing performance risk. The use of <b>commodity</b> <b>derivative</b> instruments to hedge commodity price risk is not new. The private sectors in many Asian and Latin American countries have been using commodity futures and options for some time. More recently, <b>commodity</b> <b>derivative</b> instruments are being used increasingly in several African countries and many economies in transition.

AIGFP's sponsored a major study on the historical performance of commodity futures by professors Gary Gorton and K. Geert Rouwenhorst. AIGFP created a specialized credit business.

In 2003, it absorbed subsidiary, AIG Trading Group (AIG-TG) which dealt primarily in over the counter derivatives and created the Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index (DJ-AIGCI) from their offices in Greenwich, CT. At that point, the Market and Credit Risk management groups were reduced in size. The DJ-AIGCI is a leading commodity benchmark composed of 19 futures contracts on physical commodities. As of the end of June 2007, there was an estimated $38 billion invested in financial products that track the DJ-AIGCI on a global basis.|$|E
