25|$|Chile {{produces}} around 12 million {{bottles of}} sparkling wine per annum of which only around 1.6 million bottles are exported to overseas markets. Although sparkling wines {{have been made}} since 1879, {{they have not yet}} established a significant place in Chile's wine portfolio. In recent years, the Pais grape variety has been creatively employed on its own or in blends, to make modern wines that have received favorable reviews. A rise in consumer demand and an ever-broadening selection of cool climate grapes has led to an increase in fresh and delightful sparkling wines ranging from bone dry extra brut to off-dry demi-secs, from blanc de blanc to blanc de noir to sparkling rosé. Valdivieso produce 60% of all sparkling wine in Chile. Most is inexpensive tank method fizz, but 20% is very good quality <b>Champagne</b> <b>method</b> from Pinot and Chardonnay. There is also a product made from a blend of sparkling Pinot wine and fresh handpicked strawberry pulp.|$|E
25|$|In California, American {{sparkling}} wine producers wishing {{to emulate the}} <b>Champagne</b> <b>method</b> began planting Pinot Meunier in the 1980s. Today most of the state's plantings {{are located in the}} Carneros AVA. Bouchaine Vineyards, Mumm Napa and Domaine Chandon are a few wineries in the all of the Napa Valley to produce a still Pinot Meunier. In Australia, the grape has had a longer history in Australian wine production than Pinot noir. In the Grampians region of Victoria, Pinot Meunier was known at one time as Miller's Burgundy and used to make still red varietal wine. In the late 20th century plantings were starting to decline until a revival of Champagne-style {{sparkling wine}} took hold in the 2000s which sparked renewed interest in Pinot Meunier. The New Zealand wine industry has recently discovered Pinot Meunier for both still & sparkling wine production. As a varietal red wine, Pinot Meunier tends to produce slightly jammy, fruit wines with moderate acidity and low tannins.|$|E
