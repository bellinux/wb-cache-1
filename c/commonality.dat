40|$|According to structure-mapping theory, {{the process}} of {{comparison}} is one of alignment and mapping between representational structures.

40|$|This study {{presents}} robust empírical {{evidence suggesting}} {{the existence of}} significant liquidity <b>commonalities</b> in the corporate Credit Default Swap (CDS) market. Using daily data for 438 firms from 25 countries in the period 2005 - 2012 we find that these <b>commonalities</b> vary over time, being stronger in periods in which the global, counterparty, and funding liquidity risks increase. However, <b>commonalities</b> do not depend on finn's characteristics. The leve! of the liquidity <b>commonalities</b> differs across economic areas being on average stronger in the European Monetary Union.

Although the ADV had 80% parts <b>commonality</b> with the Tornado IDS, the ADV had greater acceleration, improved RB199 Mk.104 engines, a stretched body, greater fuel capacity, the AI.24 Foxhunter radar, and software changes.

5|$|Another {{chance for}} the F-20 was as an upgrade for the Air National Guard (ANG). Northrop claimed that the F-20's fast {{scramble}} time made it a natural fit for this role, its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers, and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not. Additionally, the ANG would not be competing with the Air Force for production quotas, {{they would be able}} to replace their aircraft more quickly. However, the Air Force's requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role; if the ANG flew the F-16, they would further lower unit costs, maintain <b>commonality</b> between the ANG and USAF, and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles. The Congressional Budget Office had also disputed Northrop's lower cost claim in their own research. On 31 October 1986, the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected, which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7. As several nations had suggested they would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF, the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop.|$|E
5|$|In early 2006 {{a project}} office was {{established}} within the Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) {{to evaluate the}} options for acquiring heavy lift aircraft. The office considered the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, which was in service with the USAF at the time, {{as well as the}} Airbus A400M Atlas, which was yet to make its first flight. Boeing aggressively marketed the C-17 to the Australian Government during this period. Though unstated, <b>commonality</b> with the USAF and the United Kingdom's RAF was also considered advantageous. In March 2006, Minister for Defence Brendan Nelson announced that the government had decided to purchase three C-17s and take out an option for a fourth. Nelson also announced that the C-17s would be operated by No. 36 Squadron RAAF, which was to transfer its C-130H Hercules to No. 37 Squadron and relocate from RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales to RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland. Amberley was selected over Richmond as the base for the Globemasters as its runways and engineering facilities were better able to support large aircraft.|$|E

The journalists also got to ask questions to the representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background. The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the <b>commonality</b> with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Theories of {{similarity}} generally {{agree that the}} similarity ofa pair increases with its <b>commonalities</b> and decreases with its differences. Recent research suggests that this comparison process involves an alignment of structured representations yielding <b>commonalities,</b> differences related to the <b>commonalities,</b> and differences unrelated to the <b>commonalities.</b> One counterintuitive prediction of this view is {{that it should be}} easier to find the differences between pairs of similar items than to find the differences between pairs of dissimilar items. This prediction is particularly strong for differences that are related to the <b>commonalities.</b> We tested this prediction in two experiments in which subjects listed a single difference for each of a number of word pairs. The results are consistent with the predictions of structural alignment. In light of these findings, we discuss the potential role of structural alignment in other cognitive processes that involve comparisons. The process of determining the similarity of a pair of items is central to diverse mental processes, including categorization (Smith & Medin, 1981), problem solving (Novick, 1990; Ross, 1987), and affect (Kahneman & Miller, 1986). The general consensus of research on similarity is that a pair's similarity increases with its <b>commonalities</b> and decreases with its differences (Tversky, 1977). Much recent research extends this general point by suggesting that similarity comparisons involve a process of structural alignment akin to the comparison process involved in analogy (Gentner & Markman, in press; Goldstone...|$|R

5|$|During the VB's development, Holden {{realised}} {{that when}} driven at speed over harsh Australian roads, the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall. This forced Holden {{to rework the}} entire car for local conditions, resulting in only 35percent <b>commonality</b> with the Opel. The Rekord's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified, and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type. These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported —a figure close {{to the cost of}} developing a new model independently. With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme, Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant. Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long-wheelbase models, Holden was left with only a sedan, albeit one in three levels of luxury: a base, SL, and SL/E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front-end {{to the rear of the}} Rekord wagon. As the wagon-specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany, the wagon, introduced in July 1979, suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan. Although infrequently criticised in the early years, quality problems were evident, with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores. This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year. In face of these issues, VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication, especially in regards to the steering, ride quality, handling and brakes, thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978.|$|E

Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the <b>commonality</b> of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the forged letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services.
