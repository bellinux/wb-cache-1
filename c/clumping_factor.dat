40|$|Context. The {{uncertainty}} in {{the degree to which}} radiation-driven winds of hot stars might be affected by small inhomogeneities in the density leads to a corresponding {{uncertainty in}} the determination of the atmospheric mass loss rates from the strength of optical recombination lines. Furthermore, the optical recombination lines also react sensitively to even small changes in the density structure resulting from the (often assumed instead of computed) velocity law of the outflow. This raises the question of how reliable the parameter determinations from such lines are. Results. The discrepancy between the optical and the UV analyses is confirmed {{to be the result of}} a missing consistency between stellar and wind parameters in the optical analysis. The influence of the density (velocity field) is of the same order as that of moderate <b>clumping</b> <b>factors.</b> Moderate <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> leave the UV spectra mostly unaffected, indicating that the influence on the ionization balance, and thus on the radiative acceleration, is small. Instead of the erratic behavior of the <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> claimed from the optical analyses, our analysis based on the velocity field computed from radiative driving yields similar <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> for all CSPNs. The shock temperatures and the ratios of X-ray to bolometric luminosity required to reproduce the highly ionized Ovi line agree with those known from massive O stars, again confirming the similarity of O-type CSPN and massive O star atmospheres. Conclusions. The similarity of the winds of O-type CSPNs and those of massive O stars justifies using the same methods based on the dynamics of radiation-driven winds in their analysis, thus supporting the earlier result that several of the CSPNs in the sample have near-Chandrasekhar-limit masses and may thus be possible single-star progenitors of type Ia supernovae.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of <b>clumping</b> <b>factor</b> and coagulase in mediating Staphylococcus aureus adhesion to surface-adsorbed fibrinogen have been quantified {{by using a}} new methodology and analysis. The attachment or detachment kinetics of bacteria were directly observed in a radial flow chamber with a well-defined laminar flow field and a spatially varying shear rate and were quantified by recursively scanning the chamber surface and counting cells via automated video microscopy and image analysis with a motorized stage and focus control. Intrinsic rate constants for attachment or detachment were estimated as functions of shear rate for the wild-type Newman strain of S. aureus and for mutants lacking <b>clumping</b> <b>factor,</b> coagulase, or both proteins on surfaces coated with plasma, fibrinogen, or albumin. <b>Clumping</b> <b>factor,</b> but not coagulase, increased the probability of attachment and decreased the probability of detachment of S. aureus on plasma-coated surfaces; however, both <b>clumping</b> <b>factor</b> and, to a lesser extent, coagulase increased the probability of attachment on the purified-fibrinogen-coated surface. All mutants were resistant to detachment on the purified-fibrinogen-coated surface, suggesting {{the possibility of an}} additional adhesion mechanism which was independent of coagulase or <b>clumping</b> <b>factor</b> and effective only for fully attached cells.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Staphylococcus aureus cells to induce {{platelet}} aggregation {{has long been}} recognized. However, despite several attempts to identify the mechanisms involved in this interaction, {{the nature of the}} bacterial receptors required remains poorly understood. Using genetic manipulation, this study for the first time provides clear evidence that several S. aureus surface proteins participate in the inter-action with platelets. Mutants of S. aureus strain Newman lacking one or more surface proteins were tested for their ability to stimulate platelet aggre-gation. This approach was complemented by the expression of a number of candidate proteins in the non-aggregating Gram-positive bacterium Lacto-coccus lactis. S. aureus-induced aggregation was monophasic and was dependent on the platelet receptor GPIIb/IIIa. The fibrinogen-binding proteins, <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> A and B and the serine-aspartate repeat protein SdrE could each induce aggregation when expressed in L. lactis. Although protein A expressed in L. lactis was not capable of inducing aggregation independently, it enhanced the aggregation response when expressed on the surface of S. aureus.

40|$|Abridged] We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} study of the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rates in stationary stellar winds of hot massive stars. Assuming a power-law dependence of mass loss on metallicity, Mdot ∝ Z^m, and adopting a theoretical relation between the terminal velocity and metallicity, v_inf ∝ Z^ 0. 13 (Leitherer et al.), we find m = 0. 83 +/- 0. 16 for non-clumped outflows from {{an analysis of the}} wind momentum luminosity relation (WLR) for stars more luminous than 10 ^ 5. 2 Lsun. Within the errors, this result agrees with the prediction of m = 0. 69 +/- 0. 10 from Vink et al. For the high luminosity stars we find the mass loss rates to be greater than the predictions, implying wind <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> in their line-forming regions of 4. For lower luminosity stars, the winds are so weak that their strengths cannot be reliably derived from optical lines, and one must rely on analysis of UV lines. In the low-luminosity domain the Galactic WLR is found to be much steeper than expected from theory, leading to a discrepancy between UV mass-loss rates and the predictions by a factor 100 at luminosities of L 10 ^ 4. 75 Lsun, the origin of which is unknown. We emphasize that even if the current mass-loss rates of hot luminous stars are overestimated as a result of wind clumping, the degree of clumping would likely to be independent of metallicity, so the scalings derived in this study are expected to remain correct.

40|$|We quantitatively {{investigate}} {{the extent of}} wind absorption signatures in the X-ray grating spectra of all non-magnetic, effectively single O stars in the Chandra archive via line profile fitting. Under the usual assumption of a spherically symmetric wind with embedded shocks, we confirm previous claims that some objects show little or no wind absorption. However, many other objects do show asymmetric and blue shifted line profiles, indicative of wind absorption. For these stars, {{we are able to}} derive wind mass-loss rates from the ensemble of line profiles, and find values lower by an average factor of 3 than those predicted by current theoretical models, and consistent with H-alpha if <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> of f_cl 20 are assumed. The same profile fitting indicates an onset radius of X-rays typically at r 1. 5 R_star, and terminal velocities for the X-ray emitting wind component that are consistent with that of the bulk wind. We explore the likelihood that the stars in the sample that do not show significant wind absorption signatures in their line profiles have at least some X-ray emission that arises from colliding wind shocks with a close binary companion. The one clear exception is zeta Oph, a weak-wind star that appears to simply have a very low mass-loss rate.

Anti-adhesin antibody titre was measured incubating surface-coated bacterial antigens with patients' IgG. S. aureus effects on platelet aggregation were evaluated with an aggregometer. Results Staphylococcus aureus isolates, from the patients with IE, exhibited a high expression of several surface components recognizing extracellular matrix proteins: <b>clumping</b> <b>factors</b> A and B (ClfA and ClfB) and fibronectin-binding proteins (FnbpA and FnbpB), whereas only four strains expressed the collagen-binding protein CNA.

Almost all patients presented significantly higher antibody reactivity to ClfA, ClfB, FnbpA, CNA and MAP (MHC class II analogous protein) than in sera from healthy individuals. On the contrary, the reactivity to CNA was remarkable only in three patients. The IgG preparations weakly inhibited the binding of bacteria to fibronectin, whereas they exhibited considerable blocking activity on staphylococcal attachment to fibrinogen or collagen.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} non-LTE Monte-Carlo {{radiative}} transfer code with clump and interclump media complementary {{to the one}} presented by Park et al.

The main difference is that instead of representing a very few real clumps treated individually, we consider an arbitrary large number of clumps, which we treat statistically with only a radial dependance. The main advantages are i) the incomparably faster convergence time, ii) the smooth profiles closer to observations and iii) the possibility to represent clumps as small as 1 millipc or less. The main disadvantages are i) {{to be limited to}} 1 D geometries and ii) to lose the excitation dependence of the interclump gas as a function of its distance from each clump. The main results are that i) we partly confirm the large-scale excitation results presented by Park et al. (1996) (that is the interdependance of the two media excitation as a function of <b>clump</b> filling <b>factor,</b> the radial excitation profile shape and absolute value and the absence of emergent line profile variation as a function of <b>clump</b> filling <b>factor</b> in the particular case they studied) but we also extend them to other situations where the presence of clumps is shown to have indeed some strong influence on the emergent line profile, whether the interclump medium is optically thick or not, ii) we show that independent, gaussian, randomly moving clumps can actually give self-reversed or saturated profiles and iii) though we could improve on the previous tentatives to mode...|$|R
