50|$|Aboard Valour {{the three}} pairs of port and {{starboard}} fuel tanks (#'s 4, 5 & 17) were connected by cross-connect lines equipped with isolation valves. The #12 port and starboard wash water tanks were similarly arranged, {{with the addition of}} a smaller secondary <b>cross-over</b> <b>line.</b> These valves were required, by regulation, to be kept closed when underway. Nonetheless, the #5 port and starboard fuel tanks (which were feeding the day tank for the main engines) were left open, and this was a standard practice. During the post-accident dives, it was discovered that the isolation valve between the #4 port and starboard fuel tanks was also left open. In addition, it's probable (but unconfirmed) that the isolation valve on the secondary cross-connect line between the wash water tanks was also left open. The valves are kept closed to prevent hydrostatic balancing between the tanks and to minimize free surface effect, both of which are detrimental to a vessel's stability.|$|E

40|$|We explore net charge {{probability}} distributions {{in heavy}} ion collisions within the hadron resonance gas model. The distributions for strangeness, electric charge and baryon number are derived. We show that, within this model, net charge probability distributions {{and the resulting}} fluctuations can be computed directly from the measured yields of charged and multi-charged hadrons. The influence of multi-charged particles and quantum statistics on {{the shape of the}} distribution is examined. We discuss the properties of the net proton distribution along the chemical freeze-out line. The model results presented here can be compared with data at RHIC energies and at the LHC to possibly search for the relation between chemical freeze-out and QCD <b>cross-over</b> <b>lines</b> in heavy ion collisions.

40|$|We analyse the {{theoretical}} behaviour of macromolecular chains dissolved {{in a good}} solvent, and confined into tubes (or slits) of diameter D comparable to the coil radius. The repulsive interactions between monomers {{are taken into account}} by a scaling method which goes beyond the usual Flory Huggins approach. For the slit problem, we find five different regimes (depending on the concentration C and on the diameter D) with smooth cross-overs at all boundaries. For the tube problem, one of these regimes disappears and two <b>cross-over</b> <b>lines</b> merge, giving rise to a line of stronger discontinuity. This is related to the fact that, when D decreases down to the monomer size, different coils cannot overlap each other at all. For all regimes that thermodynamic properties, the local correlations and the overall chain size are estimated. The scaling arguments, however, predict only the power laws (in C and D) for all these quantities, and do not give precise numerical coefficients...|$|R

40|$|The first heavy fermion {{superconductor}} CeCu 2 Si 2 {{is still}} only partially understood. At high pressures, superconductivity {{is supposed to}} be mediated by a different mechanism than at ambient pressure, where spin fluctuations most likely act as pairing glue. We have obtained and analyzed new resistivity data up to 7 GPa on a good quality CeCu 2 Si 2 single crystal with an unprecedented high transition temperature. For the first time, we establish quantitatively that CeCu 2 Si 2 lies in proximity to a valence transition: the critical end point could be located at 4. 5 ± 0. 2 GPa and a slightly negative temperature, and the corresponding valence <b>cross-over</b> <b>line</b> has been added to the p-T phase diagram.

40|$|Based on Regge-inspired {{arguments}} and counting rules, we formulate empirical models for zero-skewness generalized parton distributions (GPDs) ˜ H (3) and ˜ E (3) in the iso-vector sector. If a hypothetical a 1 /ρ 2 master trajectory is taken into account, {{we find that}} the polarized deep inelastic structure function g (3) 1, axial-vector form factor, pseudoscalar form factor, and lattice data are well described. Thereby, we use a symmetric valence scenario in which the ‘spin puzzle’ in the iso-vector sector is trivially resolved. Utilizing a minimalist ‘holographic ’ GPD principle, tying the t-channel angular momentum and collinear conformal spin together, we build skewness dependent GPD models. Confronting these models with HERMES and JLAB measurements of hard exclusive π + electroproduction within the collinear factorization approach, we might conclude that minimalist GPD models are disfavored at leading order. We provide then a set of GPDs on the <b>cross-over</b> <b>line</b> that fairly describes both HERMES and JLAB measurements...|$|E
30|$|In the LOMGRAV survey, however, also intersections of {{traverse}} lines exist, both in {{the main}} survey area and in the radial flight lines from and to the three airfields (Fig. 1 (a, b)). Additionally, some flights included sections {{from more than one}} traverse line or parts of traverse lines were flown more than once. Occasionally, intersecting or overlapping lines were flown at different altitudes. Furthermore, each of the three prominent tie-lines (North, Centre, South) are broken up into partly overlapping sections. To account for these features, some of the lines with deviating altitude were removed and an adaptive line levelling procedure was performed on the reduced survey data ΔFsurvey. In this procedure, we distinguish between tie-line cross-over differences and traverse-line cross-over differences. Firstly, the flight lines were split into separate traverse lines and tie-lines. Spacing is about 12 to 15 km for the traverse lines in the main survey area, 316 km between the North tie-line and the Centre tie-line and 240 km between the Centre and the South tie-line (Fig. 1 (b)). The North, Centre and South tie-line consists of two, three and four partly overlapping sections, respectively. Secondly, the sections of each tie-line were merged by shifting ΔFsurvey by a constant offset for each section such that the shifted data mean values are identical in the overlapping parts. The offsets are between − 3.9 nT and − 21.1 nT and the mean values are based on about 150 to 1200 measurements, which show a similar variation in the overlapping region. Thirdly, for each merged tie-line, the tie-line cross-over differences were calculated and the tie-line was adjusted by the straight line fit to the cross-over differences. The tie-line cross-over differences after adjustment and the traverse-line cross-over differences are shown in Fig. 1 (b). The fourth step is based on the adjusted tie-line <b>cross-over</b> differences. Traverse <b>lines</b> that intersect only two tie-lines were DC-shifted by the mean value of the two tie-line <b>cross-over</b> differences. Traverse <b>lines</b> that intersect three tie-lines were adjusted by a cubic spline function through the three tie-line cross-over differences plus two artificial end points equal to the most adjacent cross-over data, that were added to stabilise the fit. A fifth step is taking into account traverse line crossover differences from traverse line intersections or repeatedly flown traverse lines, that otherwise pose a problem for gridding, but also give an opportunity to make additional adjustments in the line levelling. This is especially an advantage for the traverse lines that only cross two tie-lines (adjusted by a DC shift in step four). One traverse line after the other was adjusted by a cubic spline similar as in step four, but this time the cubic spline was fitted to both tie-line cross-over differences as well traverse <b>line</b> <b>cross-over</b> differences.|$|R

From the observations we removed main and magnetospheric fields as given by the CHAOS- 3 field model (Olsen et al., 2010) and remaining external fields as monitored by the Canadian magnetic observatory Alert. The reduced data were levelled based on <b>cross-over</b> differences at <b>line</b> intersections. Finally, a grid was computed, upward continued by 3500 m and compared with the EMAG 2 grid (Maus et al., 2009), showing a good general agreement but also areas with systematic differences.

40|$|We give a partonic {{interpretation}} for {{the deeply}} virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) {{measurements of the}} H 1 and ZEUS collaborations in the small-x_B region in terms of generalized parton distributions. Thereby we have {{a closer look at}} the skewness effect, parameterization of the t-dependence, revealing the chromomagnetic pomeron, and at a model dependent access to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of nucleon. We also quantify the reparameterization of generalized parton distributions resulting from the inclusion of radiative corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Beyond the leading order approximation, our findings are compatible with a `holographic' principle that would arise from a (broken) SO(2, 1) symmetry. Utilizing our leading-order findings, we also perform a first model dependent dispersion relation fit of HERMES and JLAB DVCS measurements. From that we extract the generalized parton distribution H on its <b>cross-over</b> <b>line</b> and predict the beam charge-spin asymmetry, measurable at COMPASS.

40|$|This {{progress}} report covers {{the period from}} November 15, 1963 to February 15, 1964. A study indicated that the most desirable type of blower drive turbine is one using main turbine throttie steam conditions and exhausting to the main turbine <b>cross-over</b> <b>line.</b> Preliminary planning for the initiation of a dynamic structural analyses of the overall steam generator was completed. External pressure loading and thermal stress calculations show that the calandria has a suitable design margin. A revised fuel latch operable from the rear face of the core was designed. A study was initiated to determine the feasibility of substituting Zircaloy for the stainless steel tubing within the active core. Preliminary sizing of control rod extensions and gang plates was completed. Initial loading of the second configuration of the 630 A critical experiment reactor was completed. Detailed power distributions were measured in the 11 typical positions. Subcritical and critical rod worth curves were obtained in the critical experiment with up to 132 shim rods in the core. Moderator temperature coefficient measurements were made and agreed well with analytical data. Critical experiment correlation of fine radial power calculations in the revised mock-up showed good agreement. Performance specifications were prepared for a 1 -Mw(e) power plant. Parametric thermal analyses, based on various tube sheet thicknesses and heating rates, were completed for {{the top and bottom}} tube sheets. The shield plug was redesigned to accommodate additional shim rods and to facilitate fabrication and moderator flow adjustments. Calculations of the operating and shutdown dose at the nuclear sensor location was started. Studies were performed to determine the size of the port openings needed to prevent buckling in the containmert vessel in the event of ship sinking. A blower shaft static seal was built and tested with satisfactory results. Manufacture and procurement of all parts for two developmental dynamic rod actuators were completed. The two-tube boiler was modified and operated satisfactorily on automatic control down to 20 percent power. A reactor control system that meets response and accuracy requirements was simulated on the analog computer. Investigation of a possible test site for power testing the prototype reactor was continued with cost estimates and a facility layout drawing being made for the IET facility at ITS. Specimen ORF- 4 was removed from test after 4800 hours of actual operation at 1300 deg F, equivalent to approximately 15, 000 hours of full- power 630 A operation. An estimated 40 percent burnup of the /sup 235 /U atoms occurred. Creep tests on warm-finished fuel sheet have accumulated more than 12, 000 hours at 630 A stress and temperature conditions with no greater than 0. 75 percent plastic creep. Cladding-stock creep tests have surpassed 15, 000 hours at various combinations of stress and temperature with satisfactory results. (auth...|$|E
50|$|From there, the Brigade {{proceeded}} to climb higher ground (today, Ramat Raziel), till {{it reached the}} crest of the mountain range where it received orders to arrange for the military occupation and capture of Dayr al-Hawa (today, Nes Harim), a village perched at an elevation of some 637 meters above sea-level. This was done with the intent of making it a springboard for further military operations while advancing toward the mountains overlooking al-Khader, Bethlehem and Hebron. The Brigade began sending out armed patrol-parties of two to three men in order to acquaint themselves with the terrain, and to learn about the feasibility of sending out greater forces to infiltrate enemy lines. The plan was to <b>cross-over</b> the railroad <b>line</b> that connected Jerusalem with Hartuv. Scouts succeeded in crossing over the railway without being detected, and reached a position southwest of Dayr al-Hawa. When a second detail was sent out to ascertain whether or not the route could be traversed, they were ambushed by gunfire, which caused the party to retreat. A third detail sent out was also fired upon, which actions taken together gave the Brigade a correct assessment of the enemy's preparedness for battle. Given these circumstances, plans were drawn-up for the attack on Dayr al-Hawa.|$|R
40|$|Heart rate {{response}} to increasing workload {{is accompanied by}} a series of physiologically marked stages, which can be identified through a linear and logarithmic regression <b>line</b> <b>cross-over.</b> These stages represent the withdrawal and activation of neural, hormonal and reflex mechanisms. However identification of physiological mechanisms associated with rate change is lacking in the literature. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study is}} to establish mathematical regression trend-lines for segmental changes in heart rate {{response to}} increased work, and identify the physiological mechanisms associated with said change. METHODS: Ten (n= 10) male cyclists acted as subjects. Each signed a university approved informed consent prior to testing. Pre-test measures included the following: medical and fitness questionnaires; height (cm), weight (kg), age (y), body fat (%) and seated resting heart rate (b*min. - 1). Subjects were then fitted to the VelotronTM bicycle ergometer. The ergometer protocol began at 150 watts (w) of work at a pedal rate between 80 and 90 (RPM). The work increased at 25 (w) per minute until volitional fatigue. The following measures were taken during the cycle ergometer test: beat-by-beat heart rate (b*min. - 1), expired ventilation (VE, l*min. - 1), minute volume of oxygen consumption (VO 2, l*min. - 1, ml*kg- 1 *min. - 1) and minute volume of carbon dioxide production (VCO 2, l*min. - 1). Statistical analyses included logarithmic and linear regression lines of group mean heart rates to establish segments of heart rate change during the test. Trend-lines of best fit were then utilized for established phases of heart rate change. Mean (SD) values were established across subjects for measured variables. RESULTS: Demographic means (SD) were the following: height, 178. 3 (5. 1); weight, 81. 4 (6. 8); body fat, 10. 5 (3. 8); age, 29. 6 (8. 1); VO 2 Max, 70. 3 (6. 03). Three phases (I, II, III) were established from the logarithmic/linear cross-over. Each phase had a distinct trend-line established as the line of best fit. These trend-lines were the following: Phase I, logarithmic; Phase II, linear; Phase III, 4 th degree polynomial. CONCLUSION: This research demonstrates the three distinct segments of heart rate response due to incremental increases in workload and can be identified through the application of a linear-logarithmic regression analysis. Associated physiological mechanisms include the following: parasympathetic deactivation, sympathetic activation, baroreceptor reflex, catecholamines, peripheral afferent signal from specific metabolites...|$|R
40|$|Cycling can be {{considered}} an elite level sport, and with this accompanies varying levels of fitness. Fitness levels are established from maximal oxygen uptake tests. In addition, heart rate may be utilized to examine the varying levels of athletic capability {{to determine if there}} is a difference among subjects pertaining to heart rate responses, and their corresponding oxygen uptake (VO­ 2) in a graded exercise test. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine heart rate response based on varying fitness levels in competitive cyclists during a graded exercise test. METHODS: Subjects were 61 (n= 61) competitive cyclists statistically placed into quartiles through maximal oxygen consumption (MVO 2) values (ml*kg- 1 *min. - 1). Prior to testing, all subjects signed an informed consent approved by the Institutional Review Board for humans as subjects at Midwestern State University. Each subject was tested on a cycle ergometer using the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) protocol, in which a beginning workload of 150 watts (w) was completed for 5 minutes, followed by 25 watt increase every minute until volitional fatigue. Heart rate(b*min. - 1) data was selectively chosen from each group based on the data collected in beat-by-beat 20 second averages. For heart rate analysis, the following quartile sample sizes were utilized: 1 st quartile (n= 4), 2 nd quartile (n= 4), 3 rdquartile (n= 4), 4 th quartile (n= 5). Thresholds (trend deviation) for heart rate were determined by a log-linear regression <b>line</b> <b>cross-over</b> method. Established cross-over points (2) indicated three phases of heart rate response. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine group quartile differences for MVO 2 and heart rate responses. Statistical significance was set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. RESULTS: Mean (SD) and range for MVO 2 at each quartile (Q) were the following: 1 st Q= 51. 65 (6. 7), range= 30. 4 - 56. 6; 2 nd Q= 60. 57 (2. 77), range= 57. 2 - 65. 3; 3 rd Q= 68. 05 (1. 44), range= 66 - 70. 6; 4 th Q= 75. 12 (3. 78), range= 70. 97 - 85. 2. Threshold occurrences between Q were not different at the point of trend-line cross-over. However, HR at thresholds while not statistically different were not similar. Quartile cross-over HR (b*min. - 1) were the following at the two cross-over points: 1 st Q= 152. 9 2 ̆ 6 171. 1; 2 nd Q= 128. 75 2 ̆ 6 158. 6; 3 rd Q= 138. 9 2 ̆ 6 156. 75; 4 th Q= 128. 7 2 ̆ 6 155. 2. CONCLUSION: This research indicates a non-significant difference in heart rate response between quartiles. Additionally, fitness levels of competitive cyclists based on MVO 2 levels were shown to be statistically different. In summary, this research indicates varying heart rate response in competitive cyclists of different fitness status...|$|R
