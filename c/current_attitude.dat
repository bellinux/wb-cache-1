25|$|The action–motivation model {{proposes that}} {{inconsistencies}} in a person's cognition cause mental stress, because psychologic inconsistency {{interferes with the}} person's functioning in the real world. Among the ways for coping, the person can choose to exercise a behavior that is inconsistent {{with his or her}} <b>current</b> <b>attitude</b> (a belief, an ideal, a value system), but later try to alter that belief to be consonant with a current behaviour; the cognitive dissonance occurs when the person's cognition does not match the action taken. If the person changes the <b>current</b> <b>attitude,</b> after the dissonance occurs, he or she then is obligated to commit to that course of behaviour.|$|E

2500|$|Today, the quaternions {{are used}} in {{computer}} graphics, control theory, signal processing, and orbital mechanics, mainly for representing rotations/orientations. For example, {{it is common for}} spacecraft attitude-control systems to be commanded in terms of quaternions, which are also used to telemeter their <b>current</b> <b>attitude.</b> The rationale is that combining quaternion transformations is more numerically stable than combining many matrix transformations. [...] In control and modelling applications, quaternions do not have a computational singularity (undefined division by zero) that can occur for quarter-turn rotations (90 degrees) that are achievable by many Air, Sea and Space vehicles. In pure mathematics, quaternions show up significantly as one of the four finite-dimensional normed division algebras over the real numbers, with applications throughout algebra and geometry.|$|E

40|$|Childhood {{experiences}} {{of animals and}} <b>current</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards animals were assessed using a questionnaire, which was completed by 227 Japanese students and 174 British students. Pet ownership in childhood, as well as contact with other animals and negative {{experiences of}} pets, were used as the independent variables; <b>current</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards pets and other animals were the dependent variables. There were some differences between Japan and the UK: in childhood, the British students had had significantly more pets and more animal-related experiences, such as visiting animal shelters and livestock farms, than had the Japanese students. Their <b>current</b> <b>attitudes</b> were also more positive, and they, showed a greater interest in animal welfare issues than did the Japanese students. In both countries there was a positive association between childhood pet-keeping and <b>current</b> favourable <b>attitudes</b> to pets, {{as measured by the}} Pet Attitude Scale. Open-ended responses also suggested that the roles of pets for children are perceived in similar ways in Japan and the UK. Adult attitudes to pets and interest in animal welfare seem to be greatly influenced in both countries by childhood experiences of animals, including pets, and may therefore be a general phenomenon...|$|R

This is despite the fact that he claimed there are significant numbers of gay men, and at all levels within the church including the cardinalate. He called for all statements from the Holy See that are offensive and violent against gay people to be withdrawn, citing Benedict XVI's signature of the 2005 document that forbids men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies from becoming priests as particularly [...] "diabolical." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{is argued}} that most travel mode choices are {{repetitive}} and made in a stable context. As an example, the everyday use of public transport is analyzed based on a panel survey with {{a random sample of}} about 1300 Danish residents interviewed up to three times in the period 1998 - 2000. The use of public transport is traced back to attitudes towards doing so, beliefs about whether or not public transportation can cover one's transport needs, and car ownership. The influence of these variables is greatly attenuated when past behavior is accounted for, however. For subjects without a car, behavior changes are in the direction of greater consistency with <b>current</b> <b>attitudes</b> and perceptions. For car owners, <b>current</b> <b>attitudes</b> are inconsequential. The temporal stability of transport behavior is also higher for car-owners than for non-owners. ...|$|R
