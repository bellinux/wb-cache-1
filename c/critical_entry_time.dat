40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a single agent's {{optimality}} {{in the case}} where there exist fixed and variable costs in the using of a consumption product.

In this case the consumption process {{can be seen as}} an American call option with strike price equal to the fixed cost, and thus we can employ the optimal stopping theory in the calculation of optimal consumption <b>entry</b> <b>time.</b> Before the consumption <b>entry</b> <b>time</b> the agent is holding the American option and the optimal portfolio process equals the option's hedging strategy. Because our market is complete this hedging strategy hedges the uncertainties in the fixed cost and, therefore, the fixed cost uncertainties do not affect the consumption <b>entry</b> <b>time.</b> We show that the consumption <b>entry</b> <b>time</b> is deterministic if the market is risk-neutral...|$|R
