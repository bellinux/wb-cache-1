500|$|On {{the same}} day that Hubbard was sent a formal letter of admonition, he {{reported}} sick with complaints of epigastric pains and possible malaria. After 77 days on the sick list, it was finally determined that he was suffering from a duodenal ulcer. In October 1943, he asked to be transferred to landing craft and was sent on a six-week training course at the Naval Small <b>Craft</b> <b>Training</b> Center in San Pedro, California. [...] He was then ordered in December 1943 to join the crew of the USS Algol, an Attack Cargo Auxiliary Vessel, to assist with the ship's fitting out and crew training in Portland, Oregon. The vessel was commissioned in July 1944 with Hubbard aboard in the role of Navigation and Training Officer. The next two months were occupied with training exercises off the California coast in preparation for the ship's envisaged departure in September for the western Pacific theater of operations.|$|E
2500|$|Arts and Crafts {{practitioners}} in Britain were {{critical of the}} government system of art education based on design in the abstract with little teaching of practical craft. This lack of <b>craft</b> <b>training</b> also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should {{pay more attention to}} the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed. The first school to make this change was the Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts, which [...] "led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper). In his external examiner's report of 1889, Walter Crane praised Birmingham School of Art in that it 'considered design in relationship to materials and usage.'" [...] Under the direction of Edward Taylor, its headmaster from 1877 to 1903, and with the help of Henry Payne and Joseph Southall, the Birmingham School became a leading Arts-and-Crafts centre.|$|E
2500|$|Curtiss {{had been}} {{lobbying}} {{for the establishment}} of the Naval Reserve Base in Miami since 1928, and this property became a Naval Reserve Aviation Training Base (NRATB), which later became an active installation renamed Naval Air Station Miami. [...] The installation was extremely active during World War II and saw significant military construction on the main base as well as several additional auxiliary airfields in the general area. [...] Much of this construction is still in existence today. [...] Training in fighter, dive-bombing and torpedo bombing skills took place at various times during the base's operation. The Brewster F2A Buffalo fighter, Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bomber, Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, and the Grumman F4F Wildcat fighter were some of the aircraft based at the facility. In addition to serving as headquarters for the 7th Naval District, the station supported a naval air gunnery school, a Marine Corps Air Station, a Coast Guard Station, and a small <b>craft</b> <b>training</b> center. The peak complement, reached in 1945, consisted of 7,200 officers and men and 3,100 civilian employees.|$|E

2500|$|The Sri Lanka Army Women's Corps (SLAWC) {{was formed}} on September 1, 1979 as an unarmed, noncombatant support unit [...] Set {{up with the}} {{assistance}} of the Women's Royal Army Corps, it was identical in structure to its parent organization, and its first generation of officer cadets was trained in Britain. Soldier Candidates were required to be between eighteen and twenty years old and to have passed the General Common Entrance (Ordinary level) examinations, while the Officer candidates must have passed the Advanced Level. Enlistment entailed a five-year service commitment (the same as for men), and recruits were not allowed to marry during this period. In the sixteen-week training course at the Army Training Centre at the Diyatalawa Sri Lanka Military Academy, cadets were put through a programme of drill and physical training similar to the men's programme, with the exception of weapons and battle <b>craft</b> <b>training.</b> Female recruits were paid according to the same scale as the men, but were limited to service in nursing, communications, and clerical work. In late 1987, the first class of women graduates from the Viyanini Army Training Centre were certified to serve as army instructors. But, from late 1987 – after hostilities began, the first batch of women graduates from the British Army's Women's Corps Centre certified to serve as Army Instructors.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there was}} a major focus on {{improving}} the housing stock on the estate, CVHAT had to tackle the other facilities and a major priority was the redevelopment of Castle Vale Shopping Centre. In 1996, Sainsbury's were invited to tender for the redevelopment of the shopping centre, which they won. The company commenced a period of consultation with the community and produced a planning application {{for the construction of a}} retail park on the site with 700 car parking spaces. Schal, the construction management company of Carillion, were appointed as contractors for the scheme. The first phase to be constructed was an office and retail block which became occupied by the CVHAT and a dentist's surgery. Construction of the rest of the retail park was completed in July 2000, with the Sainsbury's supermarket store opened on 29 July 2000. The demolition of the shopping centre and Concorde Tower resulted in 11,000 tonnes of concrete rubble, which was reused in the construction phase with the surplus being given to Project Wagtail. Schal consulted the community to distinguish how to minimise disruption on the estate, leading to the relocation of a bus-stop, the use of vibro-piling over rapid piling and also improvements to footpaths in the general area. Carillion <b>Craft</b> <b>Training</b> were brought in to employ residents on the estate to work on the construction to help tackle the unemployment rate. The opening of the Sainsbury's supermarket in the [...] anchor unit and [...] of non-food retail units, which are fully occupied by Comet, T.K. Maxx, Argos and ScS, led to the creation of approximately 600 jobs. Initially, 38% of those working at the retail park were local residents, but this figure increased to 95% within five years. Sainsbury's then worked closely with the community to help support the local radio station and football team. In total, the project cost £35 million.|$|E
