50|$|In 2008, Toyota {{proactively}} {{announced a}} 15-year, unlimited mileage <b>corrosion</b> <b>warranty</b> for 1995-2000 model years due to inadequate rustproofing and frame corrosion issues affecting over 800,000 Tacomas. Toyota will either repair the frame or buyback the truck for 1.5 times its KBB retail value. This was later extended to include 2001-2004 model years, {{but in these}} cases when a frame {{was found to be}} rusty to the point of perforation, the frame is replaced with a new one instead of a buy back.|$|E

In 1982, he testified on inadequate automobile quality and rust protection before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Technology and successfully pressured Ford to become the first automaker to provide a <b>corrosion</b> compensation <b>warranty.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 1986, Audi {{released}} a new Typ 89 Audi 80 for the 1987 model {{year on the}} European market and introduced it elsewhere within a year. It {{was based on a}} new platform which broke the relationship between the 80 and the Volkswagen Passat, the corresponding third generation of which used the transverse-engined Volkswagen B3 platform, whilst Audi stuck with the longitudinal front wheel drive layout for the B3-series 80. Although often called the typ 89 even among knowledgeable Audi enthusiasts, the official and correct nomenclature was its production code Typ 89 from 1987 to 1989, and Typ 8A from 1990 onwards (in line with a restructuring of many VW platform designations). It introduced a new aerodynamic look and a fully galvanised bodyshell. This was the first mid-sized car to feature a fully zinc-coated body, giving it longevity and durability against corrosion perforation. This protective shield proved to be so effective that Audi extended its <b>corrosion</b> perforation <b>warranty</b> from the originally offered ten years to twelve years (during early pre-production, the body was expected to be good for only eight years). Audi still uses zinc galvanisation for all current steel-bodied models.|$|R
