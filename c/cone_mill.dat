50|$|Mill villages were company-owned towns, {{built from}} scratch by textile mills to house their factory {{workers and their}} families. In the early 1900s, Cone Mills Inc. built five {{self-sufficient}} villages to serve its Greensboro factories. These villages included churches, schools, baseball fields, community centers, and company stores in addition to houses that were leased to mill workers. At their peak, the <b>Cone</b> <b>mill</b> villages covered 450 acre and housed 2,675 workers in about 1,500 houses. A separate mill village, East White Oak, housed African-American workers. Thousands of workers and their families made their lives in these “towns within a town” until the company began selling the houses (sometimes to workers) in the late 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Later named Pickrell's <b>Mill,</b> <b>Cones</b> <b>Mills</b> {{was once}} a prosperous location, but the burning of <b>Cone's</b> woolen <b>mill</b> and the closure of other local industries, {{due to lack of}} business, ruined its hopes. The {{community}} lay along the old military road approximately one mile north of Delsaver's Ford on the Scioto River, the spot at which the township's southern boundary meets the river. An earlier community, Patterson, lay on the same road a short distance to the north, at the mouth of Fulton Creek, but it was eclipsed by <b>Cones</b> <b>Mills,</b> and its post office closed when one was opened in the newer community. Operating in a local store, the <b>Cones</b> <b>Mills</b> post office endured into the 1880s.|$|R

5000|$|The stadium was {{originally}} built mostly with American football in mind, resembling a backwards [...] "J" [...] {{and with a}} running track. In 1930 the Greensboro [...] "Patriots" [...] of the old Piedmont League set up shop there, after a few decades at Cone Athletic Park (near the <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills</b> plant {{a couple of miles}} to the northeast), and made various improvements such as the installation of lights and a roof for the box seat area.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for wheat seeds crushed between simple millstones to make flour dates to 6000 BC. The Romans {{were the first}} to grind seeds on <b>cone</b> <b>mills.</b> In 1879, {{at the beginning of the}} Industrial Era, the first steam mill was erected in London. In the 1930s, some flour began to be enriched with iron, niacin, thiamine and riboflavin. In the 1940s, mills started to enrich flour and folic acid was added to the list in the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Revolution Cotton Mills, {{also known}} as Revolution Division and <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills,</b> is a {{historic}} cotton mill complex located at Greensboro, Guilford County, North Carolina.

50|$|In 1928, {{the cotton}} {{factories}} in Haw River were acquired by Proximity Manufacturing, which later became <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills</b> Corporation. When corduroy became popular, the company decided {{to produce the}} cloth in Haw River. The plants south of Main Street were renamed Tabardrey and were equipped with new machinery to produce corduroy. The mills north of the highway became Granite Finishing for the finishing of the cloth. Corduroy production began on May 1, 1930, and Granite was shipping finished goods by June of the same year.|$|R
40|$|Hop pellets type 90 are {{the most}} {{frequent}} hop products used in brewing. They are usually manufactured by drying hop cones, temporary storage of dry and pressed <b>cones,</b> <b>milling</b> and pelletising. Other possibility is a complete integration of hop harvest, <b>cone</b> drying, <b>milling</b> and pelletising in continuous process without temporary storage of pressed cones. The paper deals with the losses of bitter substances (primary α-acids) during hop cones drying, their pelletisation by two manufacturing procedures and storage in different conditions. The {{results of this study}} show that integrated procedure of hop pelletising decreases the total loss of α-acids compared to the usual procedure. During storage of hop pellets (produced by integrated procedure) the highest decrease (loss) of α-acids content was observed in pellets stored at 21 °C in the presence of air and the lowest under inert atmosphere (N 2) at 4 to 7 °C, respectively. ...|$|R
50|$|The Aycock {{neighborhood}} had {{its beginnings}} in 1895, when textile magnate Caesar Cone graded and paved Summit Avenue, a boulevard that connected downtown Greensboro to Cone’s manufacturing facilities. The neighborhood’s central location to downtown and the <b>Cone</b> <b>mills</b> {{made it a}} desirable location for city residents, who erected large homes in Queen Anne styles with turrets, porches laced with brackets and spindles, and elaborate window shapes. Later houses follow Colonial Revival and Craftsman influence, yet nearly all houses in the district share broad front porches, mature trees, and generous floor plans.|$|R
5000|$|Funding for a {{hospital}} began after the 1908 death of Moses H. Cone, a North Carolina magnate {{who founded the}} <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills</b> textile company. In 1911, Bertha Cone, the widow of Moses, established a trust fund that would establish {{a hospital}} to serve Greensboro and memorialize her late husband. The trust fund stated that [...] "No patient should be refused admittance because of inability to pay.". After Bertha Cone's death in 1947, her inheritance went to the trust fund that would eventually established the hospital. Construction began in 1949 and the facility opened on February 20, 1953.|$|R
50|$|In 1852 the Charlotte & Columbia Railroad {{came through}} Pineville, the town's first {{step into the}} 'modern world'. The {{railroad}} wanted a more modern name, and the large stands of pine trees in the area inspired the new name Pineville. Pineville was incorporated in 1873. In the 1890s Dover Yarn Mills established a cotton mill in Pineville. This <b>mill</b> later became <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills,</b> Inc., which operated in the town until the late 1970s. The one-block area of old Pineville was a bustling commercial area, with many different shops typical of any small town. Today this area is home to many quaint shops and restaurants.|$|R
5000|$|The Greensboro clubs {{initially}} {{played their}} home games at Cone Athletic Park, {{better known as}} simply Cone Park, a small facility {{on the grounds of}} the <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills</b> textile plant. World War Memorial Stadium opened in 1926 (on Armistice Day), but the Patriots continued to play at Cone Park until 1930, when the addition of lights and other improvements to the Stadium, spurred by the affiliation with the Cardinals, resulted in the team moving to the Stadium.

50|$|Reidsville was {{established}} in the early 19th century as an outpost and stop on the stage line that ran between Salisbury, North Carolina, and Danville, Virginia, and was originally known as Wright's Crossroads. The community grew from a single home and inn owned by the family of Reuben Reid, a local farmer, businessman, justice of the peace and father of David S. Reid), into a thriving farming community primarily supporting tobacco production and cigarette manufacturing. Reidsville was officially incorporated by the North Carolina State Legislature in 1873 and became a key location of the American Tobacco Company which employed large numbers of city and county residents. The American Tobacco Company was the mainstay of Reidsville economics until its sale and closure in 1994. Many textile mills were established in Reidsville as well, with <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills</b> and Burlington Industries, located in Burlington North Carolina, consolidating most of them in the mid-20th century, although most have now closed. Although Reidsville has experienced economic recession in recent years the community has enjoyed a renewal of growth as a sleeper city supplying a source of rural development for the surrounding larger cities.|$|R
40|$|In November 1954, Eugene “Gene” Hood, {{a former}} {{executive}} of North Carolina's <b>Cone</b> <b>Mills,</b> wrote an unsolicited letter to Wesley Critz George, Emeritus Professor of Histology and Embryology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Hood was writing {{in his capacity as}} de facto leader of an enclave of hard-line segregationists, based in North Carolina's Piedmont region. Six months had passed since the Supreme Court's Brown decision had effectively rendered segregation unconstitutional, and Hood and his colleagues were becoming increasingly agitated by the lack of an organised, coherent response to the Court's edict in the Tar Heel State. The Piedmont segregationists, a disparate group of lawyers and businessmen, refused to be cast as pariahs in the wake of Brown. Rather, they believed that a sizeable majority of white North Carolinians shared their views on the continued segregation of the races, and, moreover, that a significant number of them would be willing to join a crusade for all-out resistance to federally mandated desegregation. The group's overarching problem was one of trying to devise a strategy that would harness that pro-segregation opinion for maximum effect. On 22 November, after another round of discussions between the group members provided no satisfactory answers, Hood decided {{that it was time to}} seek an external stimulus. “I am convinced that we need a state-wide organization,” he wrote to George, “and I am wondering if you and your associates would consider doing something along that line. ...|$|R
