The {{facilitation}} of interoperability {{requires a}} clear distinction if a <b>relation</b> refers to <b>classes</b> of individuals or to specific instances, in particular {{when it comes to}} the logical properties of the involved <b>relations.</b> <b>Class</b> <b>relations</b> are defined whenever the semantics of entire classes are described, independently of single instances.

The paper continues research on spatial <b>class</b> <b>relations</b> by deepening the analysis of the reasoning properties of <b>class</b> <b>relations.</b> The work is based on a set of 17 abstract <b>class</b> <b>relations</b> defined in [11]. The paper provides a complete composition table for the 17 abstract <b>class</b> <b>relations</b> and redefines the concept of conceptual neighbourhood for <b>class</b> <b>relations.</b> This approach can be used to find conflicts and redundancies in sets of semantic integrity constraints or other applications of spatial <b>class</b> <b>relations...</b>|$|R

5000|$|During the 1970s, Holloway was an {{influential}} {{member of the}} Conference of Socialist Economists, particularly in his support of an approach to {{the state as a}} social form constituted ultimately by class struggle between capital and the working class. This approach was developed primarily through the critical appropriation of aspects of the German state derivation debate of the early 1970s, in particular the work of Joachim Hirsch, and led him and Sol Picciotto to publish [...] "State and Capital: A Marxist Debate", an anthology of texts from the German debate with a critical introduction. This conception of state, social form and class struggle, within the Conference of Socialist Economists developed current that ultimately gave rise to the Open Marxism school of thought in which Holloway remained a significant participant. This current rejects both traditional Marxist ideas of state monopoly capitalism and innovations such as Poulantzas' Althusserian state theory, and the Regulation school, and affirms the centrality of the <b>class</b> <b>relation</b> between capital and working class, as a struggle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Class {{relations}} are used whenever the semantics of entire classes are described, independently of single entities. This chapter focuses on class relations that define cardinality restrictions {{for a certain}} instance relation (e. g., a topological relation) between all entities of the involved classes. Typical examples are spatial semantic integrity constraints or ontologies of geospatial entity classes. Reasoning on such class relations allows {{for the detection of}} inconsistencies and redundancies in sets of class relations. Therefore the logical properties of the applied instance relations and those of the cardinality restrictions have to be considered, in par-ticular symmetry and compositions, but also other inferences.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the social}} struggles that occurred between 2010 and 2014 {{during the crisis}} in Greece: labour struggles, {{the movement of the}} squares, demonstrations and riots, neighbourhood assemblies, solidarity projects and economies, local environmental struggles, and anti-fascist and migrants' struggles. It discusses their internal and external limits in the historical specificity of the contemporary crisis and <b>class</b> <b>relation.</b> Drawing critically on Théorie Communiste's periodising schema, these struggles are framed, first, through a shift in the dynamic of the <b>class</b> <b>relation</b> effected by the crisis and the restructuring, which is a continuation of the first phase of 'neoliberal' restructuring in the 1990 s. This shift intensified a central capitalist contradiction: while the capital relation imposes most violently the absolute dependence of subsistence on the wage, the wage relation fails to guarantee subsistence and integrates proletarians as surplus to capitalist reproduction. Second, the struggles are framed through the deep political crisis of state sovereignty and the relation between state and civil society, caused by the relentless imposition of the restructuring in conjunction with supranational institutions. These historical transformations are traced through the mutual constitution of international tendencies and the development of class struggle in Greece, against theories of dependency and underdevelopment. Ideological responses to the financial crisis and the logic of the restructuring are interrogated by employing theories of value, fetishism, and the state influenced by the German 'value-form' debate. Foucault-influenced conceptions of governmentality and sovereignty are also deployed to examine the restructuring's forms of imposition and the biopolitical crisis-management strategies of the state, which reinforced the racialised and gendered constitution of civil society. The thesis argues that these two elements, the changing dynamic of the <b>class</b> <b>relation</b> and the crisis of the state and civil society, defined the struggles of this period, in which two core characteristics can be identified. First, labour struggles confronted the dilemma between the necessity and inadequacy of the wage through an ambivalence between their attachment to work and their estrangement from it. This ambivalence did not question the terms of the dilemma posed, which were only questioned fleetingly in riots that interrupted the normality of commodity exchange. Second, the deep political crisis provoked struggles defending democracy, with the disempowered 'Greek citizen' as their central subject, which constitutively excluded migrants. The splitting of these struggles between leftwing anti-imperialist and rightwing anti-immigration nationalism, and into a struggle between fascism and anti-fascism, were not able to challenge this constitutive exclusion, which was only questioned by migrants' own struggles. Nationalism and the drive to reinforce unsettled social hierarchies played into the governmental effort to contain the political crisis, through the state's biopolitical management of the migrant and marginal, racialised and gendered surplus populations produced in the crisis...|$|E

First of all SUMO already includes a good semiotics architecture for the representation and the communication of information in general. Expanded from the original SUMO somewhat are the basic segments of language, which are classified as LinguisticExpressions: Text, Sentence, Phrase, Word, Morpheme, and PhonemeSequence. There is a further distinction {{in the form of}} the LinguisticExpression which can be Written, Spoken, or Signed. We argue that a WrittenLinguisticExpression is a fundamentally different concept than a SpokenLinguisticExpression, and not simply an attribute like male/female. The distinction is particularly important when reasoning about the equivalentContentRelation between, for example, what someone says and what is printed in a newspaper. There are a number of other semiotic predicates that apply, but some of the most important are refers, represents and containsInformation. Refers is the general process of semiosis whereas represents is used in the sense that some entity expresses, connotes or describes something else.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} carried out to study the effect of volume fraction on microstructure evolution in segregation-free isotropic volume-conserved two-phase alloys. Large scale two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) simulations were performed for 10 / 90, 30 / 70 and 50 / 50 alloys with a modified quantitative phase-field model. The grain growth in the two-phase alloys was consistent with volume-diffusion controlled growth with growth exponent m∼ 3 m∼ 3. The kinetic coefficient, mean grain size, mean number of faces, grain size distribution (GSD), grain topology distribution (GTD) and grain size/topological <b>class</b> <b>relation</b> were all influenced by the volume fraction of the minor phase (αα) in the two-phase alloys. In the 10 / 90 alloy, a bimodal distribution in the GSD and GTD for the 2 D total grain structure was found. The timelines of evolution of major-phase grains in 3 D simulations for all alloys were examined. ‘Particle-like’ grain migration of isolated αα-phase grains was observed in the 2 D simulations. The formation and evolution of non-constant curvatures on interphase boundaries in the isotropic volume-conserved two-phase alloys is discussed. The microstructure evolution in the volume-conserved two-phase alloys was compared with that in non-conserved two-phase alloys (m∼ 2 m∼ 2).

40|$|Vietnam {{has posted}} {{impressive}} gains in growth of output, exports and poverty reduction {{over the last}} twenty years. The standard explanation of this sustained success views Vietnam‟s transition from socialism to capitalism {{as an extension of}} markets and removal of obstacles to their efficient operation. This view of transition is based on a particular view of the origins of capitalism, in which capitalism emerges due to the expansion of trade, technology and the removal of obstacles to the natural tendencies of human interaction. However, this view of the origins of capitalism cannot explain the uniqueness of capitalism as a distinct historical social formation. A Marxist framework will be used, stressing {{the emergence of a new}} social division of labour based on the emerging <b>class</b> <b>relation</b> between capital and labour. This transformation forces a shift to accumulation through the market, requiring capitalists to operate under the market imperative in order to survive. This will be combined with Djilas (1957) and the concept of communist bureaucracies as a New Class in order to investigate the emergence of capitalism in Vietnam. The research question is how does the appearance and reproduction of the New Class provide insight into the development of a specifically Vietnamese capitalism? Data on Vietnam‟s largest 200 firms will be analyzed through the New Class lens to explore the transformation occurring in Vietnam. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
