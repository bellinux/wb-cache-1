We apply our framework to study and compare this set through the computation of the geodesic distance between corresponding curves on different 3 D facial models. AdaBoost considers each curve as a weak classifier and selects iteratively relevant curves and show that there is significant improvement in results. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated on a subset taken from BU- 3 DFE(3 D Facial Expression Database - Binghamton University) database.

50|$|The {{site was}} {{excavated}} between 27 August and 31 December. On 13 January 1862 the first concrete foundations were poured, {{starting at the}} front and progressing sequentially toward the back, with the laying of the substructure masonry beginning as soon as each section of concrete was cast. The opera house needed a much deeper basement in the substage area than other building types, but {{the level of the}} groundwater was unexpectedly high. Wells were sunk in February 1862 and eight steam pumps installed in March, but despite operating continuously 24 hours a day, the site would not dry up. To deal with this problem Garnier designed a double foundation to protect the superstructure from moisture. It incorporated a water course and an enormous concrete cistern (<b>cuve)</b> which would both relieve the pressure of the external groundwater on the basement walls and serve as a reservoir in case of fire. A contract for its construction was signed on 20 June. Soon a persistent legend arose that the opera house was built over a subterranean lake, inspiring Gaston Leroux to incorporate the idea into his novel The Phantom of the Opera. On 21 July the cornerstone was laid at the southeast angle of the building's facade. In October the pumps were removed, the brick vault of the <b>cuve</b> was finished by 8 November, and the substructure was essentially complete {{by the end of the}} year.|$|R

Two parameters were obtained from ^ Tc-GSA time activity <b>cuves</b> of both {{the heart and the}} liver. One was [HH 15] (Clearance Index), which was the ratio of radioactivity of the liver at 15 min over that at 3 min after injection.

Significant decrease in LHL 15 and increase in HH 15 value were observed in accordance with severities of the liver damage and clinical aggravation. These parameters correlated significantly with Child-Pugh score, glucagon test, ICG-R_, serum albumin levels, cholinesterase, prothrombin time and hepaplastin test also.

40|$|Gorenstein liaison {{seems to}} be the natural notion to generalize to higher codimension the {{well-known}} results about liaison o varieties of codimension 2 in projective space. In this paper we study points in P 3 and <b>cuves</b> in P 4 in an attempt to see how far typical codimension 2 results will extend. While the results are satisfactory for small degree, we find in each case examples where we cannot decide the outcome.

Subject Classification: 14 H 50, 14 M 05, 14 M 06, 14 M 07 1 For curves in projective three-space P 3 k, the theory of liaison, or linkage, is classical, and is now a well-understood framework for the classification of algebraic space curves [21], [12]. This theory has been successfully extended to schemes of codimension 2 in any projective space Pn [2], [30], [26], [22, Ch. 6]. Recently a number of efforts have been made to find a suitable extension of these results in codimension ≥ 3 [22]. Traditional liaison uses complete intersections to link one scheme to another.

40|$|An {{equation}} is derived {{to calculate the}} dynamics of relativistic magnetized plasma which decelerates by sweeping up matter from the ISM. Reduction to the non-radiative and radiative regimes is demonstrated. The evolving electron momentum distribution function in the comoving fluid frame {{is used to calculate}} the observed synchrotron radiation spectrum, assuming that a fixed fraction of the comoving proton power is instantaneously transformed into a power-law, "shock"-like electron distribution function. This permits an analytic solution for the case of a relativistic plasmoid with a constant internal magnetic field. Breaks in the temporal behavior of the primary burst emission and long wavelength afterglows occur on two time scales for external ISM density distributions. The first represents the time when the outflow sweeps up approximately M/G_ 0 of material from the ISM, where M is the mass in the outflow ejecta and G_ 0 is the initial Lorentz factor of the plasmoid. The second represents the time when synchrotron cooling begins strongly to regulate the number of nonthemal electrons that are producing radiation which is observed at a given energy. Results are applied to GRB and blazar variability. The slopes of the time profiles of the X-ray and optical light <b>cuves</b> of the afterglows of GRB 970228 and GRB 970508 are explained by injection of hard electron spectra with indices $s < 2 $ in a deceleration regime near the radiative limit. We also propose that blazar flares are due to the transformation of the directed kinetic energy of the plasmoid when interacting with the external medium, as would occur if relativistic outflows pass through clouds orbiting the central supermassive black hole.

2500|$|Charmat (...) was {{developed}} and patented in 1895 by the Italian Federico Martinotti (1860–1924). The method was further developed with a new patent by the inventor Eugène Charmat in 1907. The method is now named after the latter, but is also called <b>cuve</b> close, metodo Italiano or the tank method. This production method is used mainly in Italian wines, especially in the Asti province, and in Prosecco wines, as well as cheap variants of Sekt. The wine is mixed in a pressure tank of stainless steel, designed to withstand the pressure, together with sugar and yeast. When the sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide, the yeast is filtered and removed, and the wine is bottled. The duration of fermentation affects the quality; longer fermentation preserves the wine's aromas better and gives finer and more durable bubbles.|$|R
