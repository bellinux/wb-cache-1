2500|$|The largest {{redevelopment}} scheme {{in the city}} since Churchill Square has been the laying out of the New England Quarter mixed-use area on the site formerly occupied by Brighton railway works and Brighton station's car park. [...] The early buildings (2004–07 by Chetwood Associates; mostly residential) are [...] "standard 21st-century developers' fare"; but a second phase of building (2007–09 by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios), with retail buildings integrated with residential blocks under the name One Brighton, is more distinctive. [...] BioRegional and the World Wide Fund for Nature's [...] "One Planet Living" [...] design principles were used to ensure the development was sustainable. [...] The best building, a residential block, comes to [...] "a dramatic sharp point" [...] at an acute road junction. Sustainable design also informs smaller developments around the city: Conran and Partners' Atlanta Apartments (2007) in Bevendean have <b>chestnut</b> <b>wood</b> cladding, recycled copper and living roofs of sedum; the Sea Saw Self-Build scheme in Whitehawk (1993) consists of 24 timber-framed houses; the Hedgehog Housing development at Bevendean (2000) is similar; and a multiple award-winning scheme for the South London Family Housing Association at Hollingdean (1988) was also built according to sustainable principles.|$|E

This workshop, it may be remembered, was the old chapel of the Abbey, a very beautiful and still perfect building, finished in early Tudor times, in which, by good fortune, the rich stained glass of the east window still remained.

The floor was hid with rich carpets made of coloured Eastern wools. The furniture also was rich and foreign-looking, being inlaid with ivory and silver, while on the table stood a golden crucifix, a miracle of art, and upon an easel, so that the light from a hanging silver lamp fell on it, a life-sized picture of the Magdalene by some great Italian painter, turning her beauteous eyes to heaven and beating her fair breast.|$|E
60|$|It was a vault low and damp, and {{the waters}} of the river washed its outer wall, for I could hear their murmuring in the silence. Perhaps the place may have {{measured}} ten paces in length by eight broad. For the rest its roof was supported by massive columns, and on one side there was a second door that led to a prison cell. At the further end of this gloomy den, that was dimly lighted by torches and lamps, two men with hooded heads, and draped in coarse black gowns, were at work, silently mixing lime that sent up a hot steam upon the stagnant air. By their sides were squares of dressed stone ranged neatly against the end of the vault, and before them was a niche cut in the thickness of the wall itself, shaped like a large coffin set upon its smaller end. In front of this niche was placed a massive chair of <b>chestnut</b> <b>wood.</b> I noticed also that two other such coffin-shaped niches had been cut in this same wall, and filled in with similar blocks of whitish stone. On the face of each was a date graved in deep letters. One had been sealed up some thirty years before, and one hard upon a hundred.|$|E

The samples were woods in powder obtained during sawing. Complementary characterization of the woods was performed by estimating the crystallinity of cellulose by means of X-ray powder diffraction. In order to simulate the degradation of wet <b>woods,</b> fir and <b>chestnut</b> <b>woods</b> were put into deionised water and into artificial sea water for several weeks; some samples of woods contained Cu and Fe nails to ascertain the effect of these metals on the degradation process.
