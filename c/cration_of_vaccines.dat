5000|$|Aaby is {{credited}} for {{the discovery of}} non-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> - i.e. effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines,</b> which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases. The theory of non-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> was established in 1991 and later documented in several trials on measles vaccine, BCG, oral polio vaccine, DTP vaccine and smallpox vaccine. As a consequence of Aaby’s work on non-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> it has been recommended the WHO vaccination program in low income countries should be changed.

40|$|Background and Objectives: After live {{attenuated}} and subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines {{were introduced}} {{as a third}} generation vaccine {{in the field of}} vaccinology. This type <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> is a promising approach to deal with infectious agents in the future. Although, many aspects of this type <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> has not yet been identified, its use has been initiated in humans and clinical trials, and several DNA vaccines have been developed against veterinary infectious diseases. This generation <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> has provided new approaches to deal with and control existing diseases. In addition to infectious diseases, this type <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> can also be used against different types of tumors. Despite numerous attempts, only one type <b>of</b> DNA <b>vaccine</b> has been approved for use in human.

The effectiveness of a booster dose in previously sensitized individuals was confirmed with a demonstration that a rise in serum antibody appears between 4 and 8 days after the booster inoculation.

40|$|Abstract Background Phase III trials <b>of</b> the malaria <b>vaccine,</b> RTS, S, are now {{underway}} across multiple sites of varying transmission intensity in Africa. Heterogeneity in exposure, vaccine response and waning of efficacy may bias estimates <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> efficacy. Methods Theoretical arguments {{are used to}} identify the expected effects of a) heterogeneity in exposure to infectious bites; b) heterogeneity in individual's response to the vaccine; and c) waning efficacy on measures <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> efficacy from clinical trials for an infection-blocking vaccine. Results Heterogeneity in exposure and vaccine response leads to a smaller proportion of trial participants becoming infected than one would expect in a homogeneous setting. This causes estimates <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> efficacy from clinical trials to be underestimated if transmission heterogeneity is ignored, and overestimated if heterogeneity in vaccine response is ignored. Waning <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> efficacy can bias estimates <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> efficacy in both directions. Conclusions Failure to account for heterogeneities in exposure and response, and waning of efficacy in clinical trials can lead to biased estimates <b>of</b> malaria <b>vaccine</b> efficacy. Appropriate methods to reduce these biases need {{to be used to}} ensure accurate interpretation and comparability between trial sites of results from the upcoming Phase III clinical trials of RTS, S. </p...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{available}} vaccines {{have similar}} efficacy {{if they are}} matched to the most prevalent circulating strains. They also have comparable adverse effect profiles.

The results were as follows: 1) Irrespective of the routes of inoculation and life or death <b>of</b> <b>vaccines,</b> the production <b>of</b> antiboies in mice remained almost independent of the sorts of rickettsial strains. 2) In the case of inoculation <b>of</b> living <b>vaccines,</b> the production <b>of</b> antibodies was the best in those inoculated by intracutaneous route and decreased in the sequence as follows; subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral and intratracheal. 3) In the case of inoculation <b>of</b> inactivated <b>vaccines,</b> the inoculation by intraperitoneal route produced the antibodies in the largest amount, and the antibody production decreased in the following order; intracutaneous, subcutaneous, intracerebral and intratracheal.
