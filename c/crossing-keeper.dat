60|$|The {{train was}} running over the malarial-looking sea-plain--past the down-at-heel palm trees, past the mosque-looking buildings. At a level {{crossing}} the woman <b>crossing-keeper</b> darted out vigorously with her red flag. And we rambled {{into the first}} village. It was built of sun-dried brick-adobe houses, thick adobe garden-walls, with tile ridges to keep off the rain. In the enclosures were dark orange trees. But the clay-coloured villages, clay-dry, looked foreign: the next thing to mere earth they seem, like fox-holes or coyote colonies.|$|E
50|$|There {{used to be}} a crossing-keeper's {{cottage on}} the {{northern}} side of the railway line. The <b>crossing-keeper</b> would open and close the level-crossing gates between each train; principally to let holiday makers to/from the sandy Abererch beach and the adjacent caravan/camping site. The single-storey cottage was externally slate-clad throughout and was situated on the left-hand (east) side when approaching the beach from the A497 Pwllheli - Porthmadog road.|$|E
50|$|Iron Acton station had {{a single}} {{platform}} and a large wooden station building. The remains of the platform survive, as does a <b>crossing-keeper's</b> cottage {{to the south of}} the station site.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{is now on}} the Castleman Trailway, off Horton Road, {{the road}} from the Ashley Heath {{interchange}} to Three Legged Cross. The former line crosses the road next to a shop (formerly the <b>crossing-keeper's</b> house). Short sections of platform including the concrete nameboards remain.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{demolished}} in the 1960s. The part-remains {{of the platform}} survive, as does a <b>crossing-keeper's</b> cottage {{to the south of}} the station site. In mid 2013, the line beyond Yate Middle Jn was placed 'Out of Use', due to the mothballing of the quarry at Tytherington.|$|R
5000|$|The Great Western Railway, {{which had}} taken over the Chipping Norton Railway, opened the {{passenger}} halt on 2 July 1906. It was a standard Great Western design with one timber platform and [...] "pagoda" [...] shelter. The designation [...] "Halt" [...] means it was unstaffed and tickets were purchased on the train. A cart weighbridge was built in 1913 and a <b>crossing-keeper's</b> house in 1930.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>crossing-keepers</b> {{house is}} the only {{building}} now remaining. The small group of houses at Churchill Mill is nowadays known as [...] "Sarsden Halt". The wooden timetable board has been preserved and {{can be seen at}} Winchcombe Railway Museum. One of the platform oil lamps, a signal lamp and a wheel off the sack truck have been privately preserved. The Sarsden Halt nameboard and signal box nameplate are not thought to have survived.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857 a cow strayed {{onto the}} line near [...] and was hit {{and killed by}} the mail train to Omagh. Afterwards the Board of Trade Inspector criticised the {{condition}} of the track, which had been laid only a decade earlier. In 1871 there were two accidents within seven months at , County Tyrone. Both were attributed to the poor condition of the permanent way. A level crossing across Ballyfatton Road between Strabane and [...] was the scene of two accidents. In 1876 the <b>crossing-keeper's</b> wife was killed by a mail train and in 1883 a train hit a horse and cart, killing the horse. After the second accident the Board of Trade ordered the railway to replace the crossing with a bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{building was}} demolished in 1985 {{and replaced by}} a brick building housing a small ticket office and waiting area, which was built in 1985 and was opened in 1986 by Jack Nivison, the former President of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man and MHK for Middle. Before this, the railway station, like several intermediate stopping places on the line, did not provide passenger platforms. The new building, however, was built at platform height, and the platform was long enough for a five-coach train, later increased to seven. The railway station also has a stone-built water tower and <b>crossing-keeper's</b> hut; the latter was extensively modified to house the now-defunct mechanical railway station gates. A <b>crossing-keeper's</b> house {{on the other side}} of the road is now a private dwelling. In 2002 the opposite side of the line also received a full-length platform, which also serves the goods siding, and a modern bus shelter was also installed; the platform edging used had previously been employed for the former South Line departure roads at Douglas railway station and was retained for future use when lifted in 1979. There was also a goods shed on the site â€” a reused wooden building originally from the prisoner of war camp at Knockaloe near Peel, which was also served by the railway during the First World War. Although now extensively modernised and not really recognisable as the railway station that existed until 1985, it remains one of the most picturesque settings on the line and was popular with photographers who had the opportunity to take images of two trains at once. From 2001 to 2012 this railway station was the only crossing place in regular use on the line, as after timetable changes in 2001 there were no crossing trains at Castletown railway station. However, with the introduction of a more intensive high season timetable in 2012, with six trains each way instead of the usual four, some trains have once again been crossing at Castletown, and all trains from 2015.|$|R
