50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the sliding <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> was {{introduced}} which combined {{all the best}} features of the <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> with sliding tubes allowing the cutter head to traverse for a much wider cut. Since then {{it has become the}} primary cross cut saw for woodworking, largely supplanting the radial arm saw.Manufacturers warn of possible electrocution when used near water or other related saws in a close proximity.|$|E
5000|$|Compound-miter saw - Compound {{adds the}} ability to rotate the blade head at a range of angles from the board {{allowing}} you to enter the wood at an angle other than 90 degrees. Creates a ramp angled cut {{into the side of}} the wood. Allows for more complex cuts and is commonly used in trim work for homes. A <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> is known as a single <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> meaning that the head only rotates on one side requiring the user to flip the board to get angle cuts in the other direction.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> began {{to replace the}} radial arm saw, but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since miter saws are unable to perform rip cuts. The radial arm saw can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as {{dangerous}} when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the radial arm saw can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> the radial arm saw can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|E
5000|$|Power <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saws,</b> and {{especially}} the sliding type, have replaced radial arm saws for many woodworkers for MITER cuts.|$|R
5000|$|Power <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm <b>saws.</b> Simple <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> allowed the saw table to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. <b>Compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> also provided saw head tilting allowing <b>compound</b> <b>miters</b> to be cut. <b>Miter</b> <b>saws</b> with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R

50|$|There are {{two common}} ways to fashion inside corners. One {{is to use}} a <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> to cut the ends of the corner pieces along two axes simultaneously. The other, called coping, is a two step process, first to cut a simple miter and then to use a coping saw to {{undercut}} the miters.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike most {{types of}} {{woodworking}} machinery, the {{radial arm saw}} has a clear genesis: it was invented by Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey. DeWalt applied for patents in 1923, which were issued in 1925 (US Patent 1,528,536). [...] DeWalt and others subsequently patented many variations on the original, but DeWalt's original design (sold under the moniker Wonder Worker) remained the most successful: a circular saw blade directly driven by an electric motor held in a yoke sliding along a horizontal arm that is some distance above a horizontal table surface. A saw which combines the sliding and compound features {{is known as a}} sliding <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> or SCMS.|$|E
5000|$|Sliding <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> are {{relatively}} portable, easy to set up, and robust enough to maintain accuracy even when moved around. Because they cut from above {{it is not}} necessary to adjust blade depth for different thicknesses of work piece and, like any bench machine, repeat cuts are very easy. Most saws have an adjustable scale plate for table swiveling with positive stops at commonly used angles. Also, there are usually adjustable stops at 90 and 45 degrees for head tilting allowing easy and very accurate adjustment of the saw.|$|R
5000|$|Electric <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> or [...] "chop saw," [...] or [...] "cut-off saw" [...] or [...] "power miter box": {{for making}} {{accurate}} cross cuts and miter cuts. The basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90° {{angle to the}} vertical. A [...] "compound miter saw" [...] has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles. A [...] "sliding <b>compound</b> <b>miter</b> saw" [...] has a blade that can be pulled through the work, in an action {{similar to that of}} a radial-arm saw, which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces.|$|R
50|$|The <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> {{was invented}} by Ed Niehaus, a tool {{designer}} for Rockwell, in 1964. The <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> showcased several innovations still found today: radial arc spring action, blade braking and dust collection. Rockwell did not patent the design, leading to {{a large number of}} manufacturers and innovation improvements.|$|R
50|$|A power <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> {{also known}} as a drop saw, is a power tool used to make a quick, {{accurate}} crosscut in a workpiece at a selected angle. Commonly used for cutting of molding and trim. Most <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> are relatively small and portable, with common blade sizes ranging from eight to twelve inches.|$|R

50|$|A {{stop block}} {{is a simple}} {{reusable}} jig used in metalworking and woodworking to locate a common edge of a workpiece so that multiple workpieces can get the same operation performed quickly.

5000|$|Standard <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> - A {{power tool}} {{designed}} for straight cross cuts on you lumber {{at a range}} of angles (unlike a chop saw which can only cut 90 degrees to the board). Commonly used to create 45° degree straight cuts for framing.|$|R
50|$|Special {{band saws}} {{designed}} for cutting metal have hardened blades and a feed mechanism for even cutting. Abrasive cut-off saws, {{also known as}} chop saws, are similar to <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> but with a steel cutting abrasive disk. Cutting torches can cut very large sections of steel with little effort.|$|R
50|$|A {{radial arm}} saw is a cutting machine {{consisting}} of a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. Invented by Raymond DeWalt in 1922, the {{radial arm saw}} was the primary tool used for cutting long pieces of stock to length until {{the introduction of the}} power <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Miter</b> <b>saws</b> are {{inherently}} low hazard as the workpiece is held stationary against a fence while the saw head moves, making kick back almost impossible and normally keeping hands {{clear of the}} blade. [...] Also the saw head is usually drawn back, then lowered and fed forward through the material so that binding is unlikely.|$|R
50|$|The <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> makes cuts {{by pulling}} a {{spinning}} {{circular saw blade}} down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise cutting angle between {{the plane of the}} blade and the plane of the longest workpiece edge. In standard position, this angle is fixed at 90°.|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pedagogy: Procedures, Scaffolds, Strategies, Tactics 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentShop safety courses have long been the only way to introduce beginning design students to the tools, methods and appropriate behaviors in the shop environment. These courses and programs are geared towards providing important knowledge so the student can successfully engage the shop. However, they lack hands on experience and can often lead to creating a culture of fear with some students around certain tools and operations. The wood shop acclimation project is executed shortly after students take the shop safety course and prior to being asked to make anything in the shop on their own. It is provided to allow for greater hands on instruction for each student, creating in the students a better sense of confidence in operating the equipment safely and efficiently. The project was conceived as a way to efficiently mass produce a specific item that each student would be required to build to support their current studio project in some way, as a site or as a display. The faculty designs these items and the students would be shown why the item was designed the way it was. Often highlighting economy of means as major design consideration. Since each project always uses plywood as its main material the dimensions of that sheet in relation to each item's components are carefully calculated to minimize scrap. Instilling in the students an important lesson in valuing material. A step-by-step process is designed and laid out for the students. It takes them from a full sheet of plywood to the final assembled item. Along the way certain tools such as the panel saw, table <b>saw</b> and <b>compound</b> sliding <b>miter</b> <b>saw</b> are described {{in terms of what they}} do well and why they are being chosen to perform the specific operation in the process. As an extension to the shop safety course, students are given three concepts to apply to each tool in order to operate it safely and without damage to it, them or the material. These concepts are feed, guide and support and are described at each part of the process on each tool. This gives the students a starting point to correctly evaluate how they need to use the machines properly. Lastly throughout the process students are given an introduction into the appropriate use of jigs and fixtures to aid in the process of mass-producing the item. This stresses the importance of planning out the sequence of how you make something as well as supporting the decision of which tool to use for a specific operation. For example a sled is made for the table saw with multiple fixtures attached to it allowing each part to be cut efficiently and precisely with out measuring that can often lead to error. Also assembly jigs are made so that holes can be drilled identically without the need to measure and mark. The wood shop acclimation project not only serves as an important safety and instructional tool but also as a means to show the students via the design process a way to consider construction, fabrication sequencing and logic related to material and fabrication processes. And most importantly instill in the students a high level of knowledge driven comfort in engaging the wood shop...|$|R

5000|$|An arbor bolt is {{the bolt}} {{that holds the}} blade to the <b>miter</b> <b>saw.</b> The {{diameter}} of the arbor bolt must match the blade hole size in order to properly secure the blade (12" [...] blades commonly use 1" [...] arbor holes and 10" [...] blades favor 5/8"). Arbor bolts are reversed threaded meaning you have to turn clockwise to loosen the bolt. Many inexperienced users will strip their arbor bolt as a result. The arbot bolt is designed so that the rotational spin of the saw blade is exerting a tightening pressure on the blade, {{as opposed to the}} bolt working its way loose and having the flying blade injure the operator.|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the evaluation of the}} generation rate of respirable dust (GAPS, defined as the mass of respirable dust generated per unit linear length cut) from cutting fiber cement siding using different tools in a laboratory testing system. We used an aerodynamic particle sizer spectrometer (APS) to continuously monitor the real-time size distributions of the dust throughout cutting tests when using a variety of tools, and calculated the generation rate of respirable dust for each testing condition using the size distribution data. The test result verifies that power shears provided an almost dust-free operation with a GAPS of 0. 006 g m- 1 at the testing condition. For the same power saws, the cuts using saw blades with more teeth generated more respirable dusts. Using the same blade for all four <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> tested in this study, a positive linear correlation was found between the saws' blade rotating speed and its dust generation rate. In addition, a circular saw running at the highest blade rotating speed of 9068 rpm generated the greatest amount of dust. All the <b>miter</b> <b>saws</b> generated less dust in the 'chopping mode' than in the 'chopping and sliding' mode. For the tested saws, GAPS consistently decreased with the increases of the saw cutting feed rate and the number of board in the stack. All the test results point out that fewer cutting interactions between the saw blade's teeth and the siding board for a unit linear length of cut tend to result in a lower generation rate of respirable dust. These results may help guide optimal operation in practice and future tool development aimed at minimizing dust generation while producing a satisfactory cut.

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which {{work well for}} rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a {{separate}} chop or <b>miter</b> <b>saw,</b> which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed for rip cutting have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. If you use a radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|R
