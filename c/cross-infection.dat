25|$|In {{the early}} {{empirical}} days of vaccination, before Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Lister's on antisepsis and asepsis, {{there was considerable}} <b>cross-infection.</b> William Woodville, {{one of the early}} vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter—the vaccine—with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle. In modern times, an effective scientific model and controlled production were important in reducing these causes of apparent failure or iatrogenic illness.|$|E
500|$|Mayo {{played a}} central role in {{establishing}} Mareeba Hospital and forming its policy, serving as honourable physician at Mareeba, and as honorary responsible officer from 1921 to 1946. To combat the risks of <b>cross-infection,</b> she instituted a policy of strict isolation of babies from other patients. [...] Each child had their own locker, where their own equipment would be kept, gowns used by nurses to tend to one child would only be used for that child, and blankets, bottles and floors were all sterilised. Mareeba eventually became a 70-bed hospital, complete with a surgical unit and a ward for premature babies.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} part of the 1910s, there was an urgent need for medical {{facilities}} to treat infants in South Australia since, due to the risks of <b>cross-infection,</b> the Adelaide Children's Hospital would not treat those under the age of two. In 1913, Mayo and Stirling called a meeting of medical practitioners to discuss the prospect of a hospital for these children. [...] After doubts about the practicality of such a plan were expressed, the group raised some funds and presented to the board of the Adelaide Children's Hospital a plan to use the funds to build a separate ward on the grounds of the hospital. The board rejected the proposal, so Mayo and her group rented a two-story house in St. Peter's and opened a hospital for infants in 1914. Financial difficulties for the hospital eventually became overwhelming and the state government took over the hospital, moving it to Woodville and renaming it the Mareeba Hospital.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, debris usually {{refers to}} {{biological}} matter that has accumulated or lodged in surgical instruments and {{is referred to}} as surgical debris.

40|$|Background: The Drosophila C virus (DCV) is {{a common}} and well-studied Drosophila pathogen. Although natural infections are known from Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, and {{artificial}} infections have been reported from several Drosophila species and other insects, it remains unclear to date whether DCV infections also occur naturally in other Drosophila species. Methods/Principal Findings: Using reverse transcription PCR, we detected natural infections in six Drosophila species, which have not been previously known as natural hosts. By subsequent Sanger sequencing we compared DCV haplotypes among eight Drosophila host species. Our data suggest that <b>cross-infections</b> might be frequent both within and among species within the laboratory environment. Moreover, we find that some lines exhibit multiple infections with distinct DCV haplotypes. Conclusions: Our {{results suggest that the}} natural host range of DCV is much broader than previously assumed and that <b>cross-infections</b> might be a common phenomenon in the laboratory, even among different Drosophila hosts...|$|R
25|$|Further {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} ‘early discharge’, which is defended by the Fundación Canguro, in Bogota, Colombia, and reported in evidence from a Cochrane review. In its origins, this was contextually correct in protecting hospitalised infants from <b>cross-infections.</b> Some argue however that where hospitals {{are not so}} overcrowded, and where home based care is not available or affordable, or where public transport is inadequate, that early discharge should not be practised.|$|R
2500|$|A {{separate}} {{argument for}} starting antiretroviral therapy that has gained more prominence is {{its effect on}} HIV transmission. ART reduces the amount of virus in the blood and genital secretions. This {{has been shown to}} lead to dramatically reduced transmission of HIV when one partner with a suppressed viral load (<50 copies/ml) has sex with a partner who is HIV negative. In clinical trial HPTN 052, 1763 serodiscordant heterosexual couples in 9 countries were planned to be followed for at least 10 years, with both groups receiving education on preventing HIV transmission and condoms, but only one group getting ART. The study was stopped early for ethical reasons {{when it became clear that}} antiviral treatment provided significant protection. Of the 28 couples where <b>cross-infection</b> had occurred, all but one had taken place in the control group consistent with a 96% reduction in risk of transmission while on ART. The single transmission in the control group occurred early after starting ART before viral load was likely to be suppressed.|$|E

In Bogota, Colombia, this could take place at weights around 1000g, with oxygen cylinders for home use; the reason was that overcrowding in their hospital meant that three babies in an incubator would result in potentially lethal <b>cross-infections.</b> An essential part of this is that there is close follow-up, and access to daily visits.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a surveillance method that identifies excessive rates of positive cultures based on patient location, culture site, and organism identification.

40|$|Summary. Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is one of}} {{the most}} common nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative {{microorganisms}} identified in clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains is a growing concern in hospital-acquired infections.

40|$|Non-manual {{techniques}} for terminal disinfection of hospital rooms have gained increasing interest {{in recent years}} as means to reduce transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). A prospective crossover study by Blazejewski and colleagues in five ICUs of a French academic hospital with a high prevalence of MDRO carriers showed that two different hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -based non-touch disinfection techniques reduced environmental contamination with MDROs after routine cleaning. This study provides further evidence of the 'in use' bioburden reduction offered by these techniques. Before H 2 O 2 -based non-touch disinfection can be recommended for routine clinical use outside specific outbreak situations, further studies need to show whether the environmental contamination reduction provided by these techniques is clinically relevant and results in reduced <b>cross-infections</b> with MDROs...|$|R

The large influx of individuals to the point-of dispensing (POD) centers to receive vaccinations or prophylactic treatment, however, raises the potential risk of serious intra-facility <b>cross-infections.</b> To mitigate the effect, a thorough understanding of how disease propagates during the dispensing under different transmission parameters versus POD design and operational factors is necessary. In this study, we employ a large-scale simulation/optimization decision support system, RealOpt, to analyze the propagation of highly infectious disease within dispensing sites. The simulation results are validated and benchmarked by a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations. Pros and cons of using analytical versus simulation tools are discussed. We further perform sensitivity analysis on the dynamics of intra-POD disease propagation, and explore feasible mitigation strategies for effective mass dispensing...|$|R
