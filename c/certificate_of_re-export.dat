5000|$|The {{kinkajou}} ( [...] ) (Potos flavus) is a rainforest mammal of {{the family}} Procyonidae related to olingos, coatis, raccoons, and the ringtail and cacomistle. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Potos and is also known as the [...] "honey bear" [...] (a name that it shares with the sun bear). Kinkajous may be mistaken for ferrets or monkeys, but are not closely related to either. Native to Central America and South America, this mostly frugivorous, arboreal mammal is not an endangered species, though it is seldom seen by people because of its strict nocturnal habits. However, they are hunted for the pet trade, for their fur (to make wallets and horse saddles) and for their meat. The species has been included in Appendix III of CITES by Honduras, which means that exports from Honduras require an export permit and exports from other countries require a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> origin or <b>re-export.</b> They may live up to 40 years in captivity.|$|R

However, the value of domestic exports decreased from 1958 to 1959. In 1959, for the first time, the value <b>of</b> <b>re-exports</b> exceeded that <b>of</b> exports.

40|$|The present article {{deals with}} the {{research}} {{of the concept of}} ‘re-export of financial services’ in banking, the examples of its practical expression and influence on economic processes. For theoretical formulation of the ‘re-export of financial services’ concept the author uses the method of inductive evidence to compare the concepts <b>of</b> export and <b>re-export</b> <b>of</b> goods and services, as well as analyzes historical information on the given subject. Special attention is paid to the comparison of ‘re-export of financial services’ with ‘re-export of capital’. The above mentioned research resulted in the author’s derivation <b>of</b> <b>re-export</b> theory. As practical examples <b>of</b> <b>re-export</b> <b>of</b> financial services the author quotes current schemes used by Latvian banks in their work with fast money transfers and with financial instruments trading on global markets. The article is completed by a disclosure and survey of positive and negative aspects of the influence <b>of</b> <b>re-export,</b> including financial services, on both subjects of economics and economy as a whole. re-export, financial services, banking, export, capital re-export...|$|R

The small amount <b>of</b> <b>re-exports</b> in the ‘services’ product category in Table  4 {{is due to}} certain goods {{that are part of}} merchandise trade statistics but classified in service categories in the CPA 2002 because they are closely linked to specific service categories, e.g., architectural plans and drawings, music (printed or in manuscript) and original works of art.|$|R

40|$|Since the mid eighties, {{re-exports}} in the Netherlands {{has been}} booming, {{with the exception}} of a short interruption in 2001 and 2002. This research shows that a relatively strong growth <b>of</b> <b>re-exports</b> is not just a Dutch phenomenon, but that there is an international trend going on. Re-exported products are at least doubly counted in world trade figures. This international re-exports trend contributes to the fact that world trade volume is growing faster than the volume of world export production. Besides, there are some serious implications for the indicators of countries' exports performances. If one doesn't take account of the implications <b>of</b> the international <b>re-exports</b> trend, the relevant export market growth for Dutch manufactures as well as the loss of market share of Dutch industrialists are overestimated. ...|$|R

In civil cases, although ordinary writs of error were authorized, the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> division remained important [...] because it permitted appeals without regard to the amount in controversy and interlocutory appeals. Inasmuch as the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> division permitted the Supreme Court some measure of control over its docket, it is a precursor to modern certiorari jurisdiction.|$|R

40|$|China's {{trade has}} three features: high {{incidence}} <b>of</b> <b>re-exports</b> through Hong Kong, {{high degree of}} trade related to foreign investment, and large amount <b>of</b> `illegal' trade. <b>Re-exports</b> occur when imports to Hong Kong are consigned to a buyer in Hong Kong, who adds a markup, and exports the goods elsewhere without fundamentally changing the goods. Using U. S. data and accounting for re-exports, the U. S. -China trade balance has to be lowered by 35 percent. Foreign investments in China accounted for 45 percent of China's exports. Foreign investments include foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign subcontracting. `Illegal' trade between China and Taiwan has been induced by Taiwan's `no direct trade' policy. Illegal trade such as smuggling and tariff evasion also affect China's trade with her other trading partners. ...|$|R
