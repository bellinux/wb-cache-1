5|$|Georgia Tech {{also has}} a music scene that {{is made up of}} groups that operate {{independently}} from the Music Department. These groups include four student-led a cappella groups: Nothin' but Treble, Sympathetic Vibrations, Taal Tadka, and Infinite Harmony. Musician's Network, another student-led group, operates Under the <b>Couch,</b> a live music venue and recording facility that was formerly located beneath the <b>Couch</b> Building on West Campus and is now located in the Student Center.|$|E
5|$|Lin {{said that}} he understands Mandarin, though he could use some help {{speaking}} it; he can also read and write a little. He took a few Mandarin classes while attending Harvard to try to improve. After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a <b>couch</b> in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on the <b>couch</b> of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E
5|$|Rory Culkin as Charlie , Dean's younger brother. He {{spends most}} of his time on the family <b>couch</b> playing video games.|$|E
50|$|Many stratigraphic {{formations}} in {{the western}} Alps were first described by Trümpy. For example, the <b>Couches</b> de l’Aroley, the <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains and the <b>Couches</b> de St Cristoph.|$|R
50|$|The <b>couching</b> threads may {{be either}} {{the same color}} as the laid threads or a {{contrasting}} color. When <b>couching</b> threads contrast with laid threads, patterns may be worked in the <b>couching</b> stitches.|$|R
50|$|In Underside <b>couching,</b> a heavy <b>couching</b> thread (historically, a stout linen) {{is brought}} {{up from the}} wrong side of the work, looped over the laid thread, and {{returned}} to the wrong side. The <b>couching</b> thread is then given a sharp pull which draws a small loop of laid thread through to {{the wrong side of}} the fabric. Underside <b>couching</b> has the advantages that the <b>couching</b> thread is completely concealed from the front and is not subject to wear.|$|R
5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they also make wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the <b>couch</b> or taking long walks.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room {{to sit on the}} <b>couch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sugar and Spice, {{played by}} Drew Barrymore and Debi Mazar, try out the Riddler's device during the montage {{when it goes}} on sale. They are seated with the Riddler and Two-Face on the <b>couch</b> where Chase is handcuffed later in the film. This scene appears in the comic {{adaptation}} {{but not in the}} final film.|$|E
30|$|Both wells (GPK- 1 and GPK- 2) {{show the}} {{presence}} of fracture zones at the transition between the <b>Couches</b> Intermédiaires and the <b>Couches</b> de Karlstal, and in GPK- 1, another fracture zone {{is present in the}} <b>Couches</b> de Trifels (Fig.  4).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains are a {{sedimentary}} formation deposited {{during the middle}} Cretaceous (Albian to Cenomanian). It consists of sandstones and black shales. The formation is 5 to 30 m thick. The <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains overly the <b>Couches</b> de l’Aroley and underlie the <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe. All three units together make up the post-rift sequence of the Valais ocean. Outcrops can be found north of Bourg-Saint-Maurice.|$|R
50|$|<b>Couching,</b> the {{stitching}} {{of decorative}} cord {{on to the}} surface of a fabric, was used widely across the Islamic world. In Afghanistan, a velvet dress could be worked in military style with gold-coloured threads on the front, sleeves and hem. Chieftains in Montenegro could wear robes heavily <b>couched</b> in gold thread. In Palestine, dresses could be heavily worked in vertical panels with <b>couched</b> threads of metal and cotton. In Syria, jackets were <b>couched</b> with stylised flowers and trees. In the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, waistcoats were sewn with a combination of appliqué panels and <b>couched</b> metal braid.|$|R
5|$|The board {{noted that}} a {{silver-plated}} copper wire, running through an environmental control unit near the center <b>couch,</b> had become stripped of its Teflon insulation and abraded by repeated opening and closing of a small access door.|$|E
5|$|The scene {{involving}} Chase Meridian on the <b>couch</b> originally {{included a}} longer ending where the Riddler injects {{her with a}} green sleeping agent so he can easily place her in the small tube with the trap door.|$|E
5|$|Their {{temperament}} {{is described}} as gentle, loyal and affectionate, but dignified and aloof with strangers. They can {{appear to be a}} sedate breed and enjoy curling up on the <b>couch,</b> eating and sleeping.|$|E
50|$|The true format {{in which}} to write the name {{seems not to have}} been decided. Even local signposts vary. The three {{different}} ways commonly found of writing the name of the hamlet are <b>Couchs</b> Mill, <b>Couch's</b> Mill and <b>Couches</b> Mill. These are all deemed correct, although the last variation is less commonly found, and generally less accepted.|$|R
30|$|The EPS- 1 drill-core {{analysis}} of the Buntsandstein was used to identify {{the boundaries of the}} Grès Vosgien. This unit is composed of the <b>Couches</b> de Karlstal (poorly cemented aeolian facies), the <b>Couches</b> de Rehberg (fluvial facies) and the <b>Couches</b> de Trifels (fluvial facies). These pink to red-brown sandstone formations are very similar to each other and the proportion of feldspar is basically the same from the top to the base of these units. The GR log has an overall consistent value, except for the transition between the <b>Couches</b> de Rehberg and <b>Couches</b> de Trifels, which is characterized by three well-developed (up to 20  cm thick) red clays that produce rightwards-directed peak in both GR logs and that are evident in the EPS- 1 cores.|$|R
50|$|In Bokhara <b>couching</b> or Bokhara stitch, the <b>couched</b> threads {{are held}} in place with many tiny {{crossing}} stitches, which may be aligned from row to row to produce patterns.|$|R
5|$|While {{lying on}} the <b>couch</b> at home, Homer sees a {{recruitment}} advertisement on television for the Naval Reserve and decides to enlist. Moe, Barney, and Apu decide to join him. Meanwhile, Bart purchases an earring, which an outraged Homer confiscates.|$|E
5|$|A {{frustrated}} Johnny manifests {{a rebellious}} drug-dealing alter ego called St. Jimmy, and injects heroin {{for the first}} time ("St. Jimmy"). His newfound courage thanks to St. Jimmy and the drugs allow Johnny to make a successful move on the girl in the window. Back in Jingletown, Will sits on the <b>couch</b> as his girlfriend's pregnancy progresses. He drinks beer and begs for a release. Meanwhile, Tunny is deployed to a war zone, and is soon shot and wounded ("Give Me Novacaine").|$|E
5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be <b>couch</b> potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Couching</b> is the {{earliest}} documented form of cataract surgery. As a cataract is a clouding in {{the lens of}} the eye, <b>couching</b> is a technique whereby the lens is dislodged, thus removing the opacity. Although <b>couching</b> is nowadays routinely practiced only in remote areas in third world countries, it was a precursor to modern cataract surgery and pars plana vitrectomy.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe are a {{sedimentary}} formation deposited between the Late Cretaceous and the Paleogene. It {{is a very}} monotonous sequence of calcitic sandstones and black schists. These are interpreted as a turbidite sequence. The average thickness of the unit is 500 m. The <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe are a post-rift sequence that overlies the <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains.|$|R
50|$|The Brèches du Grand Fond Group is a {{group of}} stratigraphic {{formations}} in France that were deposited between the Middle Jurassic and the Early Cretaceous. The deposition was contemporaneous to the rifting of the Valais ocean, and overlies the pre-rift rocks along an angular unconformity. The Brèches du Grand Fond Group is overlain by the post-rift sequences <b>Couches</b> de l’Aroley, <b>Couches</b> des Marmontains and the <b>Couches</b> de Saint Christophe.|$|R
5|$|Early in the morning, Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Penny {{wake up to}} find Sheldon {{playing a}} bongo drum, as Richard Feynman played bongos. They try to make him stop but he leaves the apartment, {{eventually}} falling asleep on Amy's <b>couch.</b> The next morning, Penny convinces him to let her cut his hair, although she ends up accidentally shaving off part {{of the back of}} his hair.|$|E
5|$|Halperin also {{explores the}} {{pornography}} industry, the Oscars, and the travails of the casting <b>couch</b> phenomenon. Links to YouTube videos by Halperin are given throughout the book, to illustrate encounters {{he had with}} various entertainment personalities. Halperin meets with famous actors and celebrities including Barbra Streisand, George Clooney and Leonardo DiCaprio, and asks them to share their advice with him about {{the workings of the}} entertainment industry. Halperin eventually lands a talent agent, and a role in the film The Aviator.|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a <b>couch</b> in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the <b>couch</b> with them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Couched</b> stitches, {{where one}} thread is {{laid on the}} surface of the fabric and another thread is used to tie it down. <b>Couching</b> is often used to create a trellis effect within an area of the design.|$|R
30|$|The Complexe du Plio-Quaternaire is in erosional {{contact with}} the {{underlying}} Oligocene (early Rupelian). The {{lower part of the}} <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn supérieures is a homogenous unit composed of calcareous clays intercalated with thin sandstone beds. Correlations inside the <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn are not possible, especially between the middle and lower <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn. The only objective benchmark is the Zone Détritique de Glaswinkel. This small unit consists of a massive sandstone layer that marks the base of the <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn supérieures. It is clearly indicated in the cuttings description by the occurrence of sandstone cuttings and is also clear in the GR log (Fig.  3) with a sharp peak directed to the left (sudden increase in the “sand/clay” ratio) compared to the sections above and below it. The boundary between the middle and lower <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn marks the Oligocene/Eocene boundary, but the precise depth could not be determined.|$|R
50|$|The gold {{embroidery}} is affixed using <b>couching</b> techniques, minimalizing waste. The gold thread {{is attached}} in sections, then <b>couched</b> with a different, less expensive, thread at turns. This ensures {{that none of}} the gold thread is used in a non-visible area.|$|R
5|$|Other {{important}} generals from Massachusetts included Maj. Gen. Darius <b>Couch,</b> who {{commanded the}} II Corps and the Department of the Susquehanna, Maj. Gen. John G. Barnard, {{who organized the}} defenses of Washington, DC and became Chief Engineer of the Union Armies in the field, and Maj. Gen. Isaac Stevens, who had graduated first in his class at West Point and commanded {{a division of the}} IX Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Browns did {{not have}} any draft choices from 1996 to 1998, because then-owner Art Modell took all the team's players to Baltimore, Maryland, {{effectively}} stopping the franchise. However, the NFL mandated that the Browns' name, colors, and franchise history remain in Cleveland and that the team would reactivate by 1999. In 1999, the Browns selected number one overall, drafting University of Kentucky quarterback Tim <b>Couch.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>couch</b> gag was {{suggested}} by Dan Castellaneta's niece. The film True Lies was {{the inspiration for}} the bus crashing against the bridge. To get the fisherman's Chinese correct, Cohen called his friend. When the Chinese actors came, the actors felt Cantonese would be more appropriate for the fisherman than Mandarin, so it was changed. Moe was picked to rescue the children, because the writers thought it was funny.|$|E
