While multiresolution motion search {{has been used for}} standard single-frame motion compensation, here we introduce several novel techniques to exploit it efficiently in the context of LTMC. The proposed algorithm computes a <b>coarse</b> <b>motion</b> vector from a lower resolution sequence to locate motion search windows (MSW). Because the <b>coarse</b> <b>motion</b> vectors are good approximations to the actual vectors, small MSWs whose size are chosen based on the error surface smoothness information can be used without significant loss in quality, leading to significant reduction in complexity. Our approach also incorporates temporal reduction of the motion search range to reduce the complexity further.

In most of the previous region-based video coding techniques, occlusion caused degradation {{in terms of both}} PSNR and perceptual video quality. We propose a new motion estimation and compensation algorithm which solves occlusion related problems effectively. The proposed motion estimation and compensation is a two stage procedure: the first stage uses U <b>coarse</b> <b>motion</b> model while the second stage uses a dense motion model. The <b>coarse</b> <b>motion</b> model generates region level motion vectors which are then fine tuned by the dense motion model which produces pixel level motion vectors.

This {{abstract}} {{presents the}} development of an ultra-precision motion controlled positioning stage for nanometer positioning over a working volume of 50 mm × 50 mm × 4 µm at an accuracy of better than 10 nm that is traceable to the national standards. The positioning stage is designed to use various probing systems to perform “pick and place ” manipulations and scanning of large specimens, including biological. The system is comprised of a two-axis, long-range stage and a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) short-range stage.

This high-precision positioning system consists of a novel concentrated-field magnet matrix and a triangular single-moving part that carries three 3 -phase permanent-magnet linear-levitation-motor armatures. Since only a single levitated moving part, namely the platen, generates all required fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>motions,</b> this positioning system is reliable and low-cost. Three planar levitation motors based on the Lorentz-force law not only generate the vertical force to levitate the triangular platen but control the platen??s position and orientation in the horizontal plane. All 6 -DOF motions are controlled by magnetic forces only. The platen is regarded a pure mass system, and the spring and damping coefficients are neglected except for the vertical directions. Single-input single-output (SISO) digital lead-lag controllers are designed and implemented on a digital signal processor (DSP). This 6 -DOF fully magnetically levitated positioner has a total mass of 5. 91 kg and currently exhibits a 120 mm ?? 120 mm travel range.

30|$|In this article, {{we focus}} on the error {{correction}} under low SNR for ISAR imaging. It is widely accepted that minimum entropy-based phase correction is very robust to noise due to the high-SNR gain from the 2 D coherent integral in image generation. Inspired by this, a novel scheme is established by using the 2 D image entropy as the penalty function to jointly optimize the range shift and phase error. Implemented by quasi-Newton algorithm, a coordinate descent algorithm is developed to estimate the high-order coefficients of the translational motion. To avoid being trapped into a local minimum far away from the ideal solution, a novel method for <b>coarse</b> <b>motion</b> estimation is also proposed. <b>Coarse</b> <b>motion</b> usually provides solution close to the global optimization, leading to significant iteration number decrease in the fine estimation. Utilizing a parametric model on the range history, the proposed method performs well under strong noise.

For example, severe vibration of the target or radar platform could induces random range shifts and phase errors. In this case, random translational motion compensation for ISAR imaging under low SNR is still open.|$|E

Single cell recording studies in macaques have shown variable effects of fine discrimination learning in visual cortical areas V 1 (Schoups et al, Nature, 2001; Ghose et al., J. Neurophysiol., 2001) and V 4 (Yang and Maunsell, J. Neurosci, 2004; Raiguel et al., J.

Here, we determined the effect of coarse discrimination training using static oriented gratings in the ventral visual stream area V 4. We recorded single cell, spiking activity from V 4 while the monkey was trained to discriminate two orthogonal oblique orientations of a sinusoidal grating at different signal-to-noise (SNR) levels. Behavioral performance improved significantly for SNRs greater than 5 % throughout the 60 daily training sessions (robust linear regression; P< 0. 01) and the 75 % correct SNR threshold decreased from ~ 32 to ~ 11 %. During the course of training, single neurons improved significantly in their ability to discriminate the two gratings for SNRs of 20 and 40 % (ROC analysis; robust linear regression, P< 0. 01; N= 108). The difference between the responses to the best and worst orientation increased significantly for SNR of 20 % (linear regression; P< 0. 005).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design, control, {{and implementation of}} a compact highprecision multidimensional positioner. This precision-positioning system consists of a novel concentrated-field magnet matrix and a triangular single-moving part that carries three 3 -phase permanent-magnet planar-levitation-motor armatures. Since only a single levitated moving part, namely the platen, generates all required fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>motions,</b> this positioning system is reliable and potentially cost-effective. The three planar levitation motors based on the Lorentz-force law not only produce the vertical force to levitate the triangular platen but also control the platen's position and orientation in the horizontal plane. Three laser distance sensors are used to measure vertical, x-, and yrotation motions. Three 2 -axis Hall-effect sensors are used to determine lateral motions and rotation motion about the z-axis by measuring the magnetic flux density generated by the magnet matrix. This positioning system has a total mass of 1. 52 kg, which is the minimized mass to produce better dynamic performance. In {{order to reduce the}} mass of the moving platen, it is made of Delrin with a mass density of 1. 54 g/cm 3 by Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining. The platen can be regarded a pure mass, and the spring and damping effects are neglected except for the vertical dynamic. Single-input single-output (SISO) digital lead-lag controllers and a multivariable Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller were designed and implemented. Real-time control was performed with the Linux-Ubuntu operating system OS. Real Time Application Interface (RTAI) for Linux works with Comedi and Comedi libraries and enables closed-loop real-time control. One of the key advantages of this positioning stage with Hall-effect sensors is the extended travel range and rotation angle in the horizontal mode. The maximum travel ranges of 220 mm in x and 200 mm in y were achieved experimentally. Since the magnet matrix generates periodical sinusoidal flux densities in the x-y plane, the travel range can be extended by increasing the number of magnet pitches. The rotation angle of 12 degrees was achieved in rotation around z. The angular velocities of 0. 2094 rad/s and 4. 74 rad/s were produced by a 200 -mm-diameter circular motion and a 30 -mm-diameter spiral motion, respectively. The maximum velocity of 16. 25 mm/s was acquired from over one pitch motion. The maximum velocity of 17. 5 mm/s in a 8 -mm scanning motion was achieved with the acceleration of 72. 4 m/s 2. Step responses demonstrated a 10 -um resolution and 6 -um rms position noise in the translational mode. For the vertical mode, step responses of 5 um in z, 0. 001 degrees in roation around x, and 0. 001 degrees in rotation around y were achieved. This compact single-moving-part positioner has potential applications for precisionpositioning systems in semiconductor- manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Micro- and {{nano-scale}} robotics {{has become}} a new emerging area of systems and controls area recently. These miniature robots have unique advantages such as accessing to unprecedented and small areas, increased flexibility, functionality and robustness, and being low cost, many (swarms), adaptive and distributed. The locomotion and manipulation dynamics of these robots are dominated by micro/nano-scale forces and the scaling effects. The long term target is the miniaturization of these robots down to micrometers size. However, currently, these robots have sizes from tens of centimeters down to millimeters due to limited miniaturization and integration capabilities of available power sources, communication, control and computation schemes and tools, and <b>coarse</b> to fine <b>motion</b> mechanisms, sensors, manipulators, and actuators. This tutorial addresses the research challenges and future directions for these robots with many case studies such as Scanning Probe Microscope dynamics and control, nano-scale manipulation and assembly, human-machine interfacing, and miniature surgical micro/nano-robots.
