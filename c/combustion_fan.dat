50|$|To {{economically}} manufacture a condensing boiler's {{heat exchanger}} (and for the appliance to be manageable at installation), the smallest practical size for its output is preferred. This approach {{has resulted in}} heat exchangers with high combustion side resistance, often requiring {{the use of a}} <b>combustion</b> <b>fan</b> to move the products through narrow passageways. This has also had the benefit of providing the energy for the flue system as the expelled combustion gases are usually below 100°C (212°F) and as such, have a density close to air, with little buoyancy. The <b>combustion</b> <b>fan</b> helps to pump exhaust gas to the outside.|$|E
50|$|When {{the flame}} {{is no longer}} needed, the fuel valves are shut and the <b>{{combustion}}</b> air <b>fan</b> is left running to clear the combustion chamber of all unburnt fuel and products of combustion. The <b>combustion</b> air <b>fan</b> is shut down {{after a period of}} time.|$|R

40|$|Body shapes, {{including}} axisymmetric {{and three}} dimensional, {{have been developed}} to minimize wave drag. The von Karman ogive and the area rule are examples. Similar work has not been accomplished for optimum shapes with propulsion. Propulsion can be divided into two categories—those devices with internal heat addition and those with external burning. For internal heat addition an analytical model is formulated which introduces the propulsive disc, Attention is shifted to external burning, which is examined for one dimensional and two dimensional linearized flow. Heat fronts and <b>combustion</b> <b>fans</b> are discussed as examples. Forces on a heat source in a uniform stream and adjacent to bodies are derived. Several possible applications are examined including base pressure augmentation by external burning, spin recovery using external burning, and transonic boattail drag alleviation. Previous work on base pressure augmentation has used a two dimensional planar model. A two dimensional axisymmetric model is examined.

40|$|The {{combination}} of boilers of high efficiency is presented which contribute to energy saving in domestic heating plants and {{solve the problems}} of delivery of hot water in the favourable terms. They present the following features: conventional or condensing instantaneous boiler, flame modulating, and with electric ignition. A natural gas-fired high efficiency conventional boiler is considered: maximum output 35 kW; combined instantaneous boiler to produce heating and hot water; with a hermetically sealed gas <b>combustion</b> chamber, <b>fan</b> assisted, ready to be connected to flue-gas and external air ducts. Experimental efficiencies and cyclic values, calculated by simulation at partial load, are compared with those of other three different high efficiency boilers, for heating and tap water services: - ON-OFF, conventional boiler with tank; - ON-OFF, conventional instantaneous boiler; - flame modulating, conventional instantaneous boiler...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe new {{developments}} in cookstove design have been made for better usage of sustainable energy and reducing the worse impact of climate change on environment. A cookstove is a combustion device which liberates lot of heat energy during cooking. In the recent developed design of TEG integrated forced draft biomasscookstove, the liberated waste heat energy is utilized for generation of electricity {{with the help of}} a thermoelectric generator. A power of 5 W is achievedthrough the thermoelectric generator. The generated electricity is stored in a Li-ion battery and used further for running a 12 Vd. c. fan, lighting a LED light, and charging a mobile phone. The novelty in charging a Li-ion battery is to run a fan for domestic biomass cookstovefor cleaner <b>combustion.</b> The <b>fan</b> is also used for cooling one side of TEG through heat sink for improving electrical performance of TEG and thus improving the combustion of the cookstove. This cookstove has been deployed in the rural areas to check its usability, viability, electrical and thermal performance under the umbrella of clean combustion...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} single stage earth-to-orbit {{transportation}} is studied {{with respect to}} existing and projected ramjet technology. Four types of ramjet are analyzed: fan ejector, <b>fan</b> ramjet, supersonic <b>combustion</b> ramjet, and <b>fan</b> ramjet with turbojet boosters. A fan ramjet with a removable fan, with separate rockets for the non-air-breathing flight phase, is considered superior to an ejector ramjet, for both ease of orbit insertion and payload boost capability. Vehicle design is also {{discussed in terms of}} trajectory integration and optimization, aerodynamic trim and stability, and complete mass estimation. Graphs are presented showing Mach number for air-breathing and non-air-breathing flight, specific impulse from various ramjet engines, and orbital-insertion parameters...|$|R
6000|$|And so, {{from right}} wing to left, miles long, {{there is now}} {{universal}} storm of volleying, bayonet-charging, thunder of artillery, case-shot, cartridge-shot, and sulphurous devouring whirlwind; the wrestle very tough and furious, especially on the assaulting side. Here, as at Prag, the Prussian troops were one and all in the fire; each doing strenuously his utmost, no complaint {{to be made of}} their performance. More perfect soldiers, I believe, were rarely or never seen on any field of war. But there is no reserve left: Mannstein and the rest, who should have been reserve, and at a General's disposal, we see what they are doing! In vain, or nearly so, is Friedrich's tactic or manoeuvring talent; what now is there to manoeuvre?

40|$|The act of {{condition}} monitoring {{has actually been}} practiced by plant engineers for generating or estimating, how long {{a part of the}} equipment can continue in service until it needs to be shut down for repair using traditional touch, see and hear methods. The applications of computers, electronic measuring and detecting systems have provided a new approach to {{condition monitoring}}. The analysis of the information provided by the sensor output is done by using established techniques and interpretation of evaluated output, is then used to establish what actions are to be taken. The use of vibration signals is quite common in the field of condition monitoring of rotating machinery. In this paper, an attempt has been made to monitor the condition of a <b>combustion</b> air <b>fan</b> located at Wire Rod Mill Department in Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, India. The fan unit is supported by four Plummer blocks, two at motor end and the other two at fan end. Using the accelerometer, the velocities at the bearings are recorded and analyzed using ISO 2372 codes for identification of fault/ faults.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a work availability {{perspective on the}} thermodynamic performance of the turbofan engine and contrasts this with the classic presentation, which describes performance based primarily on cycle efficiency. It is shown that the availability perspective leads to a more fundamental understanding of the basic problem, this being to maximize the conversion of work potential stored in the fuel into useful work output. The discussion specifically addresses the impact of primary turbofan cycle parameters on usage and loss of work potential. It is shown that cycle pressure ratio governs exhaust heat losses, turbine inlet temperature governs non-equilibrium <b>combustion</b> losses, and <b>fan</b> pressure ratio governs loss due to residual exhaust kinetic energy. Finally, simplified loss calculation methods applicable to any turbofan engine are presented and the method {{is applied to the}} analysis of cycle losses in the Northrop F- 5 E propulsion system...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the qualitative behavior of solutions of a Burgers-Boussinesq system – a reaction-diffusion equation coupled via gravity to a Burgers equation – {{by a combination}} of numerical, asymptotic and mathematical techniques. Numerical simulations suggest that when the gravity ρ is small the solutions decompose into a traveling wave and an accelerated shock wave moving in opposite directions. There exists ρcr 1 so that, when ρ> ρcr 1, this structure changes drastically, and the solutions become more complicated. The solutions are composed of three elementary pieces: a wave <b>fan,</b> a <b>combustion</b> traveling wave, and an accelerating shock, the whole structure traveling in the same direction. There exists ρcr 2 so that when ρ> ρcr 2, the wave fan catches up with the accelerating shock wave and the solution is quenched, no matter how large was the support of the initial temperature. We prove that the three building blocks (wave <b>fans,</b> <b>combustion</b> traveling waves and shocks) exist and we construct asymptotic solutions made up of these three elementary pieces. We finally prove, in a mathematically rigorous way, a quenching result irrespective {{of the size of the}} region where the temperature was above ignition – a major difference with what happens in advection-reaction-diffusion equations where an incompressible flow is imposed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{turbofan}} or fanjet {{is a type}} of airbreathing {{jet engine}} that is widely used in aircraft propulsion. The word [...] "turbofan" [...] is a portmanteau of [...] "turbine" [...] and [...] "fan": the turbo portion refers to a gas turbine engine which achieves mechanical energy from <b>combustion,</b> and the <b>fan,</b> a ducted fan that uses the mechanical energy from the gas turbine to accelerate air rearwards. Thus, whereas all the air taken in by a turbojet passes through the turbine (through the combustion chamber), in a turbofan some of that air bypasses the turbine. A turbofan thus {{can be thought of as}} a turbojet being used to drive a ducted fan, with both of those contributing to the thrust. The ratio of the mass-flow of air bypassing the engine core compared to the mass-flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio. The engine produces thrust through a combination of these two portions working together; engines that use more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as low-bypass turbofans, conversely those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as high-bypass. Most commercial aviation jet engines in use today are of the high-bypass type, and most modern military fighter engines are low-bypass. Afterburners are not used on high-bypass turbofan engines but may be used on either low-bypass turbofan or turbojet engines.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{collects}} {{the results}} of research conducted on thermo-fluid dynamics and aero-acoustic noise sources, especially on the characteristic noise of the condensing boilers <b>combustion</b> and centrifugal <b>fans</b> noise. The confined combustion cause instability phenomena which produce pressure fluctuations inside the combustion chamber, resulting in generation of noise. The instability phenomena of condensing boilers can be divided in two main types: {{the first one is}} called "Rumbling," where an interaction among flame, acoustic field and system fluid dynamics occurs; the second one is called "Hooting", which is a thermo-kinetic instability. On {{the first part of this}} paper is shown the experimental and numerical analysis of the "Hooting" in order to find: causes, characteristics, and a methodology that allows the prediction of this phenomenon. For this purpose has been made a simplified prototype of a condensing boiler to study: the main acoustic characteristics of the instability phenomenon, the fluid dynamic parameters which affect its generation and find a simple geometry to perform 3 D simulation analysis. In order to evaluate the influence on the emitted spectrum of combustion chamber geometry, it has been performed an acoustic modes FEM analysis of the combustion chamber prototyped cavity. To study the reproducibility and therefore the prediction of the “Hooting” spectra sound pressure level a hybrid CFD/CAA model has been performed. The above numerical model combining a thermo-fluid dynamics simulation of combustion chemical reaction, with a frequency domain acoustic simulation considering the Lighthill’s acoustic analogy extension proposed by Curle. Beyond to this numerical method, CFD transient simulations have been performed to calculate the spectra of sound pressure levels of combustion chamber, analyzing the obtained pressure fluctuation. The last part of this work described two numerical methodologies to predict the noise level emitted from centrifugal fan outlet. The first one requires the combination of a transient CFD simulation with a CAA acoustic simulation using two different acoustic analogies. The Ffowcs Williams-Hawkins analogy estimates the emitted sound pressure level with the definition of a dipoles distribution placed on fixed and mobile hard surfaces present in a fluid domain. This numerical method enables to calculate centrifugal fans blade passing frequency noise and broadband noise as well. The Lowson theory defines an equivalent single sound source considering the pressure distribution on blades and rotation speed of the impeller. This numerical method enables to calculate only the noise contribution of blade passing frequency and its harmonics. The second numerical method considered enable to calculate the sound pressure level spectra directly from relative pressure fluctuations from CFD transient simulations. The simulation results have been compared with the experimental measurements performed on a test rig carried out according to UNI EN ISO 5136...|$|R
