40|$|Abstract Background EV 71 {{occasionally}} cause {{a series}} of severe neurological symptoms, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. However, the neurological destruction mechanism was remained to be clarified. This study described the <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between EV 71 induced IgG and human brain tissue. Results <b>Cross</b> <b>reaction</b> of the IgG from 30 EV 71 infected patients' sera to human tissues of cerebra was observed, which suggested that some EV 71 antigens could induce IgG cross-reactivity to human cerebra. To identify the regions of EV 71 virus that containing above antigens, the polypeptide of virus was divided into 19 peptides by expression in prokaryotes cell. Mouse anti-sera of these peptides was prepared and applied in immunohistochemical staining with human adult and fetus brain tissue, respectively. The result indicated the 19 peptides can be classified into three groups: strong cross-reactivity, weak cross-reactivity and no cross-reactivity with human brain tissue according the <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> activity. Then, the increased Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability and permits IgG entry in neonatal mice after EV 71 infection was determined. Conclusion EV 71 induced IgG could enter BBB and cross-reacted with brain tissue in EV 71 infected neonatal mice, and then the peptides of EV 71 that could induce cross-reactivity with brain tissue were identified, which should be avoided in future vaccine designing. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} the serological <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between legionella and campylobacter using the rapid microagglutination test (RMAT). METHODS: Serum samples from 49 patients with campylobacter infection were tested for legionella antibodies using the indirect {{fluorescent antibody test}} (IFAT) and the RMAT. Serum samples that had positive RMAT titres were retested {{in the presence of}} a campylobacter immunosorbent. The specificity of the immunosorbent was evaluated with serum from patients with genuine legionella infection (legionella culture or antigen positive, or both). RESULTS: Fourteen (28 %) patients with campylobacter infection had positive IFAT titres (> or = 16) and 16 (32 %) patients had positive RMAT titres (> or = 8) in one or more serum samples. In addition, serum samples from 11 of 17 patients with campylobacter infection, previously shown to have positive legionella IFAT titres, were also RMAT positive. Sixteen patients had RMAT titres of > or = 32, including seven with titres of > or = 128. RMAT titres from all but one patient were significantly reduced after campylobacter absorption, but serum samples from 48 patients with legionella infection were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Serological <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> between campylobacter and legionella can occur in the legionella RMAT, as well as the IFAT. This <b>cross</b> <b>reaction</b> can be eliminated in most cases by incorporating a campylobacter immunosorbent in the RMAT...|$|E
