5|$|Another myth {{surrounding}} this species {{is that it}} occasionally catches small monkeys and other large animals in its pitchers. Such tales have persisted {{for a very long}} time, but <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be explained as rodents being mistaken for other species. It {{is interesting to note that}} one common name for Nepenthes plants is 'Monkey Cups'. The name refers to the fact that monkeys have been observed drinking rainwater from these plants.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} no records of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that of}} Spartacus in Rome. It <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} renewed {{interest}} in Nepenthes worldwide. Much of the plants' current popularity <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be attributed to Shigeo Kurata, whose book Nepenthes of Mount Kinabalu (1976), which featured the best colour photography of Nepenthes to date, did much to bring attention to these unusual plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpsons' home, Bart and Ralph {{discover}} that the penitentiary will once again {{be used by the}} town, and remember that they forgot to disable the power. Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the electric chair in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E
5|$|He {{disappeared}} from the records until found as Official to the Archdeacon of Lothian (1283 × 1285). It is possible that in this period he left Scotland for further study. The position of Official was held under the absentee Archdeacon of Lothian, Adam de Gullane, and afterwards, Archdeacon William Frere, and was probably held along with the post of vicar of Haddington; the latter he definitely held by 1295. Nicholas is found as Official in a document dating certainly between 1273 and 1285, a document which <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be more precisely dated to between 1283 and 1285.|$|E

5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 8th century, sceattas were the primary {{circulating}} coinage. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the moneyer or the king for whom they were produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of Ine of Wessex. This light coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa's reign) <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s. These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and thinner than the pennies they replaced, and were prompted by the contemporary Carolingian currency reforms. The new pennies almost invariably carried both Offa's name {{and the name of the}} moneyer from whose mint the coins came. The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa's own mints: the kings of East Anglia, Kent and Wessex all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the Persians previously. Plutarch suggests that {{in the aftermath of the}} victory at the Eurymedon, Artaxerxes had agreed a peace treaty with the Greeks, even naming Callias as the Athenian ambassador involved. However, as Plutarch admits, Callisthenes denied that such a peace was made at this point (c. 466 BC). Herodotus also mentions, in passing, an Athenian embassy headed by Callias, which was sent to Susa to negotiate with Artaxerxes. This embassy included some Argive representatives and <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be therefore dated to c. 461 BC (after an alliance was agreed between Athens and Argos). This embassy may have been an attempt to reach some kind of peace agreement, and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the Athenian decision to support the Egyptian revolt. The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not, and, if there was, when it was agreed.|$|E

5|$|Named and {{described}} by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk-Białynicka in 1977, Opisthocoelicaudia was first {{thought to be}} a new member of the Camarasauridae, but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria. Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious, but it may have been close to the North American Alamosaurus. All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation. Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils, the only other sauropod from this rock unit is Nemegtosaurus, which is known from a single skull. Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown, several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia may represent the same species. Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation, which include skin impressions, <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland <b>can</b> <b>probably</b> be {{found among the}} {{soldiers}} and ordinary Roman citizens {{in the vicinity of}} Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the 4th century, and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) which existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians. After the departure of the Romans it is generally presumed that Christianity would have survived among the Bythonic enclaves such as Strathclyde, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced, with their gods Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated for the spring festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife. However, despite growing evidence of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at Dalmeny in East Lothian.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} days of World War II, local {{residents}} planned to use Derrick Cave as an air-raid shelter if the Japanese began bombing the west coast of the United States. While residents of Central Oregon never needed an air raid shelter during World War II, Derrick Cave was designated as a nuclear fallout shelter in 1963. Supplies of food and water for up to 1,200 people were stored at the site. The supplies were stored in a small branch of the cave behind a locked steel door. However, vandals broke into the supply vault on several occasions and plundered the food cache. The vandals left the civil defense water <b>cans,</b> <b>probably</b> because they had frozen solid. By 1970, all of the supplies had been stolen by vandals or removed by civil defense authorities.|$|R

30|$|The better {{efficiency}} of NC 15 in this narrowed ammonia concentration range <b>can</b> be <b>probably</b> assigned to core-shell morphology of the nanoparticles constituting the cast nanocomposite film. This morphology typically specifies higher {{surface of the}} film as compared with pure PANI-LSA and improves sensitivity of sensing materials [25, 28]. The enhancement of the sensing responses of pure PANI-LSA at ammonia concentrations above 114  ppm (Fig. 6, curve 2) <b>can</b> be <b>probably</b> assigned to additional involving in the sensing process of the PANI-LSA clusters located {{under the surface of}} the film. Naturally, the quantity of these clusters in the pure doped PANI film is much higher than {{in the case of the}} thin PANI-LSA shells on the core particles constituting the nanocomposite film. Therefore, their involvement in the sensing process inevitably increases sensor responses of the pure doped PANI film as compared with the NC 15 one.|$|R
