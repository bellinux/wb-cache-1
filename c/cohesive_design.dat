From 1918 to 1952, Coffin was appointed the University of Delaware’s landscape architect, a position which required Coffin to unite the university’s two separate campuses (the former Delaware College to the north and the Delaware Women’s College to the south) into one <b>cohesive</b> <b>design.</b> This was a challenge since the linear mall design of each was out of alignment with the other. Coffin solved this problem by linking them via a circle instead of curving the straight paths (the university’s library faces this circle today) which rendered the misalignment unnoticeable to the pedestrian.|$|E

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningTimothy D. KeanePapago Park is an {{extraordinary}} urban space that has a rich history {{in the development of}} the Phoenix metropolitan area. The park was settled by pre-historic civilizations and has since been a significant recreation space for more recent generations. Although the park has been treasured among locals for ages, the development of large tourist attractions and other program elements have not been part of a <b>cohesive</b> park <b>design.</b> The park lacks a sense of unity and a strong local identity. Papago is unique in the fact that it is the only major urban park that showcases the native Sonoran Desert ecosystem. Conservation of these limited areas of native landscape is important. There is great potential for Papago to better respond to the environmental, educational, and recreational needs of the public. With this master plan, development of Papago Park is guided in order to unify park elements and strengthen its identity. It is intended that a <b>cohesive</b> park <b>design</b> which focuses on conservation of native landscape with an integrated social program will help Papago Park gain proper recognition on a regional and national scale...|$|R

In doing so, we propose a new quantum computer architecture based on optical control of quantum dots. The timescales of physical hardware operations and logical, error-corrected quantum gates differ by several orders of magnitude. By dividing functionality into layers, we can design and analyze subsystems independently, demonstrating the value of our layered architectural approach. Using this concrete hardware platform, we provide resource analysis for executing fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for integer factoring and quantum simulation, finding that the quantum dot architecture we study could solve such problems on the timescale of days.

40|$|A key {{characteristic}} of the modern market place is the consumer demand for variety. To respond effectively to this demand, manufacturers need {{to ensure that their}} manufacturing practices are sufficiently flexible to allow them to achieve rapid product development. Fixturing, which involves using fixtures to secure workpieces during machining {{so that they can be}} transformed into parts that meet required design specifications, is a significant contributing factor towards achieving manufacturing flexibility. To enable flexible fixturing, considerable levels of research effort have been devoted to supporting the process of fixture design through the development of computer-aided fixture design (CAFD) tools and approaches. This paper contains a review of these research efforts. Over seventy-five CAFD tools and approaches are reviewed in terms of the fixture design phases they support and the underlying technology upon which they are based. The primary conclusion of the review is that while significant advances have been made in supporting fixture design, there are primarily two research issues that require further effort. The first of these is that current CAFD research is segmented in nature and there remains a need to provide more <b>cohesive</b> fixture <b>design</b> support. Secondly, a greater focus is required on supporting the detailed design of a fixture's physical structure...|$|R
