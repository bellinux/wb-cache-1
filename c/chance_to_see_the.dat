5|$|Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine {{documented}} their {{encounters with}} the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last <b>Chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>See.</b> <b>The</b> book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (淇淇) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (白鱀豚水族馆) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (石首半自然白鱀豚保护区), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded.|$|E

500|$|Live was {{released}} to keep Usher's fans satisfied during the four-year break between My Way (1997) and 8701, his {{second and third}} studio albums, respectively. During that time, Usher was busy pursuing an acting career in films The Faculty (1998), Light It Up (1999) and Texas Rangers (2001). The album was recorded at two free concerts Usher performed {{in his hometown of}} Chattanooga, Tennessee on October15 and 16,1998. Usher stated his reasons for releasing a live album in an interview with MTV, [...] "I really like the sound of a band, that's one, just for myself, but there were so many people who didn't get a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> concert, so I came out with a live version of most of the songs on my album, and I came out with a home video for all the people who didn't get a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> performance, and a little bio of me as well." [...] Seven of the songs included on Live are from Usher's self-titled debut album (1994) and My Way. A medley of songs originally performed by Bobby Brown—"Don't Be Cruel", [...] "Every Little Step", [...] "Rock Wit'cha" [...] and [...] "Roni"—is also featured on the album, along with covers of Force MDs' [...] "Tender Love" [...] and LL Cool J's [...] "I Need Love".|$|E

500|$|This {{decision}} {{brought on}} {{a storm of}} criticism, principally from the magistrates of Essex County, which was geographically closest to the ongoing dispute. [...] John Endecott was particularly critical, noting that Winthrop had given the French a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> colonial defenses. [...] The 1644 election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy, and he was turned out of office. [...] The Acadian dispute was eventually resolved with d'Aulnay as the victor. [...] In 1646, Winthrop was again in the governor's seat when d'Aulnay appeared in Boston and demanded reparations for damage done by the English volunteers.

500|$|The {{letter was}} {{reviewed}} by six reviewers – {{three times the}} Lancet's usual number. Four reviewers found it acceptable after revisions. A fifth thought it was flawed, but wanted it published [...] "to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> data for themselves". The sixth, John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research, also said it was flawed. After consulting with the Royal Society, Pickett publicly criticised The Lancet for agreeing to publish the study. The study, which used data held by Ewen, who was {{not subject to the}} veto of Pusztai's work, reported significant differences in thickness of the gut epithelium between control and test subjects, but did not mention growth or immunity problems.|$|E

A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast. When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reached a crescendo that reportedly made the grandstand shake. Blood-Horse magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: [...] "Two twenty-four flat! I don't believe it. Impossible. But I saw it. I can't breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile!

500|$|Eric Nylund had {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} a Halo related novel with Eric Trautmann, a member of Microsoft's Franchise Development Group, before [...] was developed but it was postponed due to legal technicalities.

[...] He wrote the book based on an outline approved by Bungie and the [...] "Halo Story Bible", a book containing all information on the characters and universe in which Halo takes place, so that his story would not conflict with other Halo publications. Nylund found it easier to write with the [...] "Bible" [...] available as the details of the universe he was writing in were already established, only minor alterations were made to fit the novel into the universe. A seven-week deadline was established for Nylund to write the book. According to Trautmann, the book was nearly cancelled because Bungie was opposed to the idea of the Master Chief having a definite backstory.

Over 150 radio stations participated in broadcasting the band's new daily material, along with MTV, VH1, and digital music retailers like iTunes, as well as Cell phone companies. AOL featured the Chili Peppers as their [...] "Artist of the Month" [...] in June, streaming interviews and live performances of the band free of charge; they also sold an MP3 of [...] "By the Way", the record's first single, for ninety-nine cents and raffled off tickets that gave fans a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> band in Japan in November.|$|E

500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to give them a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E
