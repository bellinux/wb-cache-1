5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} room of his own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> bladder, Joey is given two options: wait until he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E

5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler was available to manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> children through letters.|$|E

5|$|Butlin {{remained}} <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother, both {{in following}} her to Canada and in arranging {{for her to}} come home {{after the death of his}} stepfather. She died in 1934 and never saw his first holiday camp. By contrast, Butlin makes no mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada. Public records from South Africa show that his father remained in Cape Town for the rest of his life, dying in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E

5|$|Gala {{finished}} the first heat {{with a time}} of 13:21.21, finishing 10th.

Gala was <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> personal record of 13:17.77 in the first heat, but he {{finished the}} final {{with a time of}} 13:50.26 and placed 13th overall, out of a field of 43 athletes.|$|E
5|$|Glencross {{established}} himself as an NHL regular in 2007–08.

Glencross appeared in 26games for the Oilers, scoring 15goals and 25points in 61games combined between Columbus and Edmonton. Though he played well with Edmonton, the Oilers {{did not make a}} contract offer, making him an unrestricted free agent. Glencross hoped to remain in Edmonton as it was <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Red Deer home. But after the Oilers made little effort to negotiate with him, he chose to sign a three-year, $3.6million deal with Edmonton's provincial rival, the Calgary Flames.|$|E

5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.|$|E
5|$|In Swansea's {{maritime}} quarter are the Dylan Thomas Theatre, {{home of the}} Swansea Little Theatre {{of which}} Thomas was once a member, and the former Guildhall built in 1825 and now occupied by the Dylan Thomas Centre, a literature centre, where exhibitions and lectures are held and setting for the annual Dylan Thomas Festival. Outside the centre stands a bronze statue of Thomas, by John Doubleday. Another monument to Thomas stands in Cwmdonkin Park, one of his favourite childhood haunts, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> birthplace. The memorial is a small rock in an enclosed garden within the park inscribed with the closing lines from Fern Hill.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Wilberforce {{supported}} {{the campaign for}} the complete abolition of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery {{in most of the}} British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> friend William Pitt.|$|E
