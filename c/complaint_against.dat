5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full scope {{to take control}} of the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay with their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals. These men were quick to report any <b>complaint</b> <b>against</b> officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle.

Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s.
