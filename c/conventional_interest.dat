5000|$|Pendulum arbitration, {{otherwise}} known as final offer arbitration (or [...] "FOA"), {{is a type of}} interest arbitration in which the arbitrator chooses one of the parties' proposals on each (or perhaps all) disputed issues. For example, in the case of labor collective bargaining, a trade union may demand a wage increase of 7% and the management may offer 3%. The arbitrator's decision has to choose between awarding a 3% or a 7% increase. This procedure is opposed to <b>conventional</b> <b>interest</b> arbitration, in which the parties present evidence and the arbitrator acts as fact-finder and crafts an award. In disputes over labor contracts, this dispute resolution procedure is known to be a common type of contract arbitration. Perhaps the most well-known instance is salary arbitration in Major League Baseball, where a certain class of players may elect to arbitrate their salary instead of accepting their team's salary offer. Final-offer arbitration is widely used to determine public union contracts in the United States, either as a substitute for collective bargaining or as a mechanism to determine the contract when bargaining has failed.|$|E

The research focus is supported by more general findings from the education literature which suggest that interest-oriented learning leads to superior approaches to learning. The research was tested using 917 tertiary accounting students across two universities. The associations between vocational interests and learning approaches provide support for the theoretical model linking vocational <b>interests</b> (e. g. <b>conventional)</b> with deep learning approaches in a tertiary accounting environment.

30|$|Furthermore, {{vocational}} classrooms {{vary greatly}} {{with respect to}} instructional contents and learner groups. Very basically, we can distinguish classes for commercial, technical, and social fields of occupation, preparing students to become, for instance, bank clerks, mechanics or paediatric nurses. All of these classes offer highly distinct, targeted instruction in line with occupation-specific curricula (BIBB 2016; Hoeckel and Schwartz 2010). Previous studies suggest that perceived characteristics of instructional interaction differentially affect vocational students’ intrinsic learning motivation, depending on students’ occupational field. Whereas perceived autonomy, competence and social relatedness were prognostically most important in commercial classes (e.g., Helm 2015), perceived content relevance, instructional clarity and level of difficulty were the main predictors in technical classes (Knöll et al. 2007). Following Eder’s (2006) study on person-environment congruence in Austria’s upper secondary school system, schools that offer vocationally oriented education but specialize in distinct occupational fields create different learning environments to match and promote their students’ differing aptitudes and interests. Whereas commercial schools attract students with enterprising, <b>conventional,</b> and artistic <b>interests,</b> technical schools mostly include students with realistic, investigative, and <b>conventional</b> <b>interests,</b> and social schools contain students who mainly pursue social, artistic, and enterprising interests.|$|R

40|$|When the <b>conventional</b> <b>interest</b> {{operator}} {{is used as}} {{the feature}} extraction procedure of face recognition, it has the following two shortcomings: first, though {{the purpose of the}} <b>conventional</b> <b>interest</b> operator is to use the intensity variation between neighboring pixels to represent the image, it cannot obtain all variation information between neighboring pixels. Second, under varying lighting conditions two images of the same face usually have different feature extraction results even though the face itself does not have obvious change. In this paper, we propose two new interest operators for face recognition, which are used to calculate the pixel intensity variation information of overlapping blocks produced from the original face image. The following two factors allow the new operators to perform better than the <b>conventional</b> <b>interest</b> operator: the first factor is that by taking the relative rather than absolute variation of the pixel intensity as the feature of an image block, the new operators can obtain robust block features. The second factor is that the scheme to partition an image into overlapping rather than non-overlapping blocks allows the proposed operators to produce more representation information for the face image. Experimental results show that the proposed operators offer significant accuracy improvement over the <b>conventional</b> <b>interest</b> operator. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to propose}} a new pricing {{alternative}} called Rental Rate Index (RR-I) that captures the true value of property {{to be used by}} Islamic banks in Musharakah Mutanaqisah (MM) contract for home financing. Design/methodology/approach By formulating a profit rate based on Rental Index (RI) and House Price Index (HPI), the proposed rate eliminates conventional profit rate benchmarking, and, at the same time, suggests a fair, equitable and sustainable financing. This new RR-I (measured by RPI/HPI) enables computerization of the MM system in home financing to be easily implemented. A financial simulation is developed to demonstrate the feasibility of this newly proposed rate. Findings This newly proposed RR-I is found to be more stable, having less fluctuations, resilient to macroeconomic conditions and yet comparable to the <b>conventional</b> <b>interest</b> rates, without depending on them. It can also be regarded as a rate that is fair and sustainable to both the customer and the bank, as it measures the actual rate of return to both parties in MM contract. Research limitations/implications The paper confines one contract, namely, MM, as it is claimed to be more Shariah-compliant than others. Practical implications The finding also sheds some light on the recommendation by Bank Negara Malaysia, which is to consider RR that is more indicative of the actual rental price while taking into account the competitiveness of the product.
