50|$|A {{handful of}} engines, now largely diesels, {{retained}} hopper cooling into the 21st century. These were simply constructed engines, still using cast-iron blocks {{to provide more}} strength from a <b>crude</b> <b>foundry,</b> as a diesel engine required more strength than unsophisticated aluminium castings could provide. Single cylinder horizontal diesel engines were built in India and China and were briefly imported to the West around 2000, but were outlawed by emission control regulations.|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{dendritic}} structure, the mechanical properties of <b>foundry</b> <b>products</b> depend on the parameters: primary and secondary arm spacings. Therefore, {{it is very important}} that the computational programs use reliable equations for correlating the calculated thermal parameters with the obtained interdendritic spacings. This study presents a numerical and experimental analysis of some models for predicting the secondary arm spacings as a function of thermal parameters. The comparison between the numeric and experimental results for stainless steel permits the determination of the adequate equation for unidirectional solidification...|$|R
