5000|$|In {{the history}} of agriculture, farmers {{observed}} a traditional distinction between [...] "winter cereals", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and [...] "spring cereals", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist John Hancock Klippart, Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One {{of the most significant}} works was by a German plant physiologist Gustav Gassner who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold. [...] In 1928 a Russian geneticist Trofim Lysenko published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and <b>coind</b> the term [...] "яровизация" [...] ("jarovization") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (Jarovoe in Russian, originally from - from jar meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into [...] "vernalization" [...] (from the Latin vernum meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as [...] "the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment".|$|E
40|$|High-strength {{steel grades}} with high wear {{resistance}} and high toughness are potential candidates to reduce weight in heavy construction, agricultural machinery and shipbuilding. Weldability of HSS grades has limitations {{due to the}} loss of material properties caused by the complex thermomechanical treatments (i. e. increase of hardness and reduction of toughness caused by martensite formation within the weld seam and the resulting increment of the cold crack probability). The existing limitations can be overcome by the use of appropriate welding methods, such as laser welding combined with induction heating. In the present work, the effect of inductive heating on the microstructure and mechanical properties of fusion and heat-affected zones in butt-joints of the structural steel S 690 QL (3. 0 - 6. 0 mm sheet thicknesses) produced by <b>CO(ind</b> 2) laser welding is studied by optical microscopy and hardness measurements. The results reveal that laser welding without induction heating causes heavy martensite formation in the fusion and heat affected zones, which results in a strong increase of hardness when compared with the parent material. Inductive annealing produces tempered martensite in the fusion zone, thus, leading to a significant and homogeneous reduction of hardness. The effect decreases with increasing sheet thickness. The most promising results are obtained by induction pre- and post-heat-treatments, where the hardness in the fusion zone is similar to that found in the parent material for both thin and thick sheets. However, the hardness distribution is not homogeneous and thermal martensite is formed in the heat-affected zone due to still fast cooling times...|$|E

A defender, he too played with Bilbao Athletic and Sestao (<b>coinding</b> with his sibling in the latter as he was playing his final year), and {{appeared}} in two top level seasons with Real Oviedo (1988-90).|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} to teach four mild and moderately retarded persons to sum {{the value of}} coin combinations was tested. Subjects were first taught to count a single target coin, and then to sum that coin in combination with coins previously trained. Five American coins and various combinations were trained. Modelling, modelling with subject participation, and independent counting by the subject constituted the training sequence. The subjects improved from a mean pretest score of 29 % to 92 % correct at posttest. A four-week followup score showed a mean of 79 % correct. A multiple-baseline design suggested that improvement in coin-counting performance occurred only after the coin was trained. The results indicate that this procedure has potential for teaching the retarded to sum combinations of <b>coinds</b> in 5 to 6 hr of instruction...|$|R
