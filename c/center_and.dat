5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish Center (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn Jewish Center, the Flatbush Jewish <b>Center,</b> <b>and</b> the Ocean Parkway Jewish Center (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish Center has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish <b>Center,</b> <b>and</b> the Brooklyn Jewish Center in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish Center, stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood <b>Center,</b> <b>and</b> that the Building Committee completed them, in order to save money.|$|E

5|$|Physically, the {{cyclonic}} {{circulation of}} the storm advects environmental air poleward east of <b>center</b> <b>and</b> equatorial west of center.

The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs {{even if there is}} zero environmental flow.|$|E

5|$|After 1986, the Jewish Community of Zagreb {{began to}} {{consider}} a Jewish cultural <b>center</b> <b>and</b> a memorial synagogue. Two architects, Branko Silađin and Boris Morsan, both of whom participated in the failed 1977 department store competition, came forward on their own accord and contributed their ideas for a new Jewish center in Praška Street.

However, despite support for the project both within Yugoslavia and abroad, the issuance of necessary permits was either stalled or denied by the municipal government.
