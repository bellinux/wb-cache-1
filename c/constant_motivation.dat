5000|$|Marx and Engels {{first started}} with the {{observation}} that everything in existence is a combination or unity of opposites. For example, electricity {{is characterized by a}} positive and negative charge and atoms consist of protons and electrons which are unified but are ultimately contradictory forces. Even humans through introspection find that they are a unity of opposite qualities. Masculinity and femininity, selfishness and altruism, humbleness and pride, etc. The Marxist conclusion being that everything [...] "contains two mutually incompatible and exclusive but nevertheless equally essential and [...] parts or aspects."¹ The basic concept being that this unity of opposites in nature is the thing that makes each entity auto-dynamic and provides this <b>constant</b> <b>motivation</b> for movement and change. This idea was borrowed from Georg Wilhelm Hegel who said: [...] "Contradiction in nature is the root of all motion and of all life." ...|$|E
