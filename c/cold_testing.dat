50|$|Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is a {{component}} of the James Webb Space Telescope, a large international infrared space telescope planned for launch in 2018. ISIM {{is the heart of the}} JWST, and holds the main science payload which includes four science instruments and the fine guidance sensor. ISIM is the spacecraft chassis and instruments that take the light from the main mirror and convert that into the science data that is then sent back to Earth. The other two major sections of the JWST are the Optical Telescope Element (OTE) (mirror and their structure) and the Spacecraft Element (SE), which includes the Spacecraft Bus and Sunshield. ISIM has a mass of 1.4 metric tons (tonnes) (1.54 US tons). The infrared camera instrument integrated with ISIM passed its thermal tests in early 2016. ISIM underwent intense thermal <b>cold</b> <b>testing</b> in late 2015 to early 2016. NIRcam is extremely important to JWST, because it's not only a sensitive infrared camera, but it is also used to adjust the alignment of the main mirror segments.

NIRcam was installed into ISIM in March 2014, and then underwent integration and testing after that, as the telescope is readied for its 2018 launch.

Thermal and electrical tests are conventional methods for evaluation of pulp vitality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of thermal changes on the toothresponse to the electric pulp tester. Materials and Methods: In this study, 160 intact maxillary central incisors of 40 voluntaries were evaluated. After isolation, electric pulpal response threshold in patients were recorded. After heat and <b>cold</b> <b>tests,</b> the electrical pulp test was repeated. The degree of response was recorded. The data were analyzed using pair T-test and independent T-test. Results: The result of this study demonstrated that the average of teeth response to the electric pulp tester before and after <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> was 1. 3 and 1. 7, respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growing demand}} for high quality soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seeds {{requires}} a precise seed quality control system from the seed industry. One way to accomplish this is by improving vigor <b>testing.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>test</b> has been traditionally employed for corn seeds. However, {{it has also been}} used for other seed crops such as cotton (Gossypium spp.), soybean (Glycine Max), dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (Pisum sativum). This study was carried out with the objective of adjusting an alternative procedure for the <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> to determine soybean seed vigor. Six commercial soybean seed lots of the cultivar BRS 133 were used. The physiological potential of the seed lots was evaluated by germination on paper towel and sand box, seedling field emergence, tetrazolium, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity tests. Seed moisture content was also determined. The temperature used for the <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> procedures was 10 °C during five days. Four <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> procedures were evaluated: i) plastic boxes with soil; ii) rolled paper towel with soil; iii) rolled paper towel without soil, and iv) an alternative procedure, using rolled paper towel without soil under cold water. A completely randomized experimental design with eight replications was used and the means were compared by the Tukey test (p = 0. 05). To verify the dependence between the alternative test and others single linear correlation was used. All <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> procedures had similar coefficients of variation (CV), highlighting that rolled paper towel with soil and the alternative procedure had the best performance, with an average of 94 % and 93 % normal seedlings and CV of 3. 2 % and 3. 6 %, respectively.
