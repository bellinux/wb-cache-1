5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger,</b> resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E
25|$|Infliximab {{works by}} binding to TNF-α. TNF-α is a <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> (cytokine) {{and a key}} part of the {{autoimmune}} reaction. In rheumatoid arthritis, infliximab seems to work by preventing TNF-α from binding to its receptor in the cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{forms of}} {{myoclonus}} where {{only a single}} area is affected, and even in a few other various forms, Botox injections (OnabotulinumtoxinA) may be helpful.

30|$|Dopamine and {{serotonin}} are {{two powerful}} neurotransmitters that affect one’s mood and happiness. In general, neurotransmitters are <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> which neurons use to tell other neurons {{that they have}} received an impulse.|$|R

25|$|In 1928, the Dutch {{botanist}} Frits Warmolt Went {{showed that}} a <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> diffuses from coleoptile tips. Went's experiment identified how a growth promoting chemical causes a coleoptile to grow towards light. Went cut {{the tips of the}} coleoptiles and placed them in the dark, putting a few tips on agar blocks that he predicted would absorb the growth-promoting chemical. On control coleoptiles, he placed a block that lacked the chemical. On others, he placed blocks containing the chemical, either centred on top of the coleoptile to distribute the chemical evenly or offset to increase the concentration on one side.|$|E
25|$|Alkanes {{are found}} in animal products, {{although}} they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. One example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C19H40). They are important as pheromones, <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> materials, on which insects depend for communication. In some species, e.g. the support beetle Xylotrechus colonus, pentacosane (C25H52), 3-methylpentaicosane (C26H54) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C26H54) are transferred by body contact. With others like the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans, the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C18H38), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C39H80), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C39H80) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C40H82), and acts by smell over longer distances. Waggle-dancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.|$|E
25|$|The {{red-headed}} krait is {{an extremely}} venomous snake, although bites are reported rarely. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses, causing paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breathe on their own. When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles {{are the first to}} suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or her eyelids open. This medical condition is known as bilateral ptosis and it is a classic, tell-tale sign of severe envenomation. Other common symptoms include diplopia, dysphagia, vomiting, headache, and hypersalivation. Sometime later the symptoms of paralysis tend to worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing. Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed κ-flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia. Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> carrying signals from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> called cytokines play an impor-tant role {{during the}} body’s initial {{response}} to infection (i. e., acute inflammation). Cytokines attract and activate {{components of the}} immune system, promote blood clotting, and facilitate the release of additional <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers.</b> In addition, cytokines induce the liver to shift its physiological function, emphasizing inflammatory and immune responses {{at the expense of}} normal metabolism. Alcohol consumption may cause excessive cytokine production in the liver, leading to inflammatory liver disease. Researchers are seeking ways to moderate the toxic effects of cytokines while sparing their protective functions.

50|$|Recent {{studies in}} {{a myriad of}} systems have shown that most, if not all, neurons release several {{different}} <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers.</b> Cotransmission allows for more complex effects at postsynaptic receptors, and thus allows for more complex communication to occur between neurons.|$|R
5000|$|Neurotransmitters, {{also known}} as <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers,</b> are {{endogenous}} <b>chemicals</b> that enable neurotransmission. They transmit signals across a chemical synapse, such as a neuromuscular junction, from one neuron (nerve cell) to another [...] "target" [...] neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell. Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles in synapses into the synaptic cleft, where they are received by receptors on the target cells. Many neurotransmitters are synthesized from simple and plentiful precursors such as amino acids, which are readily available from the diet and only require {{a small number of}} biosynthetic steps for conversion. Neurotransmitters {{play a major role in}} shaping everyday life and functions. Their exact numbers are unknown, but more than 100 <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> have been uniquely identified.|$|R
500|$|The {{nerve impulse}} is characterised {{by a great}} influx of sodium ions through {{channels}} in the neuron's cell membrane followed by an efflux of potassium ions through other channels. The neuron is unable to fire again {{for a short time}} (known as the refractory period), which is mediated by another potassium channel. The flow through these ion channels is governed by a [...] "gate" [...] which is opened by either a voltage change or a <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> known as a ligand (such as a neurotransmitter). These channels are another target for anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
500|$|Outside {{the central}} nervous system, {{dopamine}} functions primarily as a local <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger.</b> [...] In blood vessels, it inhibits norepinephrine release and acts as a vasodilator (at normal concentrations); in the kidneys, it increases sodium excretion and urine output; in the pancreas, it reduces insulin production; in the digestive system, it reduces gastrointestinal motility and protects intestinal mucosa; and in the immune system, it reduces the activity of lymphocytes. [...] With {{the exception of the}} blood vessels, dopamine in each of these peripheral systems is synthesized locally and exerts its effects near the cells that release it.|$|E
500|$|The men {{knew that}} the {{pancreas}} produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in the duodenum and jejunum, because of the arrival of chyme there. By severing the duodenal and jejunal nerves in anaesthetized dogs, while leaving the blood vessels intact, then introducing acid into the duodenum and jejunum, they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response, but by {{a new type of}} chemical reflex. They named the <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> secretin, because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, stimulating the pancreas on circulation. In 1905 Starling coined the term hormone—from the Greek hormao [...] meaning [...] "I arouse" [...] or [...] "I excite"—to describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable, in extremely small quantities, of stimulating organs from a distance.|$|E
50|$|Eric Kandel (Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2000) {{demonstrated}} {{the existence of}} a genetic memory. Now, it is possible to differentiate between genetic and epigenetic in mental disorders.

50|$|In 1921, Loewi {{investigated}} how {{vital organs}} respond to chemical and electrical stimulation. He also established their relative dependence on epinephrine for proper function.

50|$|NINDS {{investigators}} {{are also looking}} at larger, tissue-specific changes within the brain after a TBI. Researchers have shown that trauma to the frontal lobes of the brain can damage specific <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> systems, specifically the dopaminergic system, the collection of neurons in the brain that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is an important <b>chemical</b> <b>messenger</b> - for example, degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons is {{the primary cause of}} Parkinson's disease. NINDS researchers are studying how the dopaminergic system responds after a TBI and its relationship to neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study reports how quantal size, or the {{quantity}} of <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> within a storage granule, is regulated in platelet dense-body granules via dynamic adaption of granule size according to changing levels of granule contents. Mechanistic studies using carbon-fiber microelectrode fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and amperometry methods correlated with transmission electron microscopy analysis reveal the impact of granule structural changes on granular content secretion kinetics and highlight the dynamic interplay between soluble granule contents and membrane components in exocytosis. Despite the distinct chemical profile of platelet dense-body granules, these secretory granules act according to general biochemical/biophysical phenomena using charge-charge interactions to sequester <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> and employ known conserved exocytotic machinery to deliver them; therefore, the mechanistic information obtained herein further advances the general understanding of exocytosis while revealing fundamental details about blood platelets...|$|R
40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground A key property of neurons and neuroendocrine cells is the regulated release of <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> to convey information to target cells across microscopic distances for the neurotransmitters at the synaptic cleft or along macroscopic dimensions for humorally distributed hor-mones. The cellular machinery to achieve the regulated release of these <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> relies in part on the same vesicular, cytoplasmic and plasma membrane proteins [1, 2]. Peripheral sympathetic neurons and ad-renal chromaffin cells, derived from the same precursor population, the neural crest, provide an excellent model system to analyze the mediators regulating the diver-gence of neuronal and neuroendocrine cell fates [3]. Early studies of rodent development shaped the idea that both sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffi...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of leptin in 1994 sparked dramatic {{new interest in}} the study of white adipose tissue. It is now recognised to be a metabolically active endocrine organ, producing important <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> – adipokines and cytokines (adipocytokines). The search for new adipocytokines or adipokines gained added fervour with the prospect of the reconciliation between cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), obesity and metabolic syndrome. The role these new <b>chemical</b> <b>messengers</b> play in inﬂammation, satiety, metabolism and cardiac function has paved the way for new research and theories examining the effects they have on (in this case) CVD.
