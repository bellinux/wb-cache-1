5|$|The Pevensies save Trumpkin {{from being}} drowned by two Telmarines. Trumpkin is {{convinced}} that the four <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Kings and Queens of Old, and they continue on together. Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to a gathering of Narnians, where Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne so he can return their land. They meet the Pevensies and Trumpkin, and all journey to Aslan's How. Peter decides they will attack Miraz's castle, rejecting Lucy's advice that they wait for Aslan to return. The Narnians raid Miraz's castle, but Caspian ruins the plan by freeing Cornelius instead of opening the gate. He learns that Miraz killed his father, and confronts Miraz but is wounded. Overwhelmed, Peter calls for a retreat. Peter, Susan, Edmund, Caspian and the Narnians escape with heavy losses. Upon returning to Aslan's How, Peter and Caspian argue, while back at the castle, Miraz is crowned King.|$|E

25|$|In general, Filipino {{women find}} {{pride in their}} work. They do not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families.

In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E
25|$|Wills and estate planning: Trusts {{frequently}} {{appear in}} wills (indeed, technically, {{the administration of}} every deceased's estate {{is a form of}} trust). Conventional wills typically leave assets to the deceased's spouse (if any), and then to the children equally. If the children are under 18, or under some other age mentioned in the will (21 and 25 are common), a trust must come into existence until the contingency age is reached. The executor of the will is (usually) the trustee, and the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> beneficiaries. The trustee will have powers to assist the beneficiaries during their minority.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the average}} Indian woman's life is spent in marriage; many women are still married before the legal age of 18, and the {{incidence}} of non-marriage is low in India. [...] Childbearing and raising <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> priorities of early adulthood for Indian women. Thus, if they enter the workforce at all, it is far later than Indian men. [...] Urban Indian men reach the peak of their labour force participation {{between the ages of}} 25 and 29, while urban Indian women do so between the ages of 40 and 44. Because of this, women have less time for the acquisition of skills and fewer opportunities for job improvements.|$|E

(Gaudium et spes)." [...] It recognizes that responsible parenthood sometimes calls for reasonable spacing or limiting of births and considers natural family planning as morally acceptable, but rejects all methods of artificial contraception.

[...] Chab Dai sought to research ways to improve anti-human-trafficking activities in Canada and to facilitate information sharing between anti-human-trafficking organisations and the federal and provincial governments. In April 2013, a troika of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights composed of Brazil, the Philippines, and the Republic of Ireland released a report reviewing Canada {{as part of that}} year's Universal Periodic Review; the report highlighted the establishment of the NAP-CHT as a positive achievement.

500|$|Australian {{novelist and}} poet Randolph Stow uses {{the account of}} the green {{children}} in his 1980 novel The Girl Green as Elderflower; the green girl is the source for the title character, here a blond girl with green eyes. The green children become a source of interest to the main character, Crispin Clare, along with some other characters from the Latin accounts of William of Newburgh, Gervase of Tilbury, and others, and Stow includes translations from those texts: these characters [...] "have histories of loss and dispossession that echo [...] own". The green <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> subject of a 1990 community opera performed by children and adults, composed by Nicola LeFanu with a libretto written by Kevin Crossley-Holland. In 2002 English poet Glyn Maxwell wrote a verse play based on the story of the green children, Wolfpit (the earlier name for Woolpit), which was performed once in New York City. In Maxwell's version the girl becomes an indentured servant to the lord of the manor, until a stranger named Juxon buys her freedom and takes her to an unknown destination.|$|E

[...] "The Love Song" [...] was {{described}} by Manson as an ode to Celebritarianism, and its title originated from his observation that [...] "Love Song" [...] {{is one of the}} most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: [...] "I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> bullets. Where you shoot them is your responsibility as parents." [...] The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American bumper sticker: [...] "Do you love your God, gun, government?" [...] Kerrang! described [...] "The Fight Song" [...] as a [...] "playground punk anthem", and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam's desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about [...] "a person who's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally , he realizes that it's worse than where he came from." ...|$|E

Several visits to Clovelly in Devon prompted him to adopt coastal scenes as his main motif and showed the hardship and rewards of life by the sea. Some early examples are [...] "A Signal on the Horizon" [...] (1857), [...] "," [...] "The Ship-boy's Letter," [...] "Children's <b>Children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Crown of Old Men," [...] "A Coast-boy gathering Eggs," [...] a scene at Lundy; [...] "Luff, Boy!" [...] (1859), [...] "The Book, Stand Clear! O Well for the Fishermans Boy!" [...] (1860), [...] "Leaving Cornwall for the Whitby Fishing," [...] and [...] "Sea Urchins". He painted these types of scenes so frequently that his coastal paintings were soon dubbed [...] "Hookscapes".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting <b>children</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
