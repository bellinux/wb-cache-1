5|$|With {{the public}} {{suspicious}} of immigrants, {{especially those who}} might be socialists or communists, Congress passed the Per Centum Act of 1921, signed by Harding on May 19, 1921, as a quick means of restricting immigration. The act reduced the numbers of immigrants to 3% of those from a given <b>country</b> <b>living</b> in the U.S., based on the 1910 census. This would, in practice, not restrict immigration from Ireland and Germany, but would bar many Italians and eastern European Jews. Harding and Secretary of Labor James Davis believed that enforcement had to be humane, and at the secretary's recommendation, Harding allowed almost a thousand deportable immigrants to remain. Coolidge signed a bill permanently restricting immigration to the U.S. in 1924.|$|E

40|$|The authors address whether “negative” {{assimilation}} among immigrants {{living in}} the United States occurs if skills are highly transferable internationally. They outline the conditions for negative assimilation {{in the context of}} the traditional immigration assimilation model, in which negative assimilation arises not from a deterioration of skills but from a decline in the wages afforded by skills coincident with the duration of residence. The authors use U. S. Census data from 1980, 1990, and 2000 to test the hypothesis on immigrants to the United States from English-speaking developed countries. They present comparisons with native-born workers to determine whether the findings are sensitive to immigrant cohort quality effects and find that even after controlling for these effects, negative assimilation still occurs for immigrants in the sample. They also find that negative assimilation occurs for immigrants from English-speaking developed <b>countries</b> <b>living</b> in Australia and for immigrants from Nordic <b>countries</b> <b>living</b> in Sweden...|$|R

25|$|Now Queen of Yugoslavia, Alexandra, however, had tenuous {{links with}} her new <b>country,</b> <b>living</b> under the Nazi occupation. In 1941, {{a large portion of}} the Yugoslav {{territory}} was annexed by the Axis powers. Crown Prince Michael of Montenegro refused to resurrect his ancient Kingdom under Italian and German protection and guidance, and thus the region of Montenegro has been transformed into a governorate by fascist Italy. Finally, the other two main parts of Yugoslavia were reduced to puppet states: the Serbia of General Milan Nedić and the Croatian Kingdom of the Ustaše. As all over occupied Europe, Yugoslav civilians suffered the abuses of the invaders and collaborators who supported them. Two groups emerged in the country: the Chetniks, led by General monarchist Draža Mihailović, and the Partisans, led by the communist Marshal Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
