40|$|Assessing the {{vulnerability}} of an enterprise’s infrastructure {{is an important step}} in judging the security of a network and the trustworthiness and quality of the information that flows through it. Currently real-world infrastructure vulnerability is often judged in an ad hoc manner, based on the criteria and experience of the assessors. While methodological approaches to assessing infrastructure vulnerability exist, in practice they are not academically rigorous, having grown organically to meet business requirements. Our aim in this paper therefore is to study infrastructure vulnerability from a more structured perspective. We introduce and explore a novel way of assessing computer network infrastructure vulnerability. Instead of attempting to find vulnerabilities in infrastructure, we instead assume the network is insecure, and measure its vulnerability based on the controls that have (and have not) been put in place. We consider different control schemes for addressing vulnerability, and look at how one of them, namely the Council on <b>Cyber</b> <b>Security’s</b> Top 20 Critical Security Controls, can be applied. </p...|$|R

40|$|Assessing the {{vulnerability}} of an enterprise's infrastructure {{is an important step}} in judging the security of its network and the trustworthiness and quality of the information that flows through it. Currently, low-level infrastructure vulnerability is often judged in an ad hocmanner, based on the criteria and experience of the assessors. While methodological approaches to assessing an organisation's vulnerability exist, they are often targeted at higher-level threats, and can fail to accurately represent risk. Our aim in this paper therefore, is to explore a novel, structured approach to assessing low-level infrastructure vulnerability. We do this by placing the emphasis on a controls-based evaluation over a vulnerability-based evaluation. This work aims to investigate a framework for the pragmatic approach that organisations currently use for assessing low-level vulnerability. Instead of attempting to find vulnerabilities in infrastructure, we instead assume the network is insecure, and measure its vulnerability based on the controls that have (and have not) been put in place. We consider different control schemes for addressing vulnerability, and show how one of them, namely the Council on <b>Cyber</b> <b>Security's</b> Top 20 Critical Security Controls, can be applied...|$|R
