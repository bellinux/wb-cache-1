With describing non-isothermal dumbbell spring, as the function of temperature, the non-linear elastic coefficient expression causes the appearance of temperature gradient in stress constitutive equations. Following the constitutive equation of Hookean dumbbell model, non-isothermal stress constitutive equations of FENE and FENE-P models are derived. In deriving process of constitutive equations, the second moment approximation is used to closure FENE model. Using the non-isothermal constitutive equations, numerical simulations of polymer flow through shear cavity and planar <b>contraction</b> <b>cavity</b> are presented. And the distributions of correlative stress functions {{and the effects of}} different temperatures on stress functions are discussed.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, ultrafast {{computed}} tomography, a {{new high}} spatial and temporal resolution imaging system, was employed to define the range of sectional (tomographic) and segmental left ventricular function in 11 normal anesthetized dogs and 11 normal human volunteers. After intravenous infusion of contrast agent, multilevel tomographic images of the left ventricle (apex to base) were acquired {{at a rate of}} 17 frames/s. Analysis of these studies demonstrated substantial but predictable heterogeneity in left ventricular contraction from apex to base. In dogs and humans, for example, the average tomographic ejection fraction of the most basal level of the left ventricle was 40 % less than that of the most apical level (p < 0. 05). In humans, circumferential segmental <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> at the mid-papillary muscle level was relatively homogeneous (range 50 to 92 % for 12 wedge-shaped segments around the tomographic circumference) if the reference system employed an endocardial centroid, but was less uniform if it used an epicardial centroid (range 22 to 98 %). It is concluded that contraction of the normal left ventricle in dogs and humans is heterogeneous both between levels (apex to base) and within a single level (circumferential <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction).</b> However, the patterns of <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> from apex to base and circumferential segmentai <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> within a given level as defined by ultrafast computed tomography are sufficiently narrow and predictable in normal individuals that these variables may be useful to define regional contraction abnormalities in pathologic conditions...|$|R

First, the mechanism of particle focusing in both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids was introduced. Then particle focusing was demonstrated experimentally in this channel with Newtonian and non- Newtonian fluids using three different sized particles (3. 2 lm, 4. 8 lm, and 13 lm), respectively. Also, the effects of dean flow (or secondary flow) induced by expansion- <b>contraction</b> <b>cavity</b> arrays were highlighted by comparing the particle distributions in a single straight rectangular channel with that in the ECCA channel. Finally, the influences of flow rates and distances from the inlet on focusing performance in the ECCA channel were studied. The results show that in the ECCA channel particles {{are focused on the}} cavity side in Newtonian fluid due to the synthesis effects of inertial and dean-drag force, whereas the particles are focused on the opposite cavity side in non-Newtonian fluid due to the addition of viscoelastic force. Compared with the focusing performance in Newtonian fluid, the particles are more easily and better focused in non-Newtonian fluid. Besides, the Dean flow in visco-elastic fluid in the ECCA channel improves the particle focusing performance compared with that {{in a straight}} channel. A further advantage is threedimensional (3 D) particle focusing that in non-Newtonian fluid is realized according to the lateral side view of the channel while only two-dimensional (2 D) particle focusing can be achieved in Newtonian fluid. Conclusively, this novel Dean-flowcoupled elasto-inertial microfluidic device could offer a continuous, sheathless, and high throughput (3 ̆e 10 000 s- 1) 3 D focusing performance, which may be valuable in various applications from high speed flow cytometry to cell counting, sorting, and analysis...|$|E

The interaction between newly constructed tunnels and existing piled foundations is an important issue.

The method uses a spherical cavity expansion analysis to evaluate the end-bearing capacity of the pile, and cylindrical <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> to estimate the decrease in the confining pressure and resulting reduction in pile capacity caused by tunnel volume loss.

Projects in which tunnels are constructed sequentially and within close proximity {{are referred to}} as ‘twin tunnelling’. Case studies and recent research indicate that the prediction of settlements for such schemes cannot be determined using existing simple methods derived from consideration of a single tunnel. To establish the reasons for the observed variation in settlements, a series of centrifuge tests was undertaken on various twin-tunnel arrangements in overconsolidated clay. The tests consisted of preformed cavities from which a specific quantity of supporting fluid could be drained, with precision, creating a predetermined magnitude of tunnelling volume loss. Data were obtained for surface and subsurface displacements, changes in pore-water pressure near the tunnels and the support pressure within the tunnels. The systematic use of <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> models was found to be an informative method of explaining the observations. Use of an elastic–perfectly plastic <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> model coupled with observations from the experiments enabled the shear stiffness of the clay around the tunnel to be described.

The process of polystyrene pattern evaporation in foundry mould under the effect of molten metal is of a very complex nature and depends on many different factors, still not fully investigated. The technology of evaporative patterns was used in manufacture of pilot castings of the high abrasion resistance plates. The material and the properties of the resultant castings were determined by the customer (patent protection). At the beginning of the studies, the properties of the pattern material were determined, patterns were assembled, the properties of the ceramic layer were determined as well as the technique of its preparation and application.

METHODS Charisma, Filtek Supreme XTE and Grandio were selected as they were found to possess different moduli of elasticity but quite similar polymerization <b>contraction.</b> MOD <b>cavities</b> (n= 30) were prepared in extracted premolars, restored and then subjected to thermocyclic and mechanical loading. Marginal quality of the restorations before and after loading was analyzed on epoxy replicas under a scanning electron microscope. The percentage of gap-free margins and occurrence of paramarginal fractures were registered. Modulus of elasticity and polymerization contraction were analyzed with parametric and margins with nonparametric ANOVA and post hoc Tukey HSD or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, respectively. The number of paramarginal fractures was analyzed with exact Fisher tests (α= 0. 05). RESULTS Grandio demonstrated significantly more gap-free enamel margins than Charisma and Filtek Supreme XTE, before and after loading (p 0. 05). No significant effect of resin composite (p= 0. 81) {{on the quality of}} dentine margins was observed, before or after loading. Deterioration of all margins was evident after loading (p< 0. 0001). More paramarginal enamel fractures were observed after loading in teeth restored with Grandio when compared to Charisma (p= 0. 008). CONCLUSIONS The resin composite with the highest modulus of elasticity resulted in the highest number of gap-free enamel margins but with an increased incidence of paramarginal enamel fractures. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The results from this study suggest that the marginal quality of restorations can be improved by the selection of a resin composite with modulus of elasticity close to that of dentine, although an increase in paramarginal enamel fractures can result as a consequence...|$|R

A typical form of designed ceramic micro parts involves the structuring of several micro columns and/or thin walls on a substrate. This work considers {{the use of}} a model mould with a straight mould cavity and a step-contracted cross-section in the filling direction. The injection moulding of such of ceramic micro part is experimentally simulated. The effect of the mould <b>cavity</b> <b>contraction</b> ratio, moulding conditions, and the solid loading of the ceramic/binder mixture on the distribution of the transverse shrinkage of the moulding parts at moulded, debinded, and sintered stages, respectively, are examined. Experimental results reveal that transverse shrinkage of the region downstream from the step-contracted cross-section clearly exceeds that of the region upstream in all three stages. Furthermore, transverse shrinkage varies greatly in the plane of the step-contracted cross-section. The magnitude of the variation in transverse shrinkage in the step-contracted cross-section increases with the contraction ratio of the mould cavity. Appropriately increasing either the holding pressure or the filling pressure of the mould cavity reduces the variation in the transverse shrinkage of the step-contracted cross-section. Moreover, using the ceramic/binder mixture with a composition similar to that of critical solid loading can lower the internal stress caused by sintering {{in the vicinity of the}} step-contracted cross-section...|$|R

Since the Paleozoic, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity. [...] The stop-start motion provided by the jets, however, continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators.

40|$|Introduction Dimensional {{stability}} of polymer-based dental materials is compromised by polymerization {{reaction of the}} monomer. The conversion into a polymer {{is accompanied by a}} closer packing of molecules, which leads to volume reduction called curing contraction or polymerization shrinkage. Curing contraction may break the adhesion between the adhesive system and hard tooth tissues forming micrographs which may result in marginal deterioration, recurrent caries and pulp injury. Polymerization shrinkage of resin-based restorative dental materials Polymerization of the organic phase (monomer molecules) of resin-based dental materials causes shrinkage. The space occupied by filler particles is not associated with polymerization shrinkage. However, high filler loading within certain limits, can contribute to a lesser curing contraction. Polymerization shrinkage stress and stress reduction possibilities Polymerization shrinkage stress of polymer-based dental resins can be controlled in various ways. The adhesive bond in tooth-restoration interface guides the <b>contraction</b> forces to <b>cavity</b> walls. If leakage occurs, complications like secondary caries and pulpal irritation may jeopardize the longevity of a restoration. Stress relieve can be obtained by modifications of the monomer and photoinitiator, or by specially designed tooth preparation and application of bases and liners of low modulus of elasticity. The polymerization contraction can be compensated by water absorption due to oral cavity surrounding. The newest approach to stress relief is based on modulation of polymerization initiation. Conclusion This work deals with polymerization contraction and how to achieve leak-proof restoration. Restorative techniques that may reduce the negative effect of polymerization shrinkage stress need further research in order to confirm up-to-date findings...|$|R
40|$|At the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CBBAF), a 4 GeV {{multipass}} CW {{electron beam}} {{is to be}} accelerated by 338 SRF, 5 -cell niobium cavities operating at a resonant frequency of 1497 MHz. Eight cavities arranged as four pairs comprise a cryomodule, a cryogenically isolated linac subdivision. The frequency is controlled by a mechanical tuner attached to the fist and fifth cell of the cavity which elastically deforms the cavity and thereby alters its resonant frequency. The tuner is driven by a stepper motor mounted external to the cryomodule that transfers torque through two rotary feedthroughs. A linear variable differential transducer (LVDT) mounted on the tuner monitors the displacement, and two limit switches interlock the movement beyond a 400 kHz bandwidth. Since the cavity has a loaded Q of 6. 6. 106, the control system must maintain {{the frequency of the}} cavity to within * 50 Hz of the drive frequency for efficient coupling. This requirement is somewhat difficult to achieve since the difference in thermal <b>contractions</b> of the <b>cavity</b> and the tuner creates a frequency hysteresis of approximately 10 kHz.

Absolute stabilization of the laser's frequency (or wavelength) as fine as 2.5 parts in 1011 can be obtained through use of an iodine absorption cell.The mechanism producing population inversion and light amplification in a HeNe laser plasma originates with inelastic collision of energetic electrons with ground state helium atoms in the gas mixture.

Because of a fortuitous near coincidence between the energy levels of the two He metastable states, and the 5s2 and 4s2 (Paschen notation [...] ) levels of neon, collisions between these helium metastable atoms and ground state neon atoms results in a selective and efficient transfer of excitation energy from the helium to neon.
