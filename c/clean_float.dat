The model predicts that {{the change in the}} exchange rate is inversely related to the lagged interest rate differential. Openness and aversion to inflation variability determine the strength of this linkage. Foreign inflation and the foreign interest rate also affect exchange rate changes. This hypothesis is tested on data from three small open economies, Canada, Norway, and Switzerland, all of which target CPI inflation and maintain extensive trade and finance links with a larger neighboring country.

The results suggest that monetary union yields the smallest welfare loss and a float the greatest, and that the EMS gives France and Italy the opportunity to appreciate their currencies and reduce their welfare loss at the expense of Germany. The robustness of the results with respect to rational expectations and wage-price dynamics is verified with the aid of differential game theory and numerical simulation.

Based on theoretical models, three factors are identified as important for the demand of international reserves and foreign reserves: average propensity to import, volume of imports and variability of reserves. The paper employs the cointegration methodology and error correction method to investigate the relationships. Cointegration tests results indicate a reliable long-run stationary relationship between the international reserves (and foreign exchange reserves) and the stated explanatory variables across countries and sub-periods of fixed and <b>clean</b> <b>float.</b> The error correction results indicate causality from the explanatory variables to the reserves during both the short and long run.

40|$|The <b>clean</b> <b>float</b> of the New Zealand {{exchange}} rate exposes financial institutions to potentially undesired volatility of the nominal {{exchange rate}}. In the New Zealand exchange-rate adjustment process of 1998 - 2000 the data seem {{consistent with the}} idea that, intentionally or unintentionally, the behaviour of the overseas-owned trading banks amounted to management of the exchange rate (support for the Kiwi) during the adjustment period from 1998 to 2000. Whether this represented the exercise of market power in a coordinated fashion, or was simply a natural decentralised response to market incentives facing the banks, is not clear. The paper suggests that in the absence of large volumes of short-term credit advanced by overseas parents to their New Zealand bank affiliates, the nominal exchange rate would have been under far greater downward pressure during 1998 - 99, and the economy might have faced a classic financial and exchange-rate crisis {{in the wake of the}} Asian meltdown. ...|$|E

Special cases of monetary accommodation are a peg, a <b>clean</b> <b>float</b> and a PPP exchange rate rule. First, the optimal degree of monetary accommodation of price shocks is analysed when there is no exchange rate band. Given that the welfare loss is a weighted sum of the asymptotic variances of output and of consumer prices, monetary accommodation is particularly strong when the authorities care relatively more about full employment than price stability. More flexible labour markets induce right-wing governments to move towards a cleaner float and left-wing governments towards a PPP exchange rate rule. Second, the effects of exchange rate bands and the accompanying inframarginal interventions are examined when allowance is made for intramarginal interventions as well. Such a framework can, in contrast to the pioneering Krugman analysis, explain the observed hump-shaped unconditional density functions of EMS exchange rates.

40|$|Recently, {{and partly}} as a result of the {{currency}} crises in emerging markets, a broad debate on reforming the international financial system has begun. Talk of a “new financial architecture ” abounds, and academics, financiers, and politicians have offered blueprints for reforming existing institutions. Some have talked of creating a global lender of last resort, while others have argued that it is high time to abolish the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that political considerations will stand in the way of true change, and it is highly likely that in the next few years we will see, at most, a modest reform of the IMF and of the other major multilateral institutions. However, we are also likely to see some important changes in exchange rate arrangements, as well as in country-specific rules governing capital mobility. Policy discussions have begun to concentrate on the following issues: (a) the conjecture that optimal exchange rate regimes are characterized by either a <b>clean</b> <b>float</b> or an institutionally rigid system, à la dollarization (Calvo 1999; Edwards 1999 a); and (b) the role of capital controls as a way of reducing an emerging country’s vulnerability to speculation and currency crises. Most proponents of controlling capital mobility have argued that a system aimed at limiting short-term—or speculative—capital movements would be beneficial to emerging countries. Almost invariably, the supporters of this policy refer to Chile’s experience with controls on capital inflows as an illustration of the merits of this system. Josep...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Asian financial crisis, the issue of the choice of exchange rate regime for East Asian (EA) countries re-emerged. The crisis had demonstrated, amongst other things, that unilateral exchange rate regimes (including de facto dollar pegging) hadn’t coped very well in the 1990 s faced with massive capital inflows into the region (Kwan et al., 1998), with the possible exceptions of Singapore and Taiwan. The immediate response to the crisis was that a ‘corner’ solution might be better. Either keep convertibility and fix the currency, preferably backed up with a currency board, but abandon monetary independence; or keep monetary policy and convertibility but abandon currency management and adopt a free float. But a hard peg is perceived to be too rigid for most countries in EA and the potential costs of a <b>clean</b> <b>float</b> are seen to be too great for emerging economies with weak financial infrastructure because of the risks of serious currency misalignment and destabilising speculation. The objective {{of this paper is to}} address some of these counterfactuals by looking at the impact of alternative exchange rate regimes on the volatility of the NEER and the bilateral rate against the US$ for nine EA countries after the Asian financial crisis. 9 Our counterfactuals include a UBP, a CBP, and a hard peg against the US$, but in contrast to previous counterfactual exercises, such as Williamson (1998 a) and Ohno (1999) which compute the weights for effective exchange rates on the basis of simple bloc aggregates, we apply a more disaggregated methodology using a larger number of trade partners. We also utilize ARCH/GARCH techniques to obtain estimates of heteroskedastic variances to better capture the time-varying characteristics of volatility for the actual and simulated exchange rate regimes.

40|$|Literature {{focusing}} on real exchange rate (RER) misalignment and agricultural trade is inconclusive {{and far from}} convincing. Against this background, the study sought to {{examine the impact of}} RER misalignment on agricultural exports using a panel data set of 20 countries covering the period 1983 - 2006. The equilibrium RER is first estimated using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares technique and deviations from this equilibrium level are termed RER misalignment. The calculated misalignment measure is then inserted in the export model as a covariate. Pre-estimation checks suggested that export determinants follow a non-stationary process (a random walk with a drift) and are cointegrated. Using the Feasible Generalized Least Squares technique to control for heteroscedasticity and contemporaneous correlation across countries, the study indicates that RER misalignment has a detrimental effect on agricultural exports and the effect is non-linear. This result is robust to estimation by the instrumental variable technique to control for endogeneity and simultaneity of the exchange rate. Against this background, policymakers in these countries should work to eliminate currency misalignment through maintaining <b>clean</b> <b>floats</b> otherwise pegged rates should remain in tandem with the equilibrium level suggested by their long term fundamentals...|$|R

The two stages shared 18 weed species, accounting for 56. 25 % of the total weeds.

40|$|The 1997 – 1998 Asian crisis, {{with its}} offshoots in Eastern Europe and Latin America, has reignited {{the debate about}} {{appropriate}} exchange-rate policies for developing countries. One widely shared conclusion from this episode is that adjustable or crawling pegs are extremely fragile {{in a world of}} volatile capital movements. The pressure resulting from massive capital flow reversals and weakened domestic financial systems was too strong even for countries that followed sound macroeconomic policies and had large stocks of reserves. As a consequence, the polar regimes of a "hard pegs" (such as a currency board), or a <b>clean</b> <b>float,</b> are enjoying new popularity. This paper argues that, while currency boards or even dollarization may be justified in some extreme cases, they are not appropriate for all developing countries. The recommendations formulated {{on the basis of the}} Mundell-McKinnon criteria for the optimum currency are considered still sensible today. Currency boards face serious implementation problems. One is the choice of the currency to peg to and at what rate; another is the need to ensure stability of the domestic financial system in the absence of a domestic lender of last resort. Floating appears to have wider applicability. As Friedman already argued in the early 1950 s,if prices move slowly, it is both faster and less costly to move the nominal exchange rate in response to a shock that requires an adjustment in the real exchange rate. But for exchange-rate flexibility to be stabilizing, it has to be implemented by independent central banks whose commitment to low inflation is credible. Ongoing depreciations that follow from imprudent of opportunistic monetary behaviour will surely come to be expected by agents, and hence will have no real effect; occasional depreciations that respond exclusively to unforecastable shocks will, almost by definition, have real effects. But floating also faces questions of implementation. Given that no central bank completely abstains from intervention in currency markets, what principles should govern such intervention? The paper elaborates on a number of points in this regard on which recent experience is likely to be instructive, but on which more research is needed. Finally, any exchange-rate regime, and especially one of flexible rates, requires complementary policies to increase its chances of success. In this context, some have suggested the use of capital controls; less controversial is the need for prudential regulation of the financial system and for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper's field {{evidence}} is: (1) {{in reality}} a major exchange rate change devastates an economy, i. e. the widespread academic faith that exchange rate changes are either beneficial or harmless {{is a false}} faith that contributes to needless world-wide economic havoc; (2) the 1982 - 85 exchange rate liquidity crisis sent much {{of the third world}} into unmanageable debt levels and was so devastating for the first world that in 1985 the G 5 instituted managed cooperating floats; (3) nearly all economists in the official sector and in academe rapidly forgot the devastation and reverted to advocating what caused that devastation, namely a closed economy <b>clean</b> <b>floats</b> exchange rate perspective; and (4) the 2006 - 2008 / 9 exchange rate liquidity shock would have been far more drastic but for central bank currency swaps yet the role of these swaps in averting unmanageable exchange rate mayhem that would have precluded the September 2008 rescue of the world financial system, has been ignored. The field evidence thus decisively favours stabilizing managed floats, or better a single world currency, and a means of preventing economists in official sectors and in academe forgetting the devastation and dangers of multiple currencies. This field evidence is bolstered by a laboratory experiment. The experiment incorporates more aspects of real world complexity and more different sorts of official and private sector agents than other investigations and employs a new central bank cooperation-conflict model of exchange rate determination. The experiment allows an interpretation within an umbrella theory of Pope, namely SKAT, the Stages of Knowledge Ahead Theory. Our joint field plus laboratory evidence indicates that official sectors should maintain an international exchange rate oriented perspective as advocated in Davidson 2009 and in the September 2010 Report by UNCTAD, the UN Conference on Trade and Development. But our field evidence details needless fragility in cooperatively managed exchange rate systems. Our joint field plus laboratory evidence thus favours a single world currency, a possibility put on the agenda in March 2009 by Zhou Xiaochuan, head of the People's Bank of China, recommended in July 2009 by the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, and forwarded as an option in the April 2010 International Monetary Fund Report on Reserve Accumulation and International Monetary Stability.

SKAT contrasts with the current economists' paradigm of expected utility and game theory that lacks a), b) and c) and hence lacks a means for economists to understand that exchange rate uncertainty matters.

40|$|As an {{economic}} policy, {{the choice of}} an exchange rate regime has been oversold. That choice pales in comparison with establishing a legal system that carefully defines property rights and creates an institutional framework in which people can freely utilize and trade their resources. It also is far less important than avoiding the plunder of political and legal battles that waste scarce resources to fight over the division of wealth, or avoiding taxes and regulations that create static inefficiencies and choke the forces of creativity and progress. The issue of choosing an exchange rate system is merely a subissue in the broader question of overall monetary policy. And while monetary policy is clearly important, its role can be easily overstated, as Milton Friedman (1968) pointed out {{more than three decades}} ago. Given the history of monetary policy in the United States and around the world, including the political forces that inevitably shape the actions of governments, not to mention scientific uncertainty over many key economic questions (and regardless of the fact that many economists operating in the policy realm deny the existence of this uncertainty and arrogantly exaggerate the extent of their knowledge), probably the best way to approach the real-life policy of choosing an exchange rate regime is to take a broad perspective on how to do the least harm.
