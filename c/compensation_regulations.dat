5000|$|... 2. Disincentives for fleet {{replacement}} and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act {{holds the}} vessel owners fully liable, {{it has created}} a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs. The majority of charterers refuse {{to pay more for}} higher grade vessels despite the liability and <b>compensation</b> <b>regulations</b> enforced by OPA. The new and safer double hull tanker vessels are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring single hull vessels mandated by OPA. For example, Exxon and Texaco have delayed the replacement of their single hull vessels for new double hulled ships. However, companies like Chevron and Mobil have ordered two new double hull tankers. Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double hull tankers as well. Despite the change from single to double tanker vessels, it is still not sufficient enough to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels.|$|E
40|$|This thesis mainly {{examines}} three empirical studies. Firstly, it {{examines the}} relation between company ownership attribute and the executive compensation gap between market level and actual level. Secondly, it examines {{the relation between}} company ownership attribute and firms’ inefficient investment behaviors. Finally, it examines the relation between executive compensation gap, between market level and actual level, and firms’ inefficient investment behaviors. Based on Chinese listed companies with data from 2005 to 2012, the thesis finds that: 1) SOE attribute (whether central or local) increases the gap between executives’ actual compensation and market determined compensation levels. 2) SOE attribute has a significantly positive influence on a firm’s unexpected investment. With other conditions controlled, SOEs invest more than non-SOEs; furthermore, SOE attribute drives firms to make more investments. Meanwhile, although local SOEs invest more than other firms, central SOE attribute {{does not have a}} significant relationship to a firm’s level of unexpected investment. 3) A significant and positive relation between the extent of <b>compensation</b> <b>regulation</b> and the degree of a listed SOE’s overinvestment. These findings reveal that <b>compensation</b> <b>regulation</b> will cause severe agency problems in SOEs. The underpayment of executives in SOEs will not only cause overinvestments but also will devalue firm value of Chinese listed SOEs finally. This thesis contributes to existing literatures by providing a new way to study the correlation between executive compensation and firm investment behaviors. It also provides solid evidence that helps us to understand the consequences of distorted incentive mechanisms in Chinese listed SOEs experiencing government intervention, an issue that has been neglected in previous researches. The implications of this thesis’s findings are important to both corporate governance practitioners and policy makers as well...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- The lynx (L y u 1 yri. v) {{had been}} {{eradicated}} in the German Alps {{by the middle}} of the 19 th century. Since the early 1970 s thcre have been several attempts to initiate the re-introduction of lynx into the German Alps. but none of the projects could be carried out because of the still very con-troversial attitudes towards the species, and because of competition between institutions. Natural re-colonization of the German Alps by lynx can be expected sooner or later from Switzerland or Aus-tria. Although lynx are already present in some parts of Germany outside the Alps, neithcr an orga-nized monitoring system nor <b>compensation</b> <b>regulations</b> for losses of livestock exist. For a successful comeback of lynx into Germany, including the German Alps, more efforts than a year-round protec-tion by the federal hunting law i b needed.

In order to realize accruable benefits derived from successful FMD control, Botswana together with other neighbouring states such as Namibia and South Africa has managed to secure OIE-certified FMD-free zones protected by a vaccination zone surrounding high-risk areas. Systems of elaborate networks of veterinary fences (approximately 10, 000  km) and quarantine camps as well as disease-surveillance programmes coupled with compulsory and free vaccination campaigns have been put in place throughout the country for decades (Letshwenyo et al. 2004). This has largely facilitated access to regional and international beef markets like South Africa {{and as far as the}} EU and Norway. These achievements, supported by a strong legal framework, have been anchored on the Diseases of Animals Act (1977) and other subsidiary legislation such as Movement of Stock (restriction) Order as well as Quarantine and <b>Compensation</b> <b>regulations.</b> Other pertinent legislation includes the Control of Livestock Industry Act as well as the Livestock and Meat Industries Act.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to examine both the gendered and racialized nature of workplace risk and compensation in the manufacturing industry of apparel. The author selects this industry because of its low-wage, labor intensive, and 2 ̆ 2 deskilled 2 ̆ 2 work, performed in often unsafe employment environments with minimal governmental regulations and limited unionization. The apparel industry is also characterized by its large percentage of racial and ethnic minorities, especially immigrant employees, that further disadvantage {{them in terms of}} communication barriers, threat of deportation, and the multiple and intersecting marginalizations associated with occupying a low-wage, minority and/or immigrant status. The gendered effects of workplace risk are addressed in the garment industry, as women and girls largely comprise these workers. Using governmental data, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, the author measures the incidences, rates, and demographic characteristics associated with workplace injuries and illnesses for the years 1993 - 2002. In addition to occupational injuries and illnesses in these industries, the author examines Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division data to examine the incidences and types of compensation violations from the years 1993 - 2002.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in Caucasian populations worldwide and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known for being the number one carcinogen. As, especially in outdoor workers, UVR is an inevitable carcinogen, the prevention and management of UVR-related skin cancers in these at-risk populations represent a collective challenge for dermatologists and healthcare policymakers likewise. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current regulations on the acknowledgement and management of work-related skin cancer in 11 European countries. METHODS: Dermatologists from 11 countries networking within the EU Horizon 2020 COST Action TD 1206 'StanDerm' contributed to a standardized survey regarding current national regulations, implemented for the recognition, prevention and management as well as possible <b>compensation</b> <b>regulations</b> in their individual country of residence. RESULTS: Ten of 11 participating countries in this survey reported the existence of an established programme available on certain occupational diseases; work-related skin diseases were only specifically recognized in eight countries. Seven of 11 countries recognize cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in outdoor workers as 'occupational skin cancer'. Basal cell carcinoma (6 of 11), actinic keratosis (5 of 11), Bowen's disease (5 of 11) and malignant melanoma (5 of 11) are not as regularly approved as potentially 'work-induced'. Only a few of the countries included into this survey established a general documentation system (national registry) on occupational skin diseases. So far, representatives of only three countries of this survey referred to a specific established national programme for the prevention, management or compensation of occupational skin cancers acquired during work-related UVR exposure. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the need for mandatory regulations on the prevention, management and potential compensation of work-related UV-induced skin cancer across Europe. Against the background of a joint European domestic market, equal standards of occupational safety across Europe should include binding regulations for the protection and management of work-related skin cancer. The design of a common regulation to meet the increasing incidence of skin cancers in outdoor workers should become part of the European agenda, ensuring equal working and living conditions in the member states...|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} history of {{executive}} <b>compensation</b> <b>regulation</b> in America and surveys {{the literature on the}} effects of these policies. CEOs are almost exclusively in the top 1 % of the pay distribution, and regulation of their pay is seen as a well-targeted way of reducing income inequality. Mandatory disclosure of executive compensation has increased nearly uniformly since 1933. A number of other regulations, including special taxes on CEO pay and rules regarding votes on some pay packages have also been introduced, particularly in the last 20 years. However, there is little solid evidence that any of these policies have had any substantial impact on pay. I also review limited evidence from overseas on 'Say on Pay', recently proposed in the US, which would allow nonbinding shareholder votes on CEO compensation. The experiences of other countries have been positive, with tighter linkages between pay and performance and improved communication with investors. Mandatory say on pay would be beneficial in the United States, both increasing shareholder value and making CEO pay fairer, thus reducing the likelihood of passage of other legislation to reduce income inequality, such as higher taxes on the rich.
