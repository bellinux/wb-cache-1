25|$|Capacitors, {{including}} film types, {{designed for}} continuous operation at low-frequency (50 or 60nbsp&Hz) mains voltage, typically between line and neutral or line and ground for interference suppression, {{are required to}} meet standard safety ratings; e.g., X2 is designed to operate between line and neutral at 200-240nbsp&VAC, and Y2 between line and ground. These types are designed for reliability, and, in case of failure, to fail safely (open-, rather than short-circuit). A non-catastrophic failure mode in this application {{is due to the}} corona effect: the air enclosed in the winding element becomes ionized and consequently more conductive, allowing partial discharges on the metallized surface of the film, which causes local vaporization of the metallization. This occurs repeatedly, and can cause significant loss of capacitance (C-decay) over one or two years. International standard IEC60384-14 specifies a limit of 10% C-decay per 1,000 test hours (41 days of permanent connection). Some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect. One method, at the expense of increased size and cost, is for a capacitor operating at 200-240VAC to consist internally of two parts in series, each at a voltage of 100-120VAC, insufficient to cause ionisation.

40|$|The present paper aims to the {{investigation}} of the methods used to minimize or maximize the values of the Corona onset and Breakdown voltage in small rod-plate air gaps when stressed by dc or impulse voltages. The main factors which influence greatly the distribution of the electric field in the gap, and hence the above values are the geometry and the selection of grounding and charging of the electrodes, (ground effect), the gap length, the existence of barrier in the gap (barrier <b>effect),</b> and the <b>Corona</b> <b>effects</b> appearing prior to breakdown. Combining theoretical, simulation and experimental work, it is resulted that: a) The electrode chosen to be ground, strongly influences the distribution of the field and the <b>Corona</b> <b>effects</b> and hence the values of the Corona onset and breakdown voltage. When the rod is grounded and the plate is negatively charged the value of Corona onset voltage is higher, the <b>corona</b> <b>effects</b> are less intense and dc breakdown voltage, without Corona, is higher. When the plate is grounded and the rod is negatively charged the value of the Corona onset voltage is lower, the <b>corona</b> <b>effects</b> are more intense and hence the dc breakdown voltage is higher. b) A dielectric barrier, when placed in specific positions in the gap, decreases the <b>Corona</b> <b>effects</b> and raises the breakdown dc voltage. c) In air gaps stressed by impulse voltages the results are very different.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper methods of {{controlling}} Corona and breakdown in small rod-plate air gaps are investigated. Combining experimental and simulation-theoretical work, it is resulted that when the rod's diameter is bigger, the gap length larger and the rod is grounded the field is less inhomogeneous. Therefore {{the value of the}} dc breakdown voltage without Corona is higher. If Corona occurs then the values of the Corona onset voltage are higher, and the <b>corona</b> <b>effects</b> are not intense. The <b>Corona</b> <b>effects,</b> lead to a rise {{of the value of the}} dc breakdown voltage especially when the rod is negatively charged. Moreover an insulated thin barrier, when positioned near the rod increases the breakdown dc voltage to a maximum value, and minimizes the <b>Corona</b> <b>effects.</b> Especially for gaps stressed by impulse voltage the <b>Corona</b> <b>effects,</b> appearing with the form of electric current pulses, are influenced by the same factors with a different way. The values of the breakdown voltage in contrast to what happens with dc voltage are higher when the <b>Corona</b> <b>effects</b> are weaker, depending on the influence of the field's inhomogenity (geometry and effect of grounding). It is also resulted that a resistor connected in series with the gap decreases its maximum charging voltage and increases the value of the breakdown voltage. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|A {{section of}} the glass is heated until it is malleable; then it is bent into shape and aligned to a neon sign pattern paper {{containing}} the graphics or lettering that the final product will ultimately conform to. This is where the real art of neon comes in, that takes some artisans from a year up to several years of practice to master. A tube bender corks off the hollow tube before heating and holds a latex rubber blow hose at the other end, through which he gently presses {{a small amount of}} air to keep the tube diameter constant as it is bending. The trick of bending is to bend one small section or bend at a time, heating one part of the tubing so that it is soft, without heating some other part of the tube as well, which would make the bend uncontrollable. A bend, once the glass is heated, must be brought to the pattern and fitted rapidly before the glass hardens again because it is difficult to reheat once completely cooled without risking breakage. It is frequently necessary to skip one or more bends and come back to it later, by measuring carefully {{along the length of the}} tube. One tube letter may contain 7-10 small bends, and mistakes are not easily corrected without going back and starting all over again. If more tubing is required, another piece is welded onto it, or the parts can be all welded onto each other at the final step. The finished tube must be absolutely vacuum tight to operate, and it must be vacuum clean inside. Once the tube is filled with mercury, if any mistake is made after that, the entire tube has to, or should be, started over anew, because breathing heated mercury impregnated glass and phosphor causes long term heavy metal poisoning in neon workers. Sticks of tubing are joined until the tube reaches an impractical size, and several tubes are joined in series with the high voltage neon transformer.

40|$|Abstract: The Corona Current in {{air gaps}} {{influences}} {{the values of}} the breakdown voltage of the air gaps greatly. This happens because the corona current changes the field distribution in the gap making it less inhomogeneous. Thus the value of the breakdown voltage increases and becomes bigger as the value of the corona current increases. A major result of this phenomenon is the appearance of the Polarity Effect. The Polarity Effect is a phenomenon occurring due to the alteration of the polarity of the applied voltage to the gaps. When the applied voltage is negative the value of the breakdown voltage is bigger and this happens because the corona current is considerably higher. A second important result of the <b>Corona</b> Current <b>Effect</b> is the inversion of the Ground Effect. The Ground Effect is the phenomenon that occurs due to the different way the gap is grounded and influences the distribution of the field in the gap, the corona onset voltage, as well as the breakdown voltage in small gaps. In longer air gaps, the <b>Corona</b> <b>Effects</b> become very intense and the influence of the Ground Effect to the breakdown voltage is overlapped. The principle of action-reaction is valid. “The corona current reacts against the action of the field to produce corona charges and makes the field less inhomogeneous...|$|R

40|$|Corona {{discharges}} in electro-negative gases {{can generate}} space charge which re-distributes the electric {{field in the}} inter-electrode gap. In the case of negative energisation of the sharp high-voltage (HV) electrode in atmospheric air, negative space charge reduces the ideal Laplacian electric field {{in the vicinity of}} the cathode, which may result in an increase in the breakdown voltage (<b>corona</b> stabilisation <b>effect).</b> Such stabilisation can be used in repetitive plasma closing switches to maintain the same voltage level between HV impulses generated by pulsed power systems. Positive energisation of the HV electrode in air demonstrates lower breakdown voltage due to less pronounced space charge effects, resulting in a reduced field-grading effect. The present paper reports on an investigation into breakdown characteristics in point-plane electrode topologies stressed with positive and negative DC voltages, and HV impulses produced by a Marx generator with maximal voltage of 100 kV and rise time of ~ 800 ns. It has been shown that the <b>corona</b> stabilisation <b>effect</b> strongly depends upon the polarity of HV energisation and electrode topology: radius of curvature of the point electrode and inter-electrode distance. In the present paper stainless steel electrodes with three different curvatures have been used: 0. 115 mm, 1. 0 mm and 2. 5 mm. The gap width has been varied from 2 to 20 mm. At shorter distances the stressed air gap demonstrated the same values of positive and negative breakdown voltages. However, the critical gap could be identified at which the negative breakdown voltage becomes higher than the positive one, and with an increase in the inter-electrode distance this difference in the breakdown voltages continues to grow. This identification of the critical gap width and corresponding critical breakdown voltage allows the development of switch topologies with well pronounced <b>corona</b> stabilisation <b>effect.</b> In the case of impulse stresses, the critical breakdown time has been obtained as a maximum pre-breakdown time, which is identical for impulses of both polarities. With further increase in the gas spacing, the pre-breakdown time for negative impulses increases significantly as compared with the time to breakdown for positive impulses (~ 3 fold increase has been observed for the point electrode with the radius of 2. 5 mm, from ~ 500 ns to ~ 1500 ns). This systematic study provides valuable information on <b>corona</b> stabilisation <b>effect</b> as a function of the electrode curvature, inter-electrode distance and HV polarity.

Equally important is a linking of midsized off-shore windfarms, on which a thyristor-based HVDC conversion and transmission would be inadequate, con-cerning money and space consumption. For the latter, IGBT-based valve technology is looking more promis-ing. In relation to FACTS, the same could be used for STATCOM functionality, emitting both leading and lagging reactive power. The use of that technology however, is posing non neg-ligible problems with transformer insulation at the HVDC converter.
