These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and <b>chamfers.</b> Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. The walls were covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E
25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting endmill, while the body has a thread-shaped form with a countersink cutter form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, <b>chamfers,</b> and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|E

It is moulded {{of three}} <b>chamfers</b> leading to respondshalf-piers {{against a wall}} {{supporting}} an archof three part round columns with continuous annulet between, and with polygonal capitals and base reflecting those of the arcade piers. At the spring of the arch are open cusped devices similar to those on the tower arch. The chancel roof is 19th century and of barrel vault construction. In the north wall of the chancel is a rectangular aumbry. In the south wall is an arched door, of planking over cross bracing and heavy surrounds, recessed within a plain right angle opening with pointed and chamfered double-arch head. From the 19th-century restoration are chancel altar rails, choir stalls, a brass eagle lectern, and a wood pulpit. The pulpit is octagonal with one side open and receiving steps. The upper level is moulded top and bottom, with each side paneled with inset tracery and quatrefoils, and is supported by scrolled brackets set on an inset base.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{are carried out}} on Hartmann whistles to explore the effect of external <b>chamfer</b> at the cavity mouth.

The modifications in spectral and directional characteristics of external <b>chamfered</b> Hartmann whistles {{are studied in detail}} and are compared with a regular cavity. The frequencies are observed to attain a minimum value at a <b>chamfer</b> angle of 30 ° along with modification in the acoustic spectra. In general, it is noticed that the external <b>chamfered</b> whistles are directive at an emission angle of around 45 ° where it is around 37 ° for a regular whistle. Numerical simulations portray the flow/shock oscillation features in external <b>chamfered</b> cavities. Simulations depict intense flow diversion at the mouth of <b>chamfered</b> cavities and elucidate the directivity shift as well as the enhancement of acoustic power observed experimentally.

60|$|One {{could say}} about this barn, what could hardly be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the purpose which had {{dictated}} its original erection was the same with that to which it was still applied. Unlike and superior to either of those two typical remnants of mediævalism, the old barn embodied practices which had suffered no mutilation {{at the hands of}} time. Here at least the spirit of the ancient builders was at one with the spirit of the modern beholder. Standing before this abraded pile, the eye regarded its present usage, the mind dwelt upon its past history, with a satisfied sense of functional continuity throughout--a feeling almost of gratitude, and quite of pride, at the permanence of the idea which had heaped it up. The fact that four centuries had neither proved it to be founded on a mistake, inspired any hatred of its purpose, nor given rise to any reaction that had battered it down, invested this simple grey effort of old minds with a repose, if not a grandeur, which a too curious reflection was apt to disturb in its ecclesiastical and military compeers. For once mediævalism and modernism had a common stand-point.

40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper removes burrs and produces a consistent <b>chamfer,</b> even with fixture, part, and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for gross positioning of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) removes burrs by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the fixture, part, and robot errors. In the second pass, <b>chamfer</b> depth variations are smoothed out using <b>chamfer</b> control, where <b>chamfer</b> depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time <b>chamfer</b> depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded <b>chamfer</b> depth. The <b>chamfer</b> depth estimator removes repeatable fixture, part, and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on edges with burrs show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and <b>chamfer</b> control was able to produce a consistent <b>chamfer</b> depth.
