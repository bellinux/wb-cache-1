5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the debtor must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
5|$|When {{the city}} {{government}} announced its budget in late June 2014 for the upcoming fiscal year beginning July 1, the ferry only received a $2 million further appropriation, enough to temporarily extend it again through October. The administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio stated {{that there was not}} enough ridership to justify the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Despite last-minute efforts by local transportation advocates, civic leaders, and elected officials, ferry service ended on October 31, 2014. They promised to continue efforts to have the service restored. This led to many negotiations between the mayor's office and the parties interested in reopening the ferry. The mayor's office eventually agreed to restart the Rockaway ferry when the NYC Ferry system opened.|$|E

This membrane builds on the lessons learned in designing the Nozzle System and uses a pocket of air to prevent cavitation but does not require nozzles or compressors.

25|$|Over {{its history}} ADFA has been criticised for its <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and for {{instances}} of cadet misbehaviour – bastardisation. In 1998, the Director of the Defence Equity Organisation, Bronwen Grey, led a review into {{the policies and}} practices to deal with sexual harassment and sexual offences at ADFA. This review - {{commonly referred to as}} the Grey Review - led to fundamental structural and cultural changes at ADFA. These included the abolition of a cadet rank hierarchy and the introduction of improved training in equity and diversity for cadets and staff. Notwithstanding these improvements, the national publicity associated with the review caused considerable damage to the Academy's reputation.|$|E

The availability of workmen’s fares was altered to cease after 7 a.m., but the time had to be amended shortly afterwards to 7.30 a.m. All transfer facilities were abolished after 20 May; the half-fare limit for children was altered from under 15 to under 12, and other half-fare concessions were abolished, except those for wounded soldiers. Shortly afterwards, workmen’s return fares were also withdrawn. In September, lost property charges were introduced of 2d. for articles claimed within the month, plus 1d. for each additional month thereafter.|$|E

25|$|No {{official}} statement {{has been made}} on the reasons behind the choice of F/A-18 fighters as Australia's primary combat commitment, but it is commonly assumed that the obvious alternative of sending a substantial land force instead was considered to involve an unacceptably high risk of casualties, particularly given the possibility of house-to-house fighting in Iraqi cities. Iraq is largely landlocked, and Australia no longer has a fixed-wing naval aviation component; thus, a larger naval commitment could not be considered particularly helpful. The choice of the F/A-18 deployment rather than of the F-111 tactical bomber {{may have been due}} to the higher <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> of the F-111, and its use being limited to more politically contentious ground attack missions rather than more uncontentious tasks like combat air patrols.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not exactly," [...] {{our friend}} assented to our intention. [...] "The {{successive}} groups have constantly sought more central, more desirable, more fashionable situations. They have built not {{better than they}} knew, for that could not be, but costlier, and they have finished in hard woods, with marble halls and marbleized hall-boys, and the first expense has been much greater; but actual disaster has not yet followed; perhaps it is too soon; we must not be impatient; but what has already happened is what happens with other beautiful things that the æsthetic invent. It has happened notoriously with all the most lovable and livable summer places which the artists and authors find out and settle themselves cheaply and tastefully in. The Philistines, a people wholly without invention, a cuckoo tribe incapable of self-nesting, stumble upon those joyous homes by chance, or by mistaken invitation. They submit meekly enough at first to be sub-neighbors ruled in all things by {{the genius of the}} place; but once in, they begin to lay their golden eggs in some humble cottage, and then they hatch out broods of palatial villas equipped with men and maid servants, horses, carriages, motors, yachts; and if the original settlers remain it is in a helpless inferiority, a broken spirit, and an overridden ideal. This tragical history is the same at Magnolia, and at York Harbor, and at Dublin, and at Bar Harbor; even at Newport itself; the co-operative housing of New York is making a like history. It is true that the Philistines do not come in and dispossess the autochthonic groups; these will not sell to them; but they have imagined doing on a sophisticated and expensive scale what the æsthetics have done simply and cheaply. They are buying the pleasanter sites, and are building co-operatively; though they have already eliminated the studio and the central principle, and they build for the sole occupancy of the owners. But the cost of their housing then is such that it puts them out of the range of our inquiry as their riches has already put them beyond the range of our sympathy. It still remains for any impecunious group to buy the cheaper lots, and build simpler houses on the old studio principle, with rents enough to pay the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> and leave the owners merely the interest and taxes, with the eventual payment of these also by the tenants. Some of the studio apartments are equipped with restaurants, and the dwellers need only do such light housekeeping as ladies may attempt without disgrace, or too much fatigue." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} multiple mobile robots navigating in a common workspace. Initially, {{based on the premise}} that the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the robots can be ignored, results regarding the probability of collision of two point robots in the workspace are derived. Obviously, these results depend on the geometry of the workspace, and hence they are derived for workspaces with various geometries. The results are then extended for two robots of finite dimensions. The question “Are k + 1 robots better than k? ” is then considered. Based on two modes <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> namely, the batch-scheduled mode and the list-scheduled mode, various theoretical results are derived. If the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the robots can be ignored, based on various computational results obtained, we conjecture that the answer to the question is in the affirmative in both modes <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> Finally, by using the model of computation which includes the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the robots, the problem is revisited. We have shown that for various geometries and revenue to cost ratios, there are optimal finite values for the number of robots that can operate within the workspace. Expressions for these optimal values have been derived...|$|R
