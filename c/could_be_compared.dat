5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung {{on opposite sides of the}} ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared.</b> The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular systematics <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular systematics work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation {{created a}} ranking {{system so that}} the nations {{involved}} in international competition <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> independently. Teams receive points based on the position they finish {{at the end of}} tournaments. The system takes into account results not only of the senior men's teams but also of junior teams. Weightings that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are {{based on the number of}} teams competing, the number of continents represented (or eligible to be represented), and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible. Only results within the previous four years are used, so points are added and removed over time. Since the system began, the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup.|$|E
30|$|The {{simplest}} {{way to create}} associations between regions from two consecutive frames <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>comparing</b> all the vertices from both frames graph. However, this option is also computationally expensive. To solve this problem, we propose {{the use of a}} region-tree {{in order to reduce the}} cost.|$|R
30|$|Various {{timetables}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{evaluated and}} <b>compared</b> {{by changing the}} model parameters.|$|R
50|$|Another {{explosive}} {{that is used}} as a {{calibration standard}} is TNT, which was afforded the arbitrary Figure of Insensitivity of 100. Other explosives <b>could</b> then <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> against this standard.|$|R
5|$|An {{individual}} {{domestic animal}} {{could also be}} regarded as a zduhać, such as a shepherd dog, ox, bellwether, horse, or billy goat. If an animal habitually made vocal sounds in sleep, it was assumed to be a zduhać. Such an animal was cherished, and was not for sale. The spirit of the animal zduhać would leave its body in sleep and fight against the enemy zduhaći, to protect its own flock or herd. Only the fertility of the livestock depended on the outcome of the battles fought by the animal zduhaći; they had no bearing on the crop yield. In the region of Užice, western Serbia, it was believed that storms and hail clouds were led by zduhaći who flew above them in the form of big birds. A black ox and a three-year-old rooster defended their village from them—especially the rooster, for which reason he was not killed for food, but kept as a home guardian. In folk spells for repelling hail clouds in Serbia, these clouds were called white cattle. This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> with the idea of the black ox as a defender from hail.|$|E
5|$|Max {{breaks through}} {{security}} at the train yard and boards the train. She locates Van Der Mescht, who initially refuses to help her. After Max threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when Max and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared.</b> I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill Max. Bear is defeated, and Max reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. Max fights {{her way to the}} upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and Max shares. She tries to recruit Max to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers. Max refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, Max tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues Max and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting {{on the roof of the}} Space Needle, Max laments that knowing the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister. A post-credits scene shows Max and Original Cindy dancing in their apartment.|$|E
25|$|To {{identify}} {{the occupants of}} the compound, the CIA worked with doctor Shakil Afridi to organize a fake vaccination program. Nurses gained entry to the residence to vaccinate the children and extract DNA, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to a sample from his sister, who died in Boston in 2010. It's not clear if the DNA was ever obtained.|$|E

25|$|After {{the human}} and {{chimpanzee}} genomes were sequenced and compared, it was usually impossible to tell whether differences {{were the result of}} the human or chimpanzee gene changing from the common ancestor. After the rhesus macaque genome was sequenced, three genes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared.</b> If two genes were the same, they were presumed to be the original gene.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{international}} competition {{led to the}} development of the INF World Rankings in 2008, in which the performances of national teams <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared.</b> Higher-ranked national teams often compete on an annual basis, either in one-off tests or as part of tours. The Australian and New Zealand national teams have traditionally dominated the international game, although England and Jamaica are becoming increasingly competitive against their Antipodean counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on which}} theory of utility is used, the {{interpretation}} of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility {{as if it were}} quantifiable, that is, as if different levels of utility <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.|$|E
2500|$|The {{downside}} to the phase comparison {{system is that}} it is not possible to know from a continuous wave signal, like Decca's, which part of the signal you <b>are</b> measuring. You <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>comparing</b> the first waveform from one station to the first from another, but the second waveform looks identical. This leads to a problem where the operator can generate an accurate measurement, but the actual fix might be at a wide variety of locations. Decca referred to these as [...] "lanes", and used a mechanical system to keep track of them.|$|R
5000|$|As an example, ICC <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to <b>compare</b> ongoing {{scientific}} {{activities on}} a European or world-wide scale.|$|R
50|$|Falun in Dalarna saw {{the warmest}} {{temperature}} {{of the year in}} the country with 35 C in early August. Its July was also the hottest in Sweden during daytime. July was so dry that <b>is</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to mediterranean climates. August compensated for that with heavy rainfall.|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{objections}} to the proposed change have been answered by its opponents. For example, Dr. Felicitas Arias, who, as Director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)'s Time, Frequency, and Gravimetry Department, is responsible for generating UTC, noted in a press release that the drift of about one minute every 60–90 years <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to the 16-minute annual variation between true solar time and mean solar time, the one hour offset by use of daylight time, and the several-hours offset in certain geographically extra-large time zones.|$|E
25|$|LORAN was {{a simple}} system that {{compared}} the arrival times of pulses to make a measurement. Ideally, perfectly formed rectangular blips would be displayed on the CRT, whose leading edge <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> with accuracy. In practice, the transmitters cannot turn on and off instantly, and due {{to a variety of}} factors the resulting blips are spread out in time. Adding to this {{is the fact that the}} shape of the resulting blip, the envelope, depends on the frequency of the system, meaning the lower-frequency systems like LORAN will generally have less accuracy than higher-frequency ones like Gee.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{infrared}} observations {{had been}} made by both space-based and ground-based observatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO, the Infrared Space Observatory) were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} <b>is</b> <b>comparing</b> three casting process {{simulation}} programs for porosity and microstructure prediction capabilities for die-casting. After confronting these results with experimentally measured data taken from real castings it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> said that simulation is pretty accurate for DAS microstructure prediction and hot-spot areas. Amount of measured porosity <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> with predicted values because specimens were not taken from the exact hot-spot areas...|$|R

50|$|These {{questions}} test both specific {{knowledge of}} aspects of culture, and basic {{facts about the}} meaning of various words and concepts. It <b>could</b> therefore <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> with the SAT, intelligence testing and other controversial measures of mental ability. McKinstry's aim was not to distinguish between shades of intelligence but to identify whether a computer program <b>could</b> <b>be</b> considered intelligent at all.|$|R
25|$|General Manager mode, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to the Extreme Warfare {{games and}} Final Fire Pro Wrestling's Management of the Ring mode, is {{included}} {{for the first}} time. In this mode, the player takes the role of General Manager for either the SmackDown! or Raw brand. Players begin by picking {{one of the two}} brands, followed by a choice of simulating or participating in a draft, where a player can pick a total of 20 Superstars. The player then allocates the championships before beginning the season. This mode goes into depth, with e-mail capabilities, the ability to book matches and statistics of how the fans reacted to the show, among other features. When WrestleMania rolls around, the General Manager of the Year is awarded, along with some unlockable features.|$|E
25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E
25|$|Le Verrier {{was unaware}} that his public {{confirmation}} of Adams' private computations {{had set in}} motion a British search for the purported planet. On 31 August, Le Verrier presented a third memoir, now giving the mass and orbit of the new body. Having been unsuccessful in his efforts to interest any French astronomer in the problem, Le Verrier finally sent his results by post to Johann Gottfried Galle at the Berlin Observatory. Galle received Le Verrier's letter on 23 September and immediately set to work observing in the region suggested by Le Verrier. Galle's student, Heinrich Louis d'Arrest, suggested that a recently drawn chart of the sky, in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location, <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a stationary star.|$|E
5000|$|... iv. Reaction Kinetics {{with the}} ML2 Model: Following H.B. Kagan's {{publication}} of the ML2 model, Professor Donna Blackmond at Scripps demonstrated how this model <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to also calculate the overall reaction rates. With these relative reaction rates, Blackmond showed how the ML2 model <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to formulate kinetic predictions which <b>could</b> then <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to experimental data. The overall rate equation, Equation 6, is shown below.|$|R

25|$|By 1940, Brooklyn {{had five}} 3 section {{articulated}} trainsets with PCC components, after WWII Chicago ordered four similar trainsets. Chicago ordered two from Pullman and two from St. Louis, with different equipment, so that competing manufacturers <b>could</b> <b>be</b> directly <b>compared.</b> Experience from the trainsets influenced the following car standards.|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} {{experiments}} with laser heating, temperature {{came from a}} calibration of laser power made with known melting points of various materials. When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|The reemergence of Cubism {{coincided with}} the {{appearance}} from about 1917–24 of a coherent body of theoretical writing by Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and, among the artists, by Gris, Léger and Gleizes. The occasional return to classicism—figurative work either exclusively or alongside Cubist work—experienced by many artists during this period (called Neoclassicism) {{has been linked to}} the tendency to evade the realities of the war and also to the cultural dominance of a classical or Latin image of France during and immediately following the war. Cubism after 1918 can be seen as part of a wide ideological shift towards conservatism in both French society and culture. Yet, Cubism itself remained evolutionary both within the oeuvre of individual artists, such as Gris and Metzinger, and across the work of artists as different from each other as Braque, Léger and Gleizes. Cubism as a publicly debated movement became relatively unified and open to definition. Its theoretical purity made it a gauge against which such diverse tendencies as Realism or Naturalism, Dada, Surrealism and abstraction <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} hatamoto and gokenin, {{especially}} amongst hatamoto of lower rank, was not rigid, {{and the title}} of hatamoto {{had more to do}} with rank rather than income rating. In the context of an army, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>compared</b> to the position of an officer. Throughout the Edo period, hatamoto held the distinction that if they possessed high enough rank, they had the right to personal audience with the shogun (these hatamoto were known as ome-mie ijō). All hatamoto can be divided into two categories, the kuramaitori, who took their incomes straight from Tokugawa granaries, and the jikatatori, who held land scattered throughout Japan. Another level of status distinction amongst the hatamoto was the class of kōtai-yoriai, men who were heads of hatamoto families and held provincial fiefs, and had alternate attendance (sankin-kōtai) duties like the daimyōs. However, as kōtai-yoriai were men of very high income in terms of the spectrum of hatamoto stipends, not all jikatatori hatamoto had the duty of alternate attendance. The dividing line between the upper hatamoto and the fudai daimyōs—the domain lords who were also vassals of the Tokugawa house—was 10,000 koku.|$|E

5000|$|This {{class was}} {{designed}} as the modified variant of the , the preceding destroyer escort class. The main anti-submarine weapon was changed from the M/50 375 mm ASW rocket launcher to the ASROC Anti-submarine missile. The octuple launcher for ASROC was stationed at the mid-deck, and the entire ship design was prescribed by this stationing. To exploit the range of ASROC, this class was equipped with the long-range low-frequency (5 kHz) bow sonar, OQS-3A (Japanese version of the AN/SQS-23), and in addition, the latter batch had SQS-35(J) Variable Depth Sonar system.
