The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide detailed information on the whole range of benefits now available and to collect views and attitudes towards benefits from a broad spectrum of the workforce in order to provide valuable information to those responsible for reviewing and implementing personnel policies in the future. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions a) Company Questionnaire Responsibility for deciding benefits policy, details of available benefits (pensions, sick pay, death in service, medical insurance, personal insurance, assistance with housing/removal expenses, holidays, discount facilities, loan schemes, share incentives and profit sharing, bonus, training, <b>cars</b> and <b>car</b> <b>allowances,</b> subsidised meals, fees to professional association, company social facilities and clubs, day nurseries, flexibility of working hours). Reasons for provision of benefits, expected change in number and/or value of benefits, additional benefits provided since 1970, staff status, choice of benefits, change resulting from EEC membership, cost of benefits. b) Individual Questionnaires There were two types of questionnaire: i. Management Attitudes ii. Employees' attitudes Questions asked for i. and ii. : Present entitlement to benefits, most important benefits (reasons), benefits not received which respondent would most like to have (in order of priority), opinion on company's reasons for providing benefits, whether choice between benefits and cash desirable, whether differential benefits according to staff status desirable. Questions asked for i. only: Personal opinion of/satisfaction with benefits (reasons), importance of benefits when seeking a new job, source of information on benefits (satisfaction with), suggested improvements for benefit schemes. Questions asked for ii. only: Expected improvements in benefit provisions, opinion of trade union involvement in negotiations for more benefits (priorities), expectation of effect of EEC membership on benefits. Differences between UK and EEC benefits mentioned to respondent (i. e. longer annual holidays, higher state pensions, more public holidays) who was then asked to list differences in order of importance (reasons).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} how a social citizenship {{for people with disabilities}} is shaped bythe normative structures in the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian law governing their right to transportin everyday life. The thesis deals with three types of transport provided by the public to private individuals: transport services, <b>car</b> <b>allowances,</b> and cash benefits for reimbursing transport costs forpeople with disabilities. For each provision, the focus of the study is directed by the followingquestions: – Is there a rights/duties relationship between the public and the individual? Who is eligible forprovision? How does public funding impact entitlement? Who is obliged to provide? What are thelegal guarantees for entitlement? Despite objectives within Nordic law and policy that people with disabilities should be compensated for their impairments, and allowed to lead independent and autonomous lives, the results from the thesis show that the various transport provisions do not fully realize this. The legal relations between the public and those with needs for transport in their everyday lives are characterized by control, scrutiny and questioning. In order to protect the public budgets from costs, the eligibility criteria in the law are so constructed as to ensure that only certain needs for transport, and only some impairments, can meet them. The national, regional and municipal governments, and the administrative courts, subject people with disabilities to intrusive inquiries regarding personal details and other circumstances in their lives, {{in order to be able}} to judge which needs for transport are to be considered legitimate and which are not. The thesis shows that the individual rights to, especially, Swedish and Norwegian transport provisions are poorly protected against political decisions to cut funding. Local and regional self-governance isan interest that always competes with individual legal rights and make them weaker, irrespective of whether these rights can be appealed in administrative courts. The conclusion in the thesis highlights how a social citizenship is shaped in the law governing the right to transport for people with disabilities, and that this social citizenship does not reinforce independence and individual autonomy for those who are dependent on the various provisions tomeet their needs for transport in their everyday lives...|$|R
