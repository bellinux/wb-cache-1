25|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} {{achievement of the}} IPP was the introduction to Irish society of a parliamentary constitutional tradition and all that went with it– a fully up and running local government administration with its diverse institutions, which had rooted itself more deeply than anyone <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> {{into the life of}} the country. The party had above all (in the era prior to 1914) contributed in its prime to the political maturity of the nation and to the transformation of its society.|$|E
25|$|In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the {{first of}} which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim {{situation}} of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy. Asimov, who {{described himself as a}} claustrophile, mentioned that a reader asked him how he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> such an existence with no sunlight, and related that it had not struck him until then that living perpetually indoors might be construed as unpleasant.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the Emerald City is changed in the film. In the book, the city is not {{actually}} all green, but everyone is forced to wear green tinted spectacles (ostensibly to protect their eyes from the glory and splendor of the luxurious city), thus making everything appear green. In the film, the city is actually all green. The architecture of the Emerald City in the movie uses a much more contemporary Art Deco style than Baum <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined.</b> In the book, a giant green wall studded in glittering emeralds surrounds the entire city, whereas in the movie {{there is only a}} gate opening.|$|E

25|$|With another World War looming, 1939 was the {{beginning}} of a difficult period, not just for Pinchon and other artists, but for the vast majority of the world's nations. Pinchon was deeply saddened by the human folly that would lead to such a turn of events. Neither he nor anyone else <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> the human loss and destruction that would be unleashed on Rouen. Yet despite the carnage that followed, hope and optimism had not entirely vanished. The 30th Salon des artistes rouennais went ahead as scheduled, with its opening on 19 May 1940; however, due to the gravity of the situation, it was closed two days later. The first bombardment of the city began on June 5, followed by a mass exodus. On June 8 at 10:00p.m. the first German tanks rolled in on la route de Neufchatel, very close to the Pinchon residence.|$|E
500|$|Pepper {{said that}} he regretted not having {{been invited to the}} Razzies and blamed the film's failure on [...] "a weak script and poor {{production}} values". Writer J. D. Shapiro received his Worst Screenplay award from Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson during a radio program; he commented that Travolta had called the script [...] "the Schindler's List of science fiction". Shapiro also made an appearance to pick up the Worst Picture of the Decade award at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards, giving a speech quoting negative reviews, and thanking both the studio for firing him and Corey Mandell for [...] "rewriting my script in a way I never, ever, ever — <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> or conceived of myself." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined.</b> Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E

500|$|Watts {{returned}} {{in the lead}} role in the sequel to The Ring, The Ring Two. The film received several negative reviews, but was a major success at the box office, with an over US$161million worldwide gross (equivalent to US$ million in [...] ) and Watts was once again praised for her performance. Her third film {{of the year was}} Marc Forster's psychological thriller Stay. Written by David Benioff, it also starred Ewan McGregor, Ryan Gosling and Bob Hoskins. Watts then starred in the 2005 remake of King Kong as Ann Darrow. Watts was the first choice for the role, portrayed by Fay Wray in the original film, with no other actors considered. In preparation for her role, Watts met with Wray, who was to make a cameo appearance and say the final line of dialogue, but she died during pre-production at the age of 96. King Kong proved to be Watts' most commercially successful film yet. Helmed by The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson, the film won high praise and grossed US$550million worldwide (equivalent to US$ million in [...] ). The Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised her performance: [...] "The third act becomes a star-crossed, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] parable far more operatic and tragic than anything the original filmmakers <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined,</b> exquisitely pantomimed by Watts with a poignancy and passion that rates Oscar consideration." ...|$|E
500|$|Dino Scatena from smh.co.au {{wrote that}} [...] "A {{quarter of a}} century ago, a {{sequence}} of symbiotic events altered the fabric of Australian popular culture and set in motion the transformation of a 19-year-old soap actor from Melbourne into an international pop icon." [...] He then stated [...] "Who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>imagined</b> this tiny, unsophisticated star of Neighbours, with the bad '80s perm and questionable vocal ability, would go on to become Australia's single most successful entertainer and a world-renowned style idol?" [...] Throughout her career, Minogue has been known for reinventing herself in fashion and musical content. Fabulous Magazine labelled her a [...] "Master of Reinvention." [...] In November 2006, Minogue posed for Vogue Australia, with Larissa Dubecki from The Age labelling her the [...] "Mother of Reinvention" [...] by saying [...] "This unveiling is as cleverly managed as every aspect of her career, and her illness, to date. Like sharks, celebrities cannot remain static; they must keep moving or die. Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities" [...] Fiona MacDonald from Madison said Kylie was [...] "an icon, one of the handful of singers recognised around the world by her first name alone. And yet despite becoming an international music superstar, style icon and honorary Brit, those two syllables still seem as Australian as the smell of eucalyptus or a barbeque on a hot day." ...|$|E
