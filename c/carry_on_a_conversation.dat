5|$|Savage {{followed}} {{his first book}} with Delilah of Harlem, The Mask of Venus, Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids. In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style was fast and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E
500|$|He {{noted that}} [...] "thinking" [...] is {{difficult}} to define and devised his famous Turing Test. If a machine could <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> (over a teleprinter) that was indistinguishable from {{a conversation with a}} human being, then it was reasonable to say that the machine was [...] "thinking". This simplified version of the problem allowed Turing to argue convincingly that a [...] "thinking machine" [...] was at least plausible and the paper answered all the most common objections to the proposition. The Turing Test was the first serious proposal in the philosophy of artificial intelligence.|$|E
500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man". Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, [...] "one had {{the impression of a}} perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch." [...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible. The feeling was you were on a tricycle chasing a racing car." [...] Edward Teller admitted that he [...] "never could keep up with him". Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E
60|$|It {{was useless}} <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> any longer {{with such a}} man. He neither {{interested}} himself about his house, his food, his landlord, or his family, and Thady again held his tongue.|$|R
60|$|Poyor {{was well}} content {{to stay there}} {{as long as the}} men <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation,</b> for he was thus enabled to get some {{valuable}} information concerning their proposed movements, and not a word escaped him.|$|R
60|$|Wrayson and Barnes {{waited in}} the former's flat. Barnes drank two brandy and sodas, and walked restlessly {{up and down the}} room. Wrayson was busy at the telephone, and <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> for some moments in French. Directly he had finished, Barnes turned upon him.|$|R
2500|$|A simple example {{concerns}} the model on which aether was originally built: sound. The speed of propagation for mechanical waves, {{the speed of}} sound, {{is defined by the}} mechanical properties of the medium. Sound travels 4.3 times faster in water than in air. [...] This explains why a person hearing an explosion underwater and quickly surfacing can hear it again as the slower travelling sound arrives through the air. [...] Similarly, a traveller on an airliner can still <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with another traveller because the sound of words is travelling along with the air inside the aircraft. This effect is basic to all Newtonian dynamics, which says that everything from sound to the trajectory of a thrown baseball should all remain the same in the aircraft flying (at least at a constant speed) as if still sitting on the ground. This is the basis of the Galilean transformation, and the concept of frame of reference.|$|E
60|$|It was {{difficult}} to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> across the table, and Frank {{turned his attention to}} the meal, which was the best he had sat down to since he reached the bush. By and by the storekeeper stood up.|$|E
6000|$|... "I noticed that," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "If it's all {{the same}} to you, will you take your fist out of my mouth? It makes it a little {{difficult}} to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation.</b> And I've several things I should like to say." ...|$|E
5000|$|SHRDLU was {{an early}} natural {{language}} understanding computer program, developed by Terry Winograd at MIT in 1968-1970. In it, the user <b>carries</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with the computer, moving objects, naming collections and querying the state of a simplified [...] "blocks world", essentially a virtual box filled with different blocks.|$|R
5000|$|One night, {{his wife}} hears him <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with [...] "Maggie," [...] {{and the next}} morning she states that [...] "Maggie" [...] has died. Apparently, hearing the {{aforementioned}} conversation helps the wife out of her mental illness and allows her to finally let go of her imaginary child.|$|R
60|$|If I {{had your}} last letter at hand I would answer it. But I have not and {{therefore}} write {{you a very}} hasty and random letter, simply {{to let you know}} that I believe you still remember me. Whilst writing I am <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with my Staff and others.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Bolling {{talked with}} his associate, Poe would {{continue}} to scribble away with his pencil, as if writing, and when his visitor jestingly remonstrated with him on his want of politeness, he replied {{that he had been}} all attention, and proved that he had by suitable comment, assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was trying 'to divide his mind,' to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> and write sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|After Carlos was gone, Walter {{tried to}} <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Josefina, {{but as the}} wench's English {{vocabulary}} was as limited as was the boy's knowledge of Spanish, the talk soon lagged. [...] "Cuba libre! 'Member de Maine!" [...] she {{said over and over}} again, and smiled that awful smile that almost caused Walter to burst into a fit of laughter. During the morning she made him some more tea and insisted upon his drinking it, greatly to the benefit of his health and strength, as he soon realized.|$|E
6000|$|They were {{to return}} {{with the next}} stage, and in the {{interval}} Gabriel was placed in an upper room, and securely guarded. Here, falling into his old apologetic manner, he asked permission to smoke a pipe, which was at once granted by his good-humoured guard, and then threw himself at full length upon the bed. The rising wind rattled the windows noisily, and entering tossed the smoke-wreaths that rose from his pipe in fitful waves about the room. The guard, who was much more embarrassed than his charge, was relieved of an ineffectual attempt to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> suitable to the occasion by Gabriel's simple directness-- ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} {{getting to the}} {{interesting}} part of it. You English people, when you are out walking and are <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with <b>a</b> friend, never come to a standstill at the points of interest. We foreigners, on the other hand, invariably stop. I surprised Oscar by suddenly pulling {{him up in the}} middle of the road.|$|R
60|$|I {{must confess}} {{that after this}} my nerve, which is {{generally}} pretty good, gave out {{to such an extent}} that I think I fainted for a few minutes. During that faint I seemed to be <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Mavovo, though whether it ever took place or I only imagined it I am not sure, since I always forgot to ask him.|$|R
60|$|I asked {{intelligently}} {{why this}} {{had not been}} done before. I forget the precise explanation he gave. A young soldier in uniform, who had been dining at an adjacent table and whom I had not recognised before as a writer I had met some years previously in London, suddenly joined in our <b>conversation,</b> with <b>a</b> slightly different explanation. I had been <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in slightly ungainly French, but now I relapsed into English.|$|R
6000|$|The {{black man}} had now removed the outer {{garments}} {{from the dead}} man, and Smith-Oldwick was hastily drawing them on over his own clothing. [...] "And now," [...] said Tarzan, [...] "we will sit down and eat. One accomplishes little on an empty stomach." [...] As they ate the ape-man attempted to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with the two natives through Otobu. He learned {{that they were in}} the palace which had belonged to the dead man lying upon the floor beside them. He had held an official position of some nature, and he and his family were of the ruling class but were not members of the court.|$|E
60|$|Seeing how aptly matters had chanced thus far, I {{began to}} think it the design of fate to let me into all Zenobia's secrets, and that {{therefore}} the couple would sit down beneath my tree, and <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> which would leave me nothing to inquire. No doubt, however, had it so happened, I should have deemed myself honorably bound to warn them of a listener's presence by flinging down a handful of unripe grapes, or by sending an unearthly groan out of my hiding-place, {{as if this were}} one of the trees of Dante's ghostly forest. But real life never arranges itself exactly like a romance. In the first place, they did not sit down at all. Secondly, even while they passed beneath the tree, Zenobia's utterance was so hasty and broken, and Westervelt's so cool and low, that I hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on either side. What I seem to remember, I yet suspect, may have been patched together by my fancy, in brooding over the matter afterwards.|$|E
50|$|French is {{the most}} popular foreign {{language}} studied in British schools. According to a 2006 European Commission report, 23% of UK residents are able to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in French. Other surveys put the figure at 15%.|$|E
60|$|Malone did {{not seem}} {{prepared}} to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> briskly <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> of this sort. He began to knock {{the heels of his}} boots together, and to yawn.|$|R
60|$|I called Bradley and Olson on {{deck and}} told them what had happened, but {{for the life of}} me I couldn't bring myself to repeat what Wilson had {{reported}} to me the previous night. In fact, as I had given the matter thought, it seemed incredible that the girl could have passed through my room, in which Bradley and I slept, and then <b>carried</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in the crew's room, in which Von Schoenvorts was kept, without having been seen by more than a single man.|$|R
6000|$|Her mamma and she {{had been}} just having a dispute about the gooseberry-cream when Cavalcadour arrived. His {{presence}} silenced Mrs. Gashleigh; and Rosa, in <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with him in the French language--which she had acquired perfectly in an elegant finishing establishment in Kensington Square--had a great advantage over her mother, who could only pursue the dialogue with very much difficulty, eying one or other interlocutor with an alarmed and suspicious look, and gasping out [...] "We" [...] whenever she thought a proper opportunity arose for the use of that affirmative.|$|R
50|$|Stage 1: Stage 1, {{also known}} as induction, is the period between the {{administration}} of induction agents and loss of consciousness. During this stage, the patient progresses from analgesia without amnesia to analgesia with amnesia. Patients can <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> at this time.|$|E
50|$|The {{intentional}} use of older, often obsolete cultural artifacts may {{be regarded}} as anachronistic. For example, it could be considered anachronistic for a modern-day person to wear a top hat, write with a quill, or <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in Latin. Such choices may reflect an eccentricity or an aesthetic preference.|$|E
5000|$|The first foreign {{language}} most commonly taught in schools in Britain is French, and the first {{foreign language}} most commonly taught in schools in France is English. Those are also the languages perceived as [...] "most useful to learn" [...] in both countries. French is a substantial minority language and immigrant language in the United Kingdom, with over 100,000 French-born people in the UK. According to a 2006 European Commission report, 23% of UK residents are able to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in French and 39% of French residents are able to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> in English. French is also an official language in both Jersey and Guernsey. Both use French to some degree, mostly in an administrative or ceremonial capacity. Jersey Legal French is the standardized variety used in Jersey. However, Norman (in its local forms, Guernésiais and Jèrriais) is the historical vernacular of the islands.|$|E
50|$|In a {{flashback}} to Rome, 1771, Angelus flees through the sewers {{from a group}} of priests, but is eventually cornered and then Daniel Holtz arrives. He appreciates the priest's assistance in capturing and chaining Angelus, then begins to torture the vampire for his murderous crimes against Holtz's family. Holtz continues his torture as he <b>carries</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Angelus about his family, Darla and their attempts to hide. Darla eventually arrives with more vampires who kill the priests, rescue Angelus and leave Holtz hurt, but alive, as they ride away hidden by <b>a</b> blanket <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cart.|$|R
2500|$|Caretaker's Residence, where # <b>carries</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> ELIZA-style <b>conversation</b> {{with the}} leader of the Island (during which it is {{possible}} to nearly replicate the [...] "Where am I?"/"In the Village" [...] dialog from the opening of most Prisoner episodes).|$|R
50|$|Hitchcock found {{a number}} of ways to convey {{sexuality}} without depicting graphic behaviors, such as the substitution of explicit sexual passion with the passionate consumption of food. In a particularly amusing scene in Psycho, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) <b>carries</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) while one of his hands strokes a dead animal and the other hand lingers on his crotch. Sexual feelings are often strongly associated with violent behavior. In The Lodger and Psycho, this association is the whole basis of the film. Biographers have noted how Hitchcock continued to challenge film censorship throughout his career, until he was allowed to show nudity in Frenzy.|$|R
50|$|Even if all phones {{used the}} same audio codec, packet {{retransmission}} and re-encoding are still required. When a user makes a call to a POTS phone, the audio is digitized into packets that are transmitted from the mobile device and are then decoded into 64 kbit/s PCM. This creates little extra noise, and if the mobile signal strength is sufficient, the user on the POTS line {{will be able to}} <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the test was to prove that in any place the railway can <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with the two stations, {{together}} and separately. In the middle section of the route the train was stopped. Train the device was connected by wire to the railway Telegraph line and ground. Connection was installed, which took less than 5 minutes, with repeated tests on other sites the connection time is reduced by half. When connected to line Telegraph used a special pole with a steel clip on the end, designed Golubitsky.|$|E
5000|$|In Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Vice Admiral James T. Kirk and Lieutenant Saavik <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> during rematerialization. In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Dr. Gillian Taylor {{jumps into}} Kirk's {{transporter}} beam during dematerialization, and rematerializes without any apparent ill effects. This is {{probably due to}} the [...] "annular confinement beam", a component of the transporter mentioned in the various television episodes which serves to keep patterns separate from one another. In the same film, Mr. Spock is beamed into a cloaked ship while walking.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. CIRCSIM-Tutor v. 3 is a natural-language based ITS for cardiac physiology. In this paper, we {{describe}} TIPS, a new text planning engine for CIRCSIM-Tutor {{based on current}} research in text generation. Since conversations cannot be completely planned in advance, TIPS plans and executes iteratively. It maintains a goal hierarchy for the tutor while <b>carrying</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>conversation</b> with the student. It can handle multi-turn plans {{on the part of}} the tutor, and it can back up and replan when the student gives an unexpected answer. In this paper we sketch the design of TIPS using an analysis of human-to-human tutoring transcripts to shape the requirements. ...|$|R
