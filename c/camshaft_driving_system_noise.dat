A huge harmonic circulating current will be induced especially in the condition of the difference of dead times existed in the two inverters, which not only affects the amplitude and phase of the outputting voltage, but also causes single harmonic. The harmonic circulating current has bad influences on the electrical system, consuming large amounts of energy, causing waveform distortion of the output voltage and inducing electromagnetic interference (Hyosung and Ji 2004).
