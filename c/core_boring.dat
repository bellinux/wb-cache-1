40|$|Central African rainforests are {{no longer}} {{considered}} as pristine, but as {{the outcome of a}} long history of changes due mainly to climatic variation. For the later part of the Holocene it has been hypothesised that climate changes together with human activities triggered modifications in terms of distribution and botanical composition. While developing a research project to explore the mechanisms of forest change, new research avenues for the archaeology of rainforests became apparent. In this paper, we outline the results of this approach, implemented on a forest concession (Cameroon). We introduce our methodology based on the analysis of botanical inventories (focused on large trees of human linked species and light demanding species), coupled to systematic <b>core</b> <b>boring</b> and test pits. A sampling strategy for the collection of charcoal and its identification is developed and archaeological remains found in association are analyzed at the Royal Museum for Central Africa...|$|E

40|$|Certain radioisotopes can {{penetrate}} {{concrete and}} contaminate the concrete {{well below the}} surface. The challenge {{is to determine the}} extent and magnitude of the contamination problem in real-time. The concrete profiling technology, TRUPROSM in conjunction with portable radiometric instrumentation produces a profile of radiological or chemical contamination through the material being studied. The data quality, quantity, and representativeness may be used to produce an activity profile from the hot spot surface into the material being sampled. This activity profile may then be expanded to ultimately characterize the facility and expedite waste segregation and facility closure at a reduced cost and risk. Performing a volumetric concrete or metal characterization safer and faster (without lab intervention) is the objective of this characterization technology. This way of determining contamination can save considerable time and money. Currently, concrete core bores are shipped to certified laboratories where the concrete residue is run through a battery of tests to determine the contaminants. The existing <b>core</b> <b>boring</b> operation volatilizes or washes out some of the contaminants (like tritium) and oftentimes cross-contaminates the area around the core bore site. The volatilization of the contaminants can lead to airborne problems in the immediate vicinity of the core bore. Cross-contamination can increase the contamination area and thereby increase the amount of waste generated. The goal is to avoid those field activities that could cause this type of release...|$|E
40|$|The {{first eight}} {{chapters}} of this thesis describe {{a study of}} the magnetic effects of drilling on <b>bore</b> <b>cores</b> of sedimentary rocks. Extensive rock and palaeo- magnetic methods were used to investigate such effects in three collections of <b>bore</b> <b>cores</b> from the North Sea and Sellafield, U. K., and Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. It is evident that a drilling imposed remanent magnetisation (DIRM) resides in the North Sea and Prudhoe Bay <b>bore</b> <b>cores</b> which is characterised by symmetries in its intensity and direction relative to the core axis. Such DIRM correlated well with the theoretically modelled magnetic field at one end of a steel drill barrel. The DIRM intensity distribution also appeared to be correlated with variation in the radial remanence susceptibility (i. e. the capacity of remanence acquisition) in the North Sea and Prudhoe Bay cores and magnetic susceptibility in the North Sea cores. Simulation experiments of shock impact conducted on <b>bore</b> <b>core</b> materials suggests that shock/vibration of the drill barrel is the major process that is responsible for the radial variation in core magnetic properties. Titanomagnetite (including magnetite) and pyrrhotite are the major carriers of DIRM but there is no DIRM identified in <b>bore</b> <b>cores</b> in which hematite is the only ferromagnetic mineral. Chapter 9 describes a novel attempt in using fractal geometry to statistically depict the geomagnetic field reversal sequence. A fractal distribution is shown to occur for longer geomagnetic polarity intervals (> 0. 28 Ma) in terms of a power law relationship between interval length and cumulative number for the last 158 Ma. A simulation study indicates that the deviation from the power law at shorter intervals (< 0. 28 Ma) is caused by missing of short intervals due to the limit of resolving power. This is strongly supported by a fractal model (i. e. a Cantor set) introduced for relating the shortest polarity interval, the transition time and the fractal dimension. Normal and reversed polarity intervals have similar fractal dimensions, suggesting that there is no, statistically, fundamental difference between the two magnetic polarity states...|$|R
40|$|Frozen sediments {{from three}} <b>cores</b> <b>bored</b> in {{permafrost}} surrounding of the El'gygytgyn Impact Crater Lake {{have been studied}} for pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, plant macrofossils, and rhizopods. The palynological study of the cores contributes to a higher resolution of time intervals presented in a poor temporal resolution in the lacustrine sediments; namely the Allerød and succeeding periods. Moreover, permafrost records better reflect local environmental changes, thus, allowing more reliable reconstruction of the local paleoenvironments. The new data confirm that shrub tundra with dwarf birch, shrub alder and willow dominated in the lake surroundings during the Allerød warming. Younger Dryas pollen assemblages reflect abrupt changes to grass-sedge-herb dominated environments reflecting significant climate deterioration. Low shrub tundra with dwarf birch and willow dominate the lake vicinity {{at the onset of}} the Holocene. The founds of larch seeds indicate its local presence around 11 000 cal. yr BP and, thus a northward shift of treeline by about 100 km during the early Holocene thermal optimum.

40|$|The 1999 Chichi {{earthquake}} ruptured along previously unrecognized {{traces of}} the Chelungpu fault, because the traces were covered with thick-bedded Xuvial, alluvial, and colluvial deposits. The earthquake created a 95 -km-long surface rupture and associated fault-related fold scarps. This study focused on the fault-related fold at two locations, where the fold scarp is characterized with trench excavation and shallow <b>cored</b> <b>boring</b> results. The structural characteristics revealed by the two trench sites are consistent with a trishear fault-propagation fold growth above a blind thrust. Several characteristics of the fold observed in the Holocene deposits show smoothly rounded fold-hinges, unconformities, onlapped structure, and downward steepening of forelimb strata. Results from these structures sug-gest that the fold grows by progressive limb rotation of growth strata in sequential coseismic growth episodes. The growth strata show several unconformable contacts as indicated by paleosoil horizons developed on event horizons. Based on the syntectonic sedimentary structure, three events are revealed at the Siangong-Temple site and two paleoearthquake events on the Shijia site. Integration with the two trenches and the previous studies suggests the three paleoearthquake events occurred 300 – 430, 710 – 800, and 1710 – 1900 yr B. P.

In such a context, various of the landing instrumental packages proposed for future missions include drill systems able to perform the <b>core</b> <b>boring</b> and in situ analysis of ground. The search for traces {{of water in the}} subsoil, both in liquid and iced phases, represent {{one of the most important}} experimental tasks. Moreover the identification of different geofaces, can be useful to define the most suitable locations for drilling. This paper describes a Multi-sensor Soil Electromagnetic Sounding (MuSES) that using different concepts and techniques: i) performs the electromagnetic detection of suitable subsoil targets to guide the drilling operations; ii) provides measurements of the subsurface dielectric profile and detects the interfaces characterized by different electromagnetic parameters (i. e. conductivity, dielectric constant and permeability). MuSES consists of three subsystems: 1) Soil Dielectric Spectroscopy Probe (SDSP), capable to provide complex permittivity measurements of the shallow soil, down to some tens of centimeters. The probe is based on a quadrupole array of electrodes AC coupled with ground in the band 100 Hz – 1 MHz. 2) Time Domain Electro-Magnetic system (TDEM), which, through a bi-static configuration of loops, operating in diffusion regime of fields (low frequencies), probes the apparent resistivity profile of subsoil, down to several meters. 3) Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), which provides the vertical profile of the dielectric/magnetic discontinuities of the ground (down to a few meters) through high frequency electromagnetic fields in propagation regime (in the band 500 MHz – 1 GHz). The authors describe the rationale of the integrated package of instruments, the complementary features of the three subsystems and illustrate the enhancement of the scientific return achieved with the relevant data fusion...|$|E

40|$|The {{compressibility}} of a fibre mass affects {{processing and}} end-product performance. The compressibility of wool {{can be measured}} by compressing a sample of clean fibre in a cylinder with a standard weight. The specific volume of the sample after compression is termed its bulk, or core bulk if a short <b>core</b> <b>bored</b> sample is used. Prediction of core bulk from the standard simultaneous measures of fibre diameter and fibre curvature would reduce testing costs. This applies to all types of fibre assemblies, but the potential for highest industrial influence is with natural fibres (wool, hairs, etc.) as the key characteristic of bulk is controlled by relatively few genes, and the ability is available to increase the bulkiness of a fibre from animals by carefully selective breeding procedures. A first approach to the problem is to model the wool sample {{as a collection of}} flexible rings. The Euler strut equation is then used to describe the rings and compute their linear deformation in response to the applied load. The resulting formula reveals that the core bulk depends on the fibre diameter and the fibre curvature only through their product. This agrees with an expression for the core bulk derived from van Wyk's formula (van Wyk, 1946) in one limit. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

However, the use of isotopic dating analyses of heartwood tissues extracted by increment <b>bore</b> <b>coring</b> is becoming increasingly widespread.

40|$|Myocarditis is an {{inflammation}} of the myocardium, but only ~ 10 % of those affected show clinical manifestations of the disease. To study the immune events of myocardial injuries, various mouse models of myocarditis have been widely used. This study involved experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) induced with cardiac myosin heavy chain (Myhc) -α 334 - 352 in A/J mice; the affected animals develop lymphocytic myocarditis but with no apparent clinical signs. In this model, the utility of magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) as a non-invasive modality to determine the cardiac structural and functional changes in animals immunized with Myhc-α 334 - 352 is shown. EAM and healthy mice were imaged using a 9. 4 T (400 MHz) 89 mm vertical <b>core</b> <b>bore</b> scanner equipped with a 4 cm millipede radio-frequency imaging probe and 100 G/cm triple axis gradients.

The poet returned to the character of the priest-religion teacher, he tried to understand him and trace the nature of the spiritual link, which, at its <b>core,</b> <b>bore</b> a theological dispute. Priest Chomsky was a pedant and he looked everywhere for traces of the presence of Satan. Consequently he despised everything that was part of the so-called real world. Czesław Miłosz, however, admired the sensual beauty of the physical world. He also deeply felt the dualism of matter and spirit and entertained the possibility of overcoming this tension through all his creative works. With this conflict in the background, Miłosz frequently returned to the personality of his former religion teacher. The priest’s mythologized portrait, inspired by Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, found its place in the Native Realm. Miłosz also dedicated two poems to the prefect, namely “To Priest Ch. ”, published in the volume Three Winters in 1936, and “Priest Ch. after Years”, included in The Unencompassed Earth in 1984.

The main aim of our research was to broaden the present knowledge on geological structure of the PKB and on its tectonic connection to the surrounding regional units using the geophysical methods. The profile gravity measurements consist of two parallel profiles named prof_ 1 and prof_ 2 of roughly NNW-SSE direction. The eastern section prof_ 1 has a length of 6. 36 km; the western profile prof_ 2 is about 3. 84 km long. Measurements were carried out at intervals of 20 meters (overall 506 points were gauged) by gravimeters Scintrex CG 3 and CG 5. The acquire data were processed into the Bouguer gravity anomalies. The software package GM-SYS (Geosoft) was applied for the gravity modelling and the final geological-geophysical sections represent distribution of the lithological members with their specific density parameters (density values were determined by the own laboratory measurements of rock samples collected along the profiles). The density modelling was also {{based on the results}} obtained by the geoelectrical exploration (vertical electric sounding and resistivity profiling), new surface geological mapping and borehole interpretation (continuously <b>cored</b> <b>bores</b> MIK- 1 and MIK- 2).

The CT images obtained clearly revealed various types of the seismically induced SSDSs embedded in the cores: a propagating sand dyke bent complexly by the preexisting geological structure, deformed laminations of fluidized sandy layers, and two types of downward mass movement (ductile downward folding and brittle normal faulting) as compensation for upward sand transport through sand dykes. Two advanced image analysis techniques were applied to the sand dyke CT images for the first time. The GrowCut algorithm, a specific digital image segmentation technique that uses cellular automata, was used successfully to extract the three-dimensional complex sand dyke structures embedded in the sandy sediments, {{which would have been}} difficult to achieve using a conventional image processing technique.

Consequential conclusion judges material characteristics of the beam and roof girder. This thesis is focused on localizing the position and average of reinforcement in every single element. Next step is focused on quality of the concrete, particularly compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. The modern machines, like Hilti PS 1000 and Profometer PM- 630, are used to localize the position and diameter of reinforcement. The quality of concrete is determined by removed <b>bore</b> <b>core.</b> Evaluation of material characteristics of the structure is in the conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Paleo/rock {{magnetic}} measurement {{had been}} performed on a <b>bore</b> <b>core</b> from Hachobaru geothermal area in Oita Prefecture, northcentral Kyushu Island, west Japan (Fig. 1). The core samples submitted {{to this study}} are mainly volcanics of which geologic ages span from Quaternary to late Tertiary, roughly speaking. The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of the sample cores was measured and thermomagnetic (Js-T) analysis on these samples had also been carried out. So far as the present study concerned, no evident reversed NRM polarity was found. The data on dip angle of NRM obtained by this study are {{compared with those of}} the previous study (Domen 1979, Muneoka & Domen 1985 a, b) on northern Kyushu rocks...|$|R
40|$|The {{approximately}} 2 km thick Upper Zone of the Rustenburg Layered Suite {{represents a}} series of differentiated rocks {{with the appearance of}} magnetite, olivine and apatite in that order, as cumulus phases in the stratigraphy. Plagioclase is the dominant cumulus mineral throughout the sequence; hence its composition provides a continuous record of differentiation. 126 plagioclase mineral separates have been obtained and analyzed from <b>bore</b> <b>core</b> drilled through the Upper Zone. Anorthite content decreases from An 60 close {{to the base of the}} Upper Zone to An 30 at the top. Six reversals were identified in a previous study occurring over a vertical interval of 16 to 69 m and in which the An increases upward by 3 to 6...|$|R
