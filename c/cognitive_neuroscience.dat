5|$|If {{one is a}} materialist and {{believes}} that all aspects of our common-sense psychology will find reduction to a mature <b>cognitive</b> <b>neuroscience,</b> and that non-reductive materialism is mistaken, then one can adopt a final, more radical position: eliminative materialism.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in <b>cognitive</b> <b>neuroscience,</b> evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E

5|$|From 1982 until 2003, Pinker {{taught at}} the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, was the co-director of the Center for Cognitive Science (1985-1994), and {{eventually}} became {{the director of the}} Center for <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Neuroscience</b> (1994-1999), taking a one-year sabbatical at the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1995–96. As of 2003, he is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard; from 2008 to 2013 he also held the title of Harvard College Professor in recognition of his dedication to teaching. He currently gives lectures as a visiting professor at the New College of the Humanities, a private college in London.|$|E
5|$|His {{research}} in cognitive psychology {{has won the}} Early Career Award (1984) and Boyd McCandless Award (1986) from the American Psychological Association, the Troland Research Award (1993) from the National Academy of Sciences, the Henry Dale Prize (2004) from the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and the George Miller Prize (2010) from the <b>Cognitive</b> <b>Neuroscience</b> Society. He has also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Newcastle, Surrey, Tel Aviv, McGill, Simon Fraser University and the University of Tromsø. He was twice {{a finalist for the}} Pulitzer Prize, in 1998 and in 2003. On May 13, 2006, he received the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year award for his contributions to public understanding of human evolution.|$|E

The paper on the magical number seven continues to be cited by both the popular press to explain the liking for seven-digit phone numbers and to argue against nine-digit zip codes, and by academia, especially modern psychology, to highlight its break with the behaviorist paradigm.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the field}} of neurobiology, there are many subdisciplines that are {{concerned}} with the relations between mental and physical states and processes: Sensory neurophysiology investigates the relation between the processes of perception and stimulation. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>neuroscience</b> studies the correlations between mental processes and neural processes. Neuropsychology describes the dependence of mental faculties on specific anatomical regions of the brain. Lastly, evolutionary biology studies the origins and development of the human nervous system and, in as much as this is the basis of the mind, also describes the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of mental phenomena beginning from their most primitive stages. Evolutionary biology furthermore places tight constraints on any philosophical theory of the mind, as the gene-based mechanism of natural selection does not allow any giant leaps in the development of neural complexity or neural software but only incremental steps over long time periods.|$|E

In cognitive science, one such model—the diffusion decision model—is now regularly used to decompose task performance into underlying processes such as the quality of information processing, response caution, and a priori bias. In the <b>cognitive</b> <b>neurosciences,</b> the diffusion decision model has recently been adopted as a quantitative tool to study the neural basis of decision making under time pressure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the modern theory of the Bayesian brain from <b>cognitive</b> <b>neurosciences</b> {{in the light of}} recommender systems and expose potentials for our community. In particular, we elaborate on noisy user feedback and the thus resulting multicomponent user models, which have indeed a biological origin. In real user experiments we observe the impact of both factors directly in a repeated rating task along with recommendation. As a consequence, this contribution supports the plausibility of contemporary theories of mind in the context of recommender systems and can be understood as a solicitation to integrate ideas of <b>cognitive</b> <b>neurosciences</b> into our systems in order to further improve the prediction of human behaviour...|$|R

25|$|Cognitive {{musicology}} can be differentiated {{from the}} fields of music cognition and <b>cognitive</b> <b>neuroscience</b> of music by a difference in methodological emphasis.

40|$|Time {{perception}} {{remains an}} open question in <b>cognitive</b> <b>neurosciences.</b> Mechanisms for the encoding of time come in different flavors but the evidence remain sparse for the simplest questions, for instance, which areas in the brain constitute the most reliable sources for the encoding of time? Indeed, not one brain lesion in the cortex can account on its own for a total impairment in timing functions. The aim of this contribution is to highlight key concepts in the history of <b>cognitive</b> <b>neurosciences</b> that are relevant to the study of time perception. An alternative or a complementary approach to the classic clock model view is provided regarding ways in which the brain could automatically encode temporal properties...|$|R

25|$|EEG {{has very}} high {{temporal}} resolution, {{on the order}} of milliseconds rather than seconds. EEG is commonly recorded at sampling rates between 250 and 2000Hz in clinical and research settings, but modern EEG data collection systems are capable of recording at sampling rates above 20,000Hz if desired.
