40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} and investigation on {{a large number of}} striped and <b>checked</b> <b>patterns</b> in silk fabric of the Republic of China (1912 - 1949) and some relevant historical records, this paper mainly reviews the types of striped and <b>checked</b> <b>patterns</b> in silk fabric of the Republic of China. It also discusses the use of weave design in striped and <b>checked</b> <b>patterns,</b> and points out that striped and <b>checked</b> <b>patterns</b> turned {{to be one of the}} most popular patterns in silk fabric during this period, only ranking second to floral pattern. The influence of western design, changes in fashion and technological innovations are main reasons for this transition...|$|R

Mitchell noted that the <b>checked</b> <b>pattern</b> surrounding the central fountain matches the <b>checked</b> <b>pattern</b> {{on some of the}} outermost rings of the medallions.

30|$|If the {{cardinality}} of a <b>pattern</b> <b>code</b> differs by one, {{there is}} also another discrepancy of one in the cardinality of another <b>pattern</b> <b>code.</b> We assume that if two sets of P-LTP features are similar, the discrepancy of <b>pattern</b> <b>code</b> cardinality should not occur more than twice. Therefore, we fixed εp as 4. Also, we {{count the number of}} occurrences oi for each distinctive P-LTP feature. In case the initialization sequence contains a moving object, its P-LTP feature should not be included in the background model. Assume that the moving object P-LTP feature occurs less often than the background P-LTP feature. We fixed the filter threshold εo as 10 % of the length of the initialization sequence.|$|R

Wireless sensor {{networks are}} expected to consist of Thousands of inexpensive nodes, each having sensing capability with limited computational and communication power their reliability, cost-effectiveness, ease of deployment and ability to operate in an unattended environment, among other Positive characteristics make sensor networks the leading choice of networks for these applications. Here pattern generation for data aggregation is performed securely by allowing a sensor network to aggregate encrypted data without first decrypting it. In this pattern generation process, initially when a sensor node senses an event from the environment, a <b>pattern</b> <b>code</b> is generated and sends to the cluster head. This generated <b>pattern</b> <b>code</b> is compared with the existing <b>pattern</b> <b>code</b> in the cluster head and then reception of the acknowledgement, Authentication and the transmission of actual data then follows. The simulator used for the implementation is GloMoSim Network Simulator. This is more efficient due to aggregated data transmission, secure and bandwidth efficient.
