For many organizations, MO {{is responsible for}} evaluating, maintaining, and using the various marketing technology components whether stand-alone single point solutions or integrated together. The marketing technology landscape can be confusing, and the acronym alphabet soup used to describe these technologies only adds to the conundrum: DAM/MAM (digital asset or marketing asset management), MOM (marketing operations management), MAP (marketing automation platforms), and MRM (marketing resource management). Marketing technology ties together metrics, <b>customer</b> <b>touchpoints,</b> and stages of the customer lifecycle management in order to optimize its performance and agility in creating growth. Marketing technology platforms can be organized into four broad categories: ...|$|E
50|$|Employee <b>customer</b> <b>touchpoints</b> offer {{employees}} {{the opportunity}} to listen and better understand their customer’s needs and wants. Westernberg, E. (2010) suggest that through the pathways of interaction through social media, web searches and mobile apps, consumers are leaving fingerprints on many touch points, such as when they seek information or visit a specific destination. This presents the following opportunities for the employee; firstly they will know what the consumer {{is going to look}} for and be the first to offer it to him or her. Secondly is {{the opportunity to}} increase the importance of the brand by making life better and easier for the consumer. By enabling the customer to interact with the business experience through social networking, they allow their customer to share their ideas, questions and suggestions. Employees ability to create positive customer interactions, hinges on being able to respond quickly and appropriately to the customers experience.|$|E

50|$|The {{benefit of}} {{touchpoint}} analysis is that, while comprehending all relevant media and departments, it filters and measures {{all the relevant}} contact points from the target <b>customer’s</b> view. <b>Touchpoint</b> management allows companies to optimize all the interactions with the existing and potential customers, the internal communications and process management.|$|R
50|$|Touchpoints in {{marketing}} communications are the varying ways that a brand interacts and displays information to prospective customers and current <b>customers.</b> <b>Touchpoints</b> allow <b>customers</b> to have experiences {{every time they}} “touch’ {{any part of the}} product, service, brand or organization, across multiple channels and various points in time (Pantano and Milena, 2015 and Zomerdijk and Voss, 2010). Customers opinions and perceptions are largely influenced by the contact that is made with these touchpoints, which can be positive or negative depending wholly on the individual person (Meyer, & Schwager, 2007). Touchpoints have the ability to influence a consumers buying or intent to purchase, all throughout the five stages of the buyer purchasing decision-making process: Problem recognition, information search, the evaluation of alternatives, purchase decision, and post-purchase behaviour (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, Armstrong, 2013). Touchpoints can happen in both a Business-to-Business setting and a Business-to-Consumer setting (Lemke, Clark, & Wilson, 2010). A touchpoint is a message or way a brand reaches out to their target market providing engagement as it allows the brand to be seen by the prospective customer in a favorable way. The goal effective touch points is that it will create opportunity for the purchaser to choose their brand over another competitor.|$|R

As the importance of nonmarketing touchpoints such as customer service departments and the actual in-store experience continues to increase, marketing is challenged to step beyond its traditional role to prove its value in generating business growth. Toward achieving this end, marketing must respond to three key challenges: the ability to maintain superiority, the need for achieving returns with fewer resources, and finding ways to manage the expanding complexity of today s <b>customer</b> <b>touchpoints.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|A few {{use case}} {{examples}} from the survey can further illustrate the type of projects and returns telecom companies have captured from big data. One telecom company in our sample used multiple big data software to assess the load in real time of heavy video streaming applications, and limit congestion on fiber networks. A predictive model led to identify multiple causes of congestion, and their proactive prevention led to a 15  % reduction in capex planning, while reducing IPTV customer churn by 10  %, via reduction of jitter and packet loss. Another telecom company reported on its use of machine learning based model of voluntary churn, and fraud/bad payments. The data used was a mash up of socio-demographics, all <b>customer</b> <b>touchpoints</b> (online, call and service center, social media), network points’ usage, etc. The machine learning model classifies in real time, the most likely churners and non payors, including the types of actions to retain or to ensure payment recovery. About 2 points of churn could be improved technically by big data analytics alone. A major cost to fixed telecom providers is the installation of services at the customer premises. A telecom company built a big data software to help profile homes and anticipate likely faulty or challenging home installs. The home data and predictions were provided real time to all installers {{with a list of}} hints, so that they can also check the premises, and ensure first time right installation. The rate of first time right increases by about 11  %, leading to significant lower costs of install.|$|E
50|$|Businesses {{that offer}} {{products}} or services directly to <b>customers</b> use <b>touchpoints</b> {{in order to improve}} the relationship with the consumer and create brand recognition within their minds (Roll, 2015). Companies that offer services such as transport, mobile phone packages, flights, and rental cars are creating awareness of themselves through the intensive or minimal, targeted or broad use of touchpoints (Hogan, et al., 2005) which portray certain positive aspects of their company to prospective clients and customers. The choosing of (a) suitable touch point/s send messages to the customers about what values the company holds in high esteem. This is particularly important in the marketing of products in heavily filled marketplaces such as telecommunications, with companies producing tech-information services to retain customers in a competitive marketplace (Ojiako, Chipulu and Graesser, 2012).|$|R
50|$|Businesses are now {{realising}} {{they must}} {{find ways to}} differentiate their brands amidst a variety of consumer touchpoints throughout their purchase journey. Westernberg, E (2010) states that market leaders are using touchpoints {{to listen to their}} customers and are working to develop new services that help them earn ownership of the customer experience. They use social media to listen, to engage, to offer services and to interact through platforms that enhance the brand and customer experience, to keep them coming back. Traditionally businesses have developed their <b>customer</b> experience <b>touchpoints</b> by communicating their brand and services through channels they control; the shop, the phone, events, their website. Now, however there is a shift towards new touchpoints that are completely independent of the business owner; social net working such as Facebook, blogs, mobile apps, Twitter, instagram, location based services and many more.|$|R

Specifically within the investment banking sector, the importance and criticality of such customer information underpins the firm’s ability to transact sales, trading and other advisory-based services in an efficient and relevant manner. The design and development of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to address the given external vs. internal <b>customer</b> information <b>touchpoints,</b> therefore provides a vital link between financial services professionals, client data and business processes. In doing so, the input of CRM user requirements is a key step in deriving benefit from such a technology solution. This paper henceforth identifies and details user requirements and experiences of such an information system within a case study company and highlights pertinent issues for the adoption of such systems within the given secto...|$|R
50|$|The <b>customers</b> derive <b>touchpoint</b> {{value from}} the {{capabilities}} offered, {{such as a}} great website {{making it easier to}} find product information, making their life easier or helping to facilitate decision-making. For business owners, value comes from information about customer preferences and the ability to use this knowledge to lock in customers. Today, early adopting consumers will immediately try anything if it looks as though it will improve their lives. The incorporation of Apps with GPS locations that can now display popular restaurants nearby and connect details of products and pricing, also offering consumer opinions and comments, enable consumers to select their destination and products based on brand and customer experience. The development of new touchpoint opportunities is hugely accelerated by new technology such as, augmented reality (AR), near field communications, IPTV and sixth sense technology. The challenge for businesses is to keep up to date, engaged, understand, make choices and respond to the touchpoint opportunities evolving. (Westernberg, E. 2010).|$|R
40|$|A <b>customer</b> {{experiences}} various <b>touchpoints</b> {{during the}} shopping trip with a brand, (i. e., traditional advertising, online and WOMs). However, {{it is still}} unknown how satisfaction and behavior are affected by customers’ instant touchpoint experiences during the shopping process. Therefore we investigate the effects of holistic and real-time touchpoint experiences on satisfaction, and the instant impacts of multiple <b>touchpoints</b> on <b>customer</b> shopping and WOM over time. We apply a new real-time experience tracking method to track experiences from various touchpoints, incl. mass media, direct channels, store, online, publicity and WOM. Our results reveal {{that the effect of}} customers’ touchpoint experiences on satisfaction mainly comes from the valences of touchpoints, and not from their volumes. And these effects vary across touchpoints’ types and categories...|$|R
40|$|Service design must {{negotiate}} {{the challenges of}} intangibility, co-production and temporality in the design for experience. The field currently uses tools and concepts such as <b>customer</b> journeys and <b>touchpoints</b> to assist in this task. However, oth-er fields {{have the potential to}} inform the service design process as it seeks to focus more and more upon the customer experience. Theory relating to the sacred speaks essentially of the intangible where extraordinary experiences are co-produced in communities through myths and time based ritual structures. This paper undertakes a theoretical comparison be-tween relevant theory from social science relating to the discourse on the sacred and theory relating to service design. The paper demonstrates the potential for sacred theory to inform service design, and presents some examples from contemporary society in which the sacred is evident in service provision. This shows that there is potential from combining the two fields as part of the service de-sign process and delivery, and identifies a potential to operationalize this theory into new service de-sign tools. Areas for further research are identified that can help introduce theory on the sacred, myth and ritual into service design in a more operational way...|$|R
40|$|Creative, dynamic {{strategies}} {{are the ones}} that identify new and better ways of uniquely offering the target customers what they want or need. A business can achieve competitive advantage if it chooses a marketing strategy that sets the business apart from anyone else. Healthcare services companies have to understand that the customer should be placed in the centre of all specific marketing operations. The brand message should reflect the focus on the patient. Healthcare products and services offered must represent exactly the solutions that <b>customers</b> expect. The <b>touchpoints</b> with the patients must be well mastered in order to convince them to accept the proposed solutions. Healthcare service providers must be capable to look beyond customer’s behaviour or product and healthcare service aquisition. This will demand proactive and far-reaching changes, including focusing specifically on customer preference, quality, and technological interfaces; rewiring strategy to find new value from existing and unfamiliar sources; disintegrating and radically reassembling operational processes; and restructuring the organization to accommodate new typess of work and skill. It is a reality that economic transformations of advanced economies are becoming dominated by services which overwhelm all other sectors. „The service revolution”, that we are part of nowadays which affects all sectors includin...|$|R
50|$|The {{interaction}} between employees and customers {{can be said}} to be another important touchpoint. This is because, during such an interaction, {{there is a need for}} employees to create a sense of trust between themselves and the customers. Regardless of whether or not a customer has made a decision to purchase, and depending on the level of the employees’ customer service, the {{interaction between}} themselves and the employees of a brand can create a more gratifying (or terrible) experience for the customer. Employees of all brands can adopt Robert B. Cialdini’s principles of persuasion in order to create a bond between themselves and the customers that may result in the customer’s decision to purchase. Cialdini states that there are 6 principles of persuasion when it comes to the consumer’s decision making process: Reciprocation, commitment and consistency, social proof, liking, authority and scarcity. The use of such principles is at the discretion of the employee when dealing with a customers during the buying process. The interaction between employees and <b>customers</b> as a <b>touchpoint</b> is vital in the sense that employees have the opportunity to get to know their customers and be able to grasp what is important to them as a consumer of their brand. Once such a distinction can be made, the customer will have a sense of belonging to the brand or rather, trust of the brand and as a result, a purchase decision will be made.|$|R
50|$|Development of a {{positive}} customer experience can be difficult as there are many aspects associated with a customer's experience. The customer service, a brand's ethical ideals and the shopping environment is but a few examples that can effect a customer's experience. Understanding and effectively developing {{a positive}} customer experience has become a staple within businesses and brands to combat growing competition (Andajani, 2015). In today's world, many consumers are well informed. With {{the help of the}} internet, they are able to easily compare two similar products or services together. Therefore, consumers are looking for unique experiences that can fulfil their intentions and create a positive overall experience (Ali, 2015). A brand that can provide this gains a competitive advantage over their competition. A study by Ali (2015) found that developing a positive behavioural culture created a greater competitive advantage in the long term. He looked at the customer experience at resort hotels and discovered that providing the best hotel service was not sufficient. To optimise a customer's experience, management must also consider peace of mind and relaxation, recognition and escapism, involvement, and hedonics. The overall customer experience must be considered. The development {{of a positive}} customer experience is important as it increases the chances of a customer to make continued purchases and develops brand loyalty (Kim & Yu, 2016). Brand loyalty can turn customers into advocates, resulting in a long term relationship between both parties (Ren, Wang & Lin, 2016). This promotes word-of-mouth and turns the <b>customer</b> into a <b>touchpoint</b> for the brand. Potential customers can develop opinions through another's experiences. Males and females both respond differently to brands and therefore, will experience the same brand differently. Males respond effectively to relational, behavioural and cognitive experiences whereas females respond greater to behavioural, cognitive and effective experiences in relation to branded apps. If female consumers are the target market, an app advert focused on the emotion of the product will provide an effective customer experience (Kim & Yu, 2016).|$|R
