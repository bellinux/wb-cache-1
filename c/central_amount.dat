The version was produced by Claudio Guzman and Charles Ver Halen and featured a voice cast including Randi Kiger as Heidi, Billy Whitaker as Peter, Michelle Laurita as Clara, Vic Perrin as the Alm Uncle, the Doctor and Postman, Alan Reed as Sebastian and Mr. Usher, and legendary voice talent Janet Waldo as Aunt Dete. The version is distilled to only a <b>central</b> <b>amount</b> of episodes, as well as so {{that two of the}} sub-plots (of the adopted Pichi and Meow) to make them part of the main plot, instead, as well as cutting out many other scenes, either short or, most often, entirely.

Assessing policy impact from ‘event studies’ and from econometric models, they analysed the effect on financial markets and on output, employment and inflation.

50|$|The {{convex hull}} {{of these two}} triangles forms a convex {{polyhedron}} that is combinatorially equivalent to a regular octahedron; along with the triangle edges, it has six edges connecting the two triangles to each other, with two different lengths, and three interior diagonals.

40|$|Far-infrared Herschel PACS {{imaging and}} spectroscopic {{observations}} of the nebula around the luminous blue variable (LBV) star AG Car have been obtained along with optical imaging in the Halpha+[NII] filter. In the infrared light, the nebula appears as a clumpy ring shell that extends up to 1. 2 pc with an inner radius of 0. 4 pc. It coincides with the Halpha nebula, but extends further out. Dust modeling of the nebula was performed and indicates the presence of large grains. The dust mass {{is estimated to be}} ~ 0. 2 Msun. The infrared spectrum of the nebula consists of forbidden emission lines over a dust continuum. Apart from ionized gas, these lines also indicate the existence of neutral gas in a photodissociation region that surrounds the ionized region. The abundance ratios point towards enrichment by processed material. The total mass of the nebula ejected from the <b>central</b> star <b>amounts</b> to ~ 15 Msun, assuming a dust-to-gas ratio typical of LBVs. The abundances and the mass-loss rate were used to constrain the evolutionary path of the central star and the epoch at which the nebula was ejected, with the help of available evolutionary models.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electrical}} direct current (DC) field pulses on c-fos expression, growth kinetics and vitality patterns of multicellular tumour spheroids (MCSs) were studied. Monitoring the membrane potential of MCSs by di- 8 -ANNEPS staining and confocal microscopy during DC electrical field treatment revealed a hyperpolarization at the anode-facing {{side and a}} depolarization at the cathode-facing side. When a single 500 V m(- 1) electrical field pulse {{with a duration of}} 60 s was applied to MCSs (150 - 350 microm in diameter) an enhancement of the growth kinetics within a period of 6 days post pulse was observed. Whereas the volume doubling time amounted to 4 - 5 days in control samples, it was reduced to 1 - 2 days in electropulsed MCSs. At day 6 post pulse the diameter of the necrotic core was significantly smaller than the control. The critical diameter for the first appearance of <b>central</b> necrosis <b>amounted</b> to 350 +/- 50 microm in the control and 450 +/- 50 microm in the electropulsed MCSs. Coincidentally, the proliferating rim was increased to 107 +/- 11 microm in electropulsed MCSs as compared with 60 +/- 6 microm in the control. The growth stimulation may be mediated by the proto-oncogene c-fos as its expression increased by a factor of 2. 5 within 2 h post pulse. c-fos expression declined towards control values within 8 h post pulse...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} {{a model for the}} variability of gamma ray emission in jets of active galactic nuclei in which the variability arises as a result of photon-photon pair production interactions with X-rays emitted by a hot spot in the inner part of the accretion disk. As the hot spot orbits around the <b>central</b> engine, the <b>amount</b> of absorption varies periodically. Our model may account for the observed variability of TeV emission from Markarian 421 and other blazars detected by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, as well as correlated variations of X-ray and TeV gamma flux from Markarian 421. Quasi-periodic variations observed in Markarian 421 enable us to place an upper limit on the black hole mass of (2 - 30) times 10 ^ 8 solar masses.

2500|$|The burn {{temperature}} in modern stoves can increase {{to the point}} where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4grams per hour. This is roughly 90% less smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace. (Net efficiency is the amount of heat energy transferred to the room compared to the amount contained in the wood, minus any <b>amount</b> <b>central</b> heating must work to compensate for airflow problems.) ...|$|R
