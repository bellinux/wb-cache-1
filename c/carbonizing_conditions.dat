40|$|The {{regenerative}} {{capacity of}} bamboo {{is very high}} and bamboo is noticed {{from the viewpoint of}} effective utilization of resources. Recently, bamboo charcoa 1 has been produced everywhere in Japan, in what has beeome a bamboo charcoal boom. However, there are few research reports on bamboo charcoal. ln this study, the fundamental properties of bamboo charcoal, including the humiclity control capacity under different <b>carbonizing</b> <b>conditions,</b> were compared with　those of wood charcoal. The results were obtained as follows. 1 ）Ash content in bamboo charcoal is about 4 times greater than that of wood charcoai. 2) There is good correlation, regardless of the wood species, between carbonization temperature and electrical resistance, and it is possible to estimate the 　　carbonization temperature in the traditional charcoal furnace. 3 ）The pH of wood charcoal changes from alkaline to acid with the nise in the carbonization temperature, but the pH of bamboo charcoal maintained its alkalinity regardless of the carbonization temperature. The quantity of ash, K and Mg content in bamboo charcoa 1 seems {{to be related to the}} pH. 4 ）The humidity control capacity in the high humidity region of barnboo charcoal is better than wood charcoal...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{meat and}} bone meal (MBM) has rapidly {{spread all over}} the world as an {{effective}} feed resource for daily or beef cattle. MBM is effective recycling of dead animals and slaughterhouse waste. It has been an efficient protein source due to the richness of undegradable proteins in rumen. However, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) occurred due to an infectious prion contaminating the MBM, and its use became prohibited in Japan. Now, most MBM is incinerated as general garbage, and part is disposed of as a raw material of cement. A large amount of tax is spent for this process, and a useful resource is lost by incineration. The present study deals with a newly developed bone carbonization technology for a safe recycling process of MBM and dead animals with a low input of energy and high-added value compared to conventional methods. Carbonization of MBM was examined with a tubular furnace or a muffle which used a crucible under aerobic conditions. Control of temperature, oxidation and reduction in the carbonization process were examined concerning organic matter survivability, surface structure, surface element, and the surface functional group for safe <b>carbonizing</b> <b>conditions</b> and high additional value. In consequence, it was shown that chemically safe bone charcoal could be manufactured at 600 °C for 1 hour, a...|$|E

40|$|In the Ryukyu Islands it {{is clear}} that cereal {{cultivation}} had begun by the Gusuku Period (12 - 15 th centuries AD). In this paper, I examine the beginning of cereal cultivation based upon archaeological materials. Prior to the Gusuku period, the cereal remains obtained from three sites (Nazakibaru, Yajagama and Nagarabaru-Higashi) are rice, wheat, barley and beans. All of these were discovered in a <b>carbonized</b> state, a <b>condition</b> that is often produced by the process of threshing. These cereals thus tell us that cultivation had already began {{at the end of the}} first millennium in the Ryukyu Islands. In addition, these cereals are thought to be derived from dry field cultivation and it is very important that this type of cultivation was connected directly with that of the Ryukyu Dynasty...|$|R
40|$|In this study, water {{hyacinth}} was hydrolyzed to sugars with dilute sulphuric acid (0. 25 M) under subcritical water conditions (P = 20 bar, T = 130 8 C) for 2 h. The sugar solution was then <b>carbonized</b> under subcritical <b>conditions</b> to produce carbon microsphere. The subcritical water carbonization {{was conducted at}} 40 bar and various temperatures (160 – 200 8 C) and times (6 – 10 h). The highest yield of carbon microspheres was 0. 1019 g/g dry {{water hyacinth}} at the temperature of 200 8 C for 10 h. The carbon microsphere was activated {{using a combination of}} chemical (KOH solution) and physical (microwave) treatments to increase the specific surface area and porosity of carbon microsphere. Electrocapacitive study of carbon microspheres showed that the carbon microsphere activated at impregnation ratio of 1 : 1 and microwave power of 630 W has the highest specific capacitance and excellent electrochemical stability...|$|R
30|$|Reliable and {{representative}} characterization of {{those aspects of}} coke structure that are pertinent to some coke quality consideration {{can be achieved by}} means of reflected light microscopy coupled with a computerized image analysis system. Special care should be taken for sampling of coke sample for pellet preparation and its polishing. The industrial significances of these measurements in this relationship to such coke properties are strength and reactivity. Coke’s porous structure is a function of both the materials <b>carbonized</b> and the <b>conditions</b> of carbonization and aim of this work was to determine the qualitative influence of some of these factors with a view to use such data for the specific structural characterization. The nature of the coal charge is obviously a major factor in determining the coke structure and in general, low rank high volatile coals with sufficient fluidity to ensure that all components are fused together tend to produce high porosity cokes.|$|R
40|$|It was {{determined}} by verification by in situ analysis that combustion products of firewood in fireplaces cause carbonation of alumina cement-bonded conventional refractory castable and accelerate its destruction. The carbonation of hydrated cement (Gorkal 40) paste was modeled in a laboratory conditions: having been fired at various temperatures (300 ºC – 950 ºC) the specimens were curing in humid conditions for two days. It {{was determined}} by X-ray analysis that the hydrates CAH 10, C 2 AH 8 and C 3 AH 6 change into a mineral C 12 A 7 after the cement paste are fired at 300 ºC – 800 ºC temperatures. The amount of the mineral depends on the firing temperature. In humid conditions C 12 A 7 hydrates and carbonizes, consequently calcium carboaluminate hydrate forms. In the composition of cement and microsilica (9 %) carbonation of cement hydrates noticeably slow down at the same <b>conditions.</b> <b>Carbonized</b> minerals are not identified when the specimens are fired at 500 ºC – 850 ºC temperatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBagasse filled {{recycled}} polyethylene bio-composites were {{produced by the}} compounding and compressive molding method. Two sets of composites were produced using uncarbonized (UBp) and carbonized (CBp) bagasse particles by varying the bagasse particles from 10 to 50 wt%. The surface morphology and the mechanical properties of the composites were examined. The {{results showed that the}} uniform distribution of the bagasse particles in the microstructure of the polymer composites is the major factor responsible for the improvement of the mechanical properties. The bagasse particles added to the RLDPE polymer improved its rigidity and the hardness values of the composites. The tensile and bending strengths of the composite increased with increasing percentage of the bagasse to a maximum of 20 wt%UBp and 30 wt%CBp. The impact energy and fracture toughness decreases with wt% bagasse particles. The developed composites have the best properties in the ranges of 30 wt% bagasse particle additions and for optimum service <b>condition,</b> <b>carbonized</b> bagasse particles addition should not exceed 30 wt%...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{physical}} and mechanical properties of charcoal from eucalypt clones by principal component analysis and demonstrate the relationships between these properties, {{in order to assess}} which charcoal property should aimed in the process to obtain a higher quality product. In this way, was cut eight clones of Eucalyptus and two of Corymbia, collecting three trees per clone and five disk in different heights. The disks were transformed into test samples, totaling an average of 75 samples per clones, which were <b>carbonized</b> under specific <b>conditions</b> for analysis of apparent density, compressive strength parallel to grain and linear and volumetric degradation due to high temperature. It is noteworthy that the data were weighted by disk and per tree, to an average closer to reality. For correlations, was used multivariate analysis of principal components. Herein, it is found that the apparent density of charcoal acts as {{the focal point of the}} other properties studied, and observed that as the higher the density, higher will be the compressive strength parallel to grain, the elastic modulus and the gravimetric yield...|$|R
40|$|Amphiphilic {{molecules}} {{equipped with}} a reactive, carbon-rich "oligoyne" segment consisting of conjugated carbon-carbon triple bonds self-assemble into defined aggregates in aqueous media and at the air-water interface. In the aggregated state, the oligoynes can then be <b>carbonized</b> under mild <b>conditions</b> while preserving the morphology and the embedded chemical functionalization. This novel approach provides direct access to functionalized carbon nanomaterials. In this article, we present a synthetic approach {{that allows us to}} prepare hexayne carboxylate amphiphiles as carbon-rich siblings of typical fatty acid esters through a series of repeated bromination and Negishi-type cross-coupling reactions. The obtained compounds are designed to self-assemble into monolayers at the air-water interface, and we show how this can be achieved in a Langmuir trough. Thus, compression of the molecules at the air-water interface triggers the film formation and leads to a densely packed layer of the molecules. The complete carbonization of the films at the air-water interface is then accomplished by cross-linking of the hexayne layer at room temperature, using UV irradiation as a mild external stimulus. The changes in the layer during this process can be monitored with the help of infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy and Brewster angle microscopy. Moreover, a transfer of the carbonized films onto solid substrates by the Langmuir-Blodgett technique has enabled us to prove that they were carbon nanosheets with lateral dimensions on the order of centimeters...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The carbon in metallurgical coke is composed of textural units, varying in size and shape depending on the rank of coal carbonized. These induce a characteristic texture to coke surfaces. This thesis describes {{a study of the}} bearing of this texture on coke strength, particular emphasis being placed on investigating the feasibility of using textural composition data, determined by either scanning electron microscopy (SEX) of etched surfaces or polarized-light microscopy (PLX) of polished coke surfaces, as a basis of predicting the tensile strength of cokes produced from blended-coal charges from the behaviour of individual blend components. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of fractured coke surfaces revealed differences in the mode of fracture of textural components which implied variations in their contribution to coke strength. The tensile strengths of pilot-oven cokes, produced from blended-coal charges, could be related to their measured PLM textural compositions using equations derived from consideration of simple models of intergranular and transgranular fracture. The coke strengths could also be related, with greater precision, with textural data calculated from the coal blend composition and either the SEM or the PLM textural data for the cokes from the individual blend components. It was further found that the strength of blended-coal cokes were additively related to the blend composition and the tensile strengths of the single-coal cokes. Such relationships are useful, at the very least, for predicting the strength of cokes from other blends of the same coals <b>carbonized</b> under similar <b>conditions.</b> The various approaches to coke strength prediction have potential value in different situations...|$|R

Istaknuti su ciljevi i pojedini rezultati istraživanja te značaj i vrijednost nalazišta kao i njegov potencijal. Detaljnije se razmatraju arheološki ostaci koji su otkriveni 2008. godine, a čine ih arheološki kontekst i pokretni arheološki materijal. Radi se o ostacima objekta koji je na osnovi tipo-kronološke analize keramičkih posuda relativno kronološki datiran u Ha B stupanj, odnosno mlađu fazu kasnog brončanog doba. Apsolutno kronološki ovaj objekt i predmeti koji su u njemu pronađeni datirani su u 9 st. pr. Kr. Objekt je uništen u požaru, a svi pokretni nalazi iz objekta otkriveni su in situ. Pri tome je u vatri karboniziran i obilan arheobotanički uzorak na kojemu je napravljena detaljna analiza. Pronađene su velike količine žitarica različitih vrsta, mahunarke i nekoliko vrsta divljih biljaka. U radu su predstavljeni rezultati analize makrofosila te se razmatraju društveno-ekonomski aspekti zajednice koja je hranu proizvodila i konzumirala. The archeological site Kalnik-Igrišče has {{during the}} last two decades {{become one of the most}} {{prominent}} Bronze Age sites in Croatia primarily thanks to the results of the systematic archeological excavations which have been conducted since 1988 (Majnarić-Pandžić 1992; Vrdoljak 1992; Vrdoljak, Forenbaher 1995). The site – where the remains of settlements from the Copper, Bronze, Late Iron Age and Roman period were found during the years – is situated on the southern terraces of the Kalnik at 500 meters above sea level. Based on the settlement remains and archaeological artefacts analysis and according to the potential of the Kalnik-Igrišče site, new systematic excavations were initiated by the Institute for Archeology under the leadership of Dr. Sc. Snježana Karavanić. Research began in 2006, and the very next year it was clear that Kalnik is extremely complex multilayered site with layers from different periods of prehistory. The most abundant finds date to the Late Bronze Age. In 2008 archaeological excavations at Kalnik-Igrišče yielded the remains of a Late Bronze Age structure, dated to the 9 th century BC based on the radiocarbon measurements of charred cereal grains (Karavanić 2008, Karavanić 2009). On the house floor among broken pottery an abundant sample of carbonised grains were discovered. The collected samples were preserved in an excellent <b>condition,</b> <b>carbonized</b> by the fire that destroyed the house. A hearth was also discovered at the floor level, while the rest of the structure extends eastwards beyond the limits of the archaeological trench. A smaller section of the house was explored, measuring approximately 35 square meters. In 2012 the trench was investigated fully and it was concluded that the house rested on wooden pillars which were firmly implanted in the rocky subsoil. Non-destructive investigation methods such as field surveying and geophysical probing were conducted on the site during 2012 and 2013. The further article elucidates the context of the uncovered Bronze Age structure and contains a short overview of the pottery finds, together with a detailed analysis of the archeobotanical material. The pottery are classified into four basic functional groups: bowls (most numerous), pots used to prepare food in the fireplace, amphorae and smaller vessels of different purposes and finer texture. The analysis of the full sample of the archeobotanical finds was conducted as part of a doctoral dissertation at the Department of Biology of the Faculty of Science in Zagreb (Mareković 2013). According to the archeobotanical analysis of the macrofossils, the following plant species were found in the analyzed sample ranging from most numerous to least: millet (Panicum miliaceum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), broad bean (Vicia faba L.), common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum), emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon), lentil (Lens culinaris), spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta), while oats (Avena), rye (Secale cereale), peas (Pisum sativum), acorn (Quercus), European wilde apple (Malus sylvestris), European cornel (Cornus mas) were not present to such an extent. The mentioned species were divided into four groups: These species were divided into 4 basic groups: 1. 	Cereals: millet (Panicum miliaceum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), common wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum), emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon), spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. Spelta), oat (Avena), rye (Secale cereale), foxtail millet (Setaria italica) 2. 	Legumes: broad bean (Vicia Faba L.), lentil (Lens culinaris), pea (Pisum sativum), 3. 	Useful wild woody plants: acorn (Quercus), wilde apple (Malus sylvestris), Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas) 4. 	Crop weeds. Field brome (Bromus arvensis), rye brome (Bromus secalinus), barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli), cleavers (Galium aparine), false cleavers (Galium spurium) The finds consist mostly of cereals (millet and barley). On the basis of the findings of weed (Galium aparine), which is connected with winter wheat, it can be concluded that the community gave preference to the autumn harvest by sowing winter wheat, while millet was sowed during the spring. Based on the very small proportion of weeds in the sample we assume that the community was well organized, and that it stored thoroughly cleaned cereals. The space in which the analysed samples were found might be associated with a domestic storage of food, that is, a store of a single household. The presence of isolated, but also mixed grains in the context of finds speaks of the storing of individual species on the one hand and mixed species on the other, which may point to the way food was prepared in the household...|$|R
