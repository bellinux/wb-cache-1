The merit of the proposed methods lies in their less conservativeness, {{which is achieved by}} avoiding the utilization of bounding inequalities for cross products of vectors.

25|$|This protocol, {{known as}} BB84 after its inventors and year of publication, was {{originally}} described using photon polarization states to transmit the information. However, any {{two pairs of}} conjugate states {{can be used for}} the protocol, and many optical fibre based implementations described as BB84 use phase encoded states. The sender (traditionally referred to as Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a quantum <b>communication</b> <b>channel</b> which allows quantum states to be transmitted. In the case of photons this channel is generally either an optical fibre or simply free space. In addition they communicate via a public classical channel, for example using broadcast radio or the internet. Neither of these channels need to be secure; the protocol is designed with the assumption that an eavesdropper (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with both.|$|E
500|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, it was acoustic resonance {{that inspired}} filtering applications, {{the first of}} these being a telegraph system known as the [...] "harmonic telegraph". Versions are due to Elisha Gray, Alexander Graham Bell (1870s), [...] and others. Its purpose was to simultaneously transmit a number of telegraph messages over the same line and represents an early form of frequency division multiplexing (FDM). FDM requires the sending end to be transmitting at different frequencies for each individual <b>communication</b> <b>channel.</b> This demands individual tuned resonators, as well as filters to separate out the signals at the receiving end. The harmonic telegraph achieved this with electromagnetically driven tuned reeds at the transmitting end which would vibrate similar reeds at the receiving end. Only the reed with the same resonant frequency as the transmitter would vibrate to any appreciable extent at the receiving end.|$|E
