40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} systematic modelling of VSC-based FACTS controllers within three-phase power flows in rectangular coordinates. Among the FACTS controllers modelled are the STATCOM, SSSC, UPFC and HVDC-VSC. The approach taken is to represent the fundamental frequency operation of each power converter as a three-phase voltage source behind a leakage reactance, where {{one or two of}} them may be connected in either series or parallel depending on the FACTS controller being modelled. Active and reactive power flow equations are developed for each voltage source circuit together with constraint equations to account for <b>co-ordinated</b> <b>operation</b> of two converters, such as in modelling of UPFC and HVDC-VSC. The power flow equations representing the VSC-based FACTS controllers are combined with the nodal power equations of the power network for a combined iterative solution using a Newton-Raphson three-phase power flow algorithm in rectangular co-ordinates enabling robust and efficient solutions of three-phase power networks with any number and kind of VSC-based controllers...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the use of a Microgrid Central Controller (MGCC) to achieve <b>co-ordinated</b> <b>operation</b> of various DG sources, storage devices and {{controllable}} loads with regards to the potential economic benefits and the power losses avoided in the local network is presented. Additionally, the effect of connecting numerous typical Microgrids in a typical medium voltage (MV) network regarding power losses and the emissions avoided is studied. The emissions avoidance calculation is based on the marginal emissions curve of the upstream network, quantifying also the calculated losses reduction impact on emissions avoidance. The presented results, based on a variety of realistic market prices time-series, various levels of renewable energy resource (RES) production and demand from different seasons, show clear benefits in terms of both losses and emissions avoidance. Finally, this paper performs a sensitivity analysis on the potential impact of the DG topology within a Microgrid on losses and emissions avoidance. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|JL, a 25 -year-old physiotherapist, became densely amnesic {{following}} {{herpes simplex}} viral encephalitis (HSVE), causing bilateral damage to medial and ventral areas of her frontal and temporal lobes and their associated circuitry. Three years post-onset, her WAIS-R full scale IQ (Verbal 74, Performance 102) showed an estimated loss of ± 50 points. She displayed severe global amnesia and markedly impaired social cognition. However, her immediate memory, perceptual priming, and cognitive problem-solving abilities were relatively spared. Her retention of professional skills {{was assessed using}} simulated physiotherapy scenarios. JL was able to demonstrate some procedural skills spontaneously, {{but was unable to}} apply them precisely and flexibly to individual patient needs. She showed no memory of theoretical or propositional physiotherapy knowledge, and could neither plan treatment nor reason clinically. Her performance was well below that of four other physiotherapists who had also not practised for 4 years. Thus, despite the relative sparing of her implicit memory, JL 2 ̆ 7 s performance lacked the <b>co-ordinated</b> <b>operation</b> of declarative and implicit long-term memory and the links to working memory that are necessary for the flexible performance of complex professional procedures...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} {{and development of}} humankind depends a lot upon a <b>co-ordinated</b> <b>operation</b> of all areas and levels of human activity. However, in either theory or practice we found no model of operation, which would offer a harmonized and target oriented development. A possible solution is offered by sustainable development, which tries to define and carry out common goals of humankind with a holistic harmonization of humans’ activities {{at all levels of}} their living and behaviour. Companies belong to central institutions of the modern society and essentially co–create the sustainability of society. Companies endeavour (e. g. by simulation and planning) to prepare models of their goals and ways concerning their internal and external environment. On the basis of systems approach, we can define companies as business systems, which can best survive in a log-run on the basis of sustainable development. This business system’s effort can also be supported by the application of the anticipatory systems thinking, which can improve its planning methods, if it is holistic, understood as a future oriented mental activity made of its methodological approach, techniques, and modes of work. Its characteristics have a direct impact on holism of the definition of goals, on the orientation of operation, and hence on the achievement of the business system’s results...|$|E
