60|$|He {{shows us}} also <b>cashmeres,</b> orange, scarlet, sky-blue, royal blue: good, pure-wool <b>cashmeres</b> {{that were being}} sent to India, and were {{captured}} from a German mercantile sub-marine. So he says. Fifty francs a metre--very, very wide. But they are too much trouble to carry in a knapsack, though their brilliance fascinates.|$|R

5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, <b>cashmere,</b> and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E

5|$|It was {{released}} in February 2014 to various stores; a promotional poster and a commercial shot by English music video director Jake Nava were released the same month with the latter featuring Beyoncé surrounded by golden glitter. Upon their release, the perfume and the commercial were positively received by critics with Rise's various scents and its feminist inspiration being particularly hailed. Rise features top notes of Italian bergamot orange, golden apricot and a basil sorbet middle notes of gold symphony orchid freesia blossom and jasminum sambac and base notes of autumn woods accord, <b>cashmere</b> musk and a vetiver extract.|$|E
60|$|Her Ladyship {{had been}} what they style a splendid woman; {{that was now}} past, although, {{with the aid of}} <b>cashmeres,</b> diamonds, and turbans, her general {{appearance}} was still striking. Her Ladyship was not remarkable for anything save a correct taste for poodles, parrots, and bijouterie, and a proper admiration of Theodore Hook and John Bull.|$|R
50|$|Broadway runs off, but vows to get revenge and, {{after an}} {{attempted}} robbery {{later in the}} day where he shoots and kills a woman at a drive-through, he wipes off his gun and tosses it into the backseat of <b>Cashmere's</b> open convertible when he is out of the car, which looks similar enough to Broadway's car to be mistaken for it.|$|R
6000|$|It {{might have}} been in almost {{compassionate}} deprecation of this weak note that Mrs. Brookenham looked at him. Her own reply to Mr. <b>Cashmere's</b> question, however, was uttered at Mr. Longdon. [...] "She's exposed--it's much worse--to ME. But Aggie isn't exposed to anything--never has been and never is to be; and we're watching to see if the Duchess can carry it through." ...|$|R
5|$|Many Scottish names {{occur in}} Otago and Southland (the Lammerlaws, Invercargill, Wedderburn, Glenfalloch) and Scottish {{settlers}} also named Riccarton and the Avon River in Christchurch. Canterbury has an English flavour to its nomenclature with Christchurch and Oxford, but also contains Belfast and French names throughout the Akaroa area. Scandinavian migrants left their {{mark in the}} Seventy Mile Bush with Dannevirke and Norsewood {{and some of the}} suburbs and streets of Auckland and Wellington reflect Australian immigration (Footscray and Botany Downs). There is very little Asian influence in New Zealand place naming, with Khandallah in Wellington and <b>Cashmere</b> (Kashmir) in Christchurch, reflecting British imperial connections rather than Indian influence.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, <b>cashmere</b> and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked <b>cashmere</b> sweater and {{tailored}} skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E
5000|$|In high school, the group's three {{remaining}} members discovered fellow student Stephen Caldwell, who was {{lead singer of}} a local group called the Romeos. Impressed, they invited him to join the group in 1960 and named themselves The Orlons as a tongue-in-cheek nod to the friendly rivalry they had with a popular group at their high school, the <b>Cashmeres.</b> (Orlon was a brand name for the widely used synthetic fiber acrylic.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{famed for}} its velvet scarves - which innovated {{the use of}} velvet as daywear - Georgina von Etzdorf was also widely admired for its skill in {{printing}} and experimenting with texture and technique on what are considered more difficult fabrics such as textured chiffon and organza, mohair, fine <b>cashmeres,</b> satin, rayon fur, chenille and wool boucle as well as using complex techniques such as devore, laser printing, leather and plastic printing ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, boutiques {{were opened}} along the Cote d'Azur in Monte Carlo, Cannes, Saint-Tropez, and in Marseilles. Throughout the 1970s, Goldberg began to {{collaborate}} with large American and European companies such as Sebago, Alden and Van's to create a shoe collection. In 1975, Albert Goldberg worked with Loro Piana, the duo creating [...] "Façorain", an invisible membrane allowing <b>cashmeres</b> and luxury wools to be wind and waterproof whilst retaining their texture and breathability.|$|R
25|$|<b>Cashmere</b> is warm, {{light in}} weight, and very {{comfortable}} to wear. <b>Cashmere</b> yarn {{comes from the}} hair of mountain goats, whose fleece allows them to survive the extreme weather conditions they are exposed to.|$|E
25|$|Softness: <b>Cashmere</b> {{is known}} in the textile {{industry}} {{as one of the}} softest wools with a fiber diameter of less than 18.5. The diameter of the down fiber of the Yak also ranges 16-20 microns making its softness comparable to that of <b>cashmere.</b> Species-specific DNA probes have been developed to identify yak, which is used to quantitatively test yak-cashmere blends. Although <b>cashmere</b> has already been firmly established in the market, yak wool has potential to be sold as a luxury product due to its softness and the (currently) sustainable and eco-friendly means used for gathering the fibers.|$|E

5000|$|In September 2014 Sorokin {{presented}} his Spring Summer 2015 collection at London Fashion Week's Fashion Scout. The collection inspired by Eric Klinenberg's Going Solo, architecture of Seagram Building and Hearst Tower showed {{the evolution of}} Homo Consommatus [...] "to intimate and exclusive label through using luxurious <b>cashmeres,</b> silks and cottons with manual finishings as polyurethane cover, hot press gluing and plastic embroidering". The collection received a massive feedback and was spotlighted by singer Lady Gaga who wears Homo Consommatus pieces.|$|R
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Maya Lieberman {{attempted to}} contrast the costumes of Sharon and Lisa {{to reinforce the}} conflict between the two characters. She said, [...] "With Ali, our discussion started with wanting really clean, classic and sharp lines, whereas Beyoncé's character [...] more soft, more textural <b>cashmeres</b> and knits." [...] Sharon wore clothes designed by Zac Posen, Yves Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo, Diane von Fürstenberg, Valentino, Stella McCartney and Missoni, while Lisa wore Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry outfits. Derek was dressed in Dolce & Gabbana and Versace suits with Thomas Pink shirts to create a [...] "prestigious yet contemporary" [...] look.|$|R

2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of Holden-Leonard the Bennington Mill, {{also known as the}} [...] "Big Mill", had discontinued making Paisley shawls and was converted to produce knit stockings as well as wool and cotton underwear and later for ladies’ dress goods and cloth for men’s clothing. The mill also produced fine wool dress fabrics, cloakings and <b>cashmeres.</b> Later modifications included fabricating Olin Scott's famous gunpowder machinery. Success was due in part to its close proximity to the Hudson River by way of the Hoosic River. Woolen products were shipped south to New York and Philadelphia, giving the company and the regional industry a huge boost. By 1895 the mill was employing 300, and had achieved the position of being the largest industrial venture in Southwestern Vermont.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{conversion}} of the Spreydon route to bus operation on 22 June 1953, the <b>Cashmere</b> route temporarily became a through route with the Spreydon service in which some of the buses from Spreydon continued on along Barrington Street before proceeding to the Hills terminus. Once trams were also removed from the <b>Cashmere</b> route in 1954, these bus services reverted to the old tram routes though a new service was established that terminated at Macmillan Avenue via Dyers Pass Road.|$|E
25|$|It quickly {{proved to}} be a useful {{addition}} to the fleet. The first, and only, English Electric trolley bus in service at the time for the Shirley route, opened on 1 April 1931, had to be temporarily withdrawn after a month for upgrades to its bodywork, during which time no. 213 was able to provide relief cover. It was also used for experiments on the <b>Cashmere</b> Hills tram route to test performance on steep terrain. On the morning of 24 May 1931 and the afternoon of 1 June 1931 no. 213 was run along the <b>Cashmere</b> tramline to Dyers Pass Road with one pole on the overhead tram wire and towing a contact line attached to a skate on the tram rail. Though the Board was satisfied with the results, it ultimately decided against conversion of the <b>Cashmere</b> tram route to trolley bus operation.|$|E

As CEO of Cleopatra Broumand, Inc., her second fashion venture, she presided over a diversified operation with productions in Italy and the Far East, distributing to two hundred top specialty stores and boutiques throughout America, Europe, and Japan. Cleopatra's Fall '83 collection {{was based on an}} ancient “Sun Man” mask and “Lady Sun,” as well as starbursts and crescent moons.

50|$|The city {{is known}} as the premier wool textile center in the country, specializing in thread and yarn, <b>cashmeres,</b> blankets, as well as {{embroidered}} blouses and skirts During the pre-Hispanic era, this area produced cotton textiles, especially in the mountain areas of Huehuetla and Tenango. These were part of the tribute items collected by the Aztecs. Textile production continued into the colonial period, especially to mining communities in the Real del Monte and Pachuca areas. Sometime during this period, the fabric produced switched to mostly wool. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the textile industry here and in the rest of Mexico was modernized and the first train station was opened to ship products. The Mexican Revolution disrupted train service and the textile industry here suffered but came back after the war was over led by the La Esperanza and Santiago Textil factories, and with about 21% of the wool fabric of the country produced here. The textile industry continued to develop with the production of dairy products becoming important as well.|$|R
