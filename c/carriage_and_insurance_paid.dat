50|$|In many cases, because risk {{warnings}} {{were not}} made as clearly {{as they are in}} today's investment market, courts have found against the insurer or broker responsible for the original advice and have required them to restore their customers to the financial position they would have been in had they taken out a repayment mortgage instead.

40|$|Resumé A {{person could}} say that from one angle the whole {{situation}} of {{occupational safety and health}} leads to a collision of two different interests of two different subjects. The main subjects are employers on one side and employees and society as a whole on the other side. Speaking of interests, there is an interest of making the biggest possible earnings and maximalization of profit, but on the other side there is an interest of maximalization of safety of the employees as a very expensive part of the business but a necessary matter of humanism and law. The solution lays on a compromise, a situation, where there is a guarantee of good safety for a reasonable price. We have to see the state as the resolver of this situation because state is laying between these two subjects and their interests and we cannot place it on the side of emloyees or employers. On the other hand state can have a big influence on the whole situation due to its statutory instruments such as legal acts and other directives. State, however, also has to resolve some opposing views inside itself. These are the maximalization of profit of companies and thus high tax income versus its target seen in the lowest possible outcome due to old-age pension <b>and</b> social <b>insurance</b> <b>paid</b> to employees together with the highest possible age reached by [...] ...|$|R
