40|$|Forensic {{scientists}} are routinely {{faced with the}} problem of assessing the total number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> while examining DNA mixtures. Inferential procedures can be biased, in particular when assessments of the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> are not made prior to considering the genotypic configuration of potential donors. Moreover, it might be observed that the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> is incompatible with the set of alleles observed in the profile of a mixed stain, given the genotype <b>of</b> a potential <b>contributor.</b> In such situations, procedures leading to a single and fixed number contributors as output can not be appropriate. In this work, two strategies to infer the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> in a mixed stain are presented and analyzed by considering mixtures in a qualitative way. One procedure is deterministic and searches the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> required to explain an observed set of alleles. The second procedure is Bayesian and provides a probability distribution for the set <b>of</b> numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors.</b> Simulation studies and graphical models will be implemented to compare the performances of the proposed procedures...|$|R

The Gentoo project is known for a period of centralization within its bug triaging community.

We find that contributors are more likely to become inactive when they express strong positive or negative emotions in the bug tracker, or when they deviate from the expected value of emotions in the mailing list. We use these insights to develop a Bayesian classifier that detects the risk <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> leaving the project.

40|$|In the {{forensic}} examination of DNA mixtures, {{the question of}} how to set the total number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> (N) presents a topic of ongoing interest. Part of the discussion gravitates around issues of bias, in particular when assessments of the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> are not made prior to considering the genotypic configuration of potential donors. Further complication may stem from the observation that, in some cases, there may be numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> that are incompatible with the set of alleles seen in the profile of a mixed crime stain, given the genotype <b>of</b> a potential <b>contributor.</b> In such situations, procedures that take a single and fixed number contributors as their output can lead to inferential impasses. Assessing the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> within a probabilistic framework can help avoiding such complication. Using elements of decision theory, this paper analyses two strategies for inference on the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors.</b> One procedure is deterministic and focuses on the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> required to ‘explain’ an observed set of alleles. The other procedure is probabilistic using Bayes’ theorem and provides a probability distribution for a set <b>of</b> numbers <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> based on the set of observed alleles as well as their respective rates of occurrence. The discussion concentrates on mixed stains of varying quality (i. e., different numbers of loci for which genotyping information is available). A so-called qualitative interpretation is pursued since quantitative information such as peak area and height data are not taken into account. The competing procedures are compared using a standard scoring rule that penalizes the degree of divergence between a given agreed value for N, that is the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors,</b> and the actual value taken by N. Using only modest assumptions and a discussion with reference to a casework example, this paper reports on analyses using simulation techniques and graphical models (i. e., Bayesian networks) to point out that setting the number <b>of</b> <b>contributors</b> to a mixed crime stain in probabilistic terms is, for the conditions assumed in this study, preferable to a decision policy that uses categoric assumptions about N...|$|R
