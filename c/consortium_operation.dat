40|$|Following a brief {{introduction}} in Section 1, Section 2 {{sets out}} the operational context of library purchasing consortia. A range of key factors have shaped {{recent developments in}} the four LIS sectors under consideration (FE, HE, health and public libraries); some have exerted a common influence over all (e. g. information technology, European Commission purchasing directives, new central government, decline in bookfunds); some are sector-specific (e. g. purchasing arrangements, regional administrative frameworks, collaborative partnerships). The structure and markets {{of the book and}} periodical publishing industry in the UK are reviewed, with attention paid to historical as well as more recent practice that has had an impact on library supply. Although each component of the LIS purchasing consortia jigsaw displays individual characteristics that have evolved as a response to its own environment, the thread that links them together is constant change. Section 3 presents the results of a survey of identified library purchasing consortia in the four library sectors. It treats common themes of relevance to all consortia arising from information gathered by seminar input, questionnaire and interview. These include models of <b>consortium</b> <b>operation,</b> membership and governance, ‘typical’ composition of consortia in each sector, and links to analogous practice in other library sectors. Common features of the tendering and contract management process are elicited and attention paid to any contribution of procurement professionals. Finally, levels of consortium expenditure and cost savings are estimated from the published statistical record, which readily demonstrate in financial terms the efficiency of the consortial purchase model for all types of library in the United Kingdom. Section 4 presents the results of a survey of suppliers to libraries in the United Kingdom of books and periodicals, the two sectors most commonly represented in current contracts of library purchasing consortia. It sets out in some detail the operating context governing the highly segmented activities of library booksellers, as well as that pertaining to periodicals suppliers (also known as subscription agents). Detailed responses to questions on the effects of library purchasing consortia on suppliers of both materials have been gathered by questionnaire survey and selected follow-up interviews. Results are presented and analysed according to supply sector with attention given to the tendering process, current contracts under way, cross-sectoral clientele, and advantages and inhibitors of consortia supply. Further responses are reported on issues of how consortia have affected suppliers’ volume of trade, operating margins and market stability as perceived in their own business, the library supply sector and the publishing industry. Finally, overall conclusions are drawn and projections made as to future implications for both types of library suppliers. Section 5 synthesises findings, details enabling and inhibiting factors for consortia formation and models of best practice amongst consortia. The scope for cross-sectoral collaboration is discussed and found to be limited at present. Pointers are given for future activity. ...|$|E
40|$|On any {{election}} day, interested citizens want to {{know one}} thing [...] who won. News organizations {{are in the business}} of getting accurate results to !heir audience as quickly as possible. but counting actual votes takes hours, and sometimes days. Beginning in the early 1960 s, news organizations developed ways of projecting the outcome of races in order to speed the process of reporting before votes were actually counted. They began to develop methods and systems of modeling and polling that could indicate, statistically, the likely winner in any given race. The motive was to give the audience what it wanted [...] the faster, the better. Of course, the news media intended to make their projections as accurate as possible. In time, polling and analysis became increasingly sophisticated. Results from preelection samples, along with extrapolations from precinct models, exit polls. and partial election returns, were combined into what I will refer to as the networks' election-day polling and projection system. This system provided the basis for making election projections faster and better, meaning with fewer mistakes. Year after year, the systems were improved, spurred on by competition among the news organizations to be the first to report outcomes to their audiences. Not incidentally, the highly competitive polling and projection business grew increasingly costly. In 1990. the first network pool for exit polling and projections, Voter Research and Surveys (VRS), was formed with the intention to meet the increasing costs and share expenses. Cost sharing made it possible for the networks to provide the greatest sweep of polling. Without the pool, the networks would have had to restrict their reach and coverage because of budget limitations. Of course, in journalistic terms, pooling meant the information would be less re liable. While the networks could, by combining resources, undertake larger polling operations and more sophisticated modeling that could reduce the risk of certain types of error, the vulnerability of the networks to any errors that did result was increased. When data are wrong, with only one source of information, there is no opportunity for correction. Nevertheless, financial considerations trumped reliability [...] and the best practices of journalism. By election day 2000, after several permutations, a comprehensive polling and projection system was in place backed by a consortium of five television networks and the Associated Press. Its purpose was to collect and disseminate polling data and voting information by which news organizations could make their independent calls, maintaining an element of competition among them. In thinking about this system in its entirety, we must consider not only the Voter News Service (VNS), the reconstituted <b>consortium</b> <b>operation,</b> but also the analysis and reporting operations of the separate networks as well. The system was economical. and it was fast. But was it accurate? The answer: not as accurate or as reliable as it was intended, promised, or needed to be, especially when it came to calling a very close race. We learned that answer on election night 2000. At the core of the reporting problem were two mistaken projections in one state, Florida, which turned out to be key to the outcome of the national election. The television networks and other news outlets twice projected the winner and twice recalled those projections. News executives, particularly television news executives, as well as editors, correspondents, and producers themselves described election-night coverage as a "debacle," a "disaster," and a "fiasco. " Something had gone wrong [...] terribly wrong [...] in the polling and projection system. It is not the purpose of this article to ferret out the exact sources of the errors on that night. The experiences of election night 2000 do, however, serve as a useful lens through which to examine the overall efficacy of the system that was in place. It is my contention that this system is too fraught with the potential for error for news organizations to rely on its projections in the way that they have in the recent past...|$|E

40|$|The Integrated Medical Model (IMM) was {{designed}} to forecast relative changes for a specified set of crew health and mission success risk metrics by using a probabilistic (stochastic process) model based on historical data, cohort data, and subject matter expert opinion. A probabilistic approach is taken since exact (deterministic) results would not appropriately reflect the uncertainty in the IMM inputs. Once the IMM was conceptualized, a plan was needed to rigorously assess input information, framework and code, and output results of the IMM, and ensure that end user requests and requirements were considered during all stages of model development and implementation.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the relations between}} form and norm in the materialization of the cities and the pragmatic contemporary urbanism, in its most commonly discussed mode: the urban project. The urban project is here understood as the mediating elements of urban transformation, which today lack theorization and instrumentalities in the Brazilian context. Through the dialectic relation between theoretical discourse and empirical observation, the materialization of the contemporary city is discussed, {{by means of the}} conceptual figures Definition, Induction, and Improvisation, which relate to processes triggered by regulations. The floodplain of Tietê, between Lapa and Barra Funda, located in the west region of the city, between the river and the rail, is used as an empiric object, a site which generated the theoretical reflections and was evaluated as in its historic materialization as in its contemporary redevelopment. The work offers a spatial historiography of the site´s materialization, by means of the elaboration of conceptual formal figures, which guided the historic materialization process, and evaluates the contemporary materialization, guided by the instrument Urban Operation, conceived to promote urban projects in the city. Departing from the thesis that there is no urbanistic instrument that places the project and urban design as the mediating and articulating element in the Brazilian public policy on urban development today, yet some level of design, or definitions that design involves, is necessary, avoiding predatory processes in the city´s materialization. Contemporary urban projects have to incorporate urban design strategies in its conception in order to materialize according to socially agreed goals. Thus, the present research {{discusses the}} contemporary role of the urban project and urban design in the materialization of São Paulo. INTRODUCTION	 46 1.

40|$|Lipids are a {{group of}} organic {{pollutants}} whose conversion into biogas has been considered very difficult. During the anaerobic treatment of lipid-rich wastewater this conversion generally decreases {{with the increase of}} the organic loading rate (OLR) applied, due to long chain fatty acids (LCFA) accumulation. To overcome this problem, correct equilibrium between LCFA accumulation and degradation should be assured [1, 2, 3], and discontinuous operation was proposed by Pereira et al. [1] as a strategy to achieve an efficient rate of methane production. Based on these results, Cavaleiro et al.

Acclimation was performed through discontinuous operation in a lab scale reactor. During the experiment, the OLR applied was gradually increased from 5 to 31 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1, by decreasing the hydraulic retention time. From 5 to 21 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1 the increase of the OLR was followed by a fast increase of the methane production rate, towards an average value that was directly related with the OLR, showing that there was no inhibition of the anaerobic consortium. However, when the OLR was increased to 26 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1, methane production rate fluctuated around the same average value as in the previous period (16 kgCOD-CH 4 m- 3 day- 1). For 31 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1, methane production rate tended to decrease, possibly due to microbial inhibition or mass transfer limitations. From 21 to 31 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1 methane production rate was very instable, indicating that the OLR applied were higher than the optimum value for the microbial community. Maximum methane yield (100 %) was obtained for the OLR of 12 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1, but continuous anaerobic treatment of an OLR as high as 21 kgCOD m- 3 day- 1 was possible with a methane yield of 72 % and average COD removal efficiency of 99 %. Nevertheless, 16 kgCOD-CH 4 m- 3 day- 1 is likely the optimum OLR to be applied, in order to optimize methane production.
