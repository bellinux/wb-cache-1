He {{graduated}} in from a local worker's school in 1926, and in 1931 from the Kiev Technological Institute of Food Industry. He {{became a member of the}} All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1930. Like his friend and ally Andrei Kirilenko, Podgorny climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder (delivering the production goals set by the bureaucrats in charge of the <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy).</b> By 1953 he had become Second Secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. After Anastas Mikoyan's resignation, Podgorny was voted into office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After Premier Alexei Kosygin's fall from favour Podgorny became the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union until his removal as head of state in 1977.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} took major steps {{to introduce a}} Stalinist-style <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy</b> in 1946. It nationalized all industries, transformed foreign trade into a government monopoly, brought almost all domestic trade under state control, and banned land sales and transfers. Planners at the newly founded Economic Planning Commission emphasized industrial development and in 1947 the government introduced the Soviet cost-accounting system.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Slovak Republic in January 1993, Slovakia has undergone a transition from a <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy</b> to a free market economy, a process which some observers were to believe was slowed in the 1994–98 period due to the crony capitalism and other fiscal policies of Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar's government. While economic growth and other fundamentals improved steadily during Mečiar's term, public and private debt and trade deficits also rose, and privatization was uneven. Real annual GDP growth peaked at 6.5% in 1995 but declined to 1.3% in 1999.|$|E

25|$|Fueled {{by large}} infusions of Western credit, Poland's {{economic}} growth rate {{was one of}} the world's highest {{during the first half of}} the 1970s, but much of the borrowed capital was misspent, and the <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy</b> was unable to use the new resources effectively. The 1973 oil crisis caused recession and high interest rates in the West, to which the Polish government had to respond with sharp domestic consumer price increases. The growing debt burden became insupportable in the late 1970s, and negative economic growth set in by 1979.|$|E
25|$|At the {{milestone}} Third Plenum of the National Party Congress's 11th Central Committee {{which opened}} on December 22, 1978, the party leaders decided {{to undertake a}} program of gradual but fundamental reform of the economic system. They concluded that the Maoist version of the <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy</b> had failed to produce efficient economic growth and had caused China to fall far behind not only the industrialized nations of the West but also the new industrial powers of Asia: Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. In the late 1970s, while Japan and Hong Kong rivaled European countries in modern technology, China's citizens had {{to make do with}} barely sufficient food supplies, rationed clothing, inadequate housing, and a service sector that was inadequate and inefficient. All of these shortcomings embarrassed China internationally.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union had {{its roots}} in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had {{replaced}} Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism–Leninism (which he created) and initiated a <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy</b> which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period of totalitarian rule, political paranoia fermented; the late-1930s Great Purge removed Stalin's opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people, resulting in an estimated 600,000 deaths. Suppression of political critics, forced labor and famines were carried out by Stalin's government; in 1933, a major famine struck Soviet Ukraine, causing the deaths of some 3 to 7 million people.|$|E

30|$|To use the {{terminology}} of classical growth theory, {{the period of}} socialism put the transition countries (TEs) off the path of “convergence” with, or “catching up” to, the mature or developed market economies (DMEs). The gap in per capita output between <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economies</b> and mature market economies stopped closing in the 1970 s and 1980 s. The underperformance of the <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economies</b> was a key factor that triggered the dissatisfaction with central planning and market socialism and the move from plan to market in Central and Eastern Europe and the former USSR. The expectation was that the return to the market would put these countries onto a growth path that would lead eventually to convergence with the mature market economies operating at the world technological frontier.|$|R
40|$|It has {{generally}} been assumed that the inferences of the induced technical change model {{with respect to the}} direction of technical change could not be expected to hold for the <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economies.</b> In this paper we test three hypotheses generated from the induced technical change hypotheses against the experience of <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> economies: (a) if land becomes increasingly scarce new technology will be biased in a land-saving direction; (b) if labor becomes increasingly scarce new technology will be biased in a laborsaving direction; and (c) changes in the land-labor ratio have been induced by changes in relative factor endowments. The results suggest a bias toward mechanical and against biological technology regardless of factor endowments. This is consistent with the well known ideological or policy bias in a number of <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economies</b> toward a capital intensive development strategy.

2500|$|Starting {{from the}} late 1920s with a <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy,</b> Ukraine was {{involved}} in Soviet industrialisation and the republic's industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s. The peasantry suffered from the programme of collectivisation of agriculture which began during and {{was part of the}} first five-year plan and was enforced by regular troops and secret police. Those who resisted were arrested and deported and agricultural productivity greatly declined. As members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met, millions starved to death in a famine known as the Holodomor or the [...] "Great Famine".|$|E
2500|$|In the Soviet Union, Taylorism was {{advocated}} by Aleksei Gastev and nauchnaia organizatsia truda (the movement {{for the scientific}} organisation of labor). It found support in both Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five Year Plan and the <b>centrally</b> <b>planned</b> <b>economy</b> can be traced directly {{to the influence of}} Taylorism on Soviet thinking.
