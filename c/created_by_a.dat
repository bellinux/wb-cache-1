5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It was bright enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E

5|$|Although Alabama officially did not {{participate}} {{as part of the}} 1943 college football season, a team composed of 17-year old and draft deferred students was organized as the Alabama Informals in October 1943. Not officially sanctioned by the University, the Informals were allowed to utilize both equipment and the facilities of the Crimson Tide. The team was led by head coach Mitchell Olenski, and John Gresham and Al Alois served as assistant coaches.

5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely <b>created</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E
