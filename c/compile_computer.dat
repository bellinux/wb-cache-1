The radial consolidation in unsaturated soils is studied {{on the basis of}} the framework of Fredlund's one dimensional consolidation theory. Then differential quadrature method (DQM) is employed to obtain the solution. Finally, the average degree of consolidation for the water and air, variation of excess pore-water pressure at different radius with time factor are presented. It is found that the solutions of DQM are accurate and stable. DQM is easy to <b>compile</b> <b>computer</b> programs when considering uniform initial pore-water distribution condition...|$|E

2500|$|Compilers {{are used}} to {{translate}} source code from a programming language into either object code or machine code. [...] Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the central processing unit's native instructions, ready for execution. <b>Compiled</b> <b>computer</b> programs are {{commonly referred to as}} executables, binary images, or simply as binaries– a reference to the binary file format used to store the executable code.|$|R
25|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another {{disadvantage of}} interpreters is an interpreter must be {{present on the}} executing <b>computer.</b> By contrast, <b>compiled</b> <b>computer</b> programs need no compiler present during execution.|$|R
50|$|Head {{and body}} of a {{dictionary}} entry are treated separately because {{they may not be}} contiguous. For example, when a Forth program is recompiled for a new platform, the head may remain on the <b>compiling</b> <b>computer,</b> while the body goes to the new platform. In some environments (such as embedded systems) the heads occupy memory unnecessarily. However, some cross-compilers may put heads in the target if the target itself is expected to support an interactive Forth.|$|R
50|$|Binary {{files are}} usually {{thought of as}} being a {{sequence}} of bytes, which means the binary digits (bits) are grouped in eights. Binary files typically contain bytes that are intended to be interpreted as something other than text characters. <b>Compiled</b> <b>computer</b> programs are typical examples; indeed, compiled applications are sometimes referred to, particularly by programmers, as binaries. But binary files can also mean that they contain images, sounds, compressed versions of other files, etc.—in short, any type of file content whatsoever.|$|R

50|$|A fully {{featured}} Forth system with all source code will compile itself, a technique commonly called meta-compilation by Forth programmers (although the term doesn't exactly match meta-compilation {{as it is}} normally defined). The usual method is to redefine the handful of words that place compiled bits into memory. The compiler's words use specially named versions of fetch and store that can be redirected to a buffer area in memory. The buffer area simulates or accesses a memory area beginning at a different address than the code buffer. Such compilers define words to access both the target computer's memory, and the host (<b>compiling)</b> <b>computer's</b> memory.|$|R

50|$|Numerous {{variations}} of such compilers exist for different environments. For embedded systems, the code may instead be written to another computer, a technique known as cross compilation, over a serial port {{or even a}} single TTL bit, while keeping the word names and other non-executing parts of the dictionary in the original <b>compiling</b> <b>computer.</b> The minimum definitions for such a Forth compiler are the words that fetch and store a byte, and the word that commands a Forth word to be executed. Often the most time-consuming part of writing a remote port is constructing the initial program to implement fetch, store and execute, but many modern microprocessors have integrated debugging features (such as the Motorola CPU32) that eliminate this task.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} initial {{development of}} an interactive simulation for training Operational Logistics students {{in the management of}} Naval Operational Logistics. The model is designed with a modular architecture, enabling the flexibility to upgrade or modify selected components without altering the rest of the simulation. The simulation is implemented in the Java programming language, allowing the model to run on all major operating systems. The major components of the model include a discrete event simulation, a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and controller classes that connect the two. These controller classes pass user commands to the non-visual simulation for execution and information from the simulation to the GUI for display. Data required by the non-visual simulation is inputted from a separate database and configuration files. This feature allows the simulation to run different scenarios with distinct maps and graphics with no modification to the <b>compiled</b> <b>computer</b> code. The simulation and data structure developed in this thesis provide a solid foundation for further expansion into a fully featured interactive naval logistics training simulation. U. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, robot dynamic {{computational}} algorithms have been steadily improved. Lagrangian[1] and Newton-Euler [2, 3] recursive numerical algorithms, Horak’s mixed calculation[4], Lisp symbolic derivation of the robot closed form equations[5, 6] and recently, customized computing algorithms[7, 9] {{have been important}} stages towards more efficient procedures. Nevertheless, the still existing high computational loads, have prevented the industrial application of such algorithms. A new robot computational system, which overcomes those limitations, is presented. This system is motivated by the following considerations: - Symbolic formulae pose a high computational burden, due to {{the large number of}} arithmetic and transcendental computations. – These computations, usually performed at a high level <b>compiled</b> <b>computer</b> language are complex, namely, they are compiled to a large number of the microprocessor’s machine code instructions. – Those computations must be performed with very high precision, in order to reduce problems with finite precision arithmetics, a large word lengh is required. – There are two situations, as far as precision is concerned: the computer internal representation having very high precision contrasting with the computer interface to the outside world, usually consisting of 8 to 16 bit precision. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|Computer {{scientists}} and practitioners have {{a wealth of}} algorithms at their disposal for enterprises such as sorting and searching lists of numbers, <b>compiling</b> <b>computer</b> programs, and enabling machines to learn to perform tasks, just to name several. The purposes of these algorithms are broad in nature yet generally are task-driven and analytic/scientific. We are using these algorithms in unconventional, artistic ways, to generate new computer music. We outline several ideas for using algorithms in new ways and have several short compositions available that exemplify this notion. Generating Sound Grains using Sorting and Searching We have used the bubble sort, the quick sort and the binary search as methods of algorithmic granular synthesis. Algorithmic granular synthesis is a method in which computer algorithms manipulate small “grains ” of sound. These grains can vary in duration from the shortest duration that can be distinguished by the human ear to, say, 1 second. Many, many grains combined make up a new sound wave or a song. Grains may be separated by silence or may overlap to a small or large degree. Granular synthesis is a broad term {{within the field of}} computer music in that a variety of techniques are used to achieve it. Some techniques manipulate sound in the time domain and others manipulate it in the frequency domain. At present we us...|$|R
