40|$|The {{annealing}} process {{is one of}} the important operations in production of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> steel sheets, which significantly influences the final product quality of cold rolling mills.

Modelling of annealing process can be done by using of thermal models. In this paper, Modelling of steel annealing process is proposed by using data mining techniques. The main advantages of modelling with data mining techniques are: high speed in data processing, acceptable accuracy in obtained results and simplicity in using of this method.

After being reduced in the direct reduction (DR) plant and removed of oxygen, pellets are converted to (sponge iron). Sponge iron and iron scrap is melted in electric arc furnaces, after which liquid steel is purified in secondary purification units. The steel’s chemical compound is designed by customer demand. Then, it is transported to casting machines for slab production. After cooling, slab is rolled at the hot rolling mill, creating hot coils (thickness: 1.5-16 mm). Some are sold; others {{go to the}} hot finishing mill for complementary work and hot sheet transformation or the cold rolling mill to lower strip thickness to 0.18 mm. <b>Cold</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>coils</b> are also dedicated for the tinning, galvanizing, and prepainting lines.|$|R

40|$|Ridge-buckle {{defects in}} <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> thin strip {{originate}} from {{the formation of}} ridges in hot <b>rolled</b> <b>coil</b> and corresponding ridges left in the strip following annealing, cold rolling and tempering. A numerical solution was developed to calculate three-dimensional stress distribution in a wound coil built up wrap-by-wrap and subsequent flatness change in the uncoiled product. The model takes into account both nonlinear compressible characteristic of interwrap layer and uneven strip profile, especially ridges, on the stress evolution during the coiling process. The sensitivity of ridge-buckle defects in <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> thin strip to ridges in hot <b>rolled</b> <b>coil</b> profile has been investigated in details. The {{results show that the}} ridge-buckle defects in tin plate are much dependent on the height, width and location of ridges in hot coil profile.

40|$|The {{target to}} be {{achieved}} through this project was primarily aimed at detecting the surface defects belonging to different classes in <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> steel <b>coils.</b> This was achieved through grabbing the images from the camera, here line scan camera is used which grabs 20 frames per second. Carrying out defect detection on these images and later classifying them. We present a method to automatically detect and localize defects occurring on the surface. Defect regions are segmented from background images using their distinguishing texture characteristics. This method locates candidate defect regions directly in the DCT (Discrete cosine transform) domain using the intensity variation information encoded in the DCT coefficients. More precisely, defect detection employs DCT analysis of each individual non-overlapping region of the image to determine potentially defective blocks, which are further grown and merged to form a defect region on the image. In this thesis a computer vision based, a framework for steel surface defects detection and classification of <b>cold</b> <b>rolled</b> steel strips is implemented. We have designed online classifier for automatic defect detection and classification of defects. In this we measured statistical textural features using gray level co-occurrence matrix presented by Haralick and geometrical features are also calculated. The final decision SVM (Support Vector Machine) handles the problem of classification of the defect types. We also proposed SVM voting strategy for the final decision that handles the problem of multiple outputs of a given input image with a specific defect type. In addition, this approach improves the classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method on steel surface defects detection and classification. In addition, the defect information is encoded in the image. An image viewer application is designed for decoding the defect information...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The common {{transportation}} {{methods for}} the consumers of the ironwork {{such as the}} steel <b>roll</b> <b>coils</b> manufactured from the steelworks were either by the land transportation or the sea transportation. In order to transport the steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> effectively and safely to the destination, {{the stability of the}} steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> which induced the minimum movements during the transportation was strongly required. The basic transportation equipment for the steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> such as the dunnage is made of 100 % imported wood known as the apitong. However, the material characteristic such as the rigidity has caused permanent damages to the steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> and the damaged steel <b>roll</b> <b>coils</b> were not easily restorable thus they were unsuitable for other purposes. Therefore, the introduction of new materials manufacturing dunnages which would have a good recovery performance and thus enable the damage prevention or reduction to the steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> or any other products during the transportation is needed. This investigation was to develop the new and improved type of a dunnage from observing the current dunnage in the following areas; the array or the types of reinforcements that established the construction of the dunnage, the dunnage forming shapes of a rectangle and a trapezoid, the direct impacts to dunnage in the presence of vibration when the carrier was moving and stopping, and the critical impact to the dunnage due to the edge loading. Ultimately, the development of new type of dunnage that consisted of characteristics being soft and recoverable than the existing apitong dunnage and induces little or no damages to the steel <b>roll</b> <b>coils</b> are required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ironwork, {{especially}} steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil,</b> {{is usually}} {{transported to the}} customers over land or by sea. For fast and safe transportation of steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> without damaging it, {{it is necessary that}} steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil</b> is surely fixed. These days, apitong, which is fully imported from abroad, is being used to fix the steel <b>roll</b> <b>coil.</b> However, because of apitong harshness, it often damages the coil that would be hard to fix. Recovering damaged coil is almost impossible, and we have to look for a new type of dunnage, which would be able to substitute apitong. This paper discusses various types of reinforcement, as well as rectangular and trapezoid dunnages. We will consider how rolling occurs and what happens when the carrier starts and stops moving. Thus, {{it will be possible to}} design a dunnage, which would not damage ironwork and had better recovery and softness than the existing apitong...|$|R
