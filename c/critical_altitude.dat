25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power is the <b>critical</b> <b>altitude.</b> When the aircraft climbs above the <b>critical</b> <b>altitude,</b> engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E

40|$|Deorbiting {{performance}} of 200 -kg class satellites from different <b>critical</b> <b>altitudes</b> and inclinations using bare electrodynamic tape tethers is discussed. The study leads {{from the recent}} interest of several companies worldwide in building of mega-constellations composed of hundreds of microsatellites. Using as input the limited {{information that can be}} presently found in open sources, three representative mission scenarios for mega-constellations are studied in this paper considering a constant satellite mass of 200 kg. In the first step, an optimized tether geometry is found using the BETsMA optimization software assuming the spacecraft mass, the starting altitude, and the orbital inclination as inputs. The output of this phase is the conductive tether length, width, and thickness and an estimated cut probability due to hypervelocity impacts during deorbiting. In a second step, the system configuration is further refined by means of extensive numerical simulation campaigns performed with the Flexible Tether Simulator for electrodynamic tethers software that models the tape tether with a discrete number of lumped masses. This accurate simulation code take into consideration both tether longitudinal and lateral modes of vibration and employs the latest Earth magnetic field, ionospheric electron density, and atmospheric models to simulate a realistic in-orbit environment. Moreover, it enables the simulation of tether motion control strategies {{that can be used to}} increase the system reliability and efficiency. The final goal of this study is to find a comparatively light system configurations that can perform a complete deorbit of a 200 -kg microsatellite in the shortest possible time from different starting altitude and inclinations.

40|$|Abstract: The low {{atmospheric}} pressure and low oxygen content in high-altitude environment have great {{impacts on the}} functions of human body.

Artificial oxygen supply is required to ensure {{health and safety of}} construction personnel in hypoxic environments. However, there are no provisions for oxygen supply standard for tunnel construction personnel in high-altitude areas in current tunnel construction specifications. As a result, this paper has theoretically studied the impacts of high-altitude environment on human bodies, analyzed the relationship between labor intensity and oxygen consumption in high-altitude areas and determined the <b>critical</b> oxygen-supply <b>altitude</b> values for tunnel construction based on two different standard evaluation systems, i. e., variation of air density and equivalent PIO 2.

30|$|The {{observations}} {{revealed the}} {{spatial and temporal}} properties for the wave, but with a distinct tendency toward preferential directions of motion which varied from month to month. The apparent asymmetry in the propagation headings of the gravity waves {{is due to the}} presence of critical layers, which can occur at any height level where the horizontal wave vector equals the horizontal phase velocity and the intrinsic frequency is Doppler-shifted to zero. A horizontal surface region can be constructed at the critical layer height to obtain a polar plot (“a blocking diagram”) showing the range of azimuthal angles and speeds of gravity waves that are blocked from further upward propagation (Ryan, 1991). Gravity waves with horizontal phase speeds and directions within this region would encounter heavy absorption from a large number of diverse and relatively unstructured mechanisms (Booker and Bretherton, 1967; Hazel, 1967; Jones, 1968; Fritts and Geller, 1976; Fritts, 1978; He et al., 1990) as they approach the critical layer.

40|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus is a <b>critical</b> {{range of}} <b>altitudes</b> in which complex temperature variability {{has been extensively}} studied by the space mission Venus Express (Vex) during its eight-years mission (2006 - 2014). Data collected at different epochs and latitudes show evidence of short and medium timescale variability as well as latitudinal differences. Spatial and temporal variability is also predicted in mesospheric and thermosphere terminator models with lower boundary conditions at 70 km near cloud tops. The Venus transit on June 5 - 6 2012 {{was the first to}} occur with a spacecraft in orbit around Venus. It has been shown that sunlight refraction in the mesosphere of Venus is able to provide useful constraints on mesospheric temperatures {{at the time of the}} transit. The European Space Agency's Venus Express provided space-based observations of Venus during the transit. Simultaneously, the Venus aureole photometry was observed using ground-based facilities and solar telescopes orbiting Earth (NASA Solar Dynamic Observatory, JAXA HINODE). As the properties of spatial and temporal variability of the mesosphere are still debated, the opportunity of observing it at all latitudes at the same time, offered by the transit, is rather unique. In this first paper, we establish new methods for analyzing the photometry of the so-called aureole that is produced by refraction of the solar light, and we investigate the choice of physical models that best reproduce the observations.

40|$|In this research, {{we studied}} the marine flood {{risk of the}} Cagliari plain in {{relation}} to the depressed coastal area, which includes a zone of the extremely high population density (almost half of the population of Sardinia) and major industrial infrastructures. The <b>critical</b> inundation <b>altitudes</b> in the Cagliari plain occur well above the average sea level, as demonstrated by the fact that, during meteorological -marine events with SW and SE winds, the normal and extreme meteorological tides reach heights of approximately + 1. 0 m in the Santa Gilla coastline and “high water” of + 1. 5 m on the Santa Gilla lagoon, located in the western sector of the plain. In order to analyze the way the lagoon fills in and to recognise any active subsidence processes the research was concentrated across the entrance of the lagoon using the stratigraphic-sedimentological facies of the information contained in three continuous boreholes. The mouth of the lagoon is a covered palaeo-riverbed that formed during the last glacial stage {{at the time of the}} LGM low stand (MIS 2). The geometries of the different stratigraphic facies and their relative depositional paleo-environments related to the Holocene sea level rise have been reconstructed. AMS Radiocarbon dating allows the start of the lagoon’s filling processes to be placed immediately before 9, 6 ky BP, with the deposition of paralic sandy muds upon the gravels of the lower fluvial terrace. The filling processes were followed by a marine inundation, marked by muddy onshore beach sands with Posidonia oceanica. This took place 7, 4 ka BP and is identified by alternations of fine and coarse sediments that prove the closing and opening of the ancient lagoon mouth. Fine gravels and coarse-medium sands indicate a period of significant opening of the lagoon during the Upper Atlantic-Sub Boreal stage (4, 0 ka BP), followed by a sedimentation of organic rich deposits from the Sub-Atlantic to Present. The study of the thanatocoenosis, mainly composed of Gastropods and Bivalves, precisely highlights the paleo-geographical evolution of the plain and the passages between paralic and marine-littoral and lagoon environments. The living environment of the lagoonal dated organisms, with an error bar of ± 1. 5 m, (I don’t understand this) allows a precise reconstruction of the sea level rise with a minimum margin of error. The comparison of the predicted sea level curves calculated for the Cagliari Plain with the observed data, indicates good agreement as is consistent with an absence of vertical land movements other than those caused by glacio-hydro isostasy. The Upper Pleistocene-Holocene relative tectonic stability of the plain is also demonstrated by geo-archaeological data; and by the evolution of the fault slope deposit system of the western border of the plain. However, subsidence may have occurred after 5 ka BP, at a rate of 0. 8 ± 0. 02 mm yr- 1, and this is interpreted as a consequence of compression of the holocene deposits (Posidonia oceanica peats). ...|$|R
40|$|Rice is a {{major source}} of food for more than 2. 7 billion people and planted on nearly 130 million {{hectares}} in which 10 % is subjected to low temperature problems. Dry season (DS) rice cropping has been expanding in the high altitude lands in Asia and the low temperature is one of constraints to rice production. This study aims to quantify the potential for growing irrigated rice in DS, particularly in high altitude areas in northern Lao PDR where temperatures are low and pose problems for seedling establishment. Research focused on identifying sowing times to avoid the detrimental effects of low temperature, the optimal seedling age for transplanting, the potential of plastic covers and half burnt paddy husk layer to protect nursery seedbeds from low temperature and varieties suitable for this environment. Studies were conducted over 5 years and were examined at six locations. In two locations, where temperature was favorable for rice production throughout the DS, time of sowing was not <b>critical.</b> In higher <b>altitude</b> areas in northern Lao PDR, however, low temperature caused establishment problems in nurseries. In these areas, mid-November sowing before the onset of winter reduced the low temperature effects on seedling establishment while sowing in mid winter (December and January) increased the risk of failure. There were no significant effects of seedling age (25 -, 35 - and 45 -day old) for transplanting on yield for DS rice. Using clear plastic to cover the nursery increased minimum temperatures on average by about 4 degrees C, which improved seedling growth and resulted in higher grain yield. The mean minimum temperature of 12 degrees C for 30 days after seeding is critical and temperature below 12 degrees C resulted in high risk of crop failure due to poor germination, poor seedling growth or insufficient seedlings. Rice needs to be sown at times where the mean minimum temperature exceeds 12 degrees C or plastic covers are required to protect seedlings.

Fuel cell powered aircraft are generally characterised by a low {{power to weight ratio}} (W/kg). The propulsion system of an unmanned aircraft needs a large range of power and fast response to fulfil the requirements of different flight phases and to balance the variations in the load demand. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is considered as a potential power source for high altitude UAS (unmanned aircraft systems) operations. At altitudes in excess of 10 km, very low atmospheric temperatures and pressures, and unexpected variations in the load demand put severe stresses on the operation and performance of PEM fuel cells. A stable and robust controller and fuel supply system that can provide fast and sufficient flow of hydrogen and air/oxygen to the reaction of the fuel cell is one of the critical objectives. In this research, a simplified mathematical model of the PEM fuel cell stack system is developed and validated with the commercially available 1 kW PEM fuel cell stack (H- 1000) developed by Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies. Matlab-Simulink is used to implement the necessary design and simulations under various operational conditions. The implications of high altitudes on the operation and performance of a PEM fuel cell stack are investigated, and a PID controller is adopted to efficiently optimise and provide a sufficient flow of hydrogen and air/oxygen to the stack, in particular maintaining the flow rates of the reactants was deemed most <b>critical</b> at high <b>altitudes</b> operation. Also, in order to store the required oxygen and hydrogen, the design of storage vessels is considered. This research presents a design of a PEM fuel cell power system for unmanned aircraft systems with an integrated approach that enables estimation of required power for high altitudes UAS operation which is then used to determine the size and weight of the combined power-plant of fuel cell stack with hydrogen and air/oxygen vessels and the propulsion system of the UAS. This approach takes into the consideration the power capacity of fuel cell stack and the flight endurance as two main factors in designing the size and weight of storage vessels, and hence determining the overall weight of the UAS, which is a key requirement in the preliminary aircraft design phase. One of the research outcomes shows a potential in extending the flying duration and altitude for more than five hours and a half, reaching up to 11 km altitude, for a UAS with an overall weight of 32 kg, including a payload capacity of 2 kg, based on a 1 kW PEM fuel cell propulsion system...|$|R
