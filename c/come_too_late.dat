5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With no warning system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force and its own small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would <b>come</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to cover this period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of further testing, {{it was found that}} the Hurricane had poor spin {{recovery}} characteristics, in which all rudder authority could be lost due to shielding of the rudder. Hawker's response to the issue was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request; the situation was resolved by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), who established that the aerodynamic problem had been caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery had <b>come</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for the changes to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but were introduced upon the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Joseph Maddrey, [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] shares themes {{with his}} more famous {{conversion}} poem [...] "Ash Wednesday", the first parts of which Eliot was writing when [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] was written and published. Eliot uses the biblical story of Simeon {{to illustrate the}} [...] "contrast between appearance and reality and humbly begs God to teach him the stillness that unifies the two". Eliot's Ariel poems and [...] "Ash Wednesday" [...] explore this new experience of conversion and {{the progress of the}} soul. Scofield writes that Eliot's depiction of Simeon presents [...] "a figure to whom revelation has been granted but to whom it has <b>come</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for this life". [...] But as he awaits the death for which he asks, Simeon sees the consequences of the turning of faith to this new child and his mission. Simeon wants nothing of this [...] "time of sorrow" [...] and that the fate of persecution for the consequences of faith is not for him.|$|E
