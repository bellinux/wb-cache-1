40|$|The coelomocytes of Caenorhabditis elegans are {{scavenger}} cells that continuously and nonspecifically endocytose fluid from the pseudocoelom (body cavity). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) secreted into the pseudocoelom from body wall muscle cells is endocytosed and degraded by coelomocytes. We show that toxin-mediated ablation of coelomocytes results in viable animals {{that fail to}} endocytose pseudocoelomic GFP, indicating that endocytosis by coelomocytes is not essential for growth or survival of C. elegans under normal laboratory conditions. We examined known viable endocytosis mutants, and performed RNAi for other known endocytosis genes, for coelomocyte uptake defective (Cup) phenotypes. We also screened for new genes involved in endocytosis by isolating viable mutants with <b>Cup</b> defects; this <b>screen</b> identified 14 different genes, many with multiple alleles. A variety of Cup terminal phenotypes were observed, consistent with defects at various steps in the endocytic pathway. Available molecular information indicates that the <b>Cup</b> mutant <b>screen</b> has identified novel components of the endocytosis machinery that are conserved in mammals but not in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the only other organism for which large-scale genetic screens for endocytosis mutants have been performed...|$|R

Here, {{we describe the}} planula of a box jellyfish, Tripedalia cystophora, and report that these larvae have an extremely simple organization with no nervous system at all. Their only advanced feature {{is the presence of}} 10 - 15 pigment-cup ocelli, evenly spaced across the posterior half of the larval ectoderm. The ocelli are single cell structures containing a <b>cup</b> of <b>screening</b> pigment filled with presumably photosensory microvilli. These rhabdomeric photoreceptors have no neural connections to any other cells, but each has a well-developed motor-cilium, appearing to be the only means by which light can control the behaviour of the larva. The ocelli are thus self-contained sensory-motor entities, making a nervous system superfluous...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Beam {{destructive}} methods Nearly {{all modern}} storage rings use an electron cooling device {{to increase the}} phase space density of the circulating beam before its transfer to another accelerator or the experiments. For fast and efficient cooling, {{the properties of the}} electron and hadron beams need to be monitored before, during and after the cooling process. Probes inserted into the electron beam will in most cases immediately melt or evaporate. The power-density load is such that the absolute limit in the energy of the electron beam is 20 keV when one considers such methods. In fact 10 keV seems more realistic unless the electron beam is pulsed. In this paper we review the various techniques, both destructive and non-destructive, used to measure and optimise the different parameters that determine the quality of the cooling. Such devices also change the space-charge fields and self-fields of the electron beam resulting in measurements that may not necessarily reflect the real beam distribution. The current intersected by the probe is also an additional load on the high voltage power supply and hence can only be used at low electron beam currents. Faraday <b>cups,</b> scintillation <b>screens</b> and pinhole collimators The beam position and current density can be measured as a function of radial position and axial distance by the use of a water-cooled Faraday cup [2].

40|$|Urine {{drug testing}} is an {{important}} tool that is commonly used to assess patient compliance with prescription regimens. Point-of-collection immunoassay devices allow for timely availability of laboratory test results to guide therapy during the same office visit. Two waived immunoassay-based urine drug <b>screen</b> <b>cups</b> were eval-uated in this study. The NexScreen cup and the DrugCheck Waive RT cup claim to detect 10 – 12 drug classes of commonly used and/ or abused drugs. This study included a sensitivity and precision chal-lenge with 4 – 6 replicates at concentrations 0 – 150 % of the manu-facture’s claimed cutoff, using drug-free urine spiked with purified reference standards. The stability of test results was evaluated by reading the results at intervals between five and 1, 440 min. Specificity was evaluated by parallel comparison of pooled patients’ specimens, representing 56 patients and 41 known drug compounds. When comparing results to validated liquid chromatography– mass spectrometry results, false positives were observed in the NexScreen cups for benzodiazepine, methamphetamine, methadone, opiates and tricyclic antidepressant tests, {{but there were no}} false negatives. The DrugCheck Waive RT cups showed false negative results for barbiturates and opiates, but no false positives. Overall, the NexScreen cup demonstrated better sensitivity than claimed, whereas the sensitivity of the DrugCheck Waive RT cup did not meet claims...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} design, fabrication, {{and performance}} {{evaluation of a}} compact, single cell, X-band (∼ 9 GHz) electron injector based on a field emission cathode (FEC) are presented. A pulsed electron beam is generated by a 10 's of kW radiofrequency (RF) magnetron signal from a plug-in thin film nitrogen-incorporated ultrananocrystalline diamond (N) UNCD FEC cartridge. Testing of the X-band injector with the (N) UNCD FEC was conducted in a beamline equipped with a solenoid, Faraday <b>cup</b> and imaging <b>screen.</b> The results show that typically the (N) UNCD FEC cartridge produces ≳ 1 mA/cm^ 2 at a surface electric field of 28 MV/m. The diameter of the output beam generated from the 4. 4 mm diameter (N) UNCD cartridge can be as small as 1 mm. In terms of its practical applications, the demonstrated X-band electron injector with the (N) UNCD plug-in FEC {{can serve as a}} source for X-ray generation, materials processing, travelling-wave tubes (including GHz and THz backward wave oscillators), or can be used to drive slow-wave accelerating structures. The results presented also suggest that this field emitter technology based on planar (N) UNCD thin films, which are simply grown on the surface of optically polished stainless steel, can enable a vast number of device configurations that are efficient, flexible in design, and can be packaged with ease.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{assessed}} the field performance of compact growth coffee progenies {{developed by the}} MAPA/Procafé Foundation breeding program. An experiment was set up at the Procafé Foundation’s Experimental Station in Varginha, Minas Gerais state, using 20 progenies, 16 of which were resistant to leaf rust. The evaluations began {{two and a half}} years after planting in four repetitions, totalizing 80 plots, each one constituted by four coffee plants. The following characteristics were analyzed: the six first annual harvests (2002 to 2007), husk/bean ratio, <b>cup</b> quality and <b>screen</b> analysis. In the 2006 / 2007 annual harvest, crop yield and moca percentage were assessed and screen classification was done, while in the 2007 / 2008 harvest, sensorial classification was carried out. The Sabiá Tardio cv 398 presented the highest yield among all the progenies. The progenies of the Catucaí group (Catucaí Amarelo 24 / 137 (C. O), Catucaí Vermelho 24 / 137, Catucaí Vermelho 20 / 15 cv 476 and Catucaí Vermelho 19 / 18 cv 221), Sarchimor group (Obatã IAC- 1669 - 20, Tupi IAC 4093, Arara F 4), and IBC-Palma- 1 (3 - 12), Saíra cv 362, Topázio MG 1189 and Catuaí Amarelo IAC 74 presented good field performance and are recommended for the Varginha region.

40|$|Metal-on-metal hip {{resurfacing}} arthroplasty (MoMHRA) is {{an alternative}} treatment option to total hip arthroplasty (THA), especially in the young and active. Despite the early successful results, reports of adverse soft-tissue reactions around the MoMHRA have caused increased concern. These reactions have been termed pseudotumours and {{have been shown to}} be associated with increased wear. However, their incidence and aetiology is not known. The broad aims of this thesis were to 1) determine the clinical impact of pseudotumour; and 2) identify ways of reducing the risk of pseudotumour. The clinical impact was determined by examining the incidence and prevalence of pseudotumours needing revision and the subsequent outcome following revision. At the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, the 10 -year survival of the BHR, commonest MoMHRA used, was 87. 1 % (95 %CI: 83. 0 % to 91. 2 %) and the 10 -year incidence of revisions due to pseudotumour was 7. 5 % (95 %CI: 4. 3 % to 10. 7 %). In a prevalence study of two tertiary referral centres, pseudotumour was identified as the most common revision indication. An outcome based, case-control study characterised outcome following revision due to pseudotumour as inferior to that following revision for any other failure mode, and inferior to the outcome of matched primary THAs. The inferior outcome was associated with the extensive tissue damage at revision. Risk factors contributing to development of pseudotumour were found to be both patient and surgeon related. Patient factors significantly increasing risk included female gender and small component size. Case control studies demonstrated two surgical factors that were associated with significantly increased risk; cup malorientation and a reduction in head neck ratio (HNR) at operation particularly in females. Furthermore, evidence based recommendations were provided on optimum <b>cup</b> orientation and <b>screening</b> practice. Surgeons should aim for a radiographic cup inclination/anteversion zone of 45 °/ 20 ° ± 10 °. Patients with mal-positioned cups, those with high HNR prior to surgery, and those that had significant HNR reduction with the MoMHRA should be considered at increased risk of developing a pseudotumour. An ex vivo study demonstrated that the majority of pseudotumours occur due to high prosthesis wear, and result from an exaggerated innate response with an accompanying variable immune response. However a small but significant number of pseudotumours (20 %) were observed with low wear and a prominent immune response. Furthermore, the cups oriented within the optimum zone were associated with less wear. Hence, subsequent in vivo research focused on providing evidence-based guidance on how to achieve the target cup orientation and factors to consider in minimising the scatter in cup orientation observed following hip arthroplasty. This great scatter was mostly due to two factors: 1) the variability between surgeons at orientating a component at implantation and 2) the difference in the pelvic position between implantation and radiographic assessment. The angular offset was 5 ° for inclination and 8 ° for anteversion because of the different definitions at impaction and X-Ray. Surgeons should need to be aware of these factors. Greater amount of pelvic movement occurs during MoMHRA, in comparison to THA. To achieve the target MoMHRA cup orientation surgeons should implant the cup with an intra-operative inclination/anteversion of 40 °/ 30 °. It is concluded that pseudotumour following MoMHRA has a significant clinical impact. In order to minimise it, surgeons should appropriately select patients and optimise surgical technique to achieve optimum cup orientation and try to avoid reducing the native head neck ratio. Appreciation of risk factors for pseudotumour development (female gender, small size component, cup orientation, HNR reduction), would aid detection prior to extensive soft-tissue damage and improve inferior outcome associated with revision.
