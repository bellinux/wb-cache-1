50|$|Fuel cells rely on {{oxidation}} {{of organic}} compounds (or hydrogen) using catalysts. Catalytic heaters generate flameless heat from {{a supply of}} <b>combustible</b> <b>fuel</b> and oxygen from air as oxidant.|$|R
50|$|To {{increase}} safety, fire breathers {{must avoid}} highly <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> such as alcohol, spirit-based fuels, and most petrochemicals, instead using safer combustibles {{with a higher}} flash point (>50 °C). Due to its relatively safe (≈90 °C) flash point, paraffin, or highly purified lamp oil, is the preferred fuel for fire breathing. Although corn starch has been cited as a non-toxic fuel, the hazards of inhalation increase the potential risk of lung infections.|$|E
50|$|Medical procedures, such as {{diagnostic}} X-rays, nuclear medicine, {{and radiation}} therapy {{are by far}} the most significant source of human-made radiation exposure to the general public. Some of the major radionuclides used are I-131, Tc-99m, Co-60, Ir-192, and Cs-137. The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as tobacco (polonium-210), <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> (gas, coal, etc.), televisions, luminous watches and dials (tritium), airport X-ray systems, smoke detectors (americium), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles (thorium).|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of turbine engines as explained by Chrysler engineers were reduced maintenance, longer engine life expectancy, large development potential, overall parts reduction of approximately 80% (60 parts rather than 300)., requirements for tune ups nearly eliminated, low temperature starting difficulties eliminated and no warm up needed, antifreeze not required, interior heat is available instantly in winter, no engine stalling with sudden overload, engine operates without vibration, oil consumption is negligible, reduced engine weight, exhaust gases are cool and less pollutant, and most importantly, {{a wide range}} of <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> may be employed as a replacement for petroleum gasoline.|$|E

50|$|The operation, {{which was}} part of the 2010 Rio de Janeiro Security Crisis, was the State {{responding}} to drug traffickers setting buses and other vehicles on fire using <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels.</b> These attacks occurred in various neighborhoods throughout the city of Rio de Janeiro. The coordinated attack was in retaliation for the government setting up UPPs, Unidade de Policia pacificadora, Pacifying Police units within various favelas around Rio. This led to the expulsion of assorted armed drug traffickers, and tightened pressure upon criminal leaders in those favelas which continued outside the control of the State and its laws, such as the Complexo do Alemão.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{commercial}} {{application of}} explosives is mining. Whether the mine {{is on the}} surface or is buried underground, the detonation or deflagration of either a high or low explosive in a confined space {{can be used to}} liberate a fairly specific sub-volume of a brittle material in a much larger volume of the same or similar material. The mining industry tends to use nitrate-based explosives such as emulsions of fuel oil and ammonium nitrate solutions, mixtures of ammonium nitrate prills (fertilizer pellets) and fuel oil (ANFO) and gelatinous suspensions or slurries of ammonium nitrate and <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels.</b>|$|E
50|$|For many years, Chrysler {{developed}} {{gas turbine}} engines, which {{are capable of}} operating on {{a wide array of}} <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels,</b> for automotive use. Turbines were common in military vehicles, and Chrysler built many prototypes for passenger cars. In the 1960s, mass production seemed almost ready. Fifty Chrysler Turbine Cars, specialty designed Ghia-bodied coupes were built in 1962 and placed into the hands of consumers for final testing. After further development and testing to make emissions conform to 1970s-enacted EPA standards, the engines were planned as an option for the 1977 model LeBaron. However, Chrysler was forced to abandon the turbine engine as a precondition of U.S. government loan guarantees when the company experienced financial difficulties in the late 1970s.|$|E

50|$|In a wildfire, {{fire control}} {{includes}} various wildland fire suppression {{techniques such as}} defensible space, widening the fuel ladder, and removing fuel in the fire's path with firebreaks and backfires to minimize the brush fire reaching new <b>combustible</b> <b>fuel</b> and spreading further.|$|R
5000|$|A second {{concept of}} Defensible Space is [...] "Fuel Reduction." [...] This means plants are {{selectively}} thinned and pruned {{to reduce the}} <b>combustible</b> <b>fuel</b> mass of the remaining plants. The goal is {{to break up the}} more continuous and dense uninterrupted layer of vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Another big {{attraction}} {{with the}} hot-bulb engine was {{its ability to}} run {{on a wide range}} of fuels. Even poorly <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> could be used, since a combination of vaporiser- and compression ignition meant that such fuels could be made to burn. The usual fuel was fuel oil, similar to modern-day diesel fuel, but natural gas, kerosene, crude oil, vegetable oil or creosote could also be used. This made the hot-bulb engine very cheap to run, since it could be run on readily available fuels. Some operators even ran engines on used engine oil, thus providing almost free power. Recently, this multi-fuel ability has led to an interest in using hot-bulb engines in developing nations, where they can be run on locally produced biofuel.|$|E
50|$|Capturing NGL’s {{has shown}} an uptick in their {{economic}} share of U.S. production levels {{the past few}} years, sparking interest for advancement in recovery techniques for petroleum extraction. Uses of NGLs vary, from other <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> like autogas and natural gasoline, to the manufacturing of plastics. The apparent value of these materials has put the level of products developed from NGLs {{at an all-time high}} in the United States in 2015. Despite its value and use, many of the components that make up NGL and LPG become considered “waste gas” during production and are flared on-site or vented into the atmosphere as flash gas. This can be {{due to a lack of}} infrastructure to capture and store and/or transport these liquids to market. Profitability under current models is highly dependent on the access to pipeline infrastructure, gas volume produced, and the number of/distance between production facilities (batteries).|$|E
5000|$|Tsiolkovsky {{conceived}} {{a number}} of ideas that have been later used in rockets. They include: gas rudders (graphite) for controlling a rocket's flight and changing the trajectory of its center of mass, the use of components of the fuel to cool the outer shell of the spacecraft (during re-entry to Earth) and {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber and nozzle, a pump system for feeding the fuel components, the optimal descent trajectory of the spacecraft while returning from space, etc. In the field of rocket propellants, Tsiolkovsky studied a large number of different oxidizers and <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> and recommended specific pairings: liquid oxygen and hydrogen, and oxygen with hydrocarbons. Tsiolkovsky did much fruitful work on the creation of the theory of jet aircraft, and invented his chart Gas Turbine Engine. In 1927 he published the theory and design of a train on an air cushion. He first proposed a [...] "bottom of the retractable body" [...] chassis. However, space flight and the airship were the main problems to which he devoted his life. Tsiolkovsky had been developing the idea of the hovercraft since 1921, publishing a fundamental paper on it in 1927, entitled [...] "Air Resistance and the Express Train" [...] (link=no). In 1929, Tsiolkovsky proposed the construction of multistage rockets in his book Space Rocket Trains (link=no).|$|E
50|$|A {{flaming sword}} is a sword {{that has been}} coated with some type of <b>combustible</b> <b>fuel,</b> with the fuel being set on fire.

5000|$|Clemens Laby {{was born}} in Beuthen (today Bytom), a mining town near Kattowitz (today Katowice) in Upper Silesia. Towards {{the end of his}} time at senior school, around 1920, he worked as an intern at the [...] "Oheimgrube" [...] (today Wujek) coal mine. He then moved on to the Technical University (TU) of Berlin where he studied mine engineering, obtaining his degree in or before 1926. It is from the record of his {{registration}} at the TU that his birth date and birthplace can be ascertained. [...] The outcome of the 1922 referendum had moved the Polish frontier close to Beuthen, and in 1926 Laby {{went to work for the}} Polish mining administration. After the Annexation of Western Poland by the German army Laby was transferred to Germany's national head office of the <b>Combustible</b> <b>Fuels</b> Industry, taking a senior management position in the Bituminous coal department based in Berlin. It was here that he met the jurist Karl Laurenz in 1945, while Laby was working as a safety expert with the [...] "Mining Technical Inspectorate". Between 1946 and 1949 Laby was also working as personal assistant to the President of the National Administration (for what had become, in May 1945, the Soviet occupation zone). The National Administration was the forerunner to the Ministry for Coal and Energy in what became, in October 1949, the German Democratic Republic. According to testimony given by Laurenz at his trial in 1955, Laby had had to leave the National Administration in 1949 because he had had to relocate from East to West Berlin - something he had done only reluctantly.|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} of providing clean, <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> {{for use in}} Gulf Coast industries is well established; one possible source of such a fuel is to perform in situ gasification of Texas lignite which lies below stripping depths. If oxygen (rather than air) is used for gasification, the resulting medium Btu gas could be economically transported by pipeline from the gasification sites to the Gulf coast. Technical, environmental, and economic aspects of implementing this technology are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Extensive {{information}} on the greenhouse impacts of various human actions is important in developing effective climate change mitigation strategies. The greenhouse impacts of <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> consist not only of combustion emissions but also of emissions from the fuel production chain and possible effects on the ecosystem carbon storages. It {{is important to be}} able to assess the combined, total effect of these different emissions and to express the results in a comprehensive way. In this study, a new concept called relative radiative forcing commitment (RRFC) is presented and applied to depict the greenhouse impact of some <b>combustible</b> <b>fuels</b> currently used in Finland. RRFC is a ratio that accounts for the energy absorbed in the Earth system due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations (production and combustion of fuel) compared to the energy released in the combustion of fuel. RRFC can also be expressed as a function of time in order to give a dynamic cumulative picture on the caused effect. Varying time horizons can be studied separately, as is the case when studying the effects of different climate policies on varying time scales. The RRFC for coal for 100 years is about 170, which means that in 100 years 170 times more energy is absorbed in the atmosphere due to the emissions of coal combustion activity than is released in combustio...|$|E
