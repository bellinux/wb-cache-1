25|$|During the 1990s, the {{programme}} encountered severe organisational issues, {{including a}} lack of funding and backers who subsequently withdrew their participation. In November 1989, the company behind the Seastar, Claudius Dornier Aircraft, filed for bankruptcy, amid claims that the German government had failed to support the project. Prior to this, more than 50 options and letters of intent had been received for the type. In 1990, Dornier <b>Composite</b> <b>Aircraft</b> acquired the Seastar program, but this firm was also bankrupt within two years. As a result, a new company, Dornier Seastar, was formed to complete the aircraft's development and to produce the type, and began to seek partnerships with Asian companies to achieve this.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-composite}} construction aircraft, {{based on}} the commercial single-engine, low-wing Windecker Eagle. The YE-5A, delivered in 1973, was used in tests relating to the radar detectability (commonly known as 'stealth') of <b>composite</b> <b>aircraft.</b> A single YE-5A (serial number 73-1653) was built. The YE-5A composite airframe benefited from the U.S. Army project and was shown {{to be difficult to}} detect using radar; however other components, including the metal engine, could be seen on radar. The YE-5A was destroyed in a crash during a classified project in 1985, and was replaced by a modified conventional civilian model Windecker Eagle (N4196G), to complete the project. This aircraft is disassembled and in storage in the United States Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama.|$|E

2500|$|Two new Mooney {{models were}} {{announced}} on 11 November 2014.

These were developed largely with the Chinese aviation market in mind. In China, aviation fuel is scarce and expensive, whereas diesel fuel is less expensive and more readily available. The M10 series certification and deliveries were expected to begin in 2017, but in April 2017 the company announced that the project had been canceled, stating that the knowledge gained from this project would be applied to a future project.|$|E

40|$|Because {{of major}} {{advantages}} (e. g. weight saving, maintenance advantages), the airframe manufacturers use {{more and more}} Polymer Matrix Composites (PMCs) {{in different parts of}} aircraft structures. But PMCs have a substantial disadvantage of low conductivity and therefore low Electromagnetic (EM) Shielding. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) sources are all around and inside aircraft and can potentially threat the immunity of aircraft. Metallic meshes have been used to overcome this shortage. However in high frequencies most of the mentioned methods loose their performances. Regrettably on one side most of the present and upcoming systems onboard of aircraft are functional in mentioned range of frequencies. On the other side, passengers use more and more Personal Electronic Devices (PEDs) onboard of aircraft. Interferences caused by PEDs are also in the same range of frequencies. Measured susceptibility caused by PEDs is higher in <b>composite</b> <b>aircrafts</b> comparing to metallic ones. To overcome this back door lack of <b>composite</b> <b>aircrafts,</b> design of a new light weight shield particularly for aeronautic application is needed. Metallic nanoparticles have a great potential to be used as new EM shields for aerospace applications, particularly in high frequencies. Without multidisciplinary characterization of new shield, the application onboard would be suspended. Here the encouraging results of EM characterization are presented. Thermal, microscopy and mechanical tests are also performed. Based on acquired results in this work, thermal and mechanical behaviors as well as distribution of particles are all acceptable. The promising results obtained in this work can assure the designers on using metallic nanoparticles as a new shield for protection of <b>composite</b> <b>aircrafts.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The prototype was first flown on December 7, 1994, by Norman E. Howell. During the beginning of that year, Alan and Dale moved the company from their headquarters in Baraboo to a 30,000-square-foot research and development facility in Duluth, Minnesota, bringing 35 employees with them and hiring another 15 at once. They began work on the Cirrus SR20, a four-passenger, single-engine, piston-powered <b>composite</b> <b>aircraft.</b> That's when Cirrus released its new marketing campaign: [...] "Hangar X".
