40|$|In 1984, Eli Goldratt {{published}} his novel “The Goal – {{a process of}} ongoing improvement”. <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> has since evolved into a field of study, still widely debated and written about today. Most companies soon realized that the principles of <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> {{could no longer be}} ignored to stay competitive. The South African Breweries (now SABMiller plc) is the world's leading brewer in developing markets. The company has dominated the South African liquor market for years and is currently the second largest brewing company in the world, operating in Africa, China, Europe and the USA, yet even a company with this reputation can still be ignoring the basic principles of <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management.</b> This dissertation concentrates on the application of <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> in a selected brewery in South Africa. The measures used in one of SAB’s most successful breweries will be tested against <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> principles, illustrating how the practice of driving performance measures without focusing on the constraint can lead one away from the goal of the company. Rosslyn Brewery is a brewery driven by traditional brewing industry performance measures. The key drivers of the brewery have always been to increase factory efficiency and reduce costs. Rosslyn set the benchmark for packaging efficiency within SAB. The problem is that the packaging operation is not the constraint in the brewery. The throughput of the brewery is determined by the operation feeding into packaging, i. e. filtration. The end result is that even though the packaging lines have the best efficiency, they still have to stop and wait for beer to become available from filtration, resulting in downtime, frustration and eventually costly overtime and weekend work. The core conflict of the brewery is the trade-off between running all the resources as efficiently as possible, and thereby decreasing product cost, and running only the constraint as efficiently as possible, resulting in an increase in throughput. The Thinking Process was used to evaluate the conflict and a solution developed. The solution consists of the following: 1. The brewery has to adopt <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> using the 5 step process of ongoing improvement. The capacity constraint has to be exploited and all other operations subordinated, to ensure that products are not produced for the sake of improving efficiency. 2. The operational measures of the brewery have to be changed from increasing factory efficiency and reducing R/hl to increasing throughput, decreasing inventory and decreasing operating expense. 3. The production schedule and raw material release for the whole plant need to be determined by filtration. This requires a change in the current advanced planning solution to incorporate the principles of Drum-Buffer-Rope. If the decision is made and actions taken, the brewery will be able to survive the next decade, even if there is a further decline in the market. If not, the focus will still be on reducing product cost, whilst improving the efficiency of all operations. This will lead to further line closures and retrenchments, doing nothing more but reducing SABMiller’s potential future capacity and flexibility.

To promote world economic growth, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) aimed to slash duties on 8000 categories of manufactured goods. Tariff barriers have declined significantly {{and are now}} approaching trivial levels (Hill, 1999, p 163). Unfortunately, South Africa is ranked {{near the bottom of}} the World Competitiveness Report (Cheales, 1995, p 8). Increased foreign competition has caused many South African companies to search for techniques that will improve their overall performance. Unless these techniques can be identified and implemented timeously, some companies may fail to remain competitive. This research addresses the lack of awareness in the Eastern Cape (SA) and utilisation of two techniques used successfully in the USA (and elsewhere in developed countries) namely, <b>Constraint</b> <b>Management</b> and simulation. The overall objective was to develop a method of convincing industry management of the benefits of the two techniques. The approach adopted was to use simulation to prove <b>Constraint</b> <b>Management.</b> To achieve this objective a comprehensive literature survey was performed to determine the logic of each technique and the associated benefits. The next step was to determine the levels of awareness among industry practitioners and managers.

The simulation modeling process was examined in order to verify the logic of simulation and a model of a manufacturing system was developed. <b>Constraint</b> <b>Management</b> principles were then applied to the model in a series of experiments.

40|$|In decomposition-based design {{optimization}} {{strategies such as}} analytical target cascading (ATC), it is sometimes necessary to use reduced representations of highly discretized functional data exchanged among subproblems to enable efficient {{design optimization}}. However, the variables used by such reduced representation methods are often abstract, {{making it difficult to}} constrain them directly beyond simple bounds. This problem is usually addressed by implementing a penalty value-based heuristic that indirectly constrains the reduced representation variables. Although this approach is effective, it leads to many ATC iterations, which in turn yields an ill-conditioned optimization problem and an extensive runtime. To address these issues, this paper introduces a direct <b>constraint</b> <b>management</b> technique that augments the penalty value-based heuristic with constraints generated by support vector domain description (SVDD).

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Industrial Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The Theory of <b>Constraints</b> is a <b>management</b> {{philosophy}} {{based on}} the underlying assumption {{that only a few}} constraining factors limit the throughput of the entire system. Drum-Buffer-Rope is the production logistical solution of the Theory of Constraints. It is the implementation of <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> on the manufacturing shop floor, to manage physical resource constraints. Drum-Buffer-Rope was designed with the purpose of increasing Throughput, while simultaneously decreasing Inventory, and minimising Operating Expense. It aims to accomplish these goals by focusing on simplifying and therefore reducing variability in the production process, and ultimately protecting order due dates against disruptions. The dynamic conditions under which typical job shops operate can make <b>Constraints</b> <b>Management</b> of the resource constraints a cumbersome task. By following a “What If” approach to the scheduling process, the scheduler can play an interactive role in developing practical shop floor schedules. In this way the scheduler can see the results of his/her ideas on the shop floor situation quickly as immediate feedback is provided. The Drum-Buffer-Rope methodology only finite schedules certain points in the manufacturing process therefore scheduling calculations can be performed quickly if done in software. This makes it possible for the scheduler to analyse various scenarios {{in a short period of}} time and allowing the development of near optimal shop floor schedules by following a “What If” approach to scheduling. In this project, new developments in the field of Drum-Buffer-Rope were investigated, and the newly developed Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope methodology was researched. The methodologies were incorporated in a fully developed software package that uses Drum-Buffer- Rope or Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope to marry the intrinsic knowledge of the shop-floor worker with modern day computer technology to create production schedules that can be released to the shop floor. Schedules are created rapidly enough by the software to enable the scheduler to follow a “What If” approach to create near optimal shop floor schedules. The developed software was used with live data from a South African job shop to illustrate the “What If” approach to Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope scheduling. The results show that throughput can be increased and operating expense decreased, therefore increasing bottom line results, by analysing various scenarios...|$|R
