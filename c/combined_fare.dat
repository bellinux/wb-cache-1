40|$|This paper aims to {{optimize}} a desirable fare {{structure for the}} public transit service along a bus-subway corridor with the consideration of those factors related to equity in trip, including travel distance and comfort level. The travel distance factor {{is represented by the}} distance-based fare strategy, which is an existing differential strategy. The comfort level one is considered in the area-based fare strategy which is a new differential strategy defined in this paper. Both factors are referred to by the <b>combined</b> <b>fare</b> strategy which is composed of distance-based and area-based fare strategies. The flat fare strategy is applied to determine a reference level of social welfare and obtain the general passenger flow along transit lines, which is used to divide areas or zones along the corridor. This problem is formulated as a bi-level program, of which the upper level maximizes the social welfare and the lower level capturing traveler choice behavior is a variable-demand stochastic user equilibrium assignment model. A genetic algorithm is applied to solve the bi-level program while the method of successive averages is adopted to solve the lower-level model. A series of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the performance of the models and solution methods. Numerical results indicate that all three differential fare strategies play a better role in enhancing the social welfare than the flat fare strategy and that the fare structure under the <b>combined</b> <b>fare</b> strategy generates the highest social welfare and the largest resulting passenger demand, which implies that the more equity factors a differential fare strategy involves the more desirable fare structure the strategy has...|$|E

This paper analyzes the Alameda–Contra Costa (AC) Transit District 2 ̆ 7 s five alternative fare proposals introduced for public discussion in March 2005. The proposals <b>combined</b> <b>fare</b> hikes, base fare reductions, eliminations of free transfers, and discontinuation of periodic passes. Using the agency 2 ̆ 7 s 2002 on-board survey data, the study assessed the impacts of individual fare proposals on different subsets of riders and evaluated if they were equitable; and estimated potential fare revenues, using alternative price elasticities to estimate changes in ridership due to changes in price. The analysis revealed that proposals that increased the cost of transfers or eliminated unlimited-use passes produced dramatically unequal impacts on certain riders. Proposals for flat fares per ride {{were found to be}} least equitable, even when the base fare was lowered, because lower income riders, youth, and minorities made more trips and transferred more frequently than their more affluent counterparts.

40|$|A certain acrimony {{pervades the}} longstanding {{debate over the}} costs and {{benefits}} of public rail transportation in the United States. Some seem opposed to all rail transit all the time, while others support any and every rail project, despite sometimes high costs and low ridership. With much of the debate focused on pricing automobile externalities, transportation choice, and the rail’s external benefits, surprisingly few studies assess which rail transit systems create net positive social welfare. If consumer benefits alone do not justify the high cost of a transit investment, what would the external value of a passenger trip have to be to do so? <b>Combining</b> <b>fare,</b> ridership, operating, and capital cost data for 24 transit agencies' heavy and/or light rail systems, this paper makes back-of-the-envelope estimates of how transit systems' rider benefits compare to operating deficits. Urban rail systems may not be optimal from a transportation systems or economic cost-benefit perspective, but they clearly create value for consumers and society. Given a low, but commonly applied, elasticity of - 0. 3 and a linear demand curve, two transit systems create net social welfare gains based solely on consumer surplus. At least ten others likely provide net benefits when accounting for economic externalities. At an elasticity of - 0. 6, no system provides net social welfare gains without accounting for externalities. At least five systems are unlikely to provide net economic benefits, even given generous assumptions about external and rider benefits...|$|R

40|$|Pricing {{and revenue}} {{management}} are two essential levers {{to optimize the}} sales of an airline's seat inventory and maximize revenues. Over the past few decades, they have generated {{a great deal of}} research but have typically been studied and optimized separately. On the one hand, the pricing process focused on demand segmentation and optimal fares, regardless of any capacity constraints. On the other hand, researchers in revenue management developed algorithms to set booking limits by fare product, given a set of fares and capacity constraints. This thesis develops several approaches to solve for the optimal fares and booking limits jointly and simultaneously. The underlying demand volume in an airline market is modeled {{as a function of the}} fares. We propose an initial approach to the two-product, two-period revenue optimization problem by first assuming that the demand is deterministic. We show that the booking limit on sales of the lower-priced product is unnecessary in this case, allowing us to simplify the optimization problem. We then develop a stochastic optimization model and analyze the <b>combined</b> impacts of <b>fares</b> and booking limits on the total number of accepted bookings when the underlying demand is uncertain. We demonstrate that this joint optimization approach can provide a 3 - 4 % increase in revenues from a traditional pricing and revenue management practices. The stochastic model is then extended to the joint pricing and seat inventory control optimization problem for booking horizons involving more than two booking periods, as is the case in reality. A generalized methodology for optimization is presented, and we show that the complexity of the joint optimization problem increases substantially with the number of booking periods. We thus develop three heuristics. Simulations for a three-period problem show that all heuristics outperform the deterministic optimization model. In addition, two of the heuristics can provide revenues close to those obtained with the stochastic model. This thesis provides a basis for the integration of pricing and revenue management. The <b>combined</b> effects of <b>fares</b> and booking limits on the number of accepted bookings, and thus on the revenues, are explicitly taken into account in our joint optimization models. We showed that the proposed approaches can further enhance revenues. by Claire Cizaire. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 2011.

40|$|This {{research}} {{asks how}} universality of ridership is maintained in New York City’s transit system {{given that it}} is gated by the fare. Transportation planning scholarship presumes transit is affordable because the fare has a relatively low price and ridership among the poor is high. The transit agency addresses universality by maintaining a fare structure that keeps the single ride fare relatively low. Its method is based on empirical evidence that low-income riders “prefer” cheaper fare products over those with lower average fares but that require higher initial cash outlays. Transportation scholarship observes that low-income riders are inelastic and presumes, based on economic theory, that riders will forego more elastic goods to ride transit. Critical planning scholars have contested the tenets of the modernist planning project which utilize predict-and-provide empiricism and neoclassical economic models such as these. While urban planning has turned toward direct collaboration or at least participation with affected communities, transportation planning has not fully made this turn. There is thus little transit-related research that is informed directly by riders, especially low-income riders, suggesting the conventional approaches to understanding how riders afford the fare are incomplete. To fill this void, this research engages with low-income transit riders to elaborate and challenge the explanations for universality of ridership. It finds that although the fare price is low, {{it is not necessarily}} affordable. The “preference” for single ride fares is in most cases the result of constraints. Single fare rides are often <b>combined</b> with <b>fare</b> evasion and exploitation of free transfers, while unlimited fare cards are highly sought and widely shared. Low-income riders are more likely to undertake compensating behaviors than to forego goods. On the occasions when they do forego goods, they compromise necessities such as food, telephone service, rent and laundry. Finally, agents of the welfare state distribute fares to low-income individuals to promote rehabilitation and labor force attachment. Together these findings suggest that universality of ridership is tenuous. It depends on fragmented systems of generosity, compromise and welfare of which transit advocates and planners are largely unaware. Fare evasion enforcement, pricing structures and fare payment methods can pose challenges to riders who rely on these fragmented systems. By explicitly acknowledging transit affordability, and incorporating knowledge on the role that welfare plays in enabling low-income ridership, planners can expand access to transit for low-income riders...|$|R
40|$|Public transit {{agencies}} often {{struggle with}} service reliability issues; when a bus or train does not arrive on time, passengers become frustrated {{and may be}} less likely to choose transit for future trips. To address reliability problems, transit authorities increasingly provide real-time vehicle location and arrival information to riders via web-enabled and mobile devices. Although prior studies have found several benefits of offering this information to passengers, researchers have had difficulty determining if real-time information affects ridership levels. Therefore, the objective of this dissertation is to quantify the impact of real-time information on public transit ridership. 	Statistical and econometric methods were used to analyze passenger behavior in three American cities that share a common real-time information platform: New York City, Tampa, and Atlanta. New York City was the setting for a natural experiment in which real-time bus information was gradually launched on a borough-by-borough basis over a three year period. Panel regression techniques were used to evaluate route-level bus ridership while controlling for changes in transit service, fares, local socioeconomic conditions, weather, and other factors. In Tampa, a behavioral experiment was performed with a before-after control group design in which access to real-time bus information was the treatment variable and web-based surveys measured behavior changes over a three month period. In Atlanta, a methodology to <b>combine</b> smart card <b>fare</b> collection data with web-based survey responses was developed to quantify changes in transit travel of individual riders in a before-after study. In summary, each study utilized different data sources and quantitative methods to assess changes in transit ridership. 	The results varied between cities and suggest that the impact of real-time information on transit travel is greatest in locations that have high levels of transit service. These findings have immediate implications for decision-makers at transit agencies, who often face pressure to increase ridership with limited resources. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, {{the rapid growth of}} {{low-cost}} airlines and the development of web-based distribution of airline tickets have transformed the competitive environment in the airline industry worldwide. The relaxation of fares rules by low-cost airlines has disrupted the pricing and revenue management models of large network airlines. A better understanding of passenger choice behavior is now required to support the development of new strategies to compete more effectively in the current marketplace. In order to avoid the risk of bias associated with stated preference data, we focus in this research on how to develop a model of airline passenger choice based on booking data. Previous studies based on booking data have been limited to the sole choice of an airline itinerary and did not account for heterogeneity of behavior, a major characteristic of airline markets. This is due to the properties of booking data. For instance, only the chosen alternative is recorded in airline bookings and no information is available on other travel alternatives available {{at the time of the}} booking. Similarly, booking records contain no information on trip purpose that is traditionally used to segment airline markets. In this dissertation, we develop a modeling framework to overcome these limitations and extend booking-based passenger choice models to the joint choice of an airline itinerary and fare product. Booking data was <b>combined</b> with <b>fare</b> rules and seat availability data to incorporate the impact of pricing and revenue management and reconstruct the choice set of each booking. Characteristics of the traveler and the trip were retrieved from the booking records and used to replace trip purpose. (cont.) They were included as explanatory variables of a latent class choice model in which several factors can be used simultaneously to segment the demand without necessarily dividing the bookings into many small sub-segments. In addition, a new formulation of a continuous function of time was proposed to model the time-of day preferences of airline travelers in short-haul markets. Instead of being set to a full 24 hours, the duration of the daily cycle was estimated to account for the low attractiveness of some periods of the day such as nighttime. Estimation results over a sample of 2000 bookings from three European short haul markets show that the latent class structure of the model and a continuous function of time led to a significant improvement in the fit of the model compared to previous specifications based on a deterministic segmentation of the demand or time-period dummies. In addition, the latent class model provides a more intuitive segmentation of the market between a core of time-sensitive business travelers and a mixed class of price-conscious business and leisure travelers. This research extends the scope of potential applications of passenger choice models to additional airline planning decisions such as pricing and revenue management. In particular, parameter estimates of the model were applied to forecast the sell-up behavior of airline passengers, a major input required by the newly proposed revenue management models designed to maximize revenues under less restricted fare structures. by Emmanuel Carrier.
