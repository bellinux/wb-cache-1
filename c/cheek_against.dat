6000|$|She {{rubs her}} <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his. Feeling {{that he does}} not rub [...] his <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> hers, OLIVE stands away, and looks from him to [...] her mother in wonder.|$|E
60|$|She snuggled up to him, {{and laid}} her <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his breast.|$|E
60|$|Some minutes passed, then Greta leaning over, rubbed a <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She {{clasped her}} arms round my neck, and laid her <b>cheek</b> fondly <b>against</b> mine.|$|R
6000|$|When Saturday night came {{they were}} laid in their usual place on Midge's arm. She {{was too weak}} to kiss them now, and nurse laid their {{battered}} <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> the lips that whispered faintly, [...] "Be sure you send 'em to the little girl, and tell her--tell her--all about it." [...] Then she turned her cheek to the pillow with a little sigh and lay so still the dolls thought she had gone to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{went through}} the country, through the woods, over the snow. He saw the marks of rabbits and birds in the white snow. He wandered miles and miles. A smoky red sunset came on slowly, painfully, lingering. He thought she would die that day. There was a donkey that {{came up to him}} over the snow by the wood's edge, and put its head against him, and walked with him alongside. He put his arms round the donkey's neck, and stroked his <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> his ears.|$|R
60|$|He {{sank down}} on his knees beside her and put his <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> hers.|$|E
60|$|Lucy put her {{arm around}} her father's neck and placed her <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his.|$|E
60|$|Bianca, placing herself {{beside him}} on her knees, pressed her hot <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his temple.|$|E
60|$|Jonas went {{up towards}} the fire. The hearth was very large, and formed of great, flat stones. On {{one side of}} it was a large heap of wood, which Jonas had {{prepared}} the night before, to be ready for his fire. On the other side was a black cat asleep, with her chin upon her paws. When the cat heard Jonas coming, she rose up, stretched out her fore paws, and then began to purr, rubbing her <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> the bottom of the settle.|$|R
60|$|Romola, {{with the}} ready {{maternal}} instinct {{which was one}} hidden source of her passionate tenderness, instantly uncovered her head, and, stooping down on the pavement, put her arms round him, and her <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> his, while she spoke to him in caressing tones. At first his sobs were only the louder, but he {{made no effort to}} get away, and presently the outburst ceased with that strange abruptness which belongs to childish joys and griefs: his face lost its distortion, and was fixed in an open-mouthed gaze at Romola.|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes {{once more to}} his mercilessly, and drew a quick little breath. Yes, it was there written in his face--the blank utter {{indifference}} of good-fellowship. It was all {{that he had come}} to ask her, it was all that he would ever ask her. Suddenly she felt her heart throbbing in quick short beats-her cheeks burned. They were alone--even her little maid had gone out. Why was he so miserably indifferent? She stumbled to her feet, and suddenly stooping down laid her burning <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> his.|$|R
60|$|She put {{her arms}} round his terrifying, insentient body, and laid her <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his hard shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} hands upon his forehead, her <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his--smooth and cold--exquisitely {{refreshing}} {{it seemed to}} his jaded nerves.|$|E
6000|$|The breath sighed itself away. I leaned my <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> the unanswering hand, and chafed it with mine. Where now? Where now? ...|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{was crying}} softly, her <b>cheek</b> laid <b>against</b> Thursday's sleeve. The man stood as if turned to stone, but his cheeks were flushed, his eyes sparkling, {{and his head}} proudly poised.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye!" [...] She {{suddenly}} flung {{her arms}} round his neck, and, pressing her <b>cheek</b> tight <b>against</b> his, flashed {{out of the}} room by one door as her father entered it by another.|$|R
60|$|The dame de compagnie {{glanced up}} the staircase. The big cat had {{finished}} the milk and was rubbing its whiskered <b>cheek</b> sinuously <b>against</b> her skirt. She dived to snatch it up from the floor.|$|R
60|$|BLANCO. I cant {{change my}} soul, Elder: it changes me--sometimes. Feemy: I'm too pale. Let me rub my <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> yours, darling.|$|E
60|$|That was all Sara wanted. With a quick {{movement}} she nestled {{into his}} arms, and laid her warm, tear-wet <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his cold one.|$|E
60|$|He {{bent over}} the child, and laid her {{blooming}} <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his face. He put her gently from him, {{and looked at her}} unconscious mother.|$|E
6000|$|He saw {{the words}} reach her brain, and that wild look waver. Stretching out his arm, he drew her {{close to him}} till her <b>cheek</b> was <b>against</b> his, her shaking body against him, and kept murmuring: ...|$|R
60|$|Clambering {{into the}} wagon, {{he put his}} arms around her neck, {{pressing}} his <b>cheek</b> close <b>against</b> hers, and during what seemed a very long while the two remained silent, not daring to give words to their fears.|$|R
6000|$|... "I love you!" [...] She {{was resting}} {{perfectly}} quiet against him, while her heart ceased gradually to beat so fast. He {{could feel her}} <b>cheek</b> rubbing <b>against</b> his coat of Harris tweed. Suddenly she sniffed at it, and whispered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, the beauties! the beauties!" [...] Saxon cried, resting her <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> {{the velvet}} muzzle of one, {{while the other}} roguishly nuzzled for a share.|$|E
60|$|But Sadie {{had learned}} to think more about others during those terrible days of schooling. Her arms were round Mrs. Belmont, and her <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> hers.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} shall be saved," [...] whispered the child, twining her arms more closely round her father's neck, and laying her wet <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his.|$|E
60|$|She was {{clinging}} {{close to}} Dinah; her <b>cheek</b> was <b>against</b> Dinah's. It {{seemed as if}} her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact, and the pitying love that shone out from Dinah's face looked like a visible pledge of the Invisible Mercy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't bet anything," [...] {{said the}} niece, {{and she put}} her arm round the papa's neck, and pressed her <b>cheek</b> up <b>against</b> his. [...] "I'll just leave it to uncle, {{and if it does}} turn into a little-pig story, it'll be for the moral." ...|$|R
50|$|Crank noseband or Swedish Cavesson: {{used most}} often on {{dressage}} horses at levels where a double bridle is worn, this noseband {{is similar to}} the plain cavesson except it has a leveraged buckle design that may be adjusted very tight, so as to keep the horse's mouth closed. Double bridles cannot use flash or drop cavessons, so the crank is usually seen on upper level dressage horses who will not keep the mouth shut. It is also used occasionally on show hunters and hunt seat equitation horses. If adjusted so the horse can't open its jaw at all when the crank is tight, the horse also cannot relax its jaw. Additionally, it can push the <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> the horse's teeth when overtightened, which is painful.|$|R
6000|$|... "My son--my little child!" [...] he cried, in a choked, {{trembling}} voice, {{and that}} was all. And Otto pressed his <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> his father's and began crying.|$|E
6000|$|She {{placed her}} hands in one another on his shoulder, and laying her rich brown <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> them as {{she looked down at}} the fire, went on thoughtfully: ...|$|E
60|$|She laughed, and, {{making a}} small, moaning noise, as if of weariness and helplessness, she sank {{her head on}} his chest. He put down his <b>cheek</b> <b>against</b> hers.|$|E
60|$|He tottered to his chair. He {{felt her}} draw his arms about her neck; {{he felt her}} put her own round his; he felt her kisses on his face; he felt her wet <b>cheek</b> laid <b>against</b> his own; he felt--oh, how deeply!--all that he had done.|$|R
50|$|Very {{close friends}} may greet {{each other by}} kissing near the cheek three times, {{starting}} with the left cheek. In some circles and geographical areas the custom of social kissing is more common than in others. It is only done among people who know each other very well. People might kiss {{each other on the}} cheeks three times alternating right and left cheeks, every time they meet or leave. This is not compulsory. If someone {{does not want to be}} kissed, he or she extends the hand for a handshake. Men do not typically kiss other men on the cheeks. Men and women, and women among each other, will do it more often. Often there will not be an actual kiss, but rather the touching of the <b>cheeks</b> <b>against</b> each other.|$|R
6000|$|Kitty {{laid her}} <b>cheek</b> fondly <b>against</b> her uncle's <b>cheek.</b> [...] "Everything is changed," [...] she whispered. [...] "We travel about; papa has left us, and Syd has left {{us, and we}} have got a new name. We are Norman now. I wish I was grown up, and old enough to {{understand}} it." ...|$|R
