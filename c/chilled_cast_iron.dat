Basic sand casting mold was used and a portion of {{it was designed to}} accommodate the external mild steel chill (MSC).

40|$|Indefinite <b>Chill</b> <b>Cast</b> <b>Irons</b> {{also called}} ICDP when used as rolling mill rolls are high alloyed <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> alloys {{belonging}} to the Fe-Cr-C system. ICDP exhibit improved properties regarding hot oxidation and wear resistances as their microstructure {{is a mixture of}} a martensitic with bulky cementite (M 3 C) and lamellar graphite fully dispersed into the matrix. Mechanical properties involved depend either on the chemical composition of the alloy or the crystallisation behaviour and the heat treatments performed subsequently in order to lead to the desired microstructure. Thus hardenability of the matrix is of great concern as heat treatments sequence is intended to transform austenite in a more stable structure like martensite or even bainite, depending on Cr content. In fact austenite is known to be unstable during hot working conditions as hot temperature and external stresses could yield transformation of this phase into martensite with major volume distortions and even multiple cracks network on the component involved. To avoid such a hitch in service it is quite necessary to make sure all the austenite is completely transformed into martensite while performing subsequent heat treatments like quenching or tempering on the material obtained after casting process. Various techniques are allowable starting from classical ones (X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Image Analysis, Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), Dilatometry) to more exotic one like Conversion Electron Mössbauer Spectroscopy (CEMS). From an industrial point of view, it is important to set a fast and reliable method to assess retained austenite presence into ICDP microstructure at the end of any step of the thermomechanical process. The present work is intended to compare different techniques used for retained austenite assessment in ICDP alloys as a first step prior to the calibration of a classical method like dilatometry. This calibration is to be set starting from complex XRD and CEMS spectrometers analyses.

The results indicate that, laser treated zones of three roll samples consist of melting zone, phase transformation zone and heat affected zone. After laser treatment, the melting zone have low hardness compared to the phase transformation zone, but after tempering at 540 ℃ for 1 hr, the hardness at the melting zone dramatically increases, because of the formation of the fresh martensite from retained austenite. In contrast, the hardness at the phase transformation zone sharply decreases as fresh martensite changed to tempered martensite.

40|$|Cutting of <b>chilled</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and {{hardened}} steel affords cutting materials with high hardness and wear resistance, even at high temperatures, {{as well as}} a superior strength in the cutting edge range. Actual cutting tool materials do not meet these requirements sufficiently, especially in interrupted cuts. CBN-materials can be used in some of these applications; since they are no economical alternative there is an urgent need for materials development in this area. The aim of the project was to develop a new generation of cutting tool materials upon the basis of the actual Alumina-Titaniumcarbonitride ceramic-composites which meet the defined necessities. In the same time it was necessary to develop the grinding process for hard machining the extremely wear resistant ceramic itself within the required precision. Extremely fine-grained microstructures in the alumina-titaniumcarbonitride composites yielded a remarkable increase of the mechanical properties. The transformation of these mechanical properties into application properties has been proven by a lot of application tests in the lab and in field-tests. The investigation of the influence of additional hard materials (Cr_ 3 C_ 2, TiB_ 2, Sc_ 2 CO) revealed that the grain size (extremely fine:< 0, 4 #mu#m) improves the properties more than any change in chemical composition.

40|$|Cylindrical {{components}} made of {{cast iron}} or <b>chilled</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> are often applied as thermo-rollers in paper manufacturing industry. In most cases they are subjected to 'external' thermo-mechanical loads {{as well as an}} 'internal' load stateowing to the occuring residual stresses. In the layout one therefore has to consider the resulting total stresses. As the production {{of cast iron}} leads to characteristic defects (graphite lamellae), fracture mechanics {{has proved to be a}} suitable tool that allows for a local failure estimation. In order to analyze the structural behaviour, a process and product simulation is performed that demands a description of the manufacturing process as well as of the application conditions of cylindrical cast components. The structural analysis of the thermal cooling process and of the residual stresses due to casting is carried out by means of the Finite-Element-Method, and the stresses caused by external operational loads are determined analytically and numerically. The necessary reduction of the residual stresses can be achieved by modifying the heat flow during the casting process. The failure estimation is performed by applying fracture mechanics, where the stress intensity factors are determined analytically for different fracture configurations. In the present cast, multidisciplinary optimization considers both thermal and mechanical objectives, where the importance of considering temperature-dependent material properties is emphasized at the example of a thermo-roller. In addition, comparison is made between the application of conventional and fracture-mechanical failure criteria. Finally, it is shown that in the layout of thermal rollers the residual stresses due to casting can be utilized for achieving maximum states of operation. (orig.)

To better understand how to engineer contact fatigue resistant surfaces, the effects of electroless nickel and hydrogenated diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings on the fatigue life at 108 cycles of SAE 52100 steel were studied using ultrasonic fatigue methods. The addition of DLC and electroless nickel coatings to SAE 52100 bearing steel {{had no effect on}} the fatigue life. Different inclusion types were found to affect the stress intensity value beyond just the inclusion size, as theorized by Murakami. The difference in stress intensity values necessary to propagate a crack for Ti (C,N) and alumina inclusions was due to the higher driving force for crack extension at the Ti (C,N) inclusions and was attributed to differences {{in the shape of the}} inclusion: rhombohedral for the Ti (C,N) versus spherical for the oxides. A correction factor was added to the Murakami equation to account for inclusion type. The wear properties of DLC coated SAE 52100 and <b>chilled</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> were studied using pin-on-disk tribometry and very high cycle ultrasonic tribometry. A wear model that includes sliding thermal effects as well as thermodynamics consistent with the wear mechanism for DLCs was developed based on empirical results from ultrasonic wear testing to 108 cycles.

Finally, the wear properties of laser hardened steels - SAE 8620, 4140, and 52100 - were studied at high contact pressures and low numbers of cycles. A design of experiments was conducted to understand how the laser processing parameters of power, speed, and beam size, as well as carbon content of the steel, affected surface hardness. A hardness maximum was found at approximately 0. 7 wt% carbon most likely resulting from increased amounts of retained austenite.

High niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> was prepared by adding pure niobium to a commercial <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> Coarse primary niobium carbide crystals were observed in the microstructure of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> The effect of the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> as an inoculant on the grain size of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels was examined in various experimental conditions. When the amount of the <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> inoculant more than 3 mass% was added into the steel melt, fine equiaxed grains were observed and grain size was significantly reduced to 210 μm. The results indicate that the high niobium <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> is effective as a grain refiner for the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. From the dissolution rate measurement, the grain refining mechanism was proposed. 9 th International Symposium on Science and Processing of <b>Cast</b> <b>Iron,</b> SPCI- 9; Luxor; 10 November 2010 through 13 November 201...|$|R
