30|$|Fate in {{the aquatic}} {{environment}} {{depends on the}} density: plastics with a lower density than freshwater (approx. 1.0  g/cm 3) or seawater (approx. 1.03  g/cm 3) are buoyant, those with a higher density are submerged [25]. Most <b>consumer</b> <b>plastic</b> materials (including PE) are buoyant in seawater (Table  1). In aquatic environments, plastics are often colonised {{by a variety of}} organisms. This fouling can increase the density so that formerly buoyant items sink below the water surface. If other organisms graze on the foulants, density of a plastic item can decrease again so that it returns to the water surface [25, 71]. Erosion of plastics may also change their specific density [66], and mixing of the upper water layer by wind may lead to submersion of previously buoyant microplastics [19].|$|E

40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a monomer {{found in}} {{commonly}} used <b>consumer</b> <b>plastic</b> goods. Although much attention {{in recent years}} has been placed on BPA’s impact as an endocrine disruptor, it also appears to activate many immune pathways involved in both autoimmune disease development and autoimmune reactivity provocation. The current scientific literature is void of research papers linking BPA directly to human or animal onset of autoimmunity. This paper explores the impact of BPA on immune reactivity and the potential roles these mechanisms may have on the development or provocation of autoimmune diseases. Potential mechanisms by which BPA may be a contributing risk factor to autoimmune disease development and progression include its impact on hyperprolactinemia, estrogenic immune signaling, cytochrome P 450 enzyme disruption, immune signal transduction pathway alteration, cytokine polarization, aryl hydrocarbon activation of Th- 17 receptors, molecular mimicry, macrophage activation, lipopolysaccharide activation, and immunoglobulin pathophysiology. In this paper a review of these known autoimmune triggering mechanisms will be correlated with BPA exposure, thereby suggesting that BPA has a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) are additive {{flame retardants}} which have found applications in polymers for many <b>consumer</b> <b>plastic</b> and electronic goods. Wide {{use of these}} chemicals has led to their extremely high concentrations in the indoor environments. This paper presents an exploratory study of the photodebromination of five individual lower polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners (BDE- 28, BDE- 47, BDE- 99, BDE- 100 and BDE- 101) irradiated with white light and different UV (A, B, C) light ranges. The capability of photodegradation of lower PBDEs under room lights was proven by the debromination which occurred with various effectiveness for the selected PBDE congeners and depended of light source. Almost all PBDE congeners showed the greatest decay when exposed to UV-C, {{with the exception of}} BDE- 100. The decay of irradiated congeners occurred rapidly during the first 5 min of experiment. The final degradation varied from 38 % decay (BDE- 28, UV-C) to 94 % (BDE- 47, UV-C). These findings can help in predicting PBDE behavior in indoors and also be useful in the design of PBDE remediation processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste plastics {{has become a major}} worldwide environmental problem. The USA, Europe and Japan generate about 50 million tons of post-consumer plastic waste each year. These waste products were previously dumped in landfill sites, which is a non-sustainable and environmentally questionable option. The number of landfill sites and their capacity are moreover decreasing rapidly and in most countries the legislation on land filling is becoming increasingly stringent. Two sustainable alternative disposal routes are possible, i. e. recycling or energy recovery. Several European Directives concern the plastic waste issue and the requested waste management, and are briefly discussed in this paper. New sustainable processes have emerged, i. e. a mechanical treatment for recycling post) <b>consumer</b> <b>plastic</b> waste as virgin or second grade plastic feedstock, and a thermal treatment to recycle the waste as virgin monomer, as synthetic fuel gas, or as heat source (incineration with energy recovery). These processes are environmentally friendly and avoid the massive land filling, where the non-biodegradable plastics remain an environmental burden for centuries. This paper reviews the waste management options for plastic wastes by recycling and thermal processing (pyrolysis, gasification and incineration with energy recovery). A combination of all disposal routes remains necessary to achieve the most eco-efficient, effective waste management solution. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Phthalate esters are {{ubiquitous}} {{environmental and}} food pollutants {{well known as}} endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). These developmental and reproductive toxicants pose a grave risk to the human health due to their unlimited use in <b>consumer</b> <b>plastic</b> industry. Detection of phthalates is strictly laboratory based time consuming and expensive process and requires expertise of highly qualified and skilled professionals. We present a real time, non-invasive, label free rapid detection technique to quantify phthalates' presence in deionized water and fruit juices. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique applied to a novel planar inter-digital (ID) capacitive sensor plays a vital role to explore the presence of phthalate esters in bulk fluid media. The ID sensor with multiple sensing gold electrodes was fabricated on silicon substrate using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) device fabrication technology. A thin film of parylene C polymer was coated as a passivation layer to enhance the capacitive sensing capabilities of the sensor and to reduce the magnitude of Faradic current flowing through the sensor. Various concentrations, 0. 002 ppm through to 2 ppm of di (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in deionized water, {{were exposed to the}} sensing system by dip testing method. Impedance spectra obtained was analysed to determine sample conductance which led to consequent evaluation of its dielectric properties. Electro-chemical impedance spectrum analyser algorithm was employed to model the experimentally obtained impedance spectra. Curve fitting technique was applied to deduce constant phase element (CPE) equivalent circuit based on Randle's equivalent circuit model. The sensing system was tested to detect different concentrations of DEHP in orange juice as a real world application. The result analysis indicated that our rapid testing technique is able to detect the presence of DEHP in all test samples distinctively. 12 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Authors {{describe}} here {{a sequence}} of soft sediment deformation (SSD) structures at Dive Agar beach near Srivardhan in {{the west coast of}} India. The approx. 120 -cm-thick sediment package is represented by a basal undeformed sand (layer A) sharply cut by approx. 30 -cm-thick intermixed beach sand and terrigenous sand (layer B 1) followed by complex load structures and convolutions (8 – 15 cm) within a coarse sandy layer (B 2). The layer B 2 is scoured by terrigenous sand (layer C 1) which is capped with a silty mud layer (C 2). The entire sequence (B 2 –C 1 –C 2) is intruded by sand dykes originating from the lower layer B 1. This sediment package is further overlain by a heavy mineral reach marine sand (layer D) with liquefactions long axes inclined southward as a result of forceful long-shore drift. The profile ends up with coarse-grained, poorly sorted sand including angular clasts of terrigenous outwash deposits indicating return of distal inundations. Intense deformation (liquefaction) is restricted to the heavy mineral-rich marine and the intermixed sands (layers B 2 and D), whereas the terrigenous sand layers show scoured bases with oscillatory and pebbly tops. The presence of complex load structures injecting into the underlying layers, the top-truncated sand dykes, macro-thrust faults, scouring, and inclusion of coral fragments can explain it as a record of tsunami in the west coast. Occurrence of un-decayed <b>consumer</b> <b>plastic</b> material within the deformed layers suggests it {{as one of the most}} recent tsunami events (i. e., 2004 IOT), the only reported event after 1945 in the west coast.
