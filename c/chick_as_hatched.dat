40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to compare the}} effects of different levels of oils and fat powders on broiler performance. A total of 120 Cobb- 500 broiler <b>chicks</b> <b>as</b> <b>hatched</b> were randomly allocated to five treatments with three replicates of eight chicks each. Five treatment diets were 3 % soyabean oil (T 1), 3 % palm oil (T 2), 3 % bergafat HTL- 306 (T 3), 4 % bergafat HTL- 306 (T 4),and 5 % bergafat HTL- 306 (T 5) on isocaloric (12. 53 - 12. 78 MJ/kg) and isonitrogenous (22 %CP) basis calculated from tabulated value and fed to the broilers up to 5 weeks of age. The average body weight was significantly (p< 0. 05) highest in group T 3 followed by T 4 and T 5 at first week of age. There was no significant different in feed intake among the treatment groups. The mean live weight gain of T 4 group was significantly (p< 0. 05) highest in group T 4 followed by T 3, T 2, T 1 and in T 5 groups at their fourth week of age. There {{was no significant difference}} in feed conversion ratio among the treatment groups. The cost effective group was found T 2 group. It is concluded that 3 % palm oil (T 2) and 4 % bergafat (T 4) diets was found to be better in relation to growth performance compared to other treatment groups...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} dietary supplementation with different preparations of probiotics {{on the performance of}} broiler chickens experimentally infected with 2 x 10 (4) sporulated oocysts of Eimeria tenella at 14 days of age. Three hundred, day-old, Cobb- 500 <b>chicks,</b> <b>as</b> <b>hatched,</b> were separated into 10 equal groups with three replicates. Two of the groups, one challenged with E. tenella oocysts and the other not, were given a basal diet and served as controls without medication. The other challenged groups were given the anticoccidial lasalocid (60 mg/kg) or Enterococcus faecium (5 x 10 (8) or 5 x 10 (9) cfu/kg feed), Bifidobacterium animalis (5 x 10 (8) cfu/kg feed), Lactobacillus reuteri (5 x 10 (8) cfu/kg feed), Bacillus subtilis (5 x 10 (8) cfu/kg feed), or a multi-species probiotic mix at 5 x 10 (8) or 5 x 10 (9) cfu/kg feed, respectively. The trial lasted 6 weeks. Individual body weight, feed intake per pen and feed conversion ratio values were recorded weekly, along with the extent of bloody diarrhea, excreta oocyst numbers and bird mortality. Caecal lesions were assessed and intestinal samples were taken for histopathological and bacteriological evaluation from ileum and caecum. Overall growth performance of chickens fed the multi-species probiotic mix at both levels was higher (P< 0. 05) compared to the infected control. Overall oocyst shedding was lowest (P< 0. 05) in the lasalocid supplemented group. Villous height was higher (P< 0. 05) in Bacillus supplemented groups compared to infected controls. The Lactobacillus supplemented group had the highest (P< 0. 05) numbers of both Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in ileum and caecum. In conclusion, dietary probiotics are promising for further investigation on improving intestinal health and growth performance of broiler chickens experimentally challenged with E. tenella.

40|$|Received for Publication 2 - 22 - 28) It is {{customary}} in chick feeding {{to withhold}} feed from chicks {{until they are}} 48 to 72 hours old. The usual recommendation for this practice {{is based upon the}} fact that the chick absorbs the yolk just prior to hatching, which supplies nourishment for several hours. The common notion is that additional food given before the chick has had time to assimilate this yolk will cause digestive troubles. While the practice of withholding feed from chicks for the first 48 to 72 hours has given very satisfactory results, such a procedure seems to be based only on assumption. So far as we know no experimental evidence has been presented showing the effect of early feeding upon chicks. In the absence of such data it was thought advisable to determine what results might be ob-tained from feeding <b>chicks</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>hatched...</b>|$|R

The bird is at risk of extinction, and, in order to try to save the species, Russian ornithologists hatched a plan.

When they were ready to fly, they would fly alongside Angelo so they would consider him their mentor. That way, he could show them the traditional migratory route for their species.
