5000|$|The {{mechanism}} by which anechoic chambers minimize the reflection of sound waves impinging onto their walls is as follows: In the included figure, an incident sound wave I is about to impinge onto a wall of an anechoic chamber. This wall is composed {{of a series of}} wedges W with height H. After the impingement, the incident wave I is reflected as a series of waves R which in turn [...] "bounce up-and-down" [...] in the gap of air A (bounded by dotted lines) between the wedges W. Such bouncing may produce (at least temporarily) a standing wave pattern in A. During this process, the acoustic energy of the waves R gets dissipated via the air's molecular viscosity, in particular near the <b>corner</b> <b>C.</b> [...] In addition, with the use of foam materials to fabricate the wedges, another dissipation mechanism happens during the wave/wall interactions. As a result, the component of the reflected waves R along the direction of I that escapes the gaps A (and goes back to the source of sound), denoted R', is notably reduced. Even though this explanation is two-dimensional, it is representative and applicable to the actual three-dimensional wedge structures used in anechoic chambers.|$|E

40|$|Rats {{were used}} in a spatial {{reorientation}} task to assess their ability to use geometric and non-geometric, featural, information. Experimental conditions differed {{in the size of}} the arena (small, medium, or large) and whether the food-baited corner was near or far from a visual feature. The main measure was the percentage of trials with first-choice visits to the baited corner (<b>Corner</b> <b>C)</b> and the geometric equivalent corner (Corner R). Regardless of arena size, only the rats in the near-feature condition learned to make more first-choice visits to <b>Corner</b> <b>C</b> than Corner R. However, in this condition, there was a significant trend suggesting an increasing and decreasing use of, respectively, featural and geometric information with increasing arena size. Continued training with the feature removed caused all rats to primarily visit Corners C and R, reflecting the exclusive use of geometric information.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{wind tunnel}} test program was conducted to investigate interference excitation mechanisms on translational and torsional responses of an identical pair of tall buildings. Motion responses of a three-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic building model were measured. Both upstream and downstream interference effects were studied in this research. The experimental results showed that with an open terrain wind model, both dynamic translational and dynamic torsional responses generally increased under interference effects for an operating reduced wind velocity of 6. Measured response spectra indicated that amplified along-wind, cross-wind and torsional responses were largely induced by the wake of an upstream interfering building. The significance of interference effects and the dominant interference mechanisms depended upon {{the location of the}} aeroelastic model in the wake region. Furthermore, coupled translational-torsional motion of the aeroelastic building model tested was found to cause only small increases in the resultant motions at the building <b>corner.</b> (<b>C)</b> 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. The {{stability}} of the Nyström method for the Sherman-Lauricella equation on contours with corner points c j, j = 0, 1, [...] ., m relies on the invertibility of certain oper-ators Ac j belonging to an algebra of Toeplitz operators. The operators Ac j do {{not depend on the}} shape of the contour, but on the opening angle j of the corresponding <b>corner</b> <b>c</b> j and on parameters of the approximation method mentioned. They have a complicated structure and there is no analytic tool to verify their invertibility. To study this problem, the original Nyström method is applied to the Sherman-Lauricella equation on a special model contour that has only one corner point with varying opening angle j. In the interval (0. 1, 1. 9), it is found that there are 8 values of j where the invertibility of the operator Ac j may fail, so the corresponding original Nyström method on any contour with corner points of such magnitude cannot be stable and requires modication.
