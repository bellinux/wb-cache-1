40|$|Opportunities for dual {{restoration}} and carbon benefits from naturally regenerating woody ecosystems in agricultural landscapes have been highlighted recently. The restoration capacity of woody ecosystems {{depends on the}} magnitude and duration of ecosystem modification, i. e., the 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 agricultural legacy. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 However, this legacy may not influence carbon sequestration {{in the same way}} as restoration because <b>carbon</b> <b>potential</b> depends primarily on biomass accumulation, with little consideration of other attributes and functions of the ecosystem. Our present study simultaneously assesses the {{restoration and}} <b>carbon</b> <b>potential</b> of Acacia harpophylla regrowth, an extensive regrowth ecosystem in northeastern Australia. We used a landscape-scale survey of A. harpophylla regrowth to test the following hypotheses: (1) management history, in combination with climatic and edaphic factors, has long-term effects on stem densities, and (2) higher-density stands have lower restoration and <b>carbon</b> <b>potential,</b> which is also influenced by climatic and edaphic factors. We focused on the restoration of forest structure, which was characterized using stem density, aboveground biomass, stem heights, and stem diameters. Data were analyzed using multilevel models within the hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) framework. We found strong support for both hypotheses. Repeated attempts at clearing Brigalow (A. harpophylla ecosystem) regrowth increases stem densities, and these densities remain high over the long term, particularly in high-rainfall areas and on gilgaied, high-clay soils (hypothesis 1). In models testing hypothesis 2, interactions between stem density and stand age indicate that higher-density stands have slower biomass accumulation and structural development in the long term. After accounting for stem density and stand age, annual rainfall had a positive effect on biomass accumulation and structural development. Other climate and soil variables were retained in the various models but had weaker effects. Spatial extrapolations of the HBMs indicated that the central and eastern parts of the study region are most suitable for biomass accumulation; however, these may not correspond to the areas that historically supported the highest biomass Brigalow forests. We conclude that carbon and restoration goals are largely congruent within areas of similar climate.

A vertical vibratory hot-walled reactor was used along with metal powders. We started our investigation by first examining the etching of polished diamond windows coated with metal films. Metal films made from Fe, Ni and Co were deposited on diamond windows then scratched for post-reaction analysis with an Atomic Force Microprobe (AFM). The etching gases used were hydrogen, oxygen and nitrous oxide. A stable diamond interface formed between the diamond and the metal film. This interface allows for the removal of carbon from the diamond lattice. The carbon diffuses through the film to the surface were it forms C-O, and C-H species with dissociated H 2 and O 2 on the film surface. We analyzed the impact of various parameters on the etching reaction such as film thickness, length of reaction, temperature, crystal face, % of N 2 O and % of O 2 in H 2. Problems with surface poisoning and film adherence created problems with reaction reproducibility. Metal films were replaced with metal powders. In a hot-walled vibratory reactor the metal particles continuously collide with the surfaces of the diamond suspended in the powder. During these collisions, carbon transfer occurs at the diamond-metal interface which results in either etching or growth depending on the <b>carbon</b> <b>potential</b> of the gas phase.

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have highlighted the dire prospects for biodiversity in fragmented agricultural landscapes and {{stressed the need}} for increasing the area of, and connectivity between, natural ecosystems. Some have advocated the use of naturally regenerating forest ecosystems for sequestering atmospheric carbon, with opportunities for dual restoration and carbon benefits. However, no studies have explicitly explored the feasibility of obtaining such dual benefits from a regenerating woody ecosystem. This thesis aims to provide a detailed assessment of the restoration and <b>carbon</b> <b>potential</b> of Brigalow regrowth, an extensive naturally regenerating ecosystem throughout the pastoral regions of north eastern Australia. It combines observational, experimental and modelling techniques to describe the agricultural legacy of pastoral development, identify constraints to restoration and explore methods to remove these constraints. A review of existing ecological knowledge of Brigalow ecosystems is provided in chapter 3, along with discussion of policy and socio-economic issues that are likely to influence how and to what extent regrowth is utilised for restoration and carbon purposes in the Brigalow Belt. The review found restoring regrowth is likely to have benefits {{for a wide range of}} native flora and fauna, including the endangered bridled nailtail wallaby. Knowledge gaps exist relating to the landscape ecology of Brigalow regrowth and the impacts of management and climate change on carbon and restoration potential. Also, a conflict exists between short-term carbon sequestration and long-term restoration goals. Regional demand for high biomass regrowth as a carbon offset is likely to be high but ambiguities in carbon policy threaten to diminish the use of natural regrowth for reforestation projects. A large cross-sectional study of regrowth is presented in chapter 4. Data were analysed using multi-level / hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). Firstly, we found that repeated attempts at clearing Brigalow regrowth increases stem densities and densities remain high over the long term, particularly in high rainfall areas and on clay soils with deep gilgais. Secondly, higher density stands have slower biomass accumulation and structural development in the long term. Spatial extrapolations of the HBMs indicated that the central and eastern parts of the study region are most environmentally suitability for biomass accumulation, however these may not correspond to the areas that historically supported the highest biomass Brigalow forests. We conclude that carbon and restoration goals are largely congruent within regions of similar climate. At the regional scale however, spatial prioritisation of restoration and carbon projects may only be aligned in areas with higher <b>carbon</b> <b>potential.</b> Given the importance of stem density in determining restoration and <b>carbon</b> <b>potential,</b> an experimental thinning trial was established in dense Brigalow regrowth in southern Queensland (chapter 5). Four treatments were applied in a randomised block design and growth and mortality of a subset of stems was monitored for two years. Data were analysed using mixed-effects models and HBMs and the latter were subsequently used to parameterise an individual-based simulation model of stand structural development and biomass accumulation over 50 years. The main findings of this study were that growth and mortality of stems is influenced by the amount of space available to each stem (a neighbourhood effect) and that thinning accelerates structural development and increases woody species diversity. The examination of neighbourhood effects is taken further by considering drought-related mortality in a Eucalyptus savanna ecosystem (chapter 6). For this work a multi-faceted approach was employed including spatial pattern analyses and statistical models of stem survival to test three competing hypotheses relating to neighbourhood effects on drought related tree mortality. The main finding of this study was that neighbour density and microsite effects both influence drought-related mortality and the observed patterns can readily be explained by an interaction between these two factors. As a whole, this thesis contributes the following scientific insights: (1) restoration and carbon goals may be aligned for naturally regenerating woody ecosystems, but the degree of goal congruence will vary across the landscape in question, (2) while some woody ecosystems retain an excellent capacity to regenerate naturally, the agricultural legacy may still have long term effects on restoration and <b>carbon</b> <b>potential,</b> (3) neighbourhood effects that operate at the stem scale strongly influence dynamics at the ecosystem scale...|$|E

In the investigation, nitrogen was found to be the primary limiting nutrient; however, a combined treatment of nitrogen and phosphorus showed the greatest increase in the microbial numbers and <b>carbon</b> mineralization <b>potentials.</b> The results of this treatability study will be applied to the design of a bioremediation program to clean the soils at this site...|$|R

This imbalance confers {{an increasingly important}} role to P availability and N: P ratio in the Earth’s life system, affecting <b>carbon</b> sequestration <b>potential</b> and the structure, function and evolution of the Earth’s ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Pyrogenic carbon (PyC), {{produced}} naturally (wildfire charcoal) and anthropogenically (biochar), is extensively studied due to {{its importance}} in several disciplines, including global climate dynamics, agronomy and paleosciences. Charcoal and biochar are commonly used as analogues for each other to infer respective <b>carbon</b> sequestration <b>potentials,</b> production conditions, and environmental roles and fates. The direct comparability of corresponding natural and anthropogenic PyC, however, has never been tested. Here we compared key physicochemical properties (elemental composition, δ 13 C and PAHs signatures, chemical recalcitrance, density and porosity) and <b>carbon</b> sequestration <b>potentials</b> of PyC materials formed from two identical feedstocks (pine forest floor and wood) under wildfire charring- and slow-pyrolysis conditions. Wildfire charcoals were formed under higher maximum temperatures and oxygen availabilities, but much shorter heating durations than slow-pyrolysis biochars, resulting in differing physicochemical properties. These differences are particularly relevant regarding their respective roles as carbon sinks, as even the wildfire charcoals formed at the highest temperatures had lower <b>carbon</b> sequestration <b>potentials</b> than most slow-pyrolysis biochars. Our results challenge the common notion that natural charcoal and biochar are well suited as proxies for each other, and suggest that biochar’s environmental residence time may be underestimated when based on natural charcoal as a proxy, and vice versa...|$|R
