5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney was so <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, {{the idea that he}} was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E
5|$|Inaction chafed Ball, and {{he began}} {{agitating}} {{for a return to}} combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.|$|E
5|$|Having graduated, McLachlan and Michael Chechik {{founded the}} {{production}} company Omni Film Productions in 1979, {{and began to}} work with Greenpeace, filming documentary footage {{on a range of}} subjects. McLachlan narrowly avoided trouble on several of these shoots, finding himself arrested for filming too <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> Exxon oil tanker and scarcely missing being assaulted by trophy hunters in British Columbia. McLachlan would later sell his stake in Omni, but remains proud of their documentary work. At the time, McLachlan was unsuccessful in joining an industry union, relegating his work to advertising and small-scale productions; his first union-backed project was on the revival of the television series Sea Hunt.|$|E

5|$|In {{the regular}} season finale of 2001, Favre {{was the target of}} minor {{controversy}} when, in a game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium, he was sacked by the Giants defensive end Michael Strahan. It was Strahan's lone sack of the game and gave him the NFL's single–season sack record of 22.5, which topped Mark Gastineau's record of 22 set in 1984. The controversy (Favre fell over unusually easily) has followed Strahan continuously since he set the record. Jim Fassel, Strahan's coach in 2001, said that when a respected athlete like Strahan gets <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> all-time record, sometimes opponents want him to break it.|$|E
5|$|This {{period of}} Armenian hegemony in the region, however, was coming <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{end with a}} series of Roman {{victories}} in the Roman–Mithridatic Wars. Friction between the two had existed for several decades, although it was during the Third Mithridatic War that the Roman armies under Lucullus made significant progress against Mithridates, forcing him to take refuge with Tigranes. Lucullus sent an ambassador named Appius Claudius to Antioch to demand that Tigranes surrender his father-in-law; should he refuse, Armenia would face war with Rome. Tigranes refused Appius Claudius' demands, stating that he would prepare for war against the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its orbit. Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved outward from Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{headed for}} Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, {{they sought to}} travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in {{could be used as}} a hiding place. As they {{approached}} on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before the planes departed. Judy was below decks when the planes returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 15 defunct NBA franchises. The Anderson Packers, the {{original}} Denver Nuggets, the Indianapolis Jets, the Sheboygan Red Skins, and the Waterloo Hawks {{had played in}} the NBL before joining the NBA, while the original Baltimore Bullets had played in the American Basketball League before joining the NBA. Nine of the fifteen defunct teams have played in only one NBA season. The Packers, Red Skins, and Hawks left the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League, and are the only defunct teams to have ceased to exist in a league other than the NBA. The original Bullets were the last defunct team to leave the NBA, having left during the 1954–55 season, and are the only defunct team to have won an NBA championship. The Chicago Stags, the Indianapolis Olympians, the Cleveland Rebels, the Packers, and the Red Skins qualified for the playoffs in every year they were active in the league. Among cities that have hosted defunct NBA franchises, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. {{are the only ones}} to currently have an NBA team, although Providence, Rhode Island, Anderson, Indiana and Sheboygan, Wisconsin are all <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> hour away from a market with an NBA franchise.|$|E
