5|$|ATP {{is also a}} {{substrate}} of adenylate cyclase, {{most commonly}} in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to second messenger, <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP,</b> which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores.

5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation that binds F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP,</b> ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of the gene encoding colicin E 1, cea, was studied in Escherichia coli by using cea-lacZ gene fusions. Expression of the fusions showed the same characteristics {{as those of the}} wild-type cea gene: induction by treatments that damage DNA and regulation by the SOS response, sensitivity to catabolite repression, and a low basal level of expression, despite the presence of the fusion in a multicopy plasmid. Induction of expression by DNA-damaging treatments was found to differ from other genes involved in the SOS response (exemplified by recA), in that higher levels of DNA damage were required and expression occurred only after a pronounced delay. The delay in expression following an inducing treatment was more pronounced under conditions of catabolite repression, indicating that the <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> receptor protein complex {{may play a role in}} induction. These observations also suggest a biological rationale for the control of cea expression by the SOS response and the <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> receptor protein catabolite repression system...|$|R

Aminoglycosides are commonly supplemented {{to aid in}} the control of bacteria. As bacterial resistance is increasing worldwide, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) received lively interest as alternatives to overcome multi-drug resistant bacteria. We investigated, whether synthetic cationic AMPs might be a suitable alternative for conventional antibiotics in liquid boar sperm preservation. The antibacterial activity of two <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMPs</b> (c-WWW, c-WFW) and a helical magainin II amide analog (MK 5 E) was studied in vitro against two Gram-positive and eleven Gram-negative bacteria. Isolates included ATCC reference strains, multi-resistant E. coli and bacteria cultured from boar semen. Using broth microdilution, minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for all AMPs. All AMPs revealed activity towards the majority of bacteria but not against Proteus spp. (all AMPs) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (MK 5 E). We could also demonstrate that c-WWW and c-WFW were effective against bacterial growth in liquid preserved boar semen in situ, especially when combined {{with a small amount of}} gentamicin. Our results suggest that albeit not offering a complete alternative to traditional antibiotics, the use of AMPs offers a promising solution to decrease the use of conventional antibiotics and thereby limit the selection of multi-resistant strains...|$|R

In four patients, the marrow cells were cultured with and without indomethacin (1 μM). The supernatant fluids from indomethacintreated marrow cultures caused significantly less bone resorption than supernatant fluids of cell cultures without indomethacin. This inhibition of release of bone resorbing factor(s) by myeloma cultures {{is similar to the}} previously observed indomethacin-induced inhibition of osteoclast-activating factor (OAF) production by activated human leukocytes.

40|$|Pioneering studies {{conducted}} in the 1980 ’s {{laid the foundation for}} the hypothesis that axonal regeneration is limited by CNS myelin, and the identification of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), Nogo, and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) as inhibitors of neurite outgrowth firmly established myelin as a key factor in regenerative failure. Mechanistically, {{it has been shown that}} MAG, Nogo, and OMgp mediate inhibition by binding to either Nogo receptor (NgR) or paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB), and initiating a signaling cascade that culminates in the activation of RhoA. Since the discovery of these proteins, there has been tremendous interest in identifying compounds and molecular mechanisms that are capable of overcoming myelin-mediated inhibition. Many studies have focused on pharmacological antagonism of receptors and signaling intermediates, while others have sought to identify and enhance endogenous pro-regenerative pathways. The most notable example of the latter is the conditioning lesion effect, which led to the discovery of <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP’s</b> ability to overcome inhibition by MAG and myelin. Many of the agents tested in these studies have been shown to promote axonal regeneration in vivo, and this research topic allows researchers to share information about new treatments that have been developed in both academia and industry. As we look toward the future, it is becoming increasingly clear that reversal of myelin-mediated inhibition alone will not be sufficient to produce functional recovery from spinal cord injury, and that other factors, such as astroglial scarring, the expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, neuronal cell death, and lack of neurotrophic support, must also be taken into consideration. Combinatorial approaches therefore hold a great deal of promise, and we hope to initiate a dialogue on how stem cell transplantation, chondroitinase ABC, gene therapy, growth-promoting agents, and other methods can be combined to optimize functional recovery. We introduce this topic in honor of the life and work of Dr. Marie T. Filbin (1955 - 2014). Through these articles, we highlight past achievements in the field, novel findings, unanswered questions and innovative ideas that we hope will lead to new advances in axonal regeneration...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{inwardly}} rectifying K+ current, {{which was}} heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes, was inhibited by isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist. Poly(A) + mRNA isolated from guinea-pig brain was injected into oocytes 2 – 3 days before experiments. Isoproterenol inhibition of the K+ current was time- and voltage-dependent: the inhibition became {{faster and more}} pronounced as the command voltage steps were applied to more negative potentials. This inhibition was prevented by propranolol. Dibutylyl <b>cyclic</b> (dB-c) <b>AMP</b> could mimic the effect of isoproterenol, while injection of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase into the oocytes {{did not affect the}} K+ current. Inhibitors of the protein kinases, WIPTIDE and H- 8, did not prevent the inhibition by dB-cAMP. Furthermore, dB-cGMP also inhibited the K+ current in a similar time- and voltage-dependent manner.

Furthermore, {{we found that the}} transcription of the hya operon was not regulated by the <b>cyclic</b> AMP-cyclic <b>AMP</b> receptor protein complex. Investigation of the effects of different anaerobic growth conditions on the expression of the hya operon showed that expression was induced by formate and repressed by nitrate. Formate induction was not mediated by the fhlA gene product, and nitrate repression was not mediated by the narL gene product. We found a high level of anaerobic expression of the hya operon in glucose medium supplemented with formate and in glycerol medium supplemented with fumarate, suggesting that hydrogenase isoenzyme 1 has a function during both fermentative growth and anaerobic respiration...|$|R

In human U 87 MG glioblastoma cells, AChE-R formed a triple complex with protein kinase C (PKC) ε and the scaffold protein RACKi, enhanced PKCε phosphorylation, facilitated BrdU incorporation. Either overexpressed CREB, or antisense destruction of AChE-R mRNA, PKC, or protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors-but not CREB combined with PKC inhibition suppressedthis proliferation, suggesting that CREB's repression of this process involves a PKC-mediated pathway, whereas impaired CREB regulation allows AChE-Rinduced, PKA-mediated proliferation of glioblastoma tumors...|$|R

In this study, we isolated transposon insertions in the genes for the two unique enzymes of this pathway, aceA (isocitrate lyase) and aceB (malate synthase). The aceA and aceB genes were located at 89. 5 min on the S. typhimurium genetic map. Genetic linkage to nearby loci indicated that the relative gene order is purDJ metA aceB aceA. Transposon insertions in aceB were polar on aceA, suggesting that the genes form an operon transcribed from aceB to aceA. Transcriptional regulation of the aceBA operon was studied by constructing mini-Mu d(lac Kan) operon fusions. Analysis of these fusions indicated that {{expression of the}} aceBA operon is regulated {{at the level of}} transcription; the aceBA genes were induced when acetate was present and repressing carbon sources were absent.

25|$|Misoprostol is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. It acts upon gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secretion of gastric acid by G-protein coupled receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which leads to decreased intracellular <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP</b> levels and decreased proton pump activity at the apical surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of gastric ulceration (e.g. with diclofenac in Arthrotec).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as inositol triphosphate, diacylglycerol and <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP),</b> G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca2+ channels are able to survive and function {{in the absence of}} cAMP, ATP or protein kinase C when {{in the presence of the}} activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, Gα, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca2+ channel directly as an effector. This short circuit is membrane-delimiting, allowing direct gating of calcium channels by G proteins to produce effects more quickly than the cAMP cascade could. This direct gating has also been found in specific Ca2+ channels in the heart and skeletal muscle T tubules.|$|E

40|$|Ketoconazole has {{recently}} been shown to interfere with steroidogenesis in patients and rat in vitro systems. In this study we attempted to elucidate the site of inhibition in the adrenal gland. Although ketoconazole impaired adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulated <b>cyclic</b> (c) <b>AMP</b> production, dibutyrl cAMP addition did not bypass the steroidogenic blockade indicating that the critical ketoconazole-inhibited step was distal to cAMP. Addition of radiolabeled substrates to isolated adrenal cells and analysis of products by high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated a ketoconazole block between deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and corticosterone. This 11 -hydroxylase step is carried out by a P 450 -dependent mitochondrial enzyme. No restriction of progesterone or pregnenolone conversion to DOC was detected, steps carried out by non-P 450 -dependent microsomal enzymes. Inhibition of cholesterol conversion to pregnenolone by mitochondrial fractions indicated a second block at the side chain cleavage step, another mitochondrial P 450 -dependent enzyme. Adrenal malate dehydrogenase, a non-P 450 -dependent mitochondrial enzyme was not inhibited while renal 24 -hydroxylase, a P 450 -dependent mitochondrial enzyme in another organ, was blocked by ketoconazole. We conclude that ketoconazole may be a general inhibitor of mitochondrial P 450 enzymes. This finding suggests that patients receiving ketoconazole be monitored for side effects relevant to P 450 enzyme inhibition. Further, we raise the possibility that this drug action may be beneficially exploited in situations where inhibition of steroidogenesis is a therapeutic goal...|$|R
500|$|A hormone {{produced}} in the brain of the female moths controls sex pheromones. The hormone is released into the hemolymph to stimulate pheromone production. [...] Pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) is a peptide that regulates pheromone production in moths. It acts on the pheromone gland cells using calcium and <b>cyclic</b> <b>AMP.</b> Although the photoperiod regulates the release of PBAN to some extent, the chemical signals from the host plant supersede the effect {{from the time of}} day. Female Helicoverpa zea in corn fields do not produce pheromones during the night until they encounter corn. Several natural corn silk volatiles like the plant hormone ethylene induce H. zea pheromone production. The presence of the silk from an ear of corn is enough to cause pheromone production, and physical contact between females and corn is unnecessary. This evolutionary mechanism enables the moths to coordinate their reproductive behavior with the availability of food. Female moths often become depleted of sex pheromone after mating within 2 hours of separation from the male. The pheromonostatic peptide (PSP), a protein 57 amino acids long found in the male accessory gland, is what causes depletion of the female’s sex pheromone. This capability in males has been selected for because it increases the reproductive fitness of those that carry it, since other males will not be attracted to a female without a sex pheromone; thus, the female will bear only the first male's offspring. The transfer of a spermatophore without accessory gland products does not stop female pheromone production, but does stop the female's calling behavior. Intense selection acting on males to manipulate female reproductive physiology promotes rapid evolution of specific molecules, and male-derived pheromone suppressing factors exhibit positive selection.|$|E

Anaerobic expression of pfl was lower when the culture was grown in minimal glucose medium than when it was grown in nutrient broth. When Casamino Acids (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) were added to minimal glucose medium, the expression of pfl increased proportionally with the amount of Casamino Acids added.

Failure of the propositus' platelets to aggregate in response to TXA 2 formed in normal platelet-rich plasma induced by arachidonate confirmed this notion.
