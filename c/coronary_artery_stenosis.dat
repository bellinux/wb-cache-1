However, the exact role of Gal- 9 in atherosclerosis remains to be elucidated. Methods. Serum Gal- 9, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interferon- (IFN-) γ, interleukin- (IL-) 4, IL- 17, and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) β 1 were measured. The effect of Gal- 9 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was investigated in patients with normal <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> (NCA). Results. The lowest level of Gal- 9 was found in the ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) group, followed by the non-ST-segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS), the NCA, and the stable angina pectoris (SAP) groups, respectively. Additionally, Gal- 9 was found to be independently associated with hs-CRP, lipoprotein(a), and creatinine. Notably, Gal- 9 was also noted to be an independent predictor of the Gensini score. Moreover, Gal- 9 suppressed T-helper 17 (Th 17) and expanded regulatory T cells (Tregs), resulting in decreased IL- 17 production and increased secretion of TGF-β 1. Conclusions.

PATIENTS: Seventy women with limited exercise capacity referred for evaluation of myocardial ischemia. METHODS: DSE (up to 40 microg/kg/min) was performed in conjunction with stress MIBI SPECT. Resting MIBI images were acquired 24 h after the stress test. Ischemia was defined as new or worsened wall motion abnormalities confirmed by DSE and as reversible perfusion defects confirmed by MIBI. Significant coronary artery disease was defined as > or = 50 % luminal diameter stenosis. RESULTS: DSE was positive for ischemia in 35 of 45 patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and in 2 of 25 patients without <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (sensitivity = 78 % CI, 68 to 88; specificity = 92 % CI, 85 to 99; and accuracy = 83 % CI, 74 to 92). A positive MIBI study for ischemia occurred in 29 patients with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> and in 7 patients without <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (sensitivity = 64 % CI, 53 to 76; specificity = 72 % CI, 61 to 83; and accuracy = 67 % CI, 56 to 78 [p < 0. 05 vs DSE]). In the 59 vascular regions with <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis,</b> the regional sensitivity of DSE was higher than MIBI (69 % CI, 62 to 77 vs 51 % CI, 42 to 59, p < 0. 05), whereas specificity in the 81 vascular regions without significant stenosis was similar (89 % CI, 84 to 94 vs 88 % CI, 82 to 93, respectively).

The mean CACS was compared between patients with different severities of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The association between CACS and different CAD risk factors was determined as well. Different cutoff points of CACS for discriminating between different levels of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The mean CACS was significantly different between different levels of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (P< 0. 001) and there was a significant positive association between the severity of CAD and CACS (P< 0. 001,r= 0. 781).

Methods The study included 100 type 2 diabetic subjects (51 male and 49 female; mean age: 56 ± 7 years). Silent myocardial ischemia, as determined by CMR, was defined as evidence of inducible ischemia or myocardial infarction. Signal reduction or stenosis of ≥ 50 % in the vessel diameter {{was used as the}} criteria for significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> on coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. Results EAT thickness was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, postprandial glucose, fasting/postprandial triglyceride (TG), serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) level, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score. Significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> was found in 24 patients, while 14 patients had silent myocardial ischemia in CMR (1 with silent myocardial infarction, 11 with inducible ischemia, and 2 with both). EAT thickness was greater in patients who had <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> (13. 0 ± 2. 6 mm vs. 11. 5 ± 2. 1 mm, p = 0. 01), but did not differ between the subjects with or without silent myocardial ischemia on CMR images (12. 8 ± 2. 1 vs. 11. 7 ± 2. 3 mm, p = 0. 11). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that EAT thickness was an independent indicator for significant <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> after adjusting for traditional risk factors (OR 1. 403, p = 0. 026).

40|$|AbstractGrafting an {{internal}} thoracic <b>artery</b> to a <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> with moderate <b>stenosis</b> remains controversial. Competitive {{flow from the}} native <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> has been proposed {{as the cause of}} distal narrowing and ultimate failure of the internal thoracic artery graft. We investigated intraoperative phasic blood flow in internal thoracic <b>arteries</b> grafted to <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with various degrees of stenosis and the influence of stenosis on postoperative angiographic findings. One hundred patients who underwent <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> bypass grafting of {{an internal}} thoracic artery to the left anterior descending <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> were divided into three groups according to degree of coronary stenosis. Group 1 included 39 patients who had 75 % or less stenosis, group 2 included 34 patients with stenosis from 76 % to 90 %, and group 3 included 27 patients with stenosis greater than 90 %. Mean flow and peak systolic flow of internal thoracic artery graft in group 1 were lower than those in group 2 (p < 0. 01, p < 0. 05). Peak diastolic flow in group 1 showed no difference from flows in groups 2 and 3. In eight patients in group 1, internal thoracic artery flow showed a predominant diastolic peak with characteristic systolic reversal as a result of competitive flow from the native <b>coronary</b> <b>artery.</b> Angiography at 1 month showed that the internal thoracic artery graft was patent in every case. Relative contributions of native <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> and internal thoracic artery flow to distal perfusion differed among the three groups (p < 0. 001). In group 1, 15 % of patients showed native-dominant flow, 62 % showed balanced flow, and 23 % showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. In group 2, 9 % of patients showed native-dominant flow, 29 % showed balanced flow, and 62 % showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. In group 3, 96 % of patients showed internal thoracic artery–dependent flow. String sign of the internal thoracic artery graft developed in only three patients; in two of these patients internal thoracic arteries were grafted to <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with <b>stenosis</b> of 50 % or less and in the other patient there was competitive flow from a diagonal vein graft. Eleven of 13 internal thoracic <b>arteries</b> grafted to <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> with <b>stenosis</b> of 50 % or less did not show string sign.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that revascularisation guided by functional assessment of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> {{is superior to}} anatomical assessment by coronary angiography alone. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is now the established ‘gold standard’ for functional assessment of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> However, routine invasive coronary angiography and fractional flow reserve evaluation for all patients with chest pain is not feasible or economically viable. Therefore, it would be ideal {{if there is a}} non-invasive modality that can provide both anatomical and functional assessment of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> In this thesis, the utility of cardiac computed tomography for not only anatomical but also functional assessment of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis</b> was assessed. We confirmed that CT coronary angiography (CTA) has excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value but lacks specificity and positive predictive value. Meanwhile novel adjunct CT methods such as transluminal attenuation gradient (TAG 320) and adenosine stress CT perfusion (CTP) have modest accuracy for predicting significant FFR. More importantly, when TAG 320 and CTP are combined with CTA, there is incremental predictive value for predicting significant FFR. Some recent studies have highlighted the poor correlation between diameter stenosis on invasive coronary angiography and FFR. With this in mind, we evaluated adjunct predictors that improved the diagnostic accuracy of invasive coronary angiography for significant FFR. We showed that diameter stenosis alone on invasive coronary angiography has poor diagnostic accuracy for functional assessment of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>stenosis.</b> However, when lesion length and area of myocardium subtended by coronary stenosis is added to diameter stenosis (DILEMMA score), there is improvement in diagnostic accuracy...|$|E

Mann-Whitney U {{test was used to}} compare the angiographic scores with existence of tympanosclerosis. Results: Among the 203 patients, 35 (17 %) patients had angiographically normal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> without any atheroma plaque and 168 (83 %) had coronary atherosclerosis. In the otoscopic examination, tympanosclerosis was found in 14 patients (6. 9 %). No significant differences in distribution of clinical atherosclerotic risk factors (age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking and cholesterol levels) were found between groups with and without tympanosclerosis. Tympanosclerosis was found in 4 patients with normal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (11. 4 %). In the group of coronary atherosclerosis, 10 patients have tympanosclerosis (5. 9 %). In addition, there was no statistically significant association of <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> vessel, <b>stenosis</b> or extent scores of atherosclerosis with tympanosclerosis (p> 0. 05). Conclusions: We could not find any association between tympanosclerosis and angiographic extent and severity of atherosclerosis, contrary to other studies. More studies are needed to understand etiological mechanisms and association between them...|$|R
40|$|Background Women with {{clinical}} findings suggestive of ischemia but without findings of obstructive <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> disease (CAD) on angiography represent a frequent clinical problem; predicting prognosis is challenging. Methods The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study examined symptomatic women referred for clinically indicated coronary angiography and followed {{up for a}} mean 5. 2 years. The St James Women Take Heart (WTH) Project enrolled asymptomatic, community-based women with no {{history of heart disease}} who were followed up for 10 years. We compared cardiovascular events (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure) and death in 540 WISE women with suspected ischemia but no angiographic evidence of obstructive CAD with those from a cohort of 1000 age- and race-matched WTH women. Results: Compared with the WISE women, asymptomatic WTH women had a lower prevalence of obesity, family history of CAD, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (P <. 001). Five-year annualized event rates for cardiovascular events were 16. 0 % in WISE women with nonobstructive CAD (<b>stenosis</b> in any <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> of 1 %- 49 %), 7. 9 % in WISE women with normal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries</b> (<b>stenosis</b> of 0 % in all <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries),</b> and 2. 4 % in asymptomatic WTH women (P. 002), after adjusting for baseline CAD risk factors. The cardiovascular events were most frequent in women with 4 or more cardiac risk factors, with the 5 -year annualized cardiovascular event rate being 25. 3 % in women with nonobstructive CAD, 13. 9 % in WISE women with normal <b>coronary</b> <b>arteries,</b> and 6. 5 % in asymptomatic women (P = 3 D. 003). Conclusion: Women with symptoms and signs suggestive of ischemia but without obstructive CAD are at elevated risk for cardiovascular events compared with asymptomatic community-based women...|$|R
