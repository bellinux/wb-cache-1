5|$|Opinions {{are divided}} {{as to where}} in {{biological}} evolution <b>consciousness</b> emerged and {{about whether or not}} <b>consciousness</b> has any survival value. It has been argued that <b>consciousness</b> emerged (i) exclusively with the first humans, (ii) exclusively with the first mammals, (iii) independently in mammals and birds, or (iv) with the first reptiles. Other authors date the origins of <b>consciousness</b> to the first animals with nervous systems or early vertebrates in the Cambrian over 500 million years ago. Donald Griffin suggests in his book Animal Minds a gradual evolution of <b>consciousness.</b> Each of these scenarios raises the question of the possible survival value of <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|A tantric {{interpretation}} sees Shiva as <b>consciousness</b> and Kali {{as power}} or energy. <b>Consciousness</b> and energy are dependent upon each other, since Shiva depends on Shakti, or energy, {{in order to}} fulfill his role in creation, preservation, and destruction. In this view, without Shakti, Shiva is a corpse — unable to act.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or <b>consciousness,</b> and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine <b>consciousness.</b> In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on <b>consciousness,</b> but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss of <b>consciousness.</b> However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in <b>consciousness,</b> such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which loss of <b>consciousness</b> occurs.|$|E
5|$|If <b>consciousness</b> (the mind) {{can exist}} {{independently}} of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning <b>consciousness.</b> Dualism must therefore explain how <b>consciousness</b> affects physical reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit <b>consciousness</b> are considered disorders of <b>consciousness.</b> This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of <b>consciousness.</b> While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and delirium) or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of <b>consciousness,</b> they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on <b>consciousness</b> found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of <b>consciousness.</b> In partial epileptic seizures, <b>consciousness</b> is impaired or lost while some aspects of <b>consciousness,</b> often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of <b>consciousness</b> {{according}} to which <b>consciousness</b> is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of <b>consciousness</b> in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that <b>consciousness</b> has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious. Karl Popper develops in the book The Self and Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E

5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of <b>consciousness,</b> but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of <b>consciousness.</b> Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal <b>consciousness,</b> as well as QM interpretations of access <b>consciousness.</b> None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E

5|$|Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, first {{published}} in 1781 and presented again with major revisions in 1787, represents a significant intervention into what will later {{become known as the}} philosophy of mind. Kant's first critique is generally recognized as among the most significant works of modern philosophy in the West. Kant is a figure whose influence is marked in both continental and analytic/Anglo-American philosophy. Kant's work develops an in-depth study of transcendental <b>consciousness,</b> or {{the life of the mind}} as conceived through universal categories of <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
