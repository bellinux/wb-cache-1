40|$|Abstract Background <b>Clevudine</b> is a {{nucleoside}} analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor that exhibits potent antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) without serious side effects. However, mitochondrial myopathy {{has been observed}} in patients with chronic HBV infection taking <b>clevudine.</b> Moreover, the development of diabetes was recently reported in patients receiving long-term treatment with <b>clevudine.</b> In this study, we investigated the effects of <b>clevudine</b> on mitochondrial function and insulin release in a rat clonal β-cell line, INS- 1 E. Methods The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and the mRNA levels were measured by using quantitative PCR. MTT analysis, ATP/lactate measurements, and insulin assay were performed. Results Both INS- 1 E cells and HepG 2 cells, which originated from human hepatoma, showed dose-dependent decreases in mtDNA copy number and cytochrome c oxidase- 1 (Cox- 1) mRNA level following culture with <b>clevudine</b> (10 μM- 1 mM) for 4 weeks. INS- 1 E cells treated with <b>clevudine</b> had reduced total mitochondrial activities, lower cytosolic ATP contents, enhanced lactate production, and more lipid accumulation. Insulin release in response to glucose application was markedly decreased in clevudine-treated INS- 1 E cells, which might be a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions Our data suggest that high-dose treatment with <b>clevudine</b> induces mitochondrial defects associated with mtDNA depletion and impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in insulin-releasing cells. These findings partly explain the development of diabetes in patients receiving <b>clevudine</b> who might have a high susceptibility to mitochondrial toxicity. </p...|$|E

At week 48, <b>clevudine</b> therapy produced a significantly greater mean reductions in serum HBV DNA levels from baseline than lamivudine therapy (- 5. 2 vs. - 4. 2 log 10 IU/mL; P= 0. 005). Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients on <b>clevudine</b> achieved negative serum HBV DNA by PCR (< 13 IU/mL) at week 48 (60. 4 % vs. 38. 1 %; P= 0. 025).

40|$|Current therapies {{available}} {{for the treatment of}} chronic hepatitis B are limited in their ability to result in a cure. <b>Clevudine</b> is a new pyrimidine analog with potent anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity in vitro. A multicenter dose-escalation study evaluated <b>clevudine</b> at 10, 50, 100, and 200 mg once daily for 28 days. Eligible patients had HBV DNA levels of 3 × 106 copies/mL or more, had not undergone nucleoside treatment, and were without human immunodeficiency or hepatitis C virus coinfection. Thirty-two patients were enrolled (5, 10, 10, and 7 patients in the 10 -, 50 -, 100 -, and 200 -mg dose groups, respectively), 81 % were male, 81 % Asian, and 88 % were hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg) positive at baseline. Median pretreatment serum HBV DNA levels ranged from 7. 3 to 8. 8 log 10 copies/mL. After 28 days, the median HBV DNA log 10 change from baseline was − 2. 5, − 2. 7, − 3. 0, and − 2. 6 log 10. Six months after dosing, median changes from baseline were − 1. 2, − 1. 4, − 2. 7 and − 1. 7 log 10 in the 10 -, 50 -, 100 -, and 200 -mg cohorts, respectively. Six of 27 patients lost HBeAg, and 3 of 27 patients seroconverted to HBe antibody. <b>Clevudine</b> was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicities. A transient increase in alanine aminotransferase of up to 7. 8 times the upper limit of normal (increase ranged from 20 to 186 IU/L) was observed in six patients in the 100 -mg cohort, without signs of liver failure. These increases were associated with improved viral suppression. The pharmacokinetic profile of <b>clevudine</b> was proportional to the dose.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the treatment outcomes of <b>clevudine</b> compared with entecavir in antiviral-naive {{patients with chronic}} hepatitis B (CHB). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of CHB patients treated with <b>clevudine</b> 30 mg/d and compared their clinical outcomes with patients treated with entecavir 0. 5 mg/d. The biochemical response, as assessed by serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, virologic response, as assessed by serum hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) titer, serologic response, as assessed by hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status, and virologic breakthrough with genotypic mutations were assessed. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-four patients [clevudine (n = 118) vs entecavir (n = 136) ] were enrolled. In clevudine-treated patients, the cumulative rates of serum ALT normalization were 83. 9 % at week 48 and 91. 5 % at week 96 (80. 9 % and 91. 2 % in the entecavir group, respectively), the mean titer changes in serum HBV DNA were - 6. 03 and - 6. 55 log 10 copies/mL (- 6. 35 and - 6. 86 log 10 copies/mL, respectively, in the entecavir group), and the cumulative non-detection rates of serum HBV DNA were 72. 6 % and 83. 1 % (74. 4 % and 83. 8 %, respectively, in the entecavir group). These results {{were similar to those}} of entecavir-treated patients. The cumulative rates of HBeAg seroconversion were 21. 8 % at week 48 and 25. 0 % at week 96 in patients treated with <b>clevudine,</b> which was similar to patients treated with entecavir (22. 8 % and 27. 7 %, respectively). The virologic breakthrough in the <b>clevudine</b> group occurred in 9 (7. 6 %) patients at weeks 48 and 15 (12. 7 %) patients at week 96, which primarily corresponded to genotypic mutations of rtM 204 I and/or rtL 180 M. There was no virologic breakthrough in the entecavir group.

40|$|Nos últimos anos, houve um grande progresso no tratamento da hepatite B crônica. Cinco drogas são hoje aprovadas para tratamento dessa virose: intérferon alfa, lamivudina, adefovir, {{entecavir}} e telbivudina. Os intérferons (convencionais ou peguilados) foram as primeiras drogas utilizadas no tratamento dessas infecções podendo levar a resposta sustentada (perda do DNA-VHB e do AgHbe) em até um terço dos casos tratados. Um grande número de análogos de nucleosídeos/nucleotídeos estão no momento, disponíveis para tratar a hepatite B; a eficácia da lamivudina, o primeiro análogo de nucleosídeo utilizado, é limitada pela elevada incidência de resistência. O adefovir tem eficácia comparável à lamivudina porém baixa freqüência de resistência. Entecavir e tenofovir também se mostram muito ativos em controlar a replicação do vírus da hepatite B, e estão associados com mínimo desenvolvimento de resistência, mesmo em tratamento prolongados. Outras drogas, tais como telbivudina, emtricitabina e <b>clevudine,</b> se tornarão em futuro próximo, novas armas no controle dessa virose. Co-infectados HIV/VHB representam um grupo de doentes de difícil manuseio e que hoje se beneficiam com combinações de drogas no esquema anti-retroviral potente que devem atuar em ambas as viroses. O desenvolvimento de antivirais mais potentes e novas associações de medicamentos, conjuntamente com a melhor compreensão dos mecanismos de resistência do vírus da hepatite B a terapia são importantes conquistas para melhorar a eficácia do tratamento e diminuir no futuro, a carga global de portadores do vírus da hepatite B.

Five drugs are now approved for the treatment of this virosis: interferon alpha, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. Interferons (conventional or PEG) were the first medicine used in the treatment of hepatitis being able to lead the persistent response (loss of DNA-HBV and of AgHbe) to up to one third of treated cases. A large number of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are, at present, available to treat hepatitis B. The efficacy of lamivudine, the first nucleoside analogue used, is limited by the high rate of resistance. Adefovir has efficacy comparable to that of lamivudine, but with low resistance rate. Entecavir and tenofovir have also been particularly active in the control of hepatitis B virus replication and are associated with minimal resistance development, even during long treatment regimens.

30|$|Hepatitis B {{infection}} {{caused by}} the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can become either acute or chronic diseases. HBV infections are among the top ten causes of death, and lead to 0.89  million deaths every year. It is estimated that 257  million people are living with chronic HBV infection. China {{is one of the}} high prevalence areas accounting for one-third of the infections. The major complications of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1, 2]. Hepatitis B vaccination is effective in preventing HBV infections; however, it is invalid to those who have already been infected with HBV. Interferons and nucleoside analogs are the most common drugs for CHB in clinic. Interferons (INF-α and PegIFN-α) take effects by enhancing the immune system of patients, but their application is limited by the low curing rate and serious side effects. Nucleoside analogues (mainly lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, telbivudine, entecavir, tenofovir disoprox and <b>clevudine)</b> can inhibit HBV replication by targeting on viral DNA polymerase; however, the drug-resistance and relapse are challenging after long-term treatment [3, 4, 5]. Currently, there is no cure for CHB, and new treatment methods with unprecedented targets are urgently needed. Traditional Chinese herbs that have long been used for medicinal purpose in China are fascinating sources for anti-HBV candidates [6, 7].

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the influence of these mutations on viral replication and resistance to antiviral agents. We investigated the replication fitness and susceptibility of the wild-type and five mutant HBVs (L 528 M, M 552 I, M 552 V, L 528 M/M 552 I, and L 528 M/M 552 V) to 11 compounds [lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir (BMS- 200475) (+) -BCH- 189 (±) -FTC (racivir) (–) -FTC (emtricitabine) (+) -FTC, L-D 4 FC, L-FMAU (<b>clevudine),</b> D-DAPD, and (–) -carbovir] by transfecting HBV DNA into hepatoma cells and monitoring viral products by Southern blotting. The replication competency of the single C-domain mutants M 552 I and M 552 V was markedly decreased compared with that of wild-type HBV.

40|$|Forty {{years ago}} in 1967, Professor Blumberg {{discovered}} the Australian Antigen, later known as the hepatitis B surface antigen, and was awarded the Nobel Prize. This discovery enables the diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and defines its epidemiology.

The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the previously unknown compensatory mutations, and to determine the clinical relevance of this mutation during antiviral therapy. In vitro mutagenesis, drug susceptibility assay, and molecular modeling studies were performed. The rtL 269 I substitution conferred 2 - to 7 -fold higher replication capacity in the wild-type (WT) or YMDD mutation backbone, regardless of drug treatment. The rtL 269 I substitution alone did not confer resistance to LMV, ETV, adefovir (ADV), or tenofovir (TDF). However, upon combination with YMDD mutation, the replication capacity under LMV or ETV treatment was enhanced by several folds. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the rtL 269 I substitution affects template binding, which may eventually lead to the enhanced activity of rtI 269 -HBV polymerase in both WT virus and YMDD mutant. The clinical relevance of the rtL 269 I substitution was validated by its emergence in association with YMDD mutation in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with sub-optimal response or treatment failure to LMV or CLV.

40|$|Oral nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NAs) are the {{mainstay}} of therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B, and are generally well tolerated. Despite this, the safety profile of NAs {{is of paramount importance}} since the majority of patients will require long-term treatment. All NAs can potentially affect human DNA polymerase with decrease in mitochondrial DNA, leading to manifestations of mitochondrial toxicity. As a class effect therefore, NAs can potentially cause extra-hepatic conditions such as myopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and lactic acidosis. Indeed, effects on muscles including myopathy and creatine kinase elevations have been described with <b>clevudine</b> and telbivudine use. Both adefovir and tenofovir are associated with dose-dependent nephropathy, predominantly affecting the proximal renal tubules. Neuropathy appears to be rare, and most commonly reported in patients receiving combination therapy with telbivudine and interferon. Increased risk of lactic acidosis has also been described for those with impaired liver and renal function taking entecavir. Loss of bone mineral density and hypophosphatemia has been described with the use of nucleotide analogues, although the overwhelming studies have been with HIV-infected patients. However, not all extra-hepatic effects are detrimental. Recent evidence has suggested a potential renal beneficial effect with the use of telbivudine. The effect of NAs on pregnancy appears to be minimal for all NAs, with telbivudine and tenofovir having a more favorable category B rating.

40|$|New {{antiviral}} agents currently {{evaluated for}} the treatment of HBeAg–negative chronic hepatitis B include adefovir, entecavir and some other newer nucleoside analogues. Adefovir, a nucleotide analogue of adenosine, is expected to be soon available in clinical practice. The recommended 10 mg daily dose is safe and well tolerated. In a phase III clinical trial, a 48 -week course of adefovir was recently shown to achieve histologic improvement, inhibition of HBV replication and biochemical remission in the majority of HBeAg– negative chronic hepatitis B patients. Adefovir is also effective against lamivudine resistant HBV strains, while no evidence of resistance to adefovir has been detected to date. Entecavir, a guanosine analogue, has initially been shown to suppress HBV replication given even in a low dose of 0. 1 mg daily. In a recent phase III trial including lamivudine resistant HBV patients, a 24 -week course of entecavir at daily doses of 0. 5 mg or 1. 0 mg achieved significantly greater reduction of serum HBV-DNA levels than the low 0. 1 mg entecavir dose or continuation of lamivudine. Entecavir was safe and well tolerated and is currently under evaluation within several phase III trials.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} the antiviral effect {{of a combination of}} two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, emtricitabine (FTC) and <b>clevudine</b> (L-FMAU), with the addition of an adenovirus-driven delivery of recombinant gamma interferon (IFN-γ) in the woodchuck model of hepatitis B virus infection. Six woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) -infected woodchucks received L-FMAU (10 mg/kg) plus FTC (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 8 weeks; six other animals received in addition an intravenous injection of a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing woodchuck IFN-γ (Ad-IFN) at weeks 4 and 8. In the control group, two animals received Ad-IFN alone, two received adenovirus vector expressing the green fluorescent protein reporter gene, and one remained untreated. In less than 2 weeks, all woodchucks that received L-FMAU plus FTC showed a rapid and marked inhibition of viral replication, with a 4 -log 10 drop in serum WHV DNA. In two animals, viremia remained suppressed for several months after the end of treatment. Similarly, a dramatic decrease in intrahepatic replicative intermediates of viral DNA was observed in the L-FMAU/FTC-treated groups. The additional administration of Ad-IFN led to increased inflammation in the liver but did not enhance the antiviral effect of the L-FMAU/FTC combination. In conclusion, therapies combining L-FMAU and FTC in WHV-infected woodchucks resulted in a potent and sustained antihepadnaviral effect both in the liver and in the blood circulation. However, no extra benefit of adding IFN-γ gene transduction to the L-FMAU/FTC combination could be detected...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Modeling of {{short-term}} viral dynamics of hepatitis B with traditional biphasic model might be insufficient to explain long-term viral dynamics. The {{aim was to}} develop a novel method of mathematical modeling to shed light on the dissociation between early and long-term dynamics in previous studies. METHODS: We investigated the viral decay pattern in 50 patients from the phase III clinical trial of 24 -week <b>clevudine</b> therapy, who showed virological response and HBsAg decline. Immune effectors were added as a new compartment in the model equations. We determined some parameter values in the model using the non-linear least square minimization method. RESULTS: Median baseline viral load was 8. 526 Log(10) copies/mL, and on-treatment viral load decline was 5. 683 Log(10) copies/mL. The median half-life of free virus was 24. 89 hours. The median half-life of infected hepatocytes was 7. 39 days. The viral decay patterns were visualized as triphasic curves with decreasing slopes over time: fastest decay in the first phase; slowest in the third phase; the second phase in between. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, mathematical modeling of hepatitis B in patients with virological response and HBsAg decline during 24 -week antiviral therapy showed triphasic viral dynamics with direct introduction of immune effectors as a new compartment, which was thought to reflect the reduction of clearance rate of infected cells over time. This modeling method seems more appropriate to describe long-term viral dynamics compared to the biphasic model, and needs further validation...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: Chronic {{hepatitis}} B {{infection is}} a common cause of secondary membranous nephropathy (MN) in endemic areas. Lamivudine treatment improves renal outcome in patients with hepatitis B virus-associated MN (HBV-MN), but prolonged use leads {{to the emergence of}} lamivudine-resistant variants. We describe our experience treating lamivudine-resistant and other strains of HBV-MN with new antiviral drugs. Methods: Of the 89 patients biopsied and diagnosed with MN from 1996 to 2011, 10 positive for hepatitis B surface antigen were recruited for this study. We investigated the clinical courses, therapeutic responses, and prognoses of patients with HBV-MN. Results: The incidence of HBV-MN among the original 89 patients was 11. 2 %. Of these patients, four were treated with supportive care and six with antiviral drugs. One of the four patients treated with supportive care had a spontaneous remission. Four of the six patients treated with antiviral drugs were given lamivudine, and the other two were given entecavir. Two of the four patients treated with lamivudine achieved complete remission with seroconversion (i. e., development of anti-hepatitis B e antigen antibodies), whereas the other two had lamivudine-resistant strains, which were detected at 22 and 23 months after lamivudine treatment, respectively. We added adefovir to the treatment regimen for one of these patients, and for the other patient we substituted <b>clevudine</b> for lamivudine. Both of these patients experienced complete remission, as did the two patients initially treated with entecavir, neither of whom showe...|$|E
40|$|Three {{hundred and}} fifty million people {{worldwide}} {{are estimated to be}} chronically infected with hepatitis B virus. 15 - 40 % of these subjects will develop cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma during their life. The treatment of chronic hepatitis B has improved dramatically over the last decade thanks to the advent of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues and the use of pegylated interferons. However, these agents have increased the complexity of the management of hepatitis B. Five drugs have been approved for chronic hepatitis B treatment: standard interferon-alpha 2 b, pegylated interferon-alpha 2 a, lamivudine, adefovir dipivoxil, and entecavir. A definite course of standard or pegylated interferon is administered to induce hepatitis B virus clearance. Unfortunately, these agents are not effective in all patients and are associated with not negligible side effects. Nucleoside or nucleotide analogues that inhibit hepatitis B virus polymerase induce on-treatment suppression of viral replication but patients tend to relapse after cessation of treatment. Consequently, these analogues, which are well tolerated, should be used for prolonged periods, even indefinitely. However, prolonged treatment is associated with a high rate of resistance. The following anti-hepatitis B virus drugs are currently undergoing clinical testing: telbivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, <b>clevudine</b> and thymosin-+/- 1.

These infections can lead to cirrhosis and hepatic cancer. Standard treatment, although with improved therapeutic results still exhibits resistance and relapses. New antiviral agents have been developed to further improve results and reduce adverse events. For hepatitis B, along with pegylated interferon a- 2 a, other drugs that have been approved include lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine and tenofovir, while emtricitabine and <b>clevudine</b> are awaiting FDA approval. Possible combination drug therapy may improve efficacy without engendering resistance. For hepatitis C, standard therapy has been the combination of Peg-IFN/Ribavarin. Genotype 1 of the virus, which is widespread in the USA and Europe, can be resistant to treatment especially with high viral load. Directly acting antiviral agents (DAAs), are being developed. These are: i) HCV NS 3 protease inhibitors, such as telaprevir and boceprevir, which are currently approved by the FDA. Several other compounds are in phase I-II development; ii) NS 5 B polymerase inhibitors, which target HCV replication. These include mericitabine (a nucleoside analogue inhibitor) currently in phase III trials, and nonnucleiside inhibitors; iii) New intreferons such as pgylated interferonl, which are also on trial.

40|$|To design new {{strategies}} of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B, we have evaluated the antiviral {{activity of the}} combination of amdoxovir (DAPD), emtricitabine [(−) FTC], and <b>clevudine</b> (l-FMAU) in the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) model. Using their triphosphate (TP) derivatives in a cell-free system expressing a wild-type active DHBV reverse transcriptase (RT), the three dual combinations exhibited a greater additive inhibitory effect on viral minus-strand DNA synthesis than the single drugs, according to the Bliss independence model. Both dual combinations with DAPD TP were the most efficient while the triple combination increased the inhibitory effect on the DHBV RT activity {{in comparison with the}} dual association, however, without additive effect. Postinoculation treatment of experimentally infected primary duck hepatocytes showed that dual and triple combinations potently inhibited viral DNA synthesis during treatment but did not inhibit the reinitiation of viral DNA synthesis after treatment cessation. Preinoculation treatment with the same combinations exhibited antiviral effects on intracellular viral DNA replication, but it was unable to prevent the initial covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) formation. Short-term in vivo treatment in acutely infected ducklings showed that the dual combinations were more-potent inhibitors of virus production than the single treatments, with the l-FMAU and FTC combination being the most potent. A longer administration of l-FMAU and FTC for 4 weeks efficiently suppressed viremia and viral replication. However, no viral clearance from the liver was observed, suggesting that the enhanced antiviral effect of this combination was not sufficient for cccDNA suppression and HBV eradication from infected cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Clevudine</b> (CLV) is a {{nucleoside}} analog with potent antiviral activity against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Viral resistance to CLV in patients receiving CLV therapy {{has not been}} reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize CLV-resistant HBV in patients with viral breakthrough (BT) during long-term CLV therapy. The gene encoding HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) was analyzed from chronic hepatitis B patients with viral BT during CLV therapy. Sera collected from the patients at baseline and at the time of viral BT were studied. To characterize the mutations of HBV isolated from the patients, we subjected the HBV mutants to in vitro drug susceptibility assays. Several conserved mutations were identified in the RT domain during viral BT, with M 204 I being the most common. In vitro phenotypic analysis showed that the mutation M 204 I was predominantly associated with CLV resistance, whereas L 229 V was a compensatory mutation for the impaired replication of the M 204 I mutant. A quadruple mutant (L 129 M, V 173 L, M 204 I, and H 337 N) was identified that conferred greater replicative ability and strong resistance to both CLV and lamivudine. All of the CLV-resistant clones were lamivudine resistant. They were susceptible to adefovir, entecavir, and tenofovir, except for one mutant clone. In conclusion, the mutation M 204 I in HBV RT plays a major role in CLV resistance and leads to viral BT during long-term CLV treatment. Several conserved mutations may have a compensatory role in replication. Drug susceptibility assays reveal that adefovir and tenofovir are the most effective compounds against CLV-resistant mutants. These data may provide additional therapeutic options for CLV-resistant patients...|$|E
40|$|Emtricitabine (FTC) is {{approved}} {{for the treatment}} of human immunodeficiency virus. FTC and <b>clevudine</b> (CLV) have activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). This report summarizes the results of a double-blind, multicenter study of patients with chronic hepatitis B who had completed a phase 3 study of FTC and were randomized 1 : 1 to 200 mg FTC once daily (QD) plus 10 mg CLV QD or 200 mg FTC QD plus placebo for 24 weeks with 24 weeks of follow-up. One hundred sixty-three patients were treated (82 with FTC plus CLV [FTC+CLV] and 81 with FTC); 72 % were men, 53 % were Asian, 47 % were Caucasian, and 52 % were hepatitis B e antigen positive, and the median baseline HBV DNA level was 6 log 10 copies/ml. After 24 weeks of treatment, 74 % (FTC+CLV) versus 65 % (FTC alone) had serum HBV DNA levels of < 4, 700 copies/ml (P = 0. 114) (Digene HBV Hybrid Capture II assay). Twenty-four weeks posttreatment, the mean change in serum HBV DNA levels from baseline was − 1. 25 log 10 copies/ml (FTC+CLV), 40 % had undetectable viremia (versus 23 % for FTC alone), and 63 % had normal alanine aminotransferase levels (versus 42 % for FTC alone) (P ≤ 0. 025 for all endpoints). The safety profile was similar between arms during treatment, with less posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis B in the combination arm. In summary, after 24 weeks of treatment, no significant difference between arms was observed, but there was a significantly greater virologic and biochemical response 24 weeks posttreatment in the FTC+CLV arm...|$|E
40|$|Antiviral {{resistance}} {{is now the}} single most important factor in treatment failure using nucleos(t) ide analogues (NA). Primary drug resistance mutations refer to amino acid change(s) that result in reduced susceptibility to an antiviral agent. Secondary compensatory mutations restore replication defects associated with primary drug resistance and may be associated with low level reduced susceptibility. Several evolutionary pathways of drug resistant HBV have been observed in patients treated with NAs. It is possible that the drug resistance mutations selected with one agent may affect the efficacy of other NAs. Several major HBV-evolutionary NA-resistance pathways (rtM 204 I/V, rtN 236 T and rtA 181 T/V) have now been characterised. The rtM 204 V/I pathway is responsible for resistance to the l-nucleosides, such as lamivudine (LMV), telbivudine (LdT) and <b>clevudine</b> (CLD), and also entecavir (ETV), whilst the rtN 236 T pathway is responsible for adefovir (ADV) and tenofovir (TFV) resistance. Both pathways are associated with clusters of secondary mutations that can affect subsequent treatment with NAs (rtT 184 G, rtS 202 I) such as ETV. The third pathway, rtA 181 T/V, is associated with resistance to LMV and ADV and is a potential multi-drug resistance pathway and will probably have an impact on TFV sensitivity, either alone or with the rtN 236 T. In naïve patients treated with ETV, atleast three mutations arising at the same time are required: rtL 180 M + rtM 204 V plus either one of rtT 184, rtS 202 or rtM 250 codon changes. Finally, in highly drug-experienced patients, clusters of mutations such as rtA 181 T/I 233 V/N 236 T/M 250 L, all on the one dominant HBV genome, are being detected which are associated with multi-drug resistance. Sequential treatment with nucleos(t) ide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) promotes multidrug resistance. It is likely, therefore, that development of multi-drug resistance could be reduced by combination therapy optimised to individual viral phenotypes...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} shown that in acute severeflares of hepatitis, liver {{stiffness}} measurements can be increaseddramatically. In contrast to severe hepatitis flares, it is notknown currently whether lesser degrees of hepatitis alsoincrease liver stiffness measurements. In the present study weaimed to investigate the effect of mild-to-moderate elevations ofALT on liver stiffness in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patientsand Methods: Patients with chronic hepatitis B and elevated ALTwere included. Those patients with ALT elevations of greaterthan 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN), indicating severe flareswere not included. All patients underwent liver biopsy and liverstiffness measurement for assessment of liver fibrosis prior tostarting antiviral therapy. Oral antiviral therapy (adefovir n= 14, <b>clevudine</b> n= 24) was commenced after liver biopsy andliver stiffness measurement was performed. Once ALT normal-ization was achieved, a repeat liver stiffness measurement wasperformed. Results Thirty-eight patients were included, of which 21 were male, with a median age of 39 years (range, 18 - 63). All patients achieved normalization of ALT after commencement of antiviral therapy, and the median time between the first andsecond liver stiffness measurement was 3 months (range, 1 - 7). There was a significantly lower mean liver stiffness measure-ments after the commencement of antiviral therapy with the nor-malization of ALT levels, compared to pre-treatment levels in the 38 patients (7. 5 vs 10. 5 kPa respectively, p< 0. 001). Themedian liver stiffness reduction observed in patients with pre-treatment ALT of 1 - 2 x ULN, 2 - 5 X ULN, and 5 - 10 x ULN were 0. 9, 1. 4, and 3. 9 kPa respectively, with an overall reduction of 2. 0 kPa. The higher the pre-treatment ALT, the higher the liverstiffness reduction observed (p= 0. 027). The AUROC curve fordiagnosing F 2 fibrosis in patients with elevated ALT was 0. 68,compared with 0. 73 for the same patients after ALT normaliza-tion. No patients had evidence of cirrhosis on liver histology. Using the cutoff value of 11. 0 kPa for cirrhosis, 12 (32 %) patients would have been misclassified as having cirrhosisusing liver stiffness measurements taken at the time of ALT ele-vation. In contrast, 6 (16 %) patients would have been misclas-sified as having cirrhosis using liver stiffness measurements atthe time where ALT had normalized. Conclusion: Even mild tomoderate elevation in ALT levels may increase liver stiffnessmeasurements independent of underlying liver fibrosis. HigherALT levels were associated with higher discrepancies in liverstiffness. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

We aimed to investigate the effect of longterm NA on the suppression of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) and intrahepatic HBV DNA (ihHBV-DNA). METHODS: We recruited 40 patients (median age 44. 2 years, range 24. 3 - 63. 2) {{who had been on}} continuous long-term (5 – 10 years) NA. All patients had 3 liver biopsies: at baseline, after 1 year of treatment and at the last follow-up. Serum HBV DNA and HBsAg were measured by the COBAS TaqMan HBV Test and the Elecsys HBsAg II Assay, respectively (both Roche Diagnostics). ihHBV-DNA and cccDNA were assayed by real-time PCR, with lower limits of detection of 0. 001 and 0. 005 copies/cell, respectively. RESULTS: The median duration of treatment was 10. 5 years (range: 6. 0 – 11. 9 years). At baseline, 13 patients had 100 mg lamivudine, 11 had 600 mg telbivudine, 9 had 0. 5 mg entecavir, 4 had 30 mg <b>clevudine,</b> and 3 had 10 mg adefovir. At the last follow up, these patients were on 0. 5 - 1. 0 mg entecavir (n= 23), 600 mg telbivudine (n= 9), 10 mg adefovir (n= 4), 300 mg tenofovir (n= 2), or combination therapy of lamivudine plus adefovir/tenofovir (n= 2). Histology of the third biopsy showed complete resolution of interface hepatitis in 60 % of patients with the remainder showing mild-to-moderate activity. Persistent immunoreactivity for HBsAg was found in 80 %, the mean number of hepatocytes positive for HBsAg being 10. 4 % (range 1 - 80 %). All but 1 (2. 5 %) was immunoreactive for HBcAg. At baseline, the median serum HBV DNA, HBsAg, ihHBV-DNA and cccDNA levels were 6. 84 logIU/mL, 3. 38 logIU/mL, 286 copies/cell, and 7. 3 copies/cell, respectively. At the time of the last biopsies, 36 (90 %) patients had undetectable serum HBV DNA (< 20 IU/mL), all but one patient still had detectable HBsAg (median: 2. 74 logIU/mL), all had detectable ihHBV-DNA (median: 0. 4 copies/cell), but 18 (45 %) patients had undetectable cccDNA. There was a trend of reduction of HBsAg, ihHBV-DNA and cccDNA levels from baseline to 1 year to last follow-up (all p< 0. 0001). The median log drop of HBsAg at last biopsy was 0. 55 logIU/mL. The median percentage reductions of HBsAg, ihHBV-DNA and cccDNA at last biopsies were 71. 46 %, 99. 85 % and 99. 89 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term NA treatment significantly reduced cccDNA and ihDNA. 45 % of patients had undetectable cccDNA, although small amount of ihHBV-DNA were still detectable in all patients. Integrated HBV DNA may be a possible source of detectable ihHBV-DNA and HBsAg. Continuous long-term NA therapy can reduce cccDNA to undetectable levels, suggesting a possible end-point of treatment. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
