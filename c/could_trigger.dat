5|$|Season 6, set 20 months later, {{begins at}} 6:00a.m. Jack is {{released}} after being detained in a Chinese prison following {{the events of}} Season 5. Terrorists who hold a vendetta against Jack plot to set off suitcase nuclear devices in America. Later, Jack is {{forced to choose between}} those he loves and national security when the Chinese set their sights on sensitive circuitry that <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> a war between the U.S. and Russia.|$|E
5|$|In Colima and Jalisco, {{residents}} were warned of heavy rains that <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> flooding and mudslides. Schools across both states canceled classes for June21. In Colima, 236 shelters were {{opened to the}} public. Additionally, the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief. A total of 980 temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero, {{many of which were}} in Acapulco, as many {{residents were}} expected to evacuate flood-prone area. An orange-level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains. Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (National Weather Service) advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of Beatriz.|$|E
5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1951, Sydney {{was part}} of an eighteen-ship fleet present in Sydney Harbour to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of Australia's Federation. Following this, the carrier joined a multinational training exercise in south-east Australian waters, then visited Hobart for the Royal Hobart Regatta. During the exercise, a Sea Fury accidentally fired four practice rockets into the superstructure of the New Zealand flagship, : although an inquiry concluded that the pilot had unintentionally pressed the fire button, it was later found that certain signal frequencies transmitted by Sydneys radio aerials <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> a Fury's firing circuits. Sydney was presented with the Gloucester Cup in April 1951, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN for 1950. The two CAGs were switched over in April, and on 3 May, a Sea Fury crashed during a rocket-assisted take off; the pilot became the carrier's first fatality.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian {{physicist}} Leó Szilárd, who {{was living}} in the United States at the time, realized that the neutron-driven fission of heavy atoms could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could yield vast amounts of energy for electric power generation or atomic bombs. Such a reaction using neutrons was an idea he had first formulated in 1933, upon reading Ernest Rutherford's disparaging remarks about generating power from his team's 1932 experiment using protons to split lithium. However, Szilárd {{had not been able to}} achieve a neutron-driven chain reaction with neutron-rich light atoms. In theory, if in a neutron-driven chain reaction the number of secondary neutrons produced was greater than one, then each such reaction <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> multiple additional reactions, producing an exponentially increasing number of reactions.|$|E

25|$|In July, 2017 Lloyd's {{published}} a risk-modeling report {{in conjunction with}} Cyence examining the possible economic losses from a major, global cyber attack. The conclusion was that such a global attack <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> losses averaging US$53 billion.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} wave from an underground explosion will propagate through {{the ground and}} cause a minor earthquake. Theory suggests that a nuclear explosion <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> fault rupture and cause a major quake at distances within a few tens of kilometers from the shot point.|$|E
25|$|The AFL-CIO's support enraged the Communist {{regimes of}} Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Its support worried the Carter Administration, whose Secretary of State Edmund Muskie told Kirkland that the AFL-CIO's {{continued}} support of solidarity <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> a Soviet invasion of Poland.|$|E

25|$|Each timing {{pulse in}} a {{subsequence}} <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> up to 5 control pulses. The control pulses were the signals which did the actual {{work of the}} instruction, such as reading {{the contents of a}} register onto the bus, or writing data from the bus into a register.|$|E
25|$|High {{caffeine}} consumption {{has been}} linked to an increase in the likelihood of one's experiencing auditory hallucinations. A study conducted by the La Trobe University School of Psychological Sciences revealed that as few as five cups of coffee a day (approximately 500mg of caffeine) <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> the phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Few provisions, however, {{were made}} to {{actually}} disarm the militias. The United Nations Security Council deployed about 90liaison personnel in August 1999 to support the ceasefire. However, in the following months all sides accused the others of repeatedly breaking the cease-fire, and {{it became clear that}} small incidents <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> attacks.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, {{the first}} Turkish bank Türkiye İş Bankası was established. The bank's {{creation}} {{was a response}} to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives and, where necessary, extending resources which <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> industrial impetus.|$|E
25|$|One {{attraction}} of large impact theories is that theoretically they <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> other cause-considered extinction-paralleling phenomena, {{such as the}} Siberian Traps eruptions (see below) as being either an impact site or the antipode of an impact site. The abruptness of an impact also explains why more species did not rapidly evolve to survive, {{as would be expected}} if the Permian-Triassic event had been slower and less global than a meteorite impact.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, {{with the}} {{initiative}} of Mustafa Kemal, the first Turkish bank İş Bankası was established. He was {{the first member of}} İş Bankası.

25|$|ENIAC was a modular computer, {{composed}} of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these modules were accumulators {{which could not}} only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory. Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, as they were called). In order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> different operations, depending on {{the sign of a}} computed result.|$|E
25|$|In some areas, {{emergency}} responders {{are provided}} with specialized equipment, such as a Mobile Infrared Transmitter, which allows emergency response vehicles, particularly fire-fighting apparatus, to have high-priority travel by having the lights along their route change to green. The technology behind these methods has evolved, from panels at the fire department (which <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> and control green lights for certain major corridors) to optical systems (which the individual fire apparatus can be equipped with to communicate directly with receivers on the signal head). In other areas, public transport buses have special equipment to get green lights.|$|E
25|$|At the {{check-in}} counter, passengers' passports and {{tickets are}} closely examined. A passport without a sticker from the security checkers {{will not be}} accepted. At passport control passengers' names are checked against information from the FBI, Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Scotland Yard, Shin Bet, and Interpol databases. Luggage is screened and sometimes hand searched. In addition, bags are put through a decompression chamber simulating pressures during flight that <b>could</b> <b>trigger</b> explosives. Even at overseas airports, El Al security agents conduct all luggage searches personally, {{even if they are}} supervised by government or private security firms.|$|E
