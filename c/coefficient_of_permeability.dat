The influences <b>of</b> the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> and compressibility <b>of</b> soil on the excess pore pressure distribution are different and cannot be incorporated into the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> consolidation in double-layered soil. The relative <b>permeability</b> ratio <b>of</b> two clayey soils also plays an important role on the curves of the distributions of the excess pore pressures. The effects of the thickness of the soil layer on the excess pore pressure distribution should be considered together with the dimensionless parameter θ and the <b>permeability</b> and compressibility <b>of</b> the double-layered soil system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the results <b>of</b> the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> consolidation in the horizontal direction determined from the laboratory and the field through testing, along with back analysis from settlement measurement of embankment constructed with prefabricated vertical drains at the Suvarnabhumi Airport site in Bangkok. Constant rate of strain consolidation tests with radial drainage and standard oedometer tests were conducted to provide the consolidation characteristics of soft Bangkok clay. A 20 -mm piezoprobe {{was used to measure}} the pore water pressure dissipation characteristics of the soft clay in the field, and the corresponding horizontal <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> consolidation were estimated based on established theory. The test results, such as the horizontal <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> consolidation and <b>permeability,</b> were compared with back analysis of the constructed runway embankment based on Asaoka method. The results show very good agreement in both horizontal <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> consolidation and <b>permeability</b> obtained from different testing methods and back analysis, implying the reliability of the testing methods adopted...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of experimental and analytical assessment of electrical and hydrodynamic parameters of clay soils {{as a result}} of physical and computer modelled processes in electroosmotic treatment zone is presented. The algorithm is given for calculation <b>of</b> the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> hydraulic <b>permeability,</b> electroosmotic permeability and electroosmotic activity comprising the determination of geometric boundaries of the zones subjected to electric treatment, the initial filtration rate, and the calculation of the electric field and pressure. Spatial and temporal projections of dependent parameters at different stages of electric treatment are obtained...|$|R
