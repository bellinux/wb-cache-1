40|$|<b>Contingency</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreements</b> {{between local}} tax {{assessors}} and contract auditors {{on the one}} hand, and property owners and private tax consultants on the other, create perverse financial incentives that undermine the integrity {{of state and local}} tax administration. When local governments engage outside auditors to identify undervalued or escaped taxable property, the practice raises serious due process and ethical concerns. As a matter of policy, diverting a share of property tax revenue to private third parties in consideration for outsourced tax assessment services undermines public accountability and reduces net property tax revenue for local government services. And when states allow private tax consultants to use <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreements</b> to solicit clients seeking to reduce their share of local property taxes, they unwittingly divert substantial tax revenue to private entrepreneurs. The associated private transaction cost of seeking uniformity in local tax assessment unduly burdens the entire property tax system. Because <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreements</b> with nonattorneys are generally unregulated by state law, honest taxpayers effectively subsidize not only property tax dodgers, but also contract auditors and private tax consultants...|$|R

40|$|The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers a {{benefits}} {{system designed}} to be largely paternalistic. An important aspiration of this benefits scheme is that the process should be navigable by a veteran without savvy legal prowess or the assistance of an attorney. Although the regulations governing attorney involvement have changed, the intentions behind them have not: VA insists it must protect veterans from lawyers. Congress, however, is less skeptical of legal representation and has enacted statutes designed to encourage lawyers to take the cases of deserving veterans that might prove too difficult to win otherwise. As part of this congressionally mandated incentive structure, the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) is available {{as a way for}} plaintiffs, through VA’s pockets, to pay the fees for lawyers who “win” against the government before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). The EAJA does not compensate attorneys for work done on the vast majority of veterans’ claims, which never reach the courts but are instead adjudicated at the agency level. There is, however, a separate compensation scheme to encourage attorney participation in the adjudication of VA benefits. To ensure lawyers were not discouraged from representing veterans at this first, crucial stage, Congress instituted a contingency fee system: an attorney who succeeds in gaining benefits can receive 20 % of the veteran’s past-due benefits award directly from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This largely straightforward system has raised few problems for attorneys and veterans—in most cases VA simply parcels out 20 % to the attorney and then hands over the rest to the veteran. However, there is a small but critical area of complexity involving veterans who for whatever reason will not receive the entirety of their award. In these cases, the question becomes whether attorneys are to receive 20 % of the original award or 20 % of the award after offset or withholding. For veterans who still receive some portion of their award, the answer is on the books. By statute, contingency fees are to be calculated from any past-due benefits awarded {{on the basis of the}} claim; “award” does not mean amount payable to the veteran but the actual award prior to any withholding. Snyder v. Nicholson held that award, in the “parlance of veterans’ benefits,” means “the amount stated as the award for success in pursuit of a claim for benefits. ” Thus, even though a veteran might receive only a portion of his award, the attorney will still receive 20 % of the original. This all flows from the idea that contingency fees in veterans’ benefits cases belong, by statute, to the attorney—and are thus payable directly from the benefits awarded on the claim, rather than being calculated from the actual payment to the veteran. This result reflects Congress’s decision to promote attorney participation in the VA process by guaranteeing enforcement of a 20 % <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreement</b> should the veteran win the claim. But VA regulations institute a caveat: a <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> <b>agreement</b> will be upheld only if the award of past-due benefits “results in a cash payment to a claimant... from which the fee may be deducted. ” By using results, VA asserts that contingency fee agreements lose their statutory protection if the claimant, by virtue of indebtedness to the United States, does not receive any payment at all. If no “fund” of past-due benefits is created, VA maintains that there is no percentage of that fund to which an attorney can be entitled. VA further reasons that if the veteran, as assignor, has no right to receive payment of any part of the past-due benefits, then his attorney, as assignee, cannot have such a right either. This policy has troubling consequences: by protecting only the fee agreements of veterans not in debt to the government beyond their claims’ values, VA in fact ensures that some of the neediest veterans cannot retain legal representation...|$|E

40|$|<b>Contingency</b> <b>Fee</b> <b>Agreements</b> (CFAs) {{are now a}} fixed {{feature of}} the Ontario {{litigation}} landscape. However, little research or study {{has been done on}} exactly how they operate in practice, whether they advance the objectives that they were intended to achieve, and whether litigants are best served by the current arrangements. In this study, I intend to make a preliminary start to that research, set out some tentative criticisms of the CFA system as it currently operates, and, where appropriate, suggest preliminary proposals for change. It should be said at the outset that my efforts to obtain real and serious data and information about the reliance on and kind of CFAs utilized by Ontario lawyers have been frustrated at every turn. Although often divided and divisive in interests, the Plaintiffs’ Bar seems to be almost uniquely united in striving to resist any efforts to render the fee-charging process more transparent and knowable. Accordingly, this Report has been written not only without any assistance from the Plaintiffs’ Bar, but with its concerted opposition. While there is an understandable concern among the Plaintiffs’ Bar about any inquiry that is driven and funded by the Insurance Bureau of Canada (IBC), the extent of the concern has reached almost paranoid proportions in attitude and response. However, I have tried to ensure that this fact has not influenced my analysis and recommendations. In what follows, I will first outline the formal regime within which <b>contingency</b> <b>fees</b> are allowed and regulated in Ontario. The focus of this Part is to get a general and comparative sense of the legal and policy framework for CFAs. The core of the Report attempts to go behind the received picture of CFAs and get to a more realistic sense of how they actually work in practice. Next, I draw some tentative conclusions and critical observations from the available data and information. Finally, I will put forward some proposals to address the more apparent failings of the present system in order to enhance its efficiency, fairness, and transparency. Throughout the Report, the emphasis will be on understanding and improving the existing system {{from the point of view}} of the litigant-as-consumer. The challenge is to make justice more available, but at a reasonable cost so that the interests of both litigants and lawyers are fairly represented, balanced and advanced...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, many states have filed {{complaints}} against the tobacco industry in state court to recover Medicaid costs paid by the states to treat their citizens for tobacco related illnesses. The states are also attempting to recover other damages, such as punitive damages, against the tobacco industry.

40|$|The {{profession}} of the lawyer {{is subject to}} additional and more demanding standards of professional conduct. Lawyer-client fiduciary relationshipdetermines that attorney’s fee {{is a matter of}} professional ethics. Most discussions occur regarding the contingence of the attorney. In some jurisdictions, the <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> is allowed and, in some jurisdictions, it is restricted. Especially in the United States, the majority of cases for compensation for heath injury are based on the <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> basis. The Code of Conduct for Lawyersin the European Union prohibits agreements with lawyers on the <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> basis, so-called pactum de quata litis. The main advantage of the contingence <b>fee</b> <b>agreement</b> is thatthe right to justice is guaranteed, as indigent persons have a possibility to employ any attorney and do not need to pay for the attorney in advance. The person is obliged to pay to his/her attorney only when the case is successful. Therefore access to justice is not hindered due to lack of finances. The main drawback of the <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> is its size. Alawyer may agree with a client on the attorney fees which are disproportionately high in comparison with the attorney’s time spent on the case. This is illustrated by landmark Lithuanian cases against the Marijampolė hospital where the Court of Attorney Ethics declared that the attorney fee equal to 50 % of the outcome of the case is too high. Even though the contingence fee has drawbacks, it should be allowed because, in any case, the attorney fee must be reasonable. But reasonableness is not always enough, therefore itwould be recommended to have more detailed regulation of the contingence fee. The legislation should be also clearer and foresee a possibility to get the attorney <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> awarded from the losing party. As the present regulation requires presenting documents confirming the payment of the attorney fee prior to the decision of the court when the <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> is not known yet, {{it is not possible to}} get compensation for the attorney costs based on the <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> basis.

50|$|A <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> is a prior {{arrangement}} between {{lawyer and}} client {{in which the}} lawyer receives a set percentage {{of the amount of}} recovery awarded to the plaintiff in a case. In most cases, monetary recovery is obtained through settlement, mediation, arbitration or trial. Generally, when a lawyer takes a case on a <b>contingency</b> <b>fee,</b> a client has no obligation to pay his/her lawyer a fee unless the case is successfully resolved. Most personal injury lawyers who represent injured parties, or plaintiffs, work on a <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> basis. The average <b>contingency</b> <b>fee</b> for a non-complex case is thirty-three percent if the case resolves before it is filed, and forty percent if it is resolved after that. Lawyers who defend personal injury cases are usually hired by insurance companies, and may charge fees on an 'hourly' or 'flat-fee' basis. An hourly fee arrangement involves an agreed amount of compensation for each hour the lawyer spends on the case. A flat-fee arrangement involves a set amount for the lawyer's handling of the case. These fee arrangements may also be combined.|$|R
