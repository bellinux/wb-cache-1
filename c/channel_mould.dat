40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} features of mould cooling in injection moulding is the provision of suitable and adequate cooling arrangements. For many years, mould designers and researcher have been trying to improve the performance of cooling system, despite the fact that cooling system complexity is physically limited by fabrication capability of conventional straight drilling methods. This research presents a comprehensive investigation on the application of conformal cooling channels in injection moulding for different cross sectional shapes, positions and diameter by endeavoring which conformal cooling configuration gives the best results in comparison with conventional cooling channels. Mould design with efficient cooling channels, comprehensive finite element analysis and flow simulation have been performed for different plastic parts with Pro/Engineer, ANSYS and Autodesk Moldflow Insight simulation software. Structural-thermal finite element analysis has been performed for two different types of industrial plastic part moulds with conventional, conformal and bimetallic conformal cooling channels to study the robustness and longevity of the conformal cooling channel moulds in comparison with conventional cooling channel moulds. Fatigue life of the mould with different cooling channel configuration and different materials has also been predicted using high cycle fatigue formulas and stress analysis results. Laser direct metal deposition (DMD) rapid manufacturing technology has been used to fabricate conformal cooling channel in injection mould for experimental validation of the results obtained by numerical modeling. Experimental verification has also been done for a test plastic part using conventional, conformal and bi-metallic cooling channel moulds, which have been manufactured by conventional computer numerical control machining process for mini injection moulding machine. Finally, hardness test has been done with Shore D hardness testing machine for test plastic parts which have been produced with conformal and conventional cooling <b>channel</b> <b>mould.</b> In conclusion, simulation and experimental verification show that with optimal cross section, diameter and position, the conformal cooling channel moulds reduce significant amount of cycle time as well as improve the quality of plastic parts produced by injection moulding process...|$|E

40|$|Understanding of the {{mechanism}} of the vibration needed to fill thin section or one with sharp edges in profile shapes and clarifying the dominant control parameters of the vibration in thin wall investment casting is key to producing sound casting (one free of misrun defects). It's also a central issue for study in this thesis. The filling capability in thin wall investment casting method was assessed in relation to metal head. It {{was found that the}} effect of the vibration on the metal head is markedly dependent on acceleration. Generally, it was observed that the metal head required to force the metal in thin sections in the casting vibrated at (1 g) acceleration is approximately half that used in castings made without vibration. Two potential mechanisms were observed from the experimental result during the filling process in thin wall casting i] discontinuous propagation flow in vibration conditions; and ii] continuous propagation flow without vibration. These mechanisms may be acting to modify the contact angles between liquid metal and a wall of the mould. Experiments also showed that two features of the transition can be observed {{from the front of the}} morphology; i] a coherent liquid metal front - this occurs in thin wall investment casting when the acceleration due to vibration is less than (1 g); and ii] jetting at the free surface - this occurs in thin wall investment casting when the acceleration due to vibration exceeds 1 g. This is present in terms of a unifying concept, using a frequency and amplitude (f - a) map. The time of the vibration operation has a moderate effect on the relative filling area when the acceleration is less than 1 g. However, it is more effective when the acceleration of the vibration is greater than 1 g. The mathematical models comprised one-dimensional heat transfer with phase change and had an established flow field for molten A 356 alloys flow in the thin section ceramic <b>channel</b> <b>mould.</b> The work was concerned with the fluidity of A 356 alloys in thin wall investment casting with and without vibration in two type of filling (flowability and fillability filling types), combining heat and metal flow in addition to the simultaneous solidification stage. The results of the mathematical model, produced agreement with the experimental test carried out in the foundry and also agreed with other published data. The results on fluidity indicated that the fluidity of the molten metal was affected by mould temperature, pouring temperature, the velocity of the molten metal flow relative to the surface tension and the channel thickness. The data used in the mathematical model of the fluidity in thin section under vibration condition were deduced experimentally; namely, velocity of the molten metal and the heat transfer coefficient between the liquid metal and the chilled surface of the mould. This model was used to estimate the fluidity characteristics in thin wall investment casting with and without vibration. Real-time X-ray observation and computer modelling of the metal head-driven mould filling sequences reveal that no surface turbulence occurred when the liquid metal flowed into the thin section and the advance metal front continued to flow under surface tension control. X-ray was also used to measure the flow time and the velocity of the metal inside the thin channel and confirm the modification on Bernoullis Equation (kinetic energy+ potential energy = constant) to estimate the velocity relative to surface tension in the fluidity mathematical model. Flow- 3 D software was used to calculate the velocity of the liquid metal in the flowability filling type and the fluidity characteristics. Weibull analysis identifies the acceleration vibration as practical criterion to judge the reliability of casting. A vibration mould with vertical direction in the thin wall investment casting after filling can make the liquid metal flow into the thin section under surface tension control. This technique is used to achieve mould filling free from misrun defects and surface turbulence and this makes vibration casting a promising technique for producing high quality castings. On the basis of these findings, an operation window for the production of reliable castings has for the first time been developed in this research.

Coarse clastics were deposited in braided channels, predominantly as longitudinal bars, whereas cross-bedded sandstones were deposited by migrating dunes or linguoid bars. Fine-grained overbank deposits accumulated in abandoned <b>channels.</b> Gypsum <b>moulds</b> and carbonate-filled cracks suggest an arid climate during deposition.

When looking critically at {{the causes of}} warpage, {{it is found that}} several key parameters of the moulding process have some effect on the warpage.

Conventional technologies - Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM), Drilling and Milling - have limitations in creating continuous straight or continuous curved internal channels {{and none of}} them are capable of producing continuous free-path internal channel in a single step. FSC is an innovative method within solid-state manufacturing technologies which is able to produce continuous internal channels in monolithic plates in a single step. FSC is capable of producing both straight and curved channels in metal plates with control of technical parameters similar to that of Friction Stir Welding (FSW). However, FSC is in initial phases and still more research {{needs to be done in}} order to improve FSC tools for producing channels in more diverse metals. This thesis designs and builds new tools for FSC with improved geometrical parameters, and by means of these new tools, performs experiments in order to investigate technical condition of FSC and its capability in various industries. This thesis produces various Friction Stir (FS) channel prototypes in aluminum alloy plates AA 6082 -T 6 and AA 5083 -H 111. This work performs thermal and flow analysis in order to evaluate capability of FSC for battery cooling. Following conclusions are arrived at in this thesis: The experimental results of this work shows that by means of our improved FSC tools and by selecting the right technical parameters, high quality of channel surface finish with low roughness is obtained using position control as opposed to forced control. Moreover, FS tool rotation and travel speed affect the channel size so that channel size increases by increasing travel speed and decreasing rotation speed. Pressure tests conclude that the FS channels produced in this work can endure high pressure levels. Furthermore, investigation and analysis in this thesis concludes that FSC has high potential in heat exchanger industries and conformal cooling <b>channels</b> for <b>mould</b> industries, and results in high productivity and low cost of production. Moreover, our thermal and flow analysis concludes that FSC has a high potential to be applied for cooling of industrial Lithium-ion batteries...|$|R
40|$|In plastic {{injection}} <b>moulding</b> process, cooling <b>channel</b> {{design is}} an essential factor that affects {{the quality of the}} moulded parts and the productivity of the process. Non-uniform cooling or long cooling cycle time would result if a poorly designed cooling channel is adopted. Due to limitations of traditional machining processes, the cooling channel is usually formed from straight-line drilled holes and only simple shapes are allowed, regardless of the shape complexity of the part being moulded. With the advent of rapid tooling technology, cooling channels in complex shapes can now be possible. However, there are not many design methodologies for supporting this type of cooling channel. In this paper, a methodology called visibility-based cooling channel generation is proposed for automatic preliminary cooling channel design for rapid tooling. The cooling process between a mould surface and a cooling channel is considered analogous to whether they can be visible from each other. Without loss of generality, the mould surface is approximated by a polyhedral terrain and is normally offset. A number of point light sources together that can illuminate the whole polyhedral terrain are assigned to suitable terrain offset vertices. A cooling channel is then generated by connecting all the assigned light sources. When comparing the conventional verification and redesign methods by melt flow analysis, computer-aided design and, a better design of cooling <b>channel</b> for its <b>mould</b> surface results in a short time independent of the experience of mould engineer.
