Mathis developed a plan for her farms under which the farm's basic expenses had to be met from a spectrum of crops and livestock apart from cotton, with cotton planted only to bring in extra cash, not as the mainstay of the farm's existence. She emphasized crop rotation with winter crops like clover and vetch to renew the soil. In the contracts she wrote with her tenants, the year's farming responsibilities were laid out in weekly detail to ensure that they followed her plan. She also worked with bankers, successfully persuading them to lend to farmers on more reasonable terms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} measure of bulk linen yarn is the [...] "lea", {{which is the}} number of yards in a pound of linen divided by 300. For example, a yarn having a size of 1 lea will give 300 yards per pound. The fine yarns used in handkerchiefs, etc. might be 40 lea, and give 40x300 = 12,000 yards per pound. This is a specific length therefore an indirect measurement of the fineness of the linen, i.e., the number of length units per unit mass.

40|$|Cotton {{has lost}} many ancestral {{defensive}} traits against key invertebrate pests. This {{is suggested by}} the levels of resistance to some pests found in wild cotton genotypes as well as in cultivated landraces and is a result of domestication and a long history of targeted breeding for yield and fibre quality, along with the capacity to control pests with pesticides. Genetic modification (GM) allowed integration of toxins from a bacteria into cotton to control key Lepidopteran pests. Since the mid- 1990 ’s, use of GM cotton cultivars has greatly reduced the amount of pesticides used in many <b>cotton</b> <b>systems.</b> However, pests not controlled by the GM traits have usually emerged as problems, especially the sucking bug complex. Control of this complex with pesticides often causes a reduction in beneficial invertebrate populations, allowing other secondary pests to increase rapidly and require control. Control of both sucking bug complex and secondary pests is problematic due to the cost of pesticides and/or high risk of selecting for pesticide resistance. Deployment of host plant resistance provides an opportunity to manage these issues in GM <b>cotton</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Cotton</b> cultivars resistant to the sucking bug complex and/or secondary pests would require fewer pesticide applications, reducing costs and risks to beneficial invertebrate populations and pesticide resistance. Incorporation of host plant resistance traits into elite cotton cultivars with high yield and fibre quality offers the potential to further reduce pesticide use and increase the durability of pest management in GM <b>cotton</b> <b>systems.</b> We review the challenges that the identification and use of host plant resistance against invertebrate pests brings to cotton breeding.

40|$|Weed {{management}} practices in <b>cotton</b> <b>systems</b> that {{were based on}} frequent cultivation, residual herbicides, and some post-emergent herbicides have changed. The ability to use glyphosate as a knockdown before planting, in shielded sprayers, and now over-the-top in glyphosate-tolerant cotton has seen {{a significant reduction in}} the use of residual herbicides and cultivation. Glyphosate is now the dominant herbicide in both crop and fallow. This reliance increases the risk of shifts to glyphosate-tolerant species and the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Four surveys were undertaken in the 2008 - 09 and 2010 - 11 seasons. Surveys were conducted {{at the start of the}} summer cropping season (November-December) and at the end of the same season (March-April).

40|$|Integration of {{multiple}} herbicide-resistant genes (trait stacking) into crop plants would allow {{over the top}} application of herbicides that are otherwise fatal to crops. The US has just approved Bollgard II® XtendFlex™ cotton which has dicamba, glyphosate and glufosinate resistance traits stacked. The pace of glyphosate resistance evolution {{is expected to be}} slowed by this technology. In addition, over the top application of two more herbicides may help to manage hard to kill weeds in cotton such as flax leaf fleabane and milk thistle. However, there are some issues that need to be considered prior to the adoption of this technology. Wherever herbicide tolerant technology is adopted, volunteer crops can emerge as a weed problem, as can herbicide resistant weeds.

Integrated crop-livestock systems can decrease the amount of inputs used including irrigation water and a higher intensity of land use. Furthermore, there is a great amount of agronomic evidence that crop-livestock systems have a lower negative impact on the environment but to fully asses their feasibility to potentially replace conventional cotton systems in the Texas high Plains their economic profitability must also be evaluated. Four yield and variable cost scenarios were simulated for the years 1998 to 2004 in two systems established in the Texas High Plains to compare a conventional <b>cotton</b> <b>system</b> using management practices recommended by the Texas Cooperative Extension Service vs. an integrated crop-livestock system for production of cotton and feedlot ready stocker steers that included WW-B.

Cotton produced under the conventional system and cotton produced under the integrated system achieved similar results regarding yields and input use. Favorable scenarios for the integrated system and cotton monoculture were when the yields were increased and when VC were decreased; both scenarios produced higher net returns in the integrated system than in cotton monoculture. Livestock produced in the integrated system was found to be advantageous because of the possibility to obtain additional revenue without significantly increasing the overall fixed cost of the integrated system...|$|E

40|$|Fifty years ago, Stern, Smith, van den Bosch and Hagen {{outlined}} {{a simple but}} sophisticated idea of pest control predicated on the complementary action of chemical and biological control. This integrated control concept has since been a driving force and conceptual foundation for all integrated pest management (IPM) programs. The four basic elements include thresholds for determining the need for control, sampling to determine critical densities, understanding and conserving the biological control capacity {{in the system and}} the use of selective insecticides or selective application methods, when needed, to augment biological control. Here we detail the development, evolution, validation and implementation of an integrated control (IC) program for whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Genn.), in the Arizona <b>cotton</b> <b>system</b> that provides a rare example of the vision of Stern and his colleagues. Economic thresholds derived from research-based economic injury levels were developed and integrated with rapid and accurate sampling plans into validated decision tools widely adopted by consultants and growers. Extensive research that measured the interplay among pest population dynamics, biological control by indigenous natural enemies and selective insecticides using community ordination methods, predator:prey ratios, predator exclusion and demography validated the critical complementary roles played by chemical and biological control. The term ‘bioresidual’ was coined to describe the extended environmental resistance from biological control and other forces possible when selective insecticides are deployed.

There were four rotation systems (continuous cotton, continuous corn, cotton–corn and corn–cotton) for both glyphosate-resistant (GR) and non-GR cultivars–herbicide system {{arranged in a}} randomized complete block design with four replications. Aspergillus flavus populations in surface (5 -cm depth) soil, sampled before planting (March/April), mid-season (June) and after harvest (September), ranged from 1. 47 to 2. 99 log (10) cfu g- 1 soil in the four rotation systems. Propagules of A. flavus {{were higher in the}} continuous corn system compared to the continuous <b>cotton</b> <b>system</b> on three sample dates, and cotton rotated with corn decreased A. flavus propagules in three of nine sample dates. Propagules of A. flavus were significantly greater in plots with GR cultivars compared to non-GR cultivars in three samples. In cotton seed, aflatoxin and fumonisin levels were similar (≤ 4 mgkg- 1 and non-detectable, respectively) regardless of rotation and glyphosate. In corn grain, aflatoxin was above the regulatory level (≥ 20 mgkg- 1) only in GR cultivar in 2004 and 2005. Fumonisin was higher in non- GR cultivar (4 mgkg- 1) regardless of rotation in 2004; however, in 2002, 2003 and 2005, aflatoxin and fumonisin levels were similar regardless of rotation and glyphosate. These results indicate the potential for increased aflatoxin and fumonisin levels (1 of 4 years) in corn; however, climatic conditions encountered during this study did not allow for mycotoxin production. In laboratory incubation studies, fairly high concentrations of glyphosate were required to inhibit A. flavus growth; however no short-term effect of soil treatment with glyphosate on A. flavus populations were observed. These data suggest that altered populations of A. flavus or higher aflatoxin concentrations in corn grain were due to indirect effects of the GR cropping system...|$|E

No differences were observed in the total plant FNR, seed and stover, soil and the total FNR among the different 15 N application times; however, despite no differences were observed in the plant the FNR value ranged from 30 - 38 %, while the seed exhibited the highest FNR with an average over 50 % of the 15 N recovered in the plant. In the soil, the obtained average FNR value was over 40 % while the total FNR (plant + soil) ranged from 70 - 80 %, being reduced as the 15 N application time was delayed. The second project was conducted during two seasons to examine the 15 N and bromide distribution pattern in the soil profile {{as a function of}} the time of application. 15 Nitrogen and bromide were applied to the soil at three different times in a cotton growth cycle; after that, soil samples were taken at the end of the cotton cycle to a depth of 1. 80 m., and 15 N and bromide recoveries were determined. Slightly higher FNR were obtained with the intermediate application time. The higher FNR were detected in the surface layer (0 - 30 cm) with an average of 40 %. Below 30 cm depth, low 15 N recoveries were obtained and even lower below the 60 cm soil layer. Bromide recovery behavior was related to the water movement in the soil profile: as the Br- application time was delayed more of the anionic tracer was found in the top of the soil profile, while less Br- was found in the surface soil for the early Br- application time...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of glyphosate tolerant cotton has significantly improved the flexibility {{and management of}} a number of problem weeds in cotton systems. However, reliance on glyphosate poses risks to the industry in term of glyphosate resistance and species shift. The aims of this project were to identify these risks, and determine strategies to prevent and mitigate the potential for resistance evolution. Field surveys identified fleabane as the most common weed now in both irrigated and dryland system. Sowthistle has also increased in prevalence, and bladder ketmia and peachvine remained common. The continued reliance on glyphosate has favoured small seeded, and glyphosate tolerant species. Fleabane is both of these, with populations confirmed resistant in grains systems in Queensland and NSW. When species were assessed for their resistance risk, fleabane, liverseed grass, feathertop Rhodes grass, sowthistle and barnyard grass were determined to have high risk ratings. Management practices were also determined to rely heavily on glyphosate and therefore be high risk in summer fallows, and dryland glyphosate tolerant and conventional cotton. Situations were these high risk species are present in high risk cropping phases need particular attention. The confirmation of a glyphosate resistance barnyard grass population in a dryland glyphosate tolerant <b>cotton</b> <b>system</b> means resistance is now a reality for the cotton industry. However, experiments have shown that resistant populations can be managed with other herbicide options currently available. However, the options for fleabane management in cotton are still limited. Although some selective residual herbicides are showing promise, the majority of fleabane control tactics can only be used in other phases of the cotton rotation. An online glyphosate resistance tool has been developed. This tool allows growers to assess their individual glyphosate resistance risks, and how they can adjust their practices to reduce their risks. It also provides researchers with current information on weed species present and practices used across the industry. This tool will be extremely useful in tailoring future research and extension efforts. Simulations from the expanded glyphosate resistance model have shown that glyphosate resistance can be prevented and managed in glyphosate-tolerant cotton farming systems. However, for strategies to be successful, some effort is required. Simulations have shown the importance of controlling survivors of glyphosate applications, using effective glyphosate alternatives in fallows, and combining several effective glyphosate alternatives in crop, and these are the key to the prevention and management of glyphosate resistance...|$|E

A conceptual framework is developed that relates the working of the cotton economy and its market participants to government institutions and macroeconomic forces that have a significant bearing upon its organization and performance. Selected aspects of cotton performance are evaluated in terms of their contribution to agriculture and national development goals. Main recommendations for future research are formulated in the areas of technical assistance to farmers, assemblers and ginners; market information programs; cotton lint processing; and programs to give small farmers more access to economic opportunities.
