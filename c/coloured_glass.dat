5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The windows are mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of <b>coloured</b> <b>glass,</b> possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. <b>Coloured</b> <b>glass,</b> enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
40|$|The work of art, Coral <b>Coloured</b> <b>Glasses,</b> {{depicts a}} person with beached coral <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses.</b> There is a play {{on the idea of}} an optimistic life view {{suggested}} by coral <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses</b> and the reality and horror of bleached coral.

5|$|The Norman conquest {{introduced}} northern French artistic styles, {{particular in}} illuminated manuscripts and murals, {{and reduced the}} demand for carvings. In other artistic areas, including embroidery, the Anglo-Saxon influence remained evident into the 12th century, and the famous Bayeux Tapestry {{is an example of}} older styles being reemployed under the new regime. Stained glass became a distinctive form of English art during this later medieval period, although the <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> for these works was almost entirely imported from Europe. Little early stained glass in England has survived, but it typically had both an ornamental and educational function, while later works also commemorated the sponsors of the windows into the designs. English tapestry making and embroidery in the early 14th century were of an especially high quality; works produced by nuns and London professionals were exported across Europe, becoming known as the opus anglicanum. English illuminated books, such as the Queen Mary Psalter, were also famous in this period, featuring rich decoration, a combination of grotesque and natural figures and rich colours. The quality of illuminated art in England declined significantly in the face of competition from Flanders in the 14th century, and later English illuminated medieval pieces generally imitated Flemish styles.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{involvement}} with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, {{general manager of the}} Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster tube station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.|$|E
25|$|The 19th-century {{windows of}} Clayton and Bell are typified by their {{brilliant}} luminosity. This {{is because they}} were quick to adopt {{the advice of the}} student of Medieval glass, Charles Winston, who propounded that “modern” commercially made <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> was not effective for stained glass windows, as it lacked the right refractive quality. In 1863 John Richard Clayton was among those who was experimenting with the manufacture of so-called pot metal or <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> produced by simple ancient manufacturing techniques which brought about great variability in the texture and colour of glass which is characteristic of ancient windows.|$|E

60|$|How had {{he come to}} {{disappear}} from among us? It was easily explained. HE had not grown used to being a world-famous person, and {{had been forced to}} break away from the lionising that was robbing him of all privacy and repose. So he grew a beard, put on <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses,</b> disguised himself a little in other ways, then took a fictitious name, and went off to wander about the earth in peace.|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{tries to}} give you an overview on the CCSDS contribution to COPUOS through DLR <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses.</b> The starting point of the dialogue between COPUOS and CCSDS was a letter written by Niklas Hedman from last September, in which he asked for provision of information on experience and practices that might relate to long–term-sustainability of outerspace activities and on the experiences and practices in conducting sustainable space activities. In answer to this request the CCSDS secretary submitted a paper, which shows its view in supporting systainable space activities...|$|R
40|$|Two type {{of glasses}} are {{currently}} {{of interest and}} being studied extensively. One is a glass doped with semiconducting nanocrystals while the other type is doped with noble metal colloids. In addition to their applications in non-linear optics, the first type glasses {{can also be seen}} as future optical filters and the second type of glasses can be used as <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses.</b> Therefore the present work was carried out with an objective of synthesising nano-composite glass like thin films containing semiconductor nanocrystals and mixed- and alloy- noble bimetallic colloids using the sol-gel process...|$|R

25|$|These {{windows are}} simple and decorative, {{frequently}} utilising {{the skills of}} the provincial plumber/glazier. Many of these windows are among the earliest use of <b>coloured</b> <b>glass</b> but comparatively few have survived because later Victorians have replaced them with more elaborate pictorial windows. Some of these windows date from the 1820s.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of ionizing radiation {{on the glass}} is described in this work, then it shows that roentgen or c – radiation causes structural changes in the glass, which manifests by colouring the glass and which can be prevented by suitable stabilisation of the glass structure (addition of CeO 2).

In what follows, given are the transmission features of three groups of <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses</b> under the impact of X radiation...|$|R
50|$|Louis Ducos du Hauron {{produced}} the first printed anaglyphs in 1891. This process consisted of printing the two negatives which form a stereoscopic photograph {{on to the}} same paper, one in blue (or green), one in red. The viewer would then use <b>coloured</b> <b>glasses</b> with red (for the left eye) and blue or green (right eye). The left eye would see the blue image which would appear black, whilst it would not see the red; similarly the right eye would see the red image, this registering as black. Thus a three dimensional image would result.|$|R
