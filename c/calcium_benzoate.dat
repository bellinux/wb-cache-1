The methyl esterification of benzoic acid was investigated, where the effects of temperature, alcohol:acid molar ratio and amount of catalyst were evaluated. Ester conversions of 65 to 70 % were achieved for all the catalysts under the best reaction conditions. The possibility of recycling these metallic benzoates was also demonstrated, evidenced by unaltered catalytic activity for three consecutive reaction cycles...|$|R

After reformulation, it was reintroduced as Diet 7 Up in 1970. It was renamed Sugar Free 7 Up in 1973 then back to Diet 7 Up in 1979. Diet 7 Up was reformulated and advertised as being sweetened with Splenda (sucralose); the formula has been re-tooled and listed the following ingredients: filtered carbonated water, natural flavors, citric acid, potassium citrate, potassium benzoate, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, calcium disodium EDTA. [...] The ingredients for Diet 7 Up with Splenda are: filtered carbonated water, natural flavors, citric acid, potassium citrate, potassium <b>benzoate,</b> <b>calcium</b> disodium EDTA, acesulfame potassium, sucralose. The 7 Up Company claims they switched back to aspartame because they conducted a nationwide study showing that people preferred the taste with aspartame instead of with Splenda.|$|R
40|$|Alginate-based biofilms were {{reticulated}} with Ca++ {{supplied by}} two sources, <b>calcium</b> chloride and <b>benzoate,</b> and using glycerol as plasticizer. The strong gelling {{power of the}} Ca++ ions hindered smooth casting procedures, so that films with low degree of reticulation were initially manufactured (1 st stage). These films were further crosslinked with an excess of Ca++ by immersion in a solution of 3 to 7 % of CaCl 2. 2 H 2 O (2 nd stage). The release of sorbate was evaluated considering different active agent concentrations in the film and two levels of alginate crosslinking. The mechanism involved in the diffusional process was investigated using the Power Law Model. The results indicated that potassium sorbate diffusion in alginate films has characteristics of Fickian and non-Fickian behavior. Effective diffusion coefficients obtained using the solution in series derived from Fick's Second Law are close to values obtained with the short-time solution, with effective diffusivities varying from 3 to 5 × 10 - 7 cm 2 /s. The diffusivity values decreased with the degree of reticulation and increase with benzoate concentration in the film...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in a flume (3. 0 meter long, 0. 3 meter wide by 0. 3 meter deep) to examine chemical loss to surface runoff. The bottom of the flume was made of a perforated steel plate, which allowed infiltration to occur during the runoff event. Three experiments {{were conducted}}. The objective of the first experiment was to introduce a calcium chloride solution as surface flow into the flume which was pre-saturated with calcium bromide. This experiment allowed the transfer of chemicals from soil to runoff to be examined. The second experiment was the reverse of the first experiment, i. e. the soil was saturated with calcium chloride and the surface flow contained calcium bromide. This experiment was done to examine chemical transport from runoff to the soil. In the last experiment, the soil was saturated {{with a mixture of}} <b>calcium</b> bromide, sodium <b>benzoate,</b> and pentafluorobenzoic acid (PFBA), and the surface flow contained calcium chloride. The sodium benzoate was chosen to examine biodegradation. The PFBA and bromide, both non-reactive tracers, have different aqueous diffusion coefficients. The results obtained for these two were compared to help determine if the mass transfer in the soil mainly is due to flow, or if diffusion contributes. With this research {{it has been shown that}} there are several factors influencing chemical loss to runoff infiltration, biodegradation, and there are also suggestions that there is transfer due to diffusion processes...|$|R

40|$|Calcium {{magnesium}} acetate has been assessed {{as an agent}} for the reduction of NOx, SO 2, and HCl, at the pilot scale, in a down-fired combustor operating at 80 kWth. In addition to this, the chemical and physical processes that occur during heating have been investigated. Benchmarking of calcium {{magnesium acetate}} with a suite of five other carboxylic salts (calcium magnesium acetate, calcium propionate, calcium acetate, <b>calcium</b> <b>benzoate,</b> magnesium acetate, and calcium formate) has been performed. NOx reduction involves the volatile organic content of the carboxylic salt being released at temperatures of > 1000 °C, where the reaction of CHi radicals with NO under fuel-rich conditions can result {{in some of the}} NO forming N 2 in a “reburning” process. Thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) studies identified the nature of the decomposition products from the low- and high-temperature decompositions. In addition, the rate of weight losses were studied to investigate the influence of the organic decomposition on NOx reduction by reburning. In-furnace reductions of SO 2 and HCl are aided by the highly porous, particulate residue, which results from the in situ drying, pyrolysis, and calcination processes. Simultaneous reduction of all three pollutants was obtained, and a synergy between SO 2 and HCl capture was identified. A mechanism for this inter-relationship has been proposed. Sorbent particle characterization has been performed by collecting the calcined powder from a spray pyrolysis reactor and compared with those produced from a suite of pure carboxylic salts. Physical properties (including porosity, surface area, and decomposition behavior) have been discussed, relative to reductions in NOx and acid gas emissions...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} cations in living organisms. It is found in the mineral phase of bone and in proteins like calmodulin. However, its exact environment beyond the first coordination sphere is often unknown, thus hampering the understanding of many biological processes. Here, <b>calcium</b> <b>benzoate</b> trihydrate (Ca(C 6 H 5 COO) (2) center dot 3 H(2) O) was used as a model for the NMR analysis of calcium sites in biological materials, because of the similarity of its calcium coordination, to water and carboxylate ligands, to that in several calcium-proteins. First, calcium- 43 magic angle spinning (MAS) and static NMR spectra of a Ca- 43 enriched sample were recorded at different magnetic fields, to investigate the electronic environment of calcium. Complex static lineshapes were obtained because of the presence of anisotropic NMR interactions of similar magnitude (chemical shift anisotropy and quadrupolar interaction), and the full interpretation of the spectra required simulations and gauge-including projector augmented wave (GIPAW) DFT calculations. An NMR investigation of the coordination environment of Ca 2 ? was carried out, using high resolution C- 13 -Ca- 43 MAS NMR experiments such as TRAPDOR (transfer of population double resonance) and heteronuclear J-spin-echoes. It was shown that despite the weakness of C- 13 -Ca- 43 interactions, it is possible to discriminate carbon atoms according to their calcium environment. Long-range calcium-carbon correlations were even evidenced by TRAPDOR, reaching distances > 5. 6 angstrom. This work demonstrates that by combining solid state NMR experiments, DFT calculations, and simulations, it will be possible to elucidate the electronic and coordination environment of calcium in many important and complex materials...|$|E

This study is focused on corrosion which occurs in the hydraulic access cover areas of the guide arm assemblies. The HK 26 GHLS is continuously exposed to a fluctuating marine environment and occasional high temperature rocket exhaust gases. 1008, 1018, ASTM A 514 Grade B, and ASTM A 514 Grade E steel specimens were sujected to potentiodynamic, potentiostatic, crevice, atmospheric, immersion, inhibitor, atmospheric, and paint tests in Port Huememe, CA sea water to ascertain corrosion mechanisms taking place and effective corrosion control/prevention measures. No passive film was formed {{on any of the}} steels tested when immersed in sea water. Pitting occurred at magnesium sulfide inclusions, grain boundaries, and localized areas where corrosion product films were breached. Under immersed conditions without crevices, pitting was prevalent {{in the early stages of}} corrosion, but pit growth soon became severly retarded, giving way to intergranular attack. Pitting was and remained the dominant form of attack in tight crevices. Under atmospheric condtions, pitting was dominant at all times as well. Intergranular attack was significantly more severe in the plain carbon steels than in the ASTM A 514 steels. Cathodically polarizing to - 780 mv (S. C.
