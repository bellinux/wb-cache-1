40|$|High {{velocity}} compaction (HVC) is {{a production}} technique with capacity to significantly improve the mechanical properties of powder metallurgy (PM) parts. Several investigations indicate that high-density components can by obtained using HVC. Other characteristics are low ejection force and uniform density. Investigated here are green body data such as density, tensile strength, radial springback, ejection force and surface flatness. Comparisons are performed with conventional compaction {{using the same}} pressing conditions. Cylindrical samples of a pre-alloyed water atomized iron powder are used in this experimental investigation. The different behaviour of HVC-pressed green bodies compared to conventional pressed green bodies are analysed and discussed. The HVC process in this study resulted in a better <b>compressibility</b> <b>curve</b> and lower ejection force compared to conventional quasi static pressing.

The specific values of the compaction pressure (P-Y 2) and density (rho(Y 2)) at the intersection point of the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> were determined for all investigated powders. It was shown that the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> for all investigated powders can be described by two straight lines by using special coordinates rho(G) /rho(Y 2) and log(P/P-Y 2). The sinterability curves of powders after drying and after calcination at 350 degrees C have a pronounced maximum. The optimum compaction pressures (P*) corresponding to the pressure at the maximal value of sintered density were determined for all investigated powders. It was shown that the region of optimal pressures is in {{the upper part of}} the middle-pressure region, whereas the P*/P-Y 2 ratio varies between 0. 7 and 0. 9.

In this work, the computer code initially used to simulate the effect of coupled hydro-mechanical load on composite preform (Ouahbi et al. Composites Part A, 38 : 1646 - 1654, 2007) is integrated into an inverse method to predict the compaction behaviour of the reinforcements. An experimental device developed at Le Havre is used to apply hydro-mechanical loads to the preforms. Two ramps of stress are imposed to the preform and the thickness evolution is measured {{as a function of}} time. The speed of thickness reduction is not constant and varies in the range of 0. 1 to 12 mm/min. The effect of compression speed upon the saturated fabrics is investigated. For a fixed fibre volume fraction, an increase in stress is observed in increasing compression speed. The experimental results are compared to the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> determined by an inverse method. The calculated curves correspond to the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> experimentally obtained with low compression speed (∼ 0. 25 mm/min).

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, {{the author}} highlighted {{the way in}} which the construction of a road embankment can modify the stress state of supporting ground, its permeability and hence groundwater level, causing the “underground dam effect”, in particular circumstances. A model has been developed to determine ground stress state and, to analyse it, a finite element method has been used with the support of ANSYS® software. The model has been parameterized for ground slope, embankment size width, half roadway size and slope size width and, finally, for embankment height. The software has provided horizontal and vertical stress distribution. Void index has been determined through the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curve</b> and also the permeability for each element. Subsequently, the groundwater level trend was reconstructed after fixing the flow and forward groundwater depth. Various cases have been examined: changing ground characteristics, embankment height, ground slope and finally changing groundwater depth, and critical situations have been identified.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{overview}} of the ﬂow properties of granular systems, including voids, granular porosity and random packing characteristics. For the purposes of the study, the notion of additional porous volume is intro-duced. This volume is deﬁned as the additional air volume added to the optimal granular packing. It represents the difference between the volume of the bulk powder bed and that of the same powder but when ideally packed. It appears as the volume of additional air (or voids) trapped/stored between the grains when the powder passes from a dynamical state to a static state (during the ﬁlling of a container or the formation of a powder heap, for example). Therefore, if the powder bed traps air, it is then able to restore air partially or completely or not at all, depending on the intergranular cohesion level. This mechanism of the storing and releasing of air can be analysed from the measurement of <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves.</b> If the powder is non-cohesive or free ﬂowing, it traps a small amount of air in its static state. Conversely, if the powder is cohesive, it traps more air. These data can be related to the ﬂow properties of granular materials. Indeed, the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> obtained for gran-ular materials provide information such as additional porosity, a kinetic parameter which characterizes the com-pressibility dynamics, a granular relaxation index which predicts how far a powder is from its optimal packing state and an index which gauges the de-areation speed of the powder. Measurement of such properties provides {{a better understanding of the}} nature of granular materials. Measurements of dynamical compressibility were car-ried out on ﬁve granular materials (two different lactose powders, hydrated lime Ca(OH) 2, yttrium stabilized zir-conia balls and polystyrene balls).

40|$|The role of {{lubricants}} during compaction {{is crucial}} and nowadays even more important, {{due to the}} increased number of PM parts with higher densities and/or challenging ejection conditions. The development of new lubricants for single compaction requires however an excellent understanding of the lubrication mechanisms and the behaviour of these new compounds. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} lubricant particle size distribution on the compaction and ejection behaviour, but also on the static and dynamic properties of ferrous powder metallurgy parts is studied. Indeed, as parts reach higher densities, the influence of {{the size and shape of}} pores become dominant on the mechanical performance and particularly fatigue resistance of the parts.

The neutron diffraction data at ambient pressure gave a more accurate determination of the Ca/Th cations position than previous XRD data, taking advantage that the neutron scattering lengths of calcium and thorium are of same order of magnitude. The nuclear density distribution was also determined using the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) confirming that the two cations are not located at the same position in the unit cell but are slightly displaced from one another along specific directions {{in order to minimize}} the electrostatic repulsion with the surrounding phosphorus atoms. At high pressure the compound did not show any phase transition or amorphization in agreement with other monazite-type compounds.

40|$|Recently an {{innovative}} technique {{known as the}} Isentropic Compression Experiment (ICE) was developed that allows the dynamic <b>compressibility</b> <b>curve</b> of a material to be measured in a single experiment. Hence, ICE significantly reduces the cost and time required for generating and validating theoretical models of dynamic material response. ICE has been successfully demonstrated on several materials using the 20 MA Z accelerator, resulting in a large demand for its use.

There {{is considerable}} industrial potential for aluminium alloys and aluminium metal matrix composites fabricated via net shape press-and-sintering powder metallurgy using low-cost, elemental premixed powder.

The powders reinforced with increasing ceramic particle content were cold-pressed under increasing pressure and sintered at 600 oC for 40 minutes, in nitrogen atmosphere. The powders showed the typical <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> {{and the presence}} of hard ceramic particles decreased the powder deformation capacity and, consequently, the powder compressibility. The sintering produced swelling of the parts, due to the poor wettability of liquid phase on the aluminium particles and to the Kirkendall effect caused by the difference in diffusivity of aluminium in copper and copper in aluminium. The presence of Al 2 O 3 particles increased the swelling during sintering probably due to the sooner formation of liquid phase...|$|R

Here we investigate the ground-state properties of a quasi-one-dimensional electronic system using the quantum version of the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sjölander (STLS) theory and present a critical account of its performance. The results are markedly different than those theories based on static LFC and the random-phase approximation; {{an example is the}} static structure factor, which develops a significant peak at low densities, signaling a developing ordered phase. An indication of growing instability at low densities is seen on G(q, 0), the static behavior of the dynamic LFC, which has an oscillatory character with a magnitude exceeding unity, peaking exactly at 4 k F. The pair-correlation function comes out as positive for the densities considered in this work. The correlation energy and the <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> are seen to be quite close to the static STLS results. A flaw of the theory is the significantly negative values of the dynamic structure factor around the plasmon frequencies, also the lifetime of the plasmons turns out to be negative away from the single-pair continuum. In summary, the major shortcomings of the dynamic STLS scheme are the violation of the compressibility sum rule (as in the static STLS case) and the misrepresentation of the plasmons in the dynamic structure factor. © 1999 The American Physical Society...|$|R

In this chapter I have summarized various measurements of their physical properties, relating this information to burial depth and effective overburden pressure. Rapid deposition and frequent intercalations of mud turbidites may cause underconsolidation in some cases; overconsolidation probably can be excluded. General lithification begins at depths between 200 and 300 meters sub-bottom, at porosities between 55 and 60 % (for silty clays) and as high as 70 % (for diatomaceous ooze).

In the present work, we report a detailed theoretical study on structural, elastic, and vibrational properties of the emerging oxidizer under hydrostatic compression using various dispersion correction methods to capture weak intermolecular (van der Waals and hydrogen bonding) interactions. The calculated ground state lattice parameters, axial compressibilities, and equation of state are in good accord with the available experimental results. Strength of intermolecular interactions has been correlated using the calculated <b>compressibility</b> <b>curves</b> and elastic moduli. Apart from this, we also observe discontinuities in the structural parameters and elastic constants as a function of pressure. Pictorial representation and quantification of intermolecular interactions are described by the 3 D Hirshfeld surfaces and 2 D finger print maps. In addition, the computed infra-red (IR) spectra at ambient pressure reveal that ADN is found to have more hygroscopic nature over Ammonium Perchlorate (AP) due to the presence of strong hydrogen bonding. Pressure dependent IR spectra show blue- and red-shift of bending and stretching frequencies which leads to weakening and strengthening of the hydrogen bonding below and above 5 GPa, respectively. The abrupt changes in the calculated structural, mechanical, and IR spectra suggest that ADN might undergo a first order structural transformation to a high pressure phase around 5 - 6 GPa.

For the sake of comparison, monolayers of a PtBA homopolymer (good solvent conditions) and of poly(4 -hydroxy styrene) (P 4 HS) (poor solvent conditions) have been also measured. It has been found that the relative length of the blocks plays an important role on the shape of the {{surface pressure}} Π versus surface concentration Γ curves and also on the shape of the equilibrium <b>compressibility</b> versus Γ <b>curves.</b> However, it does not affect the maximum value of Π reached at high Γ's. Surprisingly, the ellipsometric thickness of the copolymer monolayers is almost independent of the relative length of the blocks. The dynamics of the monolayers has been studied by step compression and by surface-light scattering techniques. When Mw,PtBA≫Mw,PS single exponential relaxations are observed. However, stretched exponentials are obtained for Aw,PS≥Mw,PtBA. The relaxation times decrease with increasing Γ for all the copolymers studied. This is the behavior usually found for poor solvent conditions (P 4 HS) and opposite to that found for homopolymers under good solvent conditions [PtBA, poly(vinylacetate) ]. This means that the solvent quality of the interface does not determine the pressure dependence of τ. The elasticity modulus of the monolayers in the kilohertz range takes values that {{are similar to those of}} the high-frequency limit of the relaxation experiments.
