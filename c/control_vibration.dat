40|$|This work {{proposes a}} method for <b>controlling</b> <b>vibration</b> using {{compliant}}-based actuators. The compliant actuator combines a conventional actuator with elastic elements in a series configuration. The benefits of compliant actuators for <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> applications, demonstrated in this work, are twofold: (i) vibration reduction over a wide frequency bandwidth by passive control means; (ii) improvement of <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance when active control is applied using the compliant actuator. The <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> performance is compared with the control performance achieved using the well-known vibration absorber and conventional rigid actuator systems. The performance comparison showed that the compliant actuator provided a better flexibility in achieving <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> over a certain frequency bandwidth. The passive and active control characteristics of the compliant actuator are investigated, which shows that the control performance is highly dependent on the compliant stiffness parameter. The active control characteristics are analyzed by using the Proportional and Derivative (PD) control strategy which demonstrated the capability of effectively changing the respective effective stiffness and damping of the system. These attractive dual passive-active control characteristics are therefore advantageous for achieving an effective <b>vibration</b> <b>control</b> system, particularly for <b>controlling</b> the <b>vibration</b> over a specific wide frequency bandwidth...|$|R

Four structural modifications are proposed in the first approach. The effect of the modifications to the force and moment input mobility at the engine mount locations is discussed. It is found that vibration energy transmission from a mechanical source to the ship structure can be controlled by structural modifications of the local supporting structure.
