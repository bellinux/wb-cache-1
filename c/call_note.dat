2500|$|The song is a three-note whistle, {{descending}} in pitch. It is very distinctive, {{and often}} described as oh-dear-me. The call also sounds like the words I'm so weary, so Alaskan gold miners along the trails called this bird [...] "Weary Willie". However, birds {{in the mountains of}} British Columbia have been reported to have a trill on the third note, rather than a clear whistle as in other populations. These songs are heard mainly in the breeding season, but also in the wintering grounds just after fall migration as well as just before they take off for spring migration. Like other Zonotrichia sparrows, it has a sharp, distinctive <b>call</b> <b>note,</b> which is transcribed as tsew.|$|E
2500|$|The English {{name comes}} from the Old English ceaffinc, where ceaf is [...] "chaff" [...] and finc [...] "finch". The {{chaffinch}} {{is one of the}} many birds depicted in the marginal decoration of the 15th century English illuminated manuscript the Sherborne Missal. The English naturalist William Turner described the chaffinch in his book on birds published in 1544. Although the text is in Latin, Turner gives the English name as chaffinche and lists two folk names: sheld-appel and spink. The word sheld is a dialectal word meaning pied or multicoloured (as in shelduck). Appel may be related to Alp, an obsolete word for a bullfinch. The name spink is probably derived from the bird's <b>call</b> <b>note.</b> The names spink and [...] shell apple are among the many folk names listed for the chaffinch by Reverend Charles Swainson in his Provincial Names and Folk Lore of British Birds (1885).|$|E

He is fond of meat when he can get it. He also eats seeds of many kinds. He is found all over the West from well up in the North to the hot dry regions of the Southwest.

50|$|Researchers have {{observed}} {{two different types}} of songs in male magnolia warblers. Their songs have been referred to as the First Category song and the Second Category song. Females have not been observed to have a distinct song yet as the males have; while they do sing, they don’t have separate songs for different situations. In general, the male warblers use their songs during the spring migration season and during the breeding season: one is used for courtship and the other is used to mark their territory each day. Both males and females have <b>call</b> <b>notes</b> that they use for various alerts: the females have short <b>call</b> <b>notes</b> to signal when a human observer is watching them, and the males have short <b>call</b> <b>notes</b> to signal when any sort of threatening predators are close to their offspring.|$|R
