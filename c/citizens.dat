The player must assign <b>citizens</b> to various jobs such as building or fishing. The <b>citizens</b> then perform the job without specific direction from the player. <b>Citizens</b> have needs that must be met {{in order to keep}} them happy and healthy, such as ensuring enough food is available or that they have a home.

40|$|<b>Citizen</b> {{science can}} broadly {{be defined as}} the {{involvement}} of volunteers in science. Over the past decade there has been a rapid {{increase in the number of}} <b>citizen</b> science initiatives. The breadth of environmental-based <b>citizen</b> science is immense. <b>Citizen</b> scientists have surveyed for and monitored a broad range of taxa, and also contributed data on weather and habitats reflecting an increase in engagement with a diverse range of observational science. <b>Citizen</b> science has taken many varied approaches from citizen-led (co-created) projects with local community groups to, more commonly, scientist-led mass participation initiatives that are open to all sectors of society. <b>Citizen</b> science provides an indispensable means of combining environmental research with environmental education and wildlife recording. Here we provide a synthesis of extant <b>citizen</b> science projects using a novel cross-cutting approach to objectively assess understanding of <b>citizen</b> science and environmental monitoring including: 1. Brief overview of knowledge on the motivations of volunteers. 2. Semi-systematic review of environmental <b>citizen</b> science projects in order to understand the variety of extant <b>citizen</b> science projects. 3. Collation of detailed case studies on a selection of projects to complement the semi-systematic review. 4. Structured interviews with users of <b>citizen</b> science and environmental monitoring data focussing on policy, in order to more fully understand how <b>citizen</b> science can fit into policy needs. 5. Review of technology in <b>citizen</b> science and an exploration of future opportunities...|$|R
