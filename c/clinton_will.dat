The inmates' interpretation of the Thriller music video was ranked the fifth of 10 [...] "most popular viral videos" [...] of the year, or the [...] "Web clips we couldn’t stop watching". The list also included appearances by Hillary <b>Clinton,</b> <b>Will</b> Ferrell and Chris Crocker for his Leave Britney Alone! clip. Time described the convicts as [...] "orange-jumpsuited accused murderers, rapists and drug dealers", and noted that their performance was made in [...] "homage" [...] to Jackson's Thriller. The magazine stated that the viral video had been downloaded more than nine million times. (As of January 18, 2008, the reported views of the video have reached almost 15 million).|$|E
500|$|Over {{a hundred}} books and {{scholarly}} works {{have been written}} about Clinton, from many perspectives. A 2006 survey by the New York Observer found [...] "a virtual cottage industry" [...] of [...] "anti-Clinton literature", put out by Regnery Publishing and other conservative imprints, with titles such as , Hillary's Scheme: Inside the Next Clinton's Ruthless Agenda to Take the White House and Can She Be Stopped?: Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>Will</b> Be the Next President of the United States Unless ... Books praising Clinton did not sell nearly as well (other than the memoirs written by her and her husband). When she ran for Senate in 2000, a number of fundraising groups such as Save Our Senate and the Emergency Committee to Stop Hillary Rodham Clinton sprang up to oppose her. Van Natta found that Republican and conservative groups viewed her as a reliable [...] "bogeyman" [...] to mention in fundraising letters, on a par with Ted Kennedy and the equivalent of Democratic and liberal appeals mentioning Newt Gingrich.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{mechanisms}} contributed in {{the case}} of Hillary Clinton, who has been called, and has publicly called herself, [...] "Hillary". Peter Funt, of Candid Camera, wrote in a February 21, 2007 New York Times op-ed piece, [...] "The Mononym Platform": [...] "Someone has apparently decided that Mrs. <b>Clinton</b> <b>will</b> be the first major single-name candidate since 1952, when Ike's P.R. gurus realized that 'Eisenhower' was tough to fit on a bumper sticker... In an apparent attempt to model her marketing on the likes of Madonna, Beyoncé and Cher, Mrs. Clinton's site proclaimed: [...] 'Today, Hillary took the first step...'..." [...] In an interview with Hillary Clinton published in Salon.com, the interviewer acknowledged receiving reader accusations of sexism whenever he referred to Clinton in print as [...] "Hillary" [...] (in contrast with male candidates who were almost always referred to by their last names), although he stated it was primarily to avoid confusion with her husband Bill Clinton.|$|E

2500|$|Quayle faced {{off against}} Gore and Stockdale in {{the vice presidential}} debate on October 13, 1992. Quayle {{attempted}} to avoid the one-sided outcome of his debate with Lloyd Bentsen four years earlier by staying on the offensive. Quayle criticized Gore's book Earth in the Balance with specific page references, though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group FAIR for inaccuracy. Quayle's closing argument sharply asked voters, [...] "Do you really believe Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>will</b> tell the truth?" [...] and [...] "Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?", whereas Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused. Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayle's performance, and the Vice President's camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater. However, post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore, Stockdale or Quayle had won. It ultimately {{proved to be a}} minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quayle subsequently lost.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press reported, [...] "Some {{officials}} said they believed the designations were a stretch—a knee-jerk move in a bureaucracy rife with over-classification." [...] Jeffrey Toobin, in an August 2015 New Yorker article, wrote that the Clinton email affair is an illustration of overclassification, a problem written about by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in his book Secrecy: The American Experience. Toobin writes that [...] "government bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals—in short, {{for a variety of}} motives that {{have little to do with}} national security." [...] Toobin wrote that [...] "It's not only the public who cannot know the extent or content of government secrecy. Realistically, government officials can't know either—and this is Hillary Clinton's problem. Toobin noted that [...] "one of Clinton's potentially classified email exchanges is nothing more than a discussion of a newspaper story about drones" [...] and wrote: [...] "That such a discussion could be classified underlines the absurdity of the current system. But that is the system that exists, and if and when the agencies determine that she sent or received classified information through her private server, <b>Clinton</b> <b>will</b> be accused of mishandling national-security secrets." ...|$|E

Clinton secured more labor union backing than Obama, and Obama did better than Clinton at gaining primary votes from self-identified independents. However, on foreign policy issues, Hillary Clinton was more hawkish than Barack Obama. However, Hillary has opposed certain liberal aspects of Obamacare such as the cadillac tax.|$|R
