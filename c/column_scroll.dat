50|$|Construction of {{the temple}} started on October 28, 1857 in Mỹ Trà, Cao Lãnh. The temple's altar is gilded with plaques that honor Confucius, and many hanging <b>column</b> <b>scrolls.</b> Due to the war, the temple became {{inactive}} and was abandoned in 1951. After 1975, Văn Thánh Miếu {{has been used as}} a library in the province. Today, the area surrounding the Văn Thánh Miếu is a large park, called the Park of Văn Miếu (Vietnamese: Công viên Văn Miếu). The library provides books in addition to supplying research materials, equipped with 40 computers, and free service to people in need. The temple displays its prized collection of poetry to promote art and oriental moral discussions, looking in the direction of preserving Confucian teachings.|$|R
50|$|The Englehart Melchinger House in {{the borough}} of Dover, York County, Pennsylvania, is the {{restored}} {{home of a}} prominent 19th Century businessman, Englehart Melchinger. It was built about 1852, and is a rectangular brick building with Greek Revival and Italianate design details. It features an entrance portico with Doric order <b>columns,</b> heavy <b>scroll</b> brackets, and a paneled frieze; and cast iron lintels.|$|R
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{dates from}} the 1884 remodelling and includes a three-sided gallery with a double-curved front of pierced cast iron in neo-rococo style. This was probably installed by Macfarlane of Glasgow, and the seven cast-iron <b>columns</b> with <b>scrolled</b> caps that support the gallery {{are also likely to}} be his. The organ loft is behind pulpit and is arched, with a panelled and balustraded front. The flat ceiling has a small cornice and ornate plasterwork.|$|R
50|$|The {{gardens are}} 7.2 {{hectares}} (18 acres) of Crown Land bounded by William, La Trobe, King and Dudley streets, {{managed by the}} City of Melbourne. On the southeast corner opposite is the entrance to Flagstaff railway station. Diagonally opposite stands the Victorian branch of the Royal Mint, established 7 August 1869. The former Royal Mint building is a well-preserved example of Victorian Gold Rush boom-period classical styled architecture. The facade features paired <b>columns</b> with <b>scrolled</b> capitals and the Royal Mint coat-of-arms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. [...] It is a two-story cross-gable main section with a two-story rear-gabled wing, built of {{load-bearing}} brick masonry walls. Italianate aspects include its scrolled brackets, limestone sills supported by brackets, brick dentil molding below the cornice, wood dentil molding above. It was built on a limestone ashlar foundation. The front facade's main feature is a one-story porch with a flat roof, single and triple <b>columns,</b> and <b>scrolled</b> brackets.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a study on}} image grid display with automatic vertical scrolling. While scroll operations are normally carried out manually by the user, {{in the context of}} RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) techniques this work considers a presentation mode in which the image grid is automatically scrolled. Through experiments carried out with 50 testers, we have investigated user performance while looking for specific target subjects within large collections of images. Different numbers of <b>columns</b> and <b>scrolling</b> speeds have been considered. The search task implied both clicking on the identified target pictures and simply vocally stating their visual recognition. To this purpose, and to identify possible specific gaze behaviours, eye tracking technology has been exploited. The obtained results show that number of <b>columns</b> and <b>scroll</b> speed do affect search performance. Moreover, the userâs gaze tends to focus on different screen areas depending on the values of these two parameters. Although {{it is not possible to}} definitely find an optimal columnsâspeed combination that is valid in all cases, the particular context of use can suggest feasible solutions according to oneâs needs. To the best of our knowledge, image grid display with automatic scrolling has never been studied to date.

50|$|It was a {{residence}} {{of members of}} the princely dynasty of the Welsh kingdom of Powys and one of the taî'r uchelwyr (houses of the gentry) in late medieval Wales. It subsequently came into the possession of the Ormsby-Gore family (Lord Harlech). Its English correspondent is sometimes given as Porkington. A manuscript known to have been in the possession of Brogyntyn in 1574 was a copy of the Hanes Gruf(f)udd ab Cynan.The house itself is of brick dating from circa 1730 refaced and much added to between 1813-20 by the architect Benjamin Gummow. It is noted for a portico of four giant unfluted Ionic <b>columns</b> with <b>scrolls</b> and pediment. Outside can be seen an arch with 2 pairs of unfluted Ionic columns. In the entrance hall survives an elaborately carved fireplace dated 1617.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the main stair and {{elevator}} lobbies are clad in the same Tennessee marble as the exterior. However, the marble was finished to reveal more pink tones. Ceilings {{in this area are}} vaulted plaster overlaid with gold leaf. Ornate bronze elevator fronts and grilles remain. On the second floor, the courtroom lobby is lined with twenty monolithic, Tennessee marble <b>columns</b> with bronze <b>scrolled</b> Ionic capitals. Marble flooring, wainscot, and benches contribute to the opulent finishes. A plaster cornice and coffered ceiling are painted in tones derived from the marble.|$|R

50|$|Margins are an {{important}} method of organizing the written word, and have a long history. In ancient Egypt, writing was recorded on papyrus scrolls. Egyptian papyrus scrolls could reach up to 30 meters in length, and contained text organized in columns laid out {{from left to right}} along the <b>scroll.</b> <b>Columns</b> were referred to as pagina (or pages) and were separated by margins, so that scrolls could be unrolled horizontally, uncovering individual sections one by one. Thus, in papyrus scrolls margins performed the function of visually signaling to readers when to stop reading and move down to the next line of text.|$|R
50|$|The construction, {{including}} {{barrel and}} groin vaults and an octagonal cloister-vault in the dome, reflects late Roman, or Pre-Romanesque, practices {{rather than the}} Byzantine techniques employed at San Vitale, and its plan simplifies the complex geometry of the Ravenna building. Multi-coloured marble veneer is {{used to create a}} sumptuous interior. The chapel makes use of ancient spolia, conceivably from Ravenna (Einhard claimed they were from Rome and Ravenna), as well as newly carved materials.

40|$|Multi-column layout with {{horizontal}} scrolling {{has a number}} of advantages over the standard model (single <b>column</b> with vertical <b>scrolling)</b> for on-line document layout. However, one difficulty with the multi-column model is the need for good automatic placement of floating figures. We identify reason-able aesthetic criteria for their placement, and then give a dynamic-programming-like algorithm for finding an optimal layout with respect to these criteria. We also investigate an A based approach and give two variants differing in the choice of heuristic. We find that one of the A based ap-proaches is faster than the dynamic programming approach and, if a “window ” of optimization is used, fast enough for moderately sized documents...|$|R

The third chapter of Habakkuk is missing entirely from the pesher, but it was left out intentionally, not destroyed by aging (most of the last <b>column</b> of the <b>scroll</b> is blank, clearly showing that the text of the pesher was complete). Regardless, the scroll is still largely readable, and editors have filled the lacunae with reasonable confidence.|$|R
40|$|Facetted {{growth of}} snow {{crystals}} {{leads to a}} rich diversity of forms, and exhibits a remarkable sixfold symmetry. Snow crystal structures result from diffusion limited crystal growth {{in the presence of}} anisotropic surface energy and anisotropic attachment kinetics. It is by now well understood that the morphological stability of ice crystals strongly depends on supersaturation, crystal size and temperature. Until very recently {{it was very difficult to}} perform numerical simulations of this highly anisotropic crystal growth. In particular, obtaining facet growth in combination with dendritic branching is a challenging task. We present numerical simulations of snow crystal growth in two and three space dimensions using a new computational method recently introduced by the authors. We present both qualitative and quantitative computations. In particular, a linear relationship between tip velocity and supersaturation is observed. The computations also suggest that surface energy effects, although small, have a larger effect on crystal growth than previously expected. We compute solid plates, solid prisms, hollow columns, needles, dendrites, capped <b>columns</b> and <b>scrolls</b> on plates. Although all these forms appear in nature, most of these forms are computed here for the first time in numerical simulations for a continuum model. Comment: 12 pages, 28 figure...|$|R
50|$|The {{lobby is}} divided into two areas: a postal lobby in the {{original}} portion of the building and a public lobby {{that is part of the}} 1934 addition. In the postal lobby, verde (green) marble pilasters (attached <b>columns)</b> with <b>scrolled</b> Ionic capitals decorate the walls. The floors are terrazzo with brass dividers and verde marble borders. The same marble is used for the wainscot. Heavily veined white marble veneer covers the upper portions of the walls. The ornate ceiling is executed in plaster and features beams that divide the ceiling into distinct panels. Each panel is outlined with a dentil course and egg-and-dart decorative molding. A decorative band called a guilloche with floral patterns also defines each panel. The centers each have a plaster medallion outlined with an acanthus leaf design. Cylindrical brass light fixtures descend from the centers of the panels. Original octagonal postal tables that sit upon verde marble bases remain in the lobby. Decorative finishes and details in the public lobby are similar to those in the postal lobby and provide continuity to the interior. However, ceiling panels in the public lobby are less ornate.|$|R
50|$|The Pritchard House is {{a two-story}} wood framed Queen Anne style {{residence}} located near downtown Titusville. It {{is surrounded by}} a white picket fence and is situated between two major thoroughfares. According to the original paperwork submitted to the National Park Service for the inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places:The main block of the house is gable front with a slope front gable wing on the south elevation. Exterior walls imbricated with wood fishscale shingles. Outstanding features on the main block include decorative ogee shaped bargeboard with incised scrollwork and drop pendants. The side gable contains round arched bargeboard of similar design. A conical tower at the southeast corner complements a canted, two story porch. The porch wraps the east and west elevations and is supported by small Tuscan <b>columns</b> with <b>scroll</b> brackets. The front gabled bay is canted. Three large brick chimneys with corbelled caps and hoods are located on the north and south lateral slopes of the roof and the west ridge. The house rests on a brick pier foundation. A rear porch addition does not significantly affect the integrity of the structure. In the late nineteenth century, prominent citizens built Queen Anne-style homes along the South Washington Avenue and North Indian River Avenue corridors. The Pritchard House is the last remaining Queen Anne residence on South Washington Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|The dollar sign ("$") was {{in common}} use among private merchants {{during the middle}} of the 18th century.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} passage {{referring to}} [...] "dyed leather" [...] (parchment) is iii. 13, {{although it is}} possible, in view of ii. 10, that originally בעורות צבאים stood in place of בעורות צבועים. Even if that be true, however, this is still the first reference to colored parchment for synagogal scrolls; for nothing else could be implied by these words in the received reading. The skin of game was a favorite writing-material; so that while it was forbidden to use half leather and half parchment, half leather and half skin of game were allowable (ii. 10). It was forbidden, moreover, to cut the edges of books (v. 14). A scribal term which does not occur elsewhere is found in v. 1, 2 (מעכב, variant reading מחטב). There were generally seventy-two lines to the <b>column</b> in a <b>scroll</b> of the Law (xii. 1). The passage xiii. 1 refers to the stichic writing of the Psalms; Book of Job, and Proverbs; and the remark [...] "A good scribe will note" [...] shows that the passage was written {{at a time when}} this detail was no longer generally observed (comp. Müller, ad loc., and the Vitry Maḥzor, p. 704).|$|R
5000|$|The Edwin Smith papyrus is a scroll 4.68 meters or 15.3 feet in length. The recto (front side) has 377 {{lines in}} 17 columns, while the verso (backside) has 92 lines in five columns.

It is written right-to-left in hieratic, the Egyptian cursive form of hieroglyphs, in black ink with explanatory glosses in red ink. The vast majority of the papyrus is concerned with trauma and surgery, with short sections on gynaecology and cosmetics on the verso. [...] On the recto side, there are 48 cases of injury. Each case details the type of the injury, examination of the patient, diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment. The verso side consists of eight magic spells and five prescriptions. The spells of the verso side and two incidents in Case 8 and Case 9 are the exceptions to the practical nature of this medical text. Generic spells and incantations may have been used as a last resort in terminal cases.|$|R
40|$|The Manual of Calligraphy (Shu pu 書譜) by Sun Guoting 孫過庭 (ca. 647 -ca. 690) {{is one of}} {{the great}} masterpieces of Chinese calligraphy. A 369 <b>columns</b> long {{horizontal}} <b>scroll</b> written in a beautiful cursive hand, the manuscript provides some of the finest explanations of calligraphic technique and aesthetics and has long since occupied a preeminent role in the history of calligraphy. Now kept at the National Palace Museum, Taipei, the scroll is still used as a model for the practice of the cursive script. Many are the studies on the Shu pu published in China and Japan and several English, German, and French translations already exist. However, the present book provides a new interpretation of some key questions related with the core meaning of the work. At the same time, it outlines the basic features of Sun Guoting’s life and its influence on his choice of the literary genre (pu), hitherto never used in calligraphy and painting treatises. By surveying the history of the word pu in Chinese pre-Tang literature and the differences among the literary genres of pre-Tang treatises on calligraphy, the present study on the one hand challenges the widely accepted theory of the Shu pu being a “treatise” on calligraphy; on the other, it shows how deep-rooted was Sun Guoting’s intention of writing a “manual” for teaching purposes. A critical edition conducted on the original manuscript column by column provides a comprehensive record of the entire text, including corrections and repetitions. An annotated English translation offers an almost word-to-word philologically-based interpretation of Sun Guoting’s ideas...|$|R
