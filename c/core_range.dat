5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the <b>core</b> <b>range</b> of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat, particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow bearing trees for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat. Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and dead trees have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in NSW.|$|E
5|$|Eighteen {{species of}} fish live in Yellowstone, {{including}} the <b>core</b> <b>range</b> of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout—a fish highly sought by anglers. The Yellowstone cutthroat trout has faced several threats since the 1980s, including the suspected illegal introduction into Yellowstone Lake of lake trout, an invasive species which consume the smaller cutthroat trout. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, it was never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage. The cutthroat trout has also faced an ongoing drought, {{as well as the}} accidental introduction of a parasite—whirling disease—which causes a terminal nervous system disease in younger fish. Since 2001, all native sport fish species caught in Yellowstone waterways are subject to a catch and release law. Yellowstone is also home to six species of reptiles, such as the painted turtle and Prairie rattlesnake, and four species of amphibians, including the Boreal Chorus Frog.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline and}} {{extermination}} of the Arctic wolf population was studied in east Greenland between 1899 and 1939. Through these years, there were 252 sightings of the wolves and/or their tracks. Around 112 wolves were sighted {{in the early}} winter, 31.3% were lone wolves, 23.2% were in pairs, and the rest stayed together in larger groups. The average pack size of the Arctic wolves was 3.3; packs of four or more were rare. The Arctic wolf population was mainly in {{the central part of}} the range, which made them vulnerable to the Danish and Norwegian hunters, which exterminated the population with the use of poison. They are endangered due to their exceptionally low densities, smaller pack sizes, infrequent reproduction, and lower offspring production. The population was not harvested by the Europeans prior to 1899. There was no effort to bring back or grow the population because the main goal was to maximize profits by killing as many Arctic foxes as possible. Arctic wolves were considered less in terms of economic significance because of their low abundance. They were mainly killed and exterminated due to interfering with commercial hunting by killing foxes in traps. Between 1920 and 1932, 35 wolves were killed in the core wolf range, forcing the population to decline rapidly. The Arctic wolf population in five of the six <b>core</b> <b>range</b> areas of east Greenland has severely collapsed and declined rapidly after the arrival of European commercial hunters. There is no other evidence for the potential decline in the Arctic wolf population.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{relatedness}} {{among individuals}} {{can play a}} major role in the socio-spatial organization of mammals. However, only a few studies have documented kin-related spatial pattern in solitary medium-sized carnivores. Using radiotelemetry and genetic data from 15 individuals (seven males and eight females), we investigated the relationship between kinship and spatial organization (distance and overlap between home ranges) in the European pine marten Martes martes in a wooded area of central Italy. Data analysis included 45 pairs (10 individuals) tracked in spring and summer and 66 pairs (12 individuals) tracked in autumn and winter. Kinship, distance between home ranges and proportion of home range overlap were also compared among inter- and intra-sexual pairs. Spatial distribution of pine martens was affected by genetic relatedness, so that individuals living in close proximity or occupying the same area were also more likely to be closely related. Female pairs had a higher proportion of overlap of their home and <b>core</b> <b>ranges</b> than male pairs. Male pairs were also less related than female and inter-sexual pairs, showing a pattern of space use consistent with male-biased dispersal and female philopatry. Most of the females that overlapped their home and <b>core</b> <b>ranges</b> were genetically related, while only a third of the few male pairs occupying the same territories were kin. However, our results seem to indicate that positive association between home range overlap and relatedness was mainly a consequence of common female philopatry rather than kin-biased tolerance. Male-female dyads had the highest percentage of related individuals overlapping their home and <b>core</b> <b>ranges,</b> suggesting that spatial segregation is unlikely to play a role in preventing encounters between kin. ...|$|R
