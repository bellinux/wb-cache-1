50|$|Historically {{producing}} full-wave DC with a {{center-tapped transformer}} and two rectifiers was preferred {{to the full}} bridge rectifier when rectifier costs were higher than the extra cost of copper windings and iron laminations (a <b>centre</b> <b>tap</b> only uses half of the secondary coil per half-cycle.) They saved the cost of two diodes, and also (but less importantly) halved the voltage drop across the rectifying stage. However, now the economic case has reversed and bridge rectifiers are much more common.|$|E

At this time Germany used a 220 V <b>centre</b> <b>tap</b> giving 110 V from current pins to earth, which meant that fuse links were required in both sides of the appliance and double pole switches.

40|$|High power quality, efficiency, complexity, size, cost {{effectiveness}} and switching losses {{of the direct}} current to alternating current (DC–AC) conversion system are crucial aspects in industrial applications. Therefore, the four-switch three-phase inverter (4 S 3 P) has been proposed as an innovative inverter design. However, this topology {{has been known to}} have many performance limitations in the low-frequency region, because of the generation of an unbalanced voltage leading to an unbalanced current due to the fluctuation and offset of the <b>centre</b> <b>tap</b> voltage of the DC-link capacitors. Those drawbacks are investigated and solved in this paper in order to provide pure sinusoidal output voltages. The generated output voltages are controlled using proportional-integral (PI) controllers to follow the desired voltages. Furthermore, the DC-link capacitor voltage offset is mitigated by subtracting the direct component from the control reference voltage using low pass filters, where this direct voltage component provides the direct current component which leads to DC-link capacitor voltage divergence. A simulation model and experimental setup are used to validate the proposed concept. Many simulation and experimental results are carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme...|$|E

5000|$|In full-wave {{rectification}} both {{halves of the}} AC waveform are utilised. The cathode {{is connected to the}} + side of the DC load, the other side being connected to the center tap of the transformer secondary winding, which always remains at zero potential with respect to ground or earth. For each AC phase, a wire from each end of that phase winding is connected to a separate anode [...] "arm" [...] on the mercury-arc rectifier. When the voltage at each anode becomes positive, it will begin to conduct through the mercury vapor from the cathode. As the anodes of each AC phase are fed from opposite ends of the <b>centre</b> <b>tapped</b> transformer winding, one will always be positive with respect to the center tap and both halves of the AC Waveform will cause current to flow in one direction only through the load.

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) The South African Railways {{covers a}} total {{distance}} of some 24 000 km, {{making use of}} a signalling network of 1000 interlocking systems. This comprises {{of the order of}} 1000 signalling houses each with its own unlnterruptible power supply system of which a DC·AC converter Is one of the components. Due to the requirements by Spoomet, high frequency (ultrasonic) chopper technology had to be used. This treatise describes the design and development of a 3 kVA composite DC·AC converter with an ultrasonic AC link for this application. In the primary converter (<b>centre</b> <b>tapped</b> topology) ZVS Is achieved by good circuit layout and controlled transformer capacitance. As a result the performance of the converter was improved with regard to efficiency and switching transients compared to the conventional hard switched converter. The four pulse topology with an output LC·filter was used for the secondary converter. Due to the modulation technique being used, the load perceived the switching frequency as 20 kHz while the actual switching frequency was only 10 kHz. In this way switching losses were kept within reasonable limns as well as satisfying the low audible noise requirement. The stability of the LC·filter was achieved with a current feedback loop. The literature describes the capacitor current being used in the feedback loop. In this case the Inductor current was used with the advantage of output short circuit protection without an additional current measurement. Apart from the advantages of small weight and volume from a maintenance point of view, the composite DC·AC converter also achieved high efficiency (> 85 %) over a wide load range (10 %- 100 % of full load) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} how PLL frequency synthesizers with cascaded and nested loop topologies {{can be used}} for the synthesis of low noise high frequency signals. Briefly explained, synthesizers with cascaded/nested loops combine a broadband PLL and a narrowband PLL. The broadband PLL makes it possible to obtain a low phase noise even from a relatively noisy VCO with an integrated resonator. The narrowband PLL, on the other hand, makes it possible to tune the output signal with a high frequency resolution. A necessary building block of this kind of synthesizer is a low frequency VCO having low noise. The thesis {{describes how}} this kind of VCO can be implemented by the use of low loss external resonator components and by employing tank enhancement for additional noise suppression. Tank enhancement is obtained by the use of <b>centre</b> <b>tapped</b> capacitors {{in order to reduce the}} tank impedance. A consequence of tank enhancement is that the transconductance of the gain element must be increased. The thesis also describes the design and evaluation of two fully integrated VCOs implemented in 0. 35 µm CMOS. One of the VCOs had an operating freqency around 5. 8 GHz. This VCO was also used as a building block of an experimental broadband PLL synthesizer having a target loop bandwidth of 25 MHz. Due to the large variations in VCO gain as a function of frequency, the PLL had a very narrow locking range. The other VCO had an operating frequency around 2. 4 GHz and was designed with multiple parallel tuning elements. This configuration could be used to reduce the magnitude of the VCO gain by about 34 dB and to make the VCO less sensitive to noise from the charge pump or loop filter, while still maintaining a wide frequency tuning range. Another benefit of multiple tuning inputs would be that the variations in feedback tuning voltage could be reduced. This would reduce the variations in VCO gain and the mismatch between the source current and sink current of the charge pump and give a reduction of the reference spur level. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
