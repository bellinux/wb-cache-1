25|$|This type is {{the most}} basic, but {{can be a good}} choice for hard rock, multi-laterals and {{underbalance}} drilling. It involves leaving the productive reservoir section without any tubulars. This effectively removes control of flow of fluids from the formation; it is not suitable for weaker formations which might require sand control, nor for formations requiring selective isolation of oil, gas and water intervals. However, advances in interventions such as <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> and tractors means that barefoot wells can be successfully produced.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, {{productivity}} may be hampered due to {{the residue}} of completion fluids, heavy brines, in the wellbore. [...] This is particularly a problem in gas wells.

50|$|Pumping through <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> {{can also}} be used for {{dispersing}} fluids to a specific location in the well such as for cementing perforations or performing chemical washes of downhole components such as sandscreens. In the former case, <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> is particularly advantageous compared to simply pumping the cement from surface as allowing it to flow through the entire completion could potentially damage important components, such as the downhole safety valve. <b>Coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> umbilical technologies enable the deployment of complex pumps which require multiple fluid strings on <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing.</b> In many cases, the use of <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> to deploy a complex pump can greatly reduce the cost of deployment by eliminating the number of units on site during the deploy.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> {{is often}} used as a {{production}} string in shallow gas wells that produce some water. The narrow internal diameter results in a much higher velocity than would occur inside conventional tubing or inside the casing. This higher velocity assists in lifting liquids to surface, liquids which might otherwise accumulate in the wellbore and eventually [...] "kill" [...] the well. The <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> may be run inside the casing instead or inside conventional tubing. When <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> is run inside of conventional tubing it {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "velocity string" [...] and the space between the outside of the <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> and the inside of the conventional tubing is referred to as the [...] "micro annulus". In some cases gas is produced up into the micro annulus. <b>Coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> umbilicals can convey hydraulic submersible pumps, electric submersible pumps and jet pumps into wells for both permanent deliquification schemes and service applications.|$|E
50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> {{refers to}} a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. <b>Coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> can be performed and make the operation more costly. A <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> operation is normally performed through the drilling derrick on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> operations on sub-sea wells a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self-contained <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> rig can be used.|$|E

5000|$|Portable Drilling Units. Drilling with <b>coil</b> <b>tubing</b> is a {{relatively}} new technology. The advantage of drilling with coil is the speed at which one can drill.

5000|$|In {{areas with}} a high {{concentration}} of oil wells, {{it is not unusual for}} wells to communicate through the formation for distances of up to mile. During a fracing operation thousands of gallons of fluid and sand are pumped down one well to open up the formation surrounding that wellbore. Often large amounts of that proppant and fluid will travel through the formation and into a nearby well. This sand can lodge on top of a packer or <b>coil</b> <b>tubing</b> in the well sticking the pipe.|$|R

50|$|These {{tasks are}} by default {{the realm of}} wireline. Because <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> is rigid, it can be pushed into the well from the surface. This is an {{advantage}} over wireline, which depends on {{the weight of the}} toolstring to be lowered into the well. For highly deviated and horizontal wells, gravity may be insufficient for wireline logging. Roller stem and tractors can often overcome this disadvantage at greatly reduced cost, particularly on small platforms and subsea wells where <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> would require mobilizing an expensive mobile drilling rig. The use of <b>coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> for these tasks is usually confined to occasions where it is already on site for another purpose, for example a logging run following a chemical wash.|$|E

CTD takes the well-established concept of <b>Coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> and combines it with directional drilling using a mud motor to create a system for drilling reservoirs. Bottom hole assemblies (BHAs) are now able to drill directional, S-curve and horizontal wells and can be the key to unlocking reserves in mature oilfields via re-entry drilling. <b>Coiled</b> <b>tubing</b> drilling is known for its speed and ability to drill reservoirs in an underbalanced condition and CTD can reduce drilling times between 30%-60% compared with conventional jointed pipe drilling rigs. Therefore, CTD can provide significant economic benefits.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} small {{diameter}} pump system capable of being deployed through existing production tubing strings in oil/gas wells. The pump system would then pump water up an inner <b>tubing</b> string (likely <b>coil</b> <b>tubing)</b> and allow gas to flow in the annulus between the <b>coil</b> <b>tubing</b> and production tubing. Accomplishing this would allow wells that are currently loaded up (unable to flow at high enough rates to lift the fluid out of the wellbore) to continue to produce additional gas/oil reserves. The project was unable to complete a working test system due to unforeseen complexities in coupling the system components together in part due to the small diameter. Although several of the individual components were sourced and secured, coupling them together and getting electricity to the motor proved technically more difficult than expected. Thus, the project is no longer active due primarily to the complications realized in coupling the components and the difficulties in getting electricity to the submersible motor in a slimhole system. The other problem in finishing this project was the lack of financial resources. When the grant was first applied for it was expected that it would be awarded in early 2004. Since the grant was not actually awarded until the end of August 2004, GPS had basically run out of $$$ and the principle developer (Steve Bodden) had to find a full time job which began in late July 2004. When the grant was finally awarded in late August, it was still hoped that the project could proceed as a part time development but with less financial exposure to the partners in GPS. This became very problematic as it still had many technical obstacles to overcome to get it to the stage of prototype testing...|$|R
