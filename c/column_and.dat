5|$|A bronze {{column in}} the shape of {{intertwined}} snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, acquired in the plunder of the Persian camp, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the <b>column,</b> <b>and</b> thus confirming some of Herodotus' claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new {{soft ground}} {{improvement}} method is proposed combined with soil–cement <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) {{to increase the}} bearing capacity and to accelerate the consolidation process of soft soil. A series of centrifugal modeling tests is conducted on an embankment on a composite foundation, combined with soil–cement <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> PVDs. The effects of <b>column</b> spacing <b>and</b> <b>column</b> length {{on the behavior of}} the composite foundation are considered. For comparison, two centrifugal modeling tests are conducted on the embankment, one involving only soil–cement <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> the other involving only PVDs. The embankment loads are applied in four stages using a hydraulic jack mounted on top of a strongbox. Scaled-down model <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> a kind of wool strings are used to simulate the prototype soil–cement <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> PVDs, respectively. The load sharing ratio, defined as the proportion of external loads carried by the columns, is used to evaluate the load transfer between the <b>columns</b> <b>and</b> the surrounding soil. The test results indicate that the load sharing ratio increases with an increase in <b>column</b> length <b>and</b> a decrease in column spacing. The ground settlement and the lateral displacement decrease with an increase in <b>column</b> length <b>and</b> a decrease in column spacing. Finally, the use of the combined method to mitigate differential settlements at a bridge approach is discussed...|$|R

Construct an equivalence class ID from the B2, B3 column triplet values. Use <b>column</b> <b>and</b> box swaps to achieve the lowest lexicographical ID.
