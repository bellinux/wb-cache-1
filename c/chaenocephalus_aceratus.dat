5000|$|Haemoglobin gives oxygenated blood its red colour. Unlike other vertebrates, fish of the Antarctic icefish family (Channichthyidae) {{do not use}} {{haemoglobin}} {{to transport}} oxygen around their bodies; instead, {{the small amount of}} oxygen that simply dissolves in blood plasma is utilized. In 2011 Tokyo Sea Life Park claimed that C. rastrospinosus has totally transparent blood [...] "like clear water", after dissecting a specimen. In 1954, Ruud noted that <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus,</b> another member of this family, had almost transparent blood, in contrast to the yellowish blood of other members. C. aceratus and C. rastrospinosus both fail to express the major adult α-globin, α1, due to the same 5' truncation of the gene, and have lost the β-globin gene entirely. Zhao et al. propose that an ancestral channichthyid fish lost expression of both genes through a single mutation. Antarctic icefish also have very few erythrocytes. It is believed they benefit from loss of reliance on haemoglobin-containing erythrocytes for oxygen transport by having less viscous, more easily pumped blood. They compensate for this loss by having lower metabolic rates, larger gills, scaleless skin that can contribute more to gas exchange, wider capillaries and significantly increased blood volume and cardiac output.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA primary {{objective}} of the ICEFISH 2004 cruise was to collect and study notothenioid fishes from remote localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Nearly 1 month was devoted to bottom trawling for fishes on the shelf and upper slope (to 1, 000 m) areas around Shag Rocks, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya. The focus was on the latter two locations, because their faunas are more poorly known. Eight species were collected at Shag Rocks with Patagonotothen guntheri most abundant; 17 at South Georgia with Lepidonotothen nudifrons, L. larseni and Gobionotothen gibberifrons most abundant; 13 at the South Sandwich Islands with L. larseni, L. nudifrons and G. gibberifrons most abundant; and 11 at Bouvetøya with L. larseni, Macrourus holotrachys and L. squamifrons most abundant. Ten new locality records were established: Shag Rocks (1), South Georgia (1), South Sandwich Islands (5), South Sandwich Trench at 5, 350 m (1) and Bouvetøya (2). Total known demersal fish diversity on the shelf and upper slope at Shag Rocks/South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands and Bouvetøya is 42, 31 and 17 species, respectively. To examine population structure in the four most abundant notothenioids at Bouvetøya (L. larseni, L. squamifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus),</b> we examined the ND 2 portion of mitochondrial DNA. <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus,</b> N. coriiceps and L. larseni exhibited no significant genetic differentiation in comparison with samples from localities in the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula. However, L. squamifrons showed significant genetic differentiation between the South Shetlands and Bouvetøya populations (F ST = 0. 189, P = 0. 015). Thus, these data combined with previous studies of two other notothenioids suggest that {{five of the six}} notothenioid species at Bouvetøya are not genetically differentiated from other localities in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean.

All tissues examined revealed a negative forcefrequency relationship. Under baseline conditions C. aceratus contracted with a force twice as great as that of N. coriiceps. While the degree to which ventricular tissues responded to adrenaline varied between species, adrenergic stimulation significantly increases myocyte contraction force in this group of fishes.

40|$|Abstract The Antarctic Wsh fauna is {{characterized}} by high endemism and low species diversity with one perci-form suborder, the Notothenioidei, dominating the whole species assemblage on the shelves and slopes. Nototheni-oids diversiWed in situ through adaptive radiation and show a variety of life history strategies as adults ranging from benthic to pelagic modes. Their larval development is unusually long, lasting from {{a few months to}} more than a year, and generally includes a pelagic larval stage. There-fore, the advection of eggs and larvae with ocean currents is a key factor modulating population connectivity. Here, we compare the genetic population structures and gene Xow of seven ecologically distinct notothenioid species of the southern Scotia Arc based on nuclear microsatellites and mitochondrial DNA sequences (D-loop/cytochrome b).

This investigation further develops a previous study on the species reporting the presence of one panmittic population in southern South Shetlands and Elephant Island, with genetic differentiation between year classes. Our results reveal a more complex pattern of differentiation than shown previously, as genetic differences occur both at the temporal level at Elephant Island and at the geographic scale between southern South Shetland–Elephant Islands and South Orkney population samples. In particular, the magnitude of genetic differentiation at the temporal scale, the relatively high effective population size (Ne) and high gene flow indicate that genetic differentiation is not only driven by geographic distance.

Consistent with the otolith chemistry, simulations of the large-scale circulation predicted that particles released at depths of 100 – 300 m on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf during spring, corresponding to hatching of icefish larvae from benthic nests, are transported in the southern ACC, missing South Georgia but following trajectories along the southern Scotia Ridge instead.

40|$|Aspects of the {{physiology}} and anatomy of cardiac and skeletal muscle in south polar notothenioid fish have been investigated. Relative ventricle weights for the haemoglobinless <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus</b> (family Channichthyidae) were approximately three {{times greater than}} for sympatric 'red-blooded' species. The ventricle in the channichthyid was 'sac-like' in shape and had an entirely trabecular myocardium: these characteristics were associated with low maximum myocardial power outputs (1. 46 mW(g ventricle weight) ⁻¹). The blood supply to the ventricle was through the venous lacunary circuit and vessels in the subepicardium. The myoglobin-poor ventricular myocardium in C. aceratus was composed of myocytes and granulated non-contractile cells. Myocardial cytochrome oxidase activity (34 μmoles g⁻¹min⁻¹) at O°C {{was similar to that}} of warmer-water species with myoglobin-rich ventricles. This suggests that the channichthyid has achieved compensation for the rate depressing effects of the low temperatures and low myoglobin concentrations on oxidative metabolism. Morphometric analyses of the myocytes in C. aceratus indicated that they had higher mitochondrial (0. 43) and lower myofibrillar (0. 31) volume densities than other teleosts. It was proposed that the proliferation of mitochondria serves to maintain high aerobic capacities by reducing oxygen diffusion distances between the lacunae and the myocytes.

40|$|Background: Pedomorphism is the {{retention}} of ancestrally juvenile traits by adults in a descendant taxon. Despite its importance for evolutionary change, there are few examples of a molecular basis for this phenomenon. Notothenioids represent {{one of the best}} described species flocks among marine fishes, but their diversity is currently threatened by the rapidly changing Antarctic climate. Notothenioid evolutionary history is characterized by parallel radiations from a benthic ancestor to pelagic predators, which was accompanied by the appearance of several pedomorphic traits, including the reduction of skeletal mineralization that resulted in increased buoyancy. Results: We compared craniofacial skeletal development in two pelagic notothenioids, <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus</b> and Pleuragramma antarcticum, to that in a benthic species, Notothenia coriiceps, and two outgroups, the threespine stickleback and the zebrafish. Relative to these other species, pelagic notothenioids exhibited a delay in pharyngeal bone development, which was associated with discrete heterochronic shifts in skeletal gene expression that were consistent with persistence of the chondrogenic program and a delay in the osteogenic program during larval development. Morphological analysis also revealed a bias toward the development of anterior and ventral elements of the notothenioid pharyngeal skeleton relative to dorsal and posterior elements.

Parental care, a widespread behaviour among icefishes such as C. aceratus, is not observed in C. gunnari, which has a broadcast spawning strategy. There were large differences in total fecundity mainly due to the different sizes reached by each species (total fecundity range was 2, 500 – 21, 300 hydrated oocytes). Nevertheless, when comparing relative fecundity values, the average results were, in general, similar for P. georgianus and C. aceratus (6 – 9 hydrated oocytes per female gram). However, relative fecundity estimated for C. gunnari was 10 – 37 hydrated oocytes per ovary-free female gram. The difference may be a consequence of the smaller oocyte size of the species as compared to other icefishes. The small diameter of hydrated oocytes was also associated with low values of dry weight. The high relative fecundity recorded for C. gunnnari may compensate, in part, for a broadcast spawning strategy. サウスジョージアおよびシャグロック諸島周辺海域より得られたコオリウオ科 3 種（Champsocephalus gunnari，Pseudochaenichthys georgianus，Chaenocephalus aceratus）の繁殖特性を組織学的に解析した。親魚による卵保護はコオリウオ科に広く見られる行動であるが，浮性卵を産むC. gunnari には認められない。 3 種の孕卵数はその体サイズと関連し， 2500 ～ 21300 と大きな差が認められた。一方，相対孕卵数はP. georgianus とC. aceratus が 6 ～ 9 なのに対してC. gunnari では 10 ～ 37 であった。この差はC. gunnariの卵が他種に比べて小さいことが原因と考えられた。C. gunnari における相対孕卵数の多さは，浮性卵を産むこの種の繁殖戦略を補完するものと考えられる...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of fish in}} the diet of the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella) at Bird Island, South Georgia was investigated by analysis of fish otoliths in scats (faeces) collected during late May to early November 1983. Of the 55 scats examined, 49 contained fish remains, and 45 contained fish otoliths. Ten fish species were represented by 415 otoliths, and 33 otoliths were too digested to be identified unequivocally. Fish size was estimated from otolith size based on published allometric equations. Four coastal notothenioid fishes dominated the fish component of the diet: Champsocephalus gunnari and Gobionotothen gibberifrons each comprised about 40 % of the total fish mass; <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus</b> was ranked third by mass and the smaller Lepidonotothen larseni occurred in {{one quarter of the}} scats but was of lower importance in terms of mass. The length-frequency distribution of C. gunnari landed by the commercial fishery in October 1982 to June 1983 is similar to that which comprised the bulk of the diet in the present study. Compared with recent studies on the fish component of the diet in the literature, the dominance of C. gunnari is generally similar, however, there was a greater proportion of G. gibberifrons during the 1983 winter and spring than reported for recent winters...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolated}} intestinal {{smooth muscle}} of Antarctic fishes Notothenia neglecta and the icefish <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus</b> displayed a sustained tonic contraction {{depending upon the}} temperature of the nutritive bath. The contraction was maximal at 2 ℃, relaxing proportionally with rise of the temperature, from 2 ℃ to 18 ℃. The contractile responses to acetylcholine gradually increased in proportion to the rise of temperature. By chelating calcium ions, EDTA caused a reversible relaxation of the contracted muscle at 2. 0 ℃. This effect was eliminated by washing out the drug from the muscle nutritive bath. Similar results were found with the administration of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker. However, after this drug, tonic contraction was not restored by washout. Such contraction was partially inhibited by the muscarinic blocking drug atropine. Results show that the tonic contraction is an active response, dependent on the entry of calcium into the cell and mediated by cholinergic receptors. The temperature-related tonic contraction is not a general event in poikilotherm animals, since it did not occur in the Bufo marinus intestinal smooth muscle, in similar experiments carried out as a control, in a tropical environment. The responsiveness of the smooth muscle to acetylcholine appeared to increase with temperature, suggesting lack of adaptation of the organ to low Antarctic temperature...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{capacity}} {{can influence}} distribution and abundance over large spatial scales through larval dispersal, even when adult stages remain isolated following settlement. We examined size distribution, reproductive traits and age structure in Scotia Sea icefish, <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus,</b> an abundant benthic species {{with a long}} larval pelagic phase found on continental shelves along the Southern Scotia Ridge. In particular, we compared life history strategies between fish caught during surveys undertaken off the South Orkney Islands (SOI) and South Shetland Islands (SSI). Results corroborated regional separation after settlement and suggested distinct life history strategies, in which fish from SOI invested much less in reproduction, and somewhat more in somatic growth earlier in their life history. Compared to SSI, body weight increased faster with length and absolute fecundity was 46 % lower and increased more slowly with size for SOI population. In addition, the proportion of spawning cohorts and L∞ was lower and k higher for SOI. The differences {{appeared to be a}} phenotypic response to environmental conditions related to regional hydrography. Lower reproductive capacity around the SOI, and strong eastward flow in the large-scale circulation, suggests that the SSI may be more important in influencing distributions and abundance of icefish along the Southern Scotia Ridge...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Pedomorphism is the {{retention}} of ancestrally juvenile traits by adults in a descendant taxon. Despite its importance for evolutionary change, there are few examples of a molecular basis for this phenomenon. Notothenioids represent {{one of the best}} described species flocks among marine fishes, but their diversity is currently threatened by the rapidly changing Antarctic climate. Notothenioid evolutionary history is characterized by parallel radiations from a benthic ancestor to pelagic predators, which was accompanied by the appearance of several pedomorphic traits, including the reduction of skeletal mineralization that resulted in increased buoyancy. Results We compared craniofacial skeletal development in two pelagic notothenioids, <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus</b> and Pleuragramma antarcticum, to that in a benthic species, Notothenia coriiceps, and two outgroups, the threespine stickleback and the zebrafish. Relative to these other species, pelagic notothenioids exhibited a delay in pharyngeal bone development, which was associated with discrete heterochronic shifts in skeletal gene expression that were consistent with persistence of the chondrogenic program and a delay in the osteogenic program during larval development. Morphological analysis also revealed a bias toward the development of anterior and ventral elements of the notothenioid pharyngeal skeleton relative to dorsal and posterior elements. Conclusions Our data support the hypothesis that early shifts in the relative timing of craniofacial skeletal gene expression may have {{had a significant impact on}} the adaptive radiation of Antarctic notothenioids into pelagic habitats. </p...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{anthropogenic}} pollution are of increasing concern {{in remote areas}} such as Antarctica. The evolutionary adaptation of Antarctic notothenioid fish to the cold and stable Southern Ocean led to a low plasticity of their physiological functions, what may limit their capacity to deal with altered temperature regimes and pollution in the Antarctic environment. Using a biochemical approach, we aimed to assess the hepatic biotransformation capacities of Antarctic fish species by determining (i) the activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and (ii) the metabolic clearance of benzo(a) pyrene by hepatic S 9 supernatants. In addition, we determined the thermal sensitivity of the xenobiotic biotransformation enzymes. We investigated the xenobiotic metabolism of the red-blooded Gobionotothen gibberifrons and Notothenia rossii, the hemoglobin-less <b>Chaenocephalus</b> <b>aceratus</b> and Champsocephalus gunnari, and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss as a reference. Our results revealed similar metabolic enzyme activities and metabolic clearance rates between red- and white-blooded Antarctic fish, but significantly lower rates in comparison to rainbow trout. Therefore, bioaccumulation factors for metabolizable lipophilic contaminants may be higher in Antarctic than in temperate fish. Likewise, the thermal adaptive capacities and flexibilities of the EROD and GST activities in Antarctic fish were significantly lower than in rainbow trout. As a consequence, increasing water temperatures in the Southern Ocean will additionally compromise the already low detoxification capacities of Antarctic fish...|$|E
