5|$|The city of Nanning was {{announced}} {{as the host}} venue for the 2010 World Half Marathon Championship at the IAAF Council Meeting in Monaco in November 2008. The winning bid was a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of major international athletics events in the People's Republic of China, which included the 2006 World Junior Championships and a highly successful athletics competition at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It {{was the first time}} that China hosted the competition, becoming the second Asian country to do so after India, which held the 2004 edition in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dot of August 1959 was at {{its time}} the costliest {{tropical}} cyclone in Hawaiian history. Dot was first identified as a strong tropical storm southeast of Hawaii on August1. The storm was potentially a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> previously unnamed tropical cyclone that was monitored west of the Baja California Peninsula from July24-27, but was never confirmed {{due to a lack}} of ship reports. Dot was quick to intensify, reaching hurricane intensity six hours after naming. By August3, Dot reached its peak intensity, with maximum sustained winds reaching 150mph (240km/h). Intensity leveled off afterwards as Dot tracked westward before making a curve towards the northwest on August5, after which the hurricane weakened at a faster clip. Dot made landfall the next day on Kauai as a minimal hurricane before dissipating west of the Hawaiian Islands on August8.|$|E

50|$|In general, -yoru {{refers to}} the {{progression}} or <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> action or occurrence, while -choru {{refers to the}} completion, <b>continuation,</b> or result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> condition or status.

5|$|Several other bouts {{were planned}} for Genesis, of these the most {{significant}} were a No Disqualification match and a match to determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The No Disqualification match was between Abyss and Sabu. This was a rematch from TNA's Unbreakable PPV event on September11, which Abyss won. Abyss and Sabu also fought in Monster's Ball II at Bound for Glory, which Rhino won. TNA advertised Monty Brown versus Jeff Hardy to determine the number-one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship heading into Genesis. This was a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storyline in which Brown sought to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Both of these encounters were advertised on TNA's website following Bound for Glory.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace was}} short lived, however, as in August 1970, eight black {{players on the}} Syracuse Orange {{football}} team {{did not show up}} for preseason practice, citing systemic racism in the program and discrimination by coach Ben Schwartzwalder. The move was a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boycott of spring practice by the players, and they were automatically suspended as a result. A university report released in December of that year declared that there was a chronic problem of racism in the Syracuse athletics programs, though in some cases the discrimination was unintentional. In response, Corbally reinstated the players and approved the creation of the Athletic Policy Board to oversee athletics at the school. The board would include input from students and ensure that all students, regardless of race, were entitled to fair treatment.|$|E
5|$|On December7, 2009, Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) issued {{their first}} {{extended}} range {{outlook for the}} 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting 13.9 named storms, 7.4 hurricanes, 3.4 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 135 units. The organization referenced two main factors, slower trade winds across the Caribbean and above-average ocean temperatures across the Atlantic, for an above-average season. Two days later, Colorado State University (CSU) issued their first extended range outlook, projecting 11 to 16 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, 3 to 5 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 100 to 162 units. The organization stated that although a strong El Niño event was ongoing at the release of their forecast, a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warm El Niño-Southern Oscillation was unlikely to persist through the hurricane season. On January27, 2010, The Weather Company (formerly WSI) called for the year to feature 13 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was not meant to be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

25|$|The Neolithic era {{began in}} Catalonia around 5000 BC, {{although}} {{the population was}} slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the <b>continuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fundamentally hunter-gatherer culture.|$|E
