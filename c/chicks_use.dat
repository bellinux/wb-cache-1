40|$|Summary. We {{measured}} {{meteorological conditions}} and estimated the energy costs of thermoregulation for young and adult Ad 61 ie Penguins (Pygoscel is adeliae) at a breeding colony near the Antarctic Peninsula. Air temperatures averaged < 5 ~ and strong winds were frequent. Operative temperatures (Te) for adults ranged from- 8 to 28 ~ C, averaging 5 - 6 ~ C, {{for the period}} from courtship to fledging of chicks. The average nergy cost of thermoregulation (Cth) for adult penguins was equiva-lent to 10 - 16 % of basal metabolism. Cth comprised about 15 % of the estimated aily energy budget (DEB) of incubating adults, but only about 1 % of the DEB of adults feeding chicks. The Te's for chicks older than 14 days ranged from 0 to 31 ~ C, averaging 8. 0 C. The Cth for downy chicks ranged from about 31 % of minimal metabolic rate (MMR) in 1 kg chicks to about 10 % of MMR in 3 kg chicks. Between initial thermal indepen-dence (age 12 - 14 days) and the cessation of parental feeding (age 35 - 40 days), <b>chicks</b> <b>use</b> about 10 - 11 % of assimilated energy for thermoregulation.

Prey-carrying puffins were captured in mist-nets, or observed with a telescope or with unaided eyes. Prey samples collected in mist-nets yielded higher proportions of gravid capelin Mallotus villosus than did samples obtained visually. Telescopic samples produced higher {{estimates of the}} numbers of larval fish landed by puffins (larval fishes are often lost when food-laden birds are caught in mist-nets), and yielded underestimates of the lengths of male capelin. Slight correction factors made the 3 prey sampling methods comparable. Visual sampling procedures had the advantages of creating less disturbance and allowing puffins to deliver food to <b>chicks.</b> <b>Use</b> of telescopic sampling is, however, dependent on colony topography. Forage fishes, heavily dominated by 2 -yr-old capelin, made up 88 % and 98 % of the frequency and mass, respectively, of the prey delivered to puffin chicks. Small prey (larval capelin and sandlance Ammodytes spp., hake Urophycis tenuis, crustaceans) were most commonly fed to young chicks. Gravid and male capelin {{tended to be more}} commonly ted to chicks midway through the nestling period, a time of rapid growth. Spent female and immature capelin were fed more commonly to older chicks. The lengths of gravid capelin tended to increase through the nestling period. Gravid and spent female and male capelin and sandlance fed to puffin chicks were shorter in 1992 than in 1993 or 1994. Successful puffin chicks on Great Island, Newfoundland, Canada, were fed an average of 1105 (SD = 435) prey items weighing 2812 g (SD = 579) equivalent to 12506 kJ (SD = 2391). Extrapolation of these findings suggests that the population of Atlantic puffins in Newfoundland consumes about 8000 + t of forage fishes, mostly 2 -yr-old female capelin during a breeding season.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the navigational {{abilities}} of domestic fowl. The question of how chickens represent and orient in space becomes relevant when they are kept in non-cage systems. Since the sun is known to be the dominant spatial organiser in other diurnal bird species, we started our investigation of the chicken's spatial abilities by subjecting them to a food-searching task with the sun as the only consistent visual cue. In an additional experiment we tried to rule out the use of auditory cues in finding a food reward. Eight ISA Brown chicks were housed in outdoor pens. A separate test arena comprised an open-topped, opaque-sided wooden octagon (2 m wide and 1. 5 m high). Eight goal boxes with food pots were attached to each of the arena sides; a wooden barrier inside each goal box prevented the birds from seeing the food pot before entering. After habituation we tested during five daily 5 min trials whether the chicks were able to find food in a systematically allocated goal direction. Food residue in every foot pot controlled for the use of olfactory cues and no external landmark cues were visible. Every day each box was unpredictably moved to a randomly assigned side of the arena and the side to face north was also randomly allocated, to prevent the chicks from using cues other than the sun's position. Circular statistics were used to determine whether birds moved in a non-random direction and if so, if they significantly oriented goalwards. The results showed that seven of the eight birds moved significantly in the goal direction. It seems likely that the chicks used the sun to orient. Due to weather constraints only four chicks received the same treatment on a new location, to rule out the use of auditory cues. Two of these four chicks significantly moved in the goal direction. The results from our experiments show that domestic <b>chicks</b> <b>use</b> spatial memory to orient towards a hidden goal. Moreover, their orientation is most likely to be based on sun cues opening up the possibility that the sun compass may dominate even in this ancestrally predominantly ground-living forest bird. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Domestic chicks {{are able}} to find a food goal at {{different}} times of day, with the sun as the only consistent visual cue. This suggests that domestic chickens may use the sun as a time-compensated compass, rather than as a beacon. An alternative explanation is that the birds might use the earth's magnetic field. In this study, we investigated the role of the sun compass in a spatial orientation task using a clock-shift procedure. Furthermore, we investigated whether domestic chickens use magnetic compass information when tested under sunny conditions. Ten ISA Brown chicks were housed in outdoor pens. A separate test arena comprised an open-topped, opaque-sided, wooden octagonal maze. Eight goal boxes with food pots were attached one to each of the arena sides. A barrier inside each goal box prevented the birds from seeing the food pot before entering. After habituation, we tested in five daily 5 -min trials whether chicks were able to find food in an systematically allocated goal direction. We controlled for the use of olfactory cues and intra-maze cues. No external landmarks were visible. All tests were done under sunny conditions. Circular statistics showed that nine chicks significantly oriented goalwards using the sun as the only consistent visual cue during directional testing. Next, these nine chicks were subjected to a clock-shift procedure to test for the role of sun-compass information. The chicks were housed indoors for 6 days on a light-schedule that was 6 h ahead of the natural light-dark schedule. After clock-shifting, the birds were tested again and all birds except one were disrupted in their goalward orientation. For the second experiment, six birds were re-trained and fitted with a tiny, powerful magnet on the head to disrupt their magnetic sense. The magnets did not affect the chicks' goalward orientation. In conclusion, although the strongest prediction of the sun-compass hypothesis (significant re-orientation after clock-shifting) was neither confirmed nor refuted, our results suggest that domestic <b>chicks</b> <b>use</b> the sun as a compass rather than as a beacon. These findings suggest that hens housed indoors in large non-cage systems may experience difficulties in orientation if adequate alternative cues are unavailable. Further research should elucidate how hens kept in non-cage systems orient in space in relation to available resources. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
