40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} a venting {{process for}} nitrogen <b>gas</b> heated <b>up</b> to 3, 400 °F and 27, 000 psi. Nitrogen at similar temperatures and pressures have successfully been vented in {{hot isostatic pressing}} (HIP) manufacturing processes, but to date no further applications are known for Heater Vessels used in hypersonic wind tunnels. The thesis first focuses on the instrumentation and experimental setup to test venting nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>up</b> to 1550 °F and 22, 000 psi and to measure thermal stratification in the Heater Vessel. The results of the experiment show the current Heater Vessel is capable of venting nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>up</b> to 1550 °F and 22, 000 psi by instrumenting critical locations and leveraging passive cooling. The thesis then focuses on {{using data from the}} experiment to design a system that is capable of venting nitrogen <b>gas</b> heated <b>up</b> to 3, 400 °F and 27, 000 psi through the bottom closure of the Heater Vessel...|$|R
