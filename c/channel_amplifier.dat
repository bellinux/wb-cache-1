40|$|Quantum <b>amplifier</b> <b>channels</b> are at {{the core}} of several {{physical}} processes. Not only do they model the optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion, but the transformation corresponding to an <b>amplifier</b> <b>channel</b> also describes the physics of the dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting circuits, the Unruh effect, and Hawking radiation. Here we study the communication capabilities of quantum <b>amplifier</b> <b>channels.</b> Invoking a recently established minimum output-entropy theorem for single-mode phase-insensitive Gaussian channels, we determine capacities of quantum-limited <b>amplifier</b> <b>channels</b> in three different scenarios. First, we establish the capacities of quantum-limited <b>amplifier</b> <b>channels</b> {{for one of the most}} general communication tasks, characterized by the trade-off between classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement generation or consumption. Second, we establish capacities of quantum-limited <b>amplifier</b> <b>channels</b> for the trade-off between public classical communication, private classical communication, and secret key generation. Third, we determine the capacity region for a broadcast channel induced by the quantum-limited <b>amplifier</b> <b>channel,</b> and we also show that a fully quantum strategy outperforms those achieved by classical coherent detection strategies. In all three scenarios, we find that the capacities significantly outperform communication rates achieved with a naive time-sharing strategy.

5000|$|The Overdrive Special is a two <b>channel</b> <b>amplifier,</b> {{with a clean}} {{channel and}} a second [...] "{{overdrive}}" [...] channel. This overdrive channel is described as [...] "cascading" [...] from the first channel into at least one additional gain stage in the overdrive channel. This means that the clean channel tone stack and gain stages [...] "cascade" [...] into the gain stage of the overdrive channel, causing the clean channel to become [...] "overdriven". In a sense, the overdrive channel sits [...] "on top" [...] of the clean channel. This is easily Dumble's most popular model, and subsequently is the most frequently seen. That said, the ODS (Overdrive Special) varies considerably from decade to decade, and serial number to serial number. For example, although most ODS amplifiers use 6L6 tubes in the power section (commonly associated with Fender amps), some have EL34 tubes (commonly associated with Marshall amps). On the other hand, even among the many 6L6 versions of the ODS, there are considerable variations. For example, some have a clean channel that stays clean [...] "all {{the way up to}} 10" [...] (referencing a gain potentiometer ranging from 1 - 10). Others have a clean channel that will start to [...] "break up" [...] around 3. Some overdrive channels can only reach a minimal amount of breakup, even when dialed up. However, most ODS overdrive channels have a large amount of tube distortion available if so desired. Along these same lines, many later versions of the ODS have [...] "HRM" [...] controls {{on the inside of the}} amplifier, which is a [...] "Hot Rodded Marshall" [...] tone stack that sits [...] "on top" [...] of the overdrive channel, or in other words comes after the Overdrive channel tube gain stage.|$|E

40|$|New {{concepts}} of telecommunication satellites request very small, highly integrated and linearised travelling wave tube amplifiers (LTWTA). A linearised <b>channel</b> <b>amplifier</b> (LCAMP) and an {{electronic power conditioner}} (EPC) was developed to be integrated together building one unit for the C- and Ku-Band. The LCAMP was designed for a short travelling wave tube (STWT) and optimised mechanically for the integration with the developed EPC regarding best electrical performance, volume and weight. This could be realised by applying new components (like SMD-parts, ASIC and MMIC) {{and the development of}} a new housing. One major task was the selection of a MMIC-manufacturer, the designing of MMIC and the final testing for the LCAMP. A potential high-rel manufacturer (UMS- united microwave semiconductor) has been selected and the measured results of the MMIC are close to the calculated. An ESA-evaluation was performed in the frame of LVS-Study at UMS successfully. Bosch evaluated the market for microwave packages and selected finally Kyocera who provides packages for applications up to 20 GHz. The experience during procurement of packages was important for integration of MMIC into LCAMP. The LCAMP was integrated with the EPC in C- and Ku-band and finally tested with the STWT. Particular good results were measured for intermodulation products and phase shift behaviour. All other requirements of the integrated LTWTA were fulfilled, if they are in the nature of the LCAMP and EPC only. The achieved size of the EPC is 198 x 110 x 60, 5 mm and the total weight of the LTWTA is about 2300 grams (including <b>channel</b> <b>amplifier,</b> lineariser, EPC, STWT and connecting cables).

40|$|The report {{covers the}} work {{which has been}} done in {{conjunction}} with the design, manufacturing, integration and testing of an integrated linearized transmitter unit (ILS). The test results are all within the specifications. The integrated linearized transmitter unit consists of a short TWT (30 dB saturation gain) and an integrated linearizing front end (70 dB gain) with the EPC. The integration of the Linearizing Front End (LFE) ind the EPC reduces the mounting area and increases the efficiency and improves the EMC characteristics. The new smart integrated linearized transmitter unit (ILS) has a higher efficiency, lower mass and smaller mounting area on the platform in comparison with the solution of single equipment (i. e. <b>channel</b> <b>amplifier,</b> linearizer, TWT and EPC) hitherto used.
