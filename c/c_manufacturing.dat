These applications need higher performance than a-Si and require lower cost, lower temperature (3 ̆c 250 <b>C)</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes for flexible substrates like plastic. Nanonet thin film transistors (NN-TFTs), which consist of networks of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) or Si nanowires (SiNWs) as channel materials, are emerging as a promising alternative to a-Si technology. In addition to applications in electronics, recently CNT nanonets are also emerging as highly transparent and flexible alternative for the conventional ITO electrode in photovoltaic applications. Here the density and alignment of tubes is a crucial optimization criterion to obtain the best combination of transparency and conductivity. ^ Although recent research activities have demonstrated the versatility of these TFTs and PV cells, there has been little theoretical modeling effort to systematically organize and interpret the large amounts of experiments. The 2 D stick percolation theory needs to be generalized and several key aspects like high voltage behavior, short channel characteristics, 3 D electrostatics, co-percolation of metallic/semiconducting subnetworks, optical/sensing properties, etc. are yet to be successfully modeled within this theoretical framework.

With the aim of identifying localization benefits in a particular area, some aspects of business settling are compared with trends in the development of economic activities and, particularly, with agglomeration process of the firms. Methods and Results The empirical analysis will be carried out pointing to the dynamics of employment consequent to the effects of the externalities above mentioned. Employment data are taken from the Manufacturing and Service Censuses of the years 1981, 1991 and 2001 and refer to the 77 Sicilian Local Labour Systems. Precisely, data pertain to the following sections of the classification ATECO 2002 : Mining and quarrying (<b>C),</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> (D) and Total private services (G, H, I, J, K). We consider some suitable economic indicators to depict the characteristics of concentration: _ localization ratios for studying the evolutionary trends in specialization for different types of economic activity; _ diversity measures, based on a Hirschman-Herfindahl index, suggesting the presence of Jacobs-type dynamic externalities or, on the contrary, the operativeness of MAR dynamic effects; _ competition indices to gather information about the competition levels of the markets depending on their structure; _ agglomeration indices, to measure the geographic concentration of the economic activity connected to high and/or increasing industrial concentration levels in the adjacent LLS. Conclusions The agglomeration process results from inter-sector links, easing the diffusion of innovations thanks to the variety of urban contexts. Agglomeration forces appear to be outweighed, especially since 2001, by the influence of co-agglomeration factors due to the presence, in the same local reality, of small-sized enterprises belonging to different sectors. Owing to the increasing interdependence among sectors, these effects caused a redistribution of employment among the different groups of economic activities. The indexes showed how, during the inter-census gaps, a despecialization trend took over, bringing local production structures constantly closer to the average regional values. ...|$|E

Due to the relatively advanced stage of the transitional processes in Romania, the behavioural functions were modelled - as much as possible - by the standard relationships. Besides, unlike the previous versions (that used statistical series beginning with 1980) the present one is based exclusively on information regarding the period 1989 - 2004. Since the input-output tables are defined yearly, the model contains only annual indicators. They are expressed in denominated local currency (RON). The export, import, and exchange rate series were transformed in Euro. When there were several informational sources for the same indicator, the data extracted or derived from national accounts have been adopted. The statistical series are relatively short and often fractured (because of the transforming processes of transition). Although, it is known that ADF test of stationarity does not offer reliable results in the case of limited number of observations, generally the series satisfying it were used. The simplest regression methods were also preferred. The structural breaks in evolution of some series have been dealt by the inclusion of dummies. Obviously, all these circumstances weaken the stability of econometric coefficients that must be continuously updated. The first two chapters of the paper characterise the main macroeconomic behavioural relationships and input-output coefficients. The third one discusses a possible scenario for the Romanian economy during 2005 - 2010.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the spatial dependence among productive specialization, {{variety of the}} economic environment and knowledge spillovers. With the aim of identifying localization benefits in a particular area, some aspects of business settling are compared with trends {{in the development of}} economic activities and, particularly, with agglomeration process of the firms. On the basis of the model proposed by Ellison and Glaeser (1997) it is possible identifying an “agglomerate space” that is to say a “continuous set of territorial areas specialized in a specific sector one of which, at least, proves to be provided with a level of specialization noticeably exceeding the expected value under the hypothesis of a lack of agglomeration benefits” (Iuzzolino, 2004). The study of dynamic externalities will make a distinction between: 1) localization economies: intra-industry spillovers arising from the stock of knowledge transferred from one local firm to another belonging to the same industry. This type of externalities turn into productive specialization, skilled labour and enhancement of activities subsidiary to the core-business; 2) urbanization economies: inter-industry spillovers deriving from the localization of the firms in cities where the stock of knowledge was built up thanks to the historical diversity. The empirical analysis will be carried out pointing to the dynamics of employment consequent to the effects of the externalities above mentioned. Employment data are taken from the Manufacturing and Service Censuses of the years 1981, 1991 and 2001 and refer to the 77 Local Labour Systems (LLS hereafter) that represent the result of the spatial aggregation of neighbouring municipalities based on the daily commuting flows of local population owing to work reasons.

40|$|RESEARCH QUESTION Big {{data may}} {{significantly}} improve {{the efficiency and}} effectiveness of the firm's marketing capabilities. However, firms must overcome technological, skill-based and organisational challenges to become data-driven. Academic research has not empirically investigated how strategic big data resources, and to what extent, influence strategic marketing capabilities and, by extension, firm performance. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to remedy this crucial knowledge gap. METHOD & DATA We employed a survey study methodology and administered online questionnaires for data collection. Our sampling frame focuses on strategic business units (SBUs) in large (> 1000 employees), US-based, B 2 <b>C</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and service firms who have invested in big data technologies to support marketing decision making. Using a commercial research panel provider, we targeted senior marketing executives in SBUs across a range of B 2 C industries. The survey was sent to senior marketing executives and 301 usable responses were received in return to form the final sample. Partial Least Squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used as the primary analysis method. KEY CONTRIBUTIONS The study makes two important theoretical contributions with managerial relevance. Firstly, this study makes a novel theoretical contribution with the parsimonious conceptualisation of big data resources (BDR). While all three dimensions (big data technology resources, big data analytics skills, organisational big data resources) are necessary and distinct facets of BDR, big data analytics skills are most important in enhancing marketing capabilities (MC). Based on these findings, we advise managers to ensure that all aspects of the firm’s overall big data asset are sufficient. Second, the results show that MC fully mediates the relationship between BDR and firm performance, indicating that BDR is a source of competitive advantage when leveraged in complementary marketing processes. We therefore urge managers to ensure that big data resources are properly aligned with the firm’s marketing processes. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS In this paper, we posit that strategic big data resources (BDR) {{play a key role in}} improving strategic marketing capabilities (MC) to achieve competitive advantage. Empirical findings from a survey of 301 senior marketing executives, representing large US-based firms in B 2 C industries, support the proposed model. The results highlight that BDR, encompassing technological, human and organizational IT resources, is a critical antecedent of MC. The findings also show that BDR is a source of competitive advantage when leveraged by MC...|$|E

At the same time, this model introduces some methodological and informational improvements, in comparison to previous versions.

Besides, unlike the previous versions, that used statistical series beginning with 1980, the present one is based exclusively on information regarding the period 1989 - 2004. Therefore, we have considered more adequate to name this variant the macromodel of the Romanian market (not transition, as before) economy. Since the input-output tables are defined yearly, the model contains only annual indicators. They are expressed in denominated local currency (RON). When there were several informational sources for the same indicator, we preferred the data extracted or derived from national accounts. The statistical series are relatively short and often fractured (because of the transforming processes of transition). Although, it is known that ADF test of stationarity does not offer reliable results in the case of limited number of observations, generally the series satisfying it were used. The Granger causality test was computed for one, two, and three lags. The simplest methods of estimation were also preferred. The structural breaks in the evolution of some indicators have been dealt by the inclusion of dummies. Obviously, all these circumstances weaken the stability of econometric coefficients that must be continuously updated. The main relationships are grouped in seven sections: input-output block; labour market, production function; domestic absorption, foreign trade, prices and exchange rate, and interest rate. The first two chapters present conceptual framework of macromodel and econometric analysis on which it is based. The next one describes a possible scenario for the Romanian economy during 2005 - 2010 years.
