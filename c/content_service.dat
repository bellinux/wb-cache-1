25|$|The Rock Band Network is a {{downloadable}} <b>content</b> <b>service</b> {{designed by}} Harmonix and Microsoft to allow artists and labels to author ("chart") their own songs for play in Rock Band. Using special software provided by Harmonix, these songs are peer-reviewed for content before {{being put on}} the Network, and users {{will be able to}} browse through the available songs by several means. The Network will augment the songs added by Harmonix as downloadable content for the game. The Network became publicly available to Xbox 360 players on March 4, 2010, with all of the songs immediately available to the Network Store for Xbox 360, and certain selections of songs available to the PlayStation 3 and Wii. A major update of the Network was released early in 2011, after Rock Band 3 release, to including authoring tools for normal and Pro keyboards and vocal harmonies, but will not initially support Pro guitar/bass authoring until Harmonix is able to judge the support required for these tools. Harmonix also plans to better support the PlayStation 3 through this iteration. Due to lack of interest and difficulties with Nintendo's Wii storefront, Harmonix has discontinued making Network songs available for the Wii. Xbox 360 players will still be able to create and add songs to the Rock Band Network following the April 2, 2013 end of regular DLC, but Harmonix has stated that while these mechanisms are generally automated, they are based on third-party technology like Microsoft XNA, and should those services cease, so will the functionality of the Network. As release of Network songs for the PlayStation 3 require Harmonix to be fully involved, no further Network songs will be available for the PlayStation 3 after April 2, 2013. The Network was fully shuttered in September 2014 to allow Harmonix to move forward on other projects. Rock Band Network songs are incompatible with Rock Band 4 at launch; however, Harmonix has stated they will explore the logistics of bringing RBN songs into Rock Band 4 after completing the transition of all official DLC, packs, and disc exports.|$|E
