25|$|Muslim jurists have {{debated whether}} and when <b>coerced</b> <b>confession</b> and coerced {{witnesses}} are acceptable. In the Ottoman Criminal Code, the executive officials {{were allowed to}} use torture only if the accused had a bad reputation and there were already indications of his guilt, such as when stolen goods were found in his house, if {{he was accused of}} grievous bodily harm by the victim or if a criminal during investigation mentioned him as an accomplice. Confessions obtained under torture could not be used as a ground for awarding punishment unless they were corroborated by circumstantial evidence.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{more than}} 100 men had {{said they were}} {{tortured}} on the South Side under Burge's watch. In addition to suffering electric shock, they told stories of police putting a loaded gun in their mouth or a typewriter cover over their head to make them believe they would die. On the basis of newly discovered evidence, the Chicago Police Department in 1993 fired Burge, having {{found that there was}} “systematic” torture at Area 2. In 1994, Taylor, together with law partners Joey Mogul and Tim Lohraff, began representing death row inmate Aaron Patterson, who alleged that he was tortured by Burge and his men into a <b>coerced</b> <b>confession.</b>|$|E
25|$|Miller's {{experience}} with the HUAC affected him throughout his life. In the late 1970s he became {{very interested in the}} highly publicized Barbara Gibbons murder case, in which Gibbons' son Peter Reilly was convicted of his mother's murder based on what many felt was a <b>coerced</b> <b>confession</b> and little other evidence. City Confidential, an A Network series, produced an episode about the murder, postulating that part of the reason Miller took such an active interest (including supporting Reilly's defense and using his own celebrity to bring attention to Reilly's plight) was because he had felt similarly persecuted in his run-ins with the HUAC. He sympathized with Reilly, whom he firmly believed to be innocent and to have been railroaded by the Connecticut State Police and the Attorney General who had initially prosecuted the case.|$|E

500|$|In chapter {{twelve of}} Ethics, Rothbard turns his {{attention}} to suspects arrested by the police. He argues that police {{should be able to}} torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard, [...] "Suppose ... police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a <b>coerced</b> <b>confession</b> could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault". Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to frame the suspect, after having tortured him or her.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2009, Heather Strong {{was kidnapped}} and murdered in Marion County, Florida. [...] Maintaining her innocence, and {{complaining}} of <b>coerced</b> <b>confession,</b> Emilia Lily Carr was nevertheless found guilty in December 2010 {{and sentenced to}} death by lethal injection in February 2011. [...] Carr was one of five women on death row in the state of Florida. On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole. Heather Strong's husband, and Carr's co-accused, Joshua Fulgham was similarly convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death. At a separate trial, where he pled guilty, Joshua Fulgham received two consecutive sentences of life in prison.|$|E
2500|$|The Massiah rule {{is also to}} be {{contrasted with}} the voluntariness {{standard}} of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and {{regardless of whether the}} suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony. The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from <b>coerced</b> <b>confession</b> cannot be waived nor is it necessary that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v. Connelly. Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances. [...] "Voluntary" [...] carried its everyday meaning - the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion. After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct. Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.|$|E
