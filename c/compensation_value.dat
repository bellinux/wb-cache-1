Specifically, the researchers hypothesised that peer-rejected {{children would have}} less supportive school friendships than more average peers, and that while such children would have more social and emotional problems they would also derive more support from a peer alternative, alleviating their difficulties. The peer alternative could be either a sibling or a nonschool friend.

Unlike Rubin et al.'s longitudinal study, East and Rook used a cross-sectional design. Although this avoided any attrition problems, a selection was still possible: 35% of the parents of eligible adolescents declined to allow their children to participate, for largely unstated reasons.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the easements and <b>compensation</b> <b>values</b> of fruit trees {{in the cases of}} pipeline crossing has been undertaken for Albania, Greece, Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. The {{purpose of the study was}} to compare assessment methodologies for important land use elements during construction and operation phases of pipelines. Investors in the case of pipeline construction demand land for purchase, rent, right of way or easement for tree planting restriction in the range of 8 m. In this study, only two types of compensation are compared: (i) easement and (ii) fruit tree <b>compensation</b> <b>values.</b> Discussion of the methods and their calculation formulas show that there are differences in easement quotes. They were equal to 50 % of the land value in Albania, Greece and Turkey and 60 % of the land value in the other countries. In fruit tree <b>compensation,</b> the <b>value</b> differences were even greater due to the application of different methods. They were the lowest in Albania and Turkey compared to other countries. However, in all cases, the compensation and easement rates were in accordance with national legislation and met the basic principle of the property right use and the fair compensation of easements and fruit trees sacrificed by the works...|$|R

50|$|In {{early history}} of Islam, there were {{considerable}} disagreements in Muslim jurist opinions on applicability of qisas and diyah when a Muslim murdered a non-Muslim (dhimmi, musta'min or slave). Most scholars of Hanafi school of sharia ruled that, if a Muslim killed a dhimmi, qisas was applicable against the Muslim, but this could be averted by paying a diyah. In one case, the Hanafi jurist Abu Yusuf initially ordered qisas when a Muslim killed a dhimmi, but under Caliph Harun al-Rashid's pressure replaced the order with diyah if the victim's family members were unable to prove the victim was paying jizya willingly as a dhimmi. The Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali code of sharia have historically ruled that Qisas does not apply against a Muslim, if he murders any non-Muslim (including dhimmi) or a slave for any reason. A diyah was payable instead. The early Hanafi and Hanbali Sunni jurists considered the payable diyah for Muslim and non-Muslim male victims to be same, while the Maliki school considered a non-Muslim male's value of life as worth half of a Muslim, and the Shafi'i school considered it worth a third. The Ja'fari school considered a non-Muslim male victim's value to be only 800 dirhams in contrast to 10000 dirhams for a Muslim male victim. The <b>compensation</b> <b>value</b> payable to {{the owner of a}} slave by a Muslim murderer, was the market price paid for the slave. The diyah for a murdered woman was half than the diyah for a murdered man, in all fiqhs of Islamic law. Further, in Hanafi and Maliki sharia doctrines, a diyah was not payable to a non-Muslim from a murderer's estate, if the murderer dies for natural or other causes during the trial.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — High {{dynamics}} of machine tool centers lead to high acceleration forces, which deform the machine structure {{and result in}} force coupling effects. In order to achieve high productivity combined with high path accuracy at existing machine tools, a numerical compensation of these dynamic effects is desirable. A model of an existing machine tool system allowed the evaluation of various compensation algorithms. The expected deviations of the uncompensated system can be gathered by simulation or measurement and further be used as set trajectory for the NC (offline compensation). Since this <b>compensation</b> <b>values</b> are subjected {{to the influence of}} the set point generation and the machine structure, only a marginal reduction of the deviations can be observed. Better results can be achieved by real time calculation of the <b>compensation</b> <b>values</b> based on actual velocity and jerk <b>values</b> (online <b>compensation).</b> Online compensation opens a broad range of possibilities for access points and compensation models. Good results on a model based evaluation of compensation strategies have been reached with compensation superposed directly on the torque feed forward input of the drives evaluated from set acceleration and jerk I...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} permeability of photovoltaic (PV) power production, the uncertainties and randomness of PV power {{have played a}} critical role in the operation and dispatch of the power grid and amplified the abandon rate of PV power. Consequently, the accuracy of PV power forecast urgently needs to be improved. Based on the amplitude and fluctuation characteristics of the PV power forecast error, a short-term PV output forecast method that considers the error calibration is proposed. Firstly, typical climate categories are defined to classify the historical PV power data. On the one hand, due to the non-negligible diversity of error amplitudes in different categories, the probability density distributions of relative error (RE) are generated for each category. Distribution fitting is performed to simulate probability density function (PDF) curves, and the RE samples are drawn from the fitted curves to obtain the sampling values of the RE. On the other hand, based on the fluctuation characteristic of RE, the recent RE data are utilized to analyze the error fluctuation conditions of the forecast points so as to obtain the <b>compensation</b> <b>values</b> of the RE. The <b>compensation</b> <b>values</b> are adopted to sequence the sampling values by choosing the sampling values closest to the compensation ones to be the fitted values of the RE. On this basis, the fitted values of the RE are employed to correct the forecast values of PV power and improve the forecast accuracy...|$|R
