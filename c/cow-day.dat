40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the performance of a conventional and a modified plug-flow digester for scraped dairy cattle manure based on results from 12 -month studies to characterize the performance of each design with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production and utilization. Both are full-scale digesters located on commercial dairy farms. The primary objective of this comparison was to determine if either design approach provides superior performance with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production. The modified plug-flow digester was found to provide a higher reduction in total volatile solids (TVS), 39. 6 versus 29. 7 percent, a higher biogas yield, 3. 08 versus 2. 21 m 3 per <b>cow-day,</b> and higher electricity production, 13, 896 versus 9, 380 kJ per <b>cow-day.</b> However, these differences were found to be directly related to the difference in the readily biodegradable fraction of influent TVS, 47 versus 30 percent and were reflected in the rate of electricity generated, 13, 896 kJ per <b>cow-day</b> from the modified versus 9, 380 kJ per <b>cow-day</b> from the conventional plug-flow digester design. In contrast, specific biogas and methane yields on a kg TVS destroyed basis were essentially the same for both digester designs as was the thermal efficiency of converting biogas to electricity. This comparison suggests that neither design is superior. The observed differences in TVS reduction, biogas yield, and electricity generated appear to be solely a reflection of the difference in the readily biodegradable fraction of influent TVS. This suggests that an estimate of the readily biodegradable fraction of influent TVS is a necessary prerequisite for a reliable prediction of anaerobic digester performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproducibility}} of {{pulmonary mechanics}} measurements in dairy cattle was examined using two study designs. In design A measurements {{were made with}} six cows on two days, and in design B measurements were made with four cows on six days. The mean coefficients of variation for within-day measurements for individuals ranged from 9. 2 to 25. 9 % indicating considerable within-day variability. In design A {{there were no significant}} differences between days (P less than 0. 05) for any measured variable for the group, but there were often significant differences between the two days for individuals. In design B there were significant <b>cow-day</b> interactions for all variables, again indicating significant differences between days for individuals. There were significant differences between days for the group for respiratory rate, and duration of inspiration and expiration. Both the interactions and differences between days appeared to be random. The high variability and limited reproducibility of pulmonary mechanics measurements, particularly in individual animals, indicate the need for caution in the interpretation of pulmonary mechanics measurements in dairy cattle...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 As {{the capital}} {{requirements}} for the modern dairy enterprise increase, the Oregon milk producer and his lender need more information concerning the profitability, solvency and liquidity of the enterprise {{on which to base}} their financial decisions. This research examines three areas where more information could be used to evaluate financial feasibility and credit use for Oregon dairy enterprises. The areas of investigation are (1) an analysis of factors important in determining the profitability of the enterprise, (2) an analysis of the alternatives for acquiring Oregon milk market quota and (3) an analysis of the risk that the dairy enterprise will not generate sufficient cash flows to meet various loan repayment requirements. For the first area of investigation the statistical technique of discriminant analysis was used to estimate a linear function using variables common to 63 sample dairy enterprises. The resulting discriminant function is the one that best separates the 63 observations into two groups, those with a net profit per cow greater than the mean average and those with a net profit per cow less than the mean. Fifty-seven of the 63 sample enterprises were correctly classified by the function. Standardizing the coefficients of the function revealed that production per cow, labor requirement (in minutes) per <b>cow-day</b> and the amount of concentrates per <b>cow-day</b> were the most important variables in correctly classifying the observations. The scaled discriminant function provides dairymen and their lenders with a method to assess the profit potential of an enterprise and to predict the effect of possible management changes on profit potential. Oregon milk market quota cannot only be bought and sold, subject to certain regulations, but can also be earned by producing and selling milk in excess of the produce rs quota allotment. Acquisition of additional quota increases the amount of milk sold at the higher quota blend price increasing the producer's revenue. Due to differences in the timing of cash flows, a present value analysis was used to determine which alternative for acquisition, purchase or earn, is most profitable for given sets of circumstances. The present value {{of the differences between the}} cash flows for the alternatives is the maximum amount a producer could profitably pay for some amount of quota rather than earning it. For the average difference between quota blend and surplus prices of 1. 71 per cwt. and an interest rate of 8...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{commercial}} dairy herds, {{each with}} low herd milk somatic cell counts, were monitored for 1 yr to determine prevalence of intramammary infections {{and rates of}} clinical mastitis. Staphylococcus species was the bacterial group most frequently isolated from quarters at calving and at drying off. Environmental streptococci and coliform intramammary infections totaled less than 6 % of quarters at both calving and at drying off. Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from less than 1 % of quarters and Streptococcus agalactiae from 0 % of quarters at both calving and drying off. A total of 646 clinical cases of mastitis were diagnosed in 548 quarters of 406 cows. Mean rate of clinical mastitis among herds was. 457 clinical cases/ 305 <b>cow-days.</b> Rates of clinical mastitis ranged among herds from. 273 to. 748 clinical cases/ 305 <b>cow-days.</b> Coliforms and bacteriologically negative and environmental streptococci accounted for 82. 3 % of clinical cases.

40|$|Antimicrobial use (AMU) {{data are}} {{critical}} for formulating policies for containing antimicrobial resistance. The present study determined AMU on Canadian dairy farms and characterized variation in AMU based on herd-level factors such as milk production, somatic cell count, herd size, geographic region and housing type. Drug use data were collected on 89 dairy herds in 4 regions of Canada, Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and the Maritime provinces (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia) {{for an average of}} 540 d per herd. Dairy producers and farm personnel were asked to deposit empty drug containers into specially provided receptacles. Antimicrobial use was measured as antimicrobial drug use rate (ADUR), with the unit being number of animal defined-daily doses (ADD) / 1, 000 <b>cow-days.</b> Antimicrobial drug use rates were determined at farm, region, and national level. Combined ADUR of all antimicrobial classes was 14. 35 ADD/ 1, 000 <b>cow-days</b> nationally. National level ADUR of the 6 most commonly used antimicrobial drug classes, cephalosporins, penicillins, penicillin combinations, tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations, and lincosamides were 3. 05, 2. 56, 2. 20, 1. 83, 0. 87, and 0. 84 ADD/ 1, 000 <b>cow-days,</b> respectively. Dairy herds in Ontario were higher users of third-generation cephalosporins (ceftiofur) than in Québec. Alberta dairy herds were higher users of tetracyclines in comparison to Maritimes. Antimicrobial drug use rate was higher via systemic route as compared with intramammary and other routes of administration (topical, oral, and intrauterine). The ADUR of antimicrobials used intramammarily was higher for clinical mastitis treatment than dry cow therapy. For dry cow therapy, penicillin ADUR was greater than ADUR of first-generation cephalosporins. For clinical mastitis treatment, ADUR of intramammary penicillin combinations was greater than ADUR of cephapirin. Herd-level milk production was positively associated with overall ADUR, ADUR of systemically administered ceftiofur, cephapirin administered for dry cow therapy, and pirlimycin administered for clinical mastitis treatment. Herd size and ADUR of systemically administered ceftiofur were also positively associated. In conclusion, β-lactams were most commonly used on Canadian dairy farms. Among antimicrobials of very high importance in human medicine, the use of fluoroquinolones was rare, whereas third-generation cephalosporins and penicillin combinations containing colistin were used very frequently on Canadian dairy farms...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the (compound-specific) antimicrobial consumption (AMC) in adult cattle in a convenience sample of Flemish dairy herds. Antimicrobial consumption data were obtained between 2012 and 2013 by "garbage can audits" and expressed as antimicrobial treatment incidence (ATI), with the unit of the ATI being the number of defined daily doses animal (DDDA) used per 1, 000 <b>cow-days.</b> Herds were stratified by DDDA into low-, medium-, and high-consuming herds to study the AMC per route of administration, and associations with parameters reflecting udder health, milk quality, and production performances were examined. The average ATI in adult dairy cattle for all compounds was 20. 78 DDDA (per 1, 000 <b>cow-days).</b> Large variation existed between herds (ranging from 8. 68 to 41. 62 DDDA). Fourth-generation cephalosporins were used most (4. 99 DDDA), followed by penicillins (3. 70 DDDA) and third-generation cephalosporins (2. 95 DDDA). The average ATI of the critically important antimicrobials for human health (i. e., third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones according to the World Organisation for Animal Health classification) was somewhat lower than the average ATI of the other antimicrobials (8. 59 and 12. 18 DDDA, respectively). The average ATI for intramammary treatment of (sub) clinical mastitis, for dry-cow therapy, and for systemically administered antimicrobials was 6. 30, 6. 89, and 7. 44 DDDA, respectively. In low-consuming herds, most antimicrobials were being used for dry-cow therapy, whereas in high consuming herds, most antimicrobials were being used as injectable or intramammary mastitis therapy. The incidence rate of treated mastitis was positively associated with ATI. Herds that applied blanket dry-cow therapy tended to have a higher ATI than herds in which cows were selectively dried off with long-acting antimicrobials. The ATI decreased with an increasing prevalence of primiparous cows...|$|R
40|$|Many cow-specific {{risk factors}} for {{clinical}} mastitis (CM) are known. Other studies have analyzed these risk factors separately or only analyzed {{a limited number of}} risk factors simultaneously. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of cow factors on the incidence rate of CM (IRCM) with all cow factors in one multivariate model. Also, using a similar approach, the probability of whether a CM case is caused by gram-positive or gram-negative pathogens was calculated. Data were used from 274 Dutch dairy herds that recorded CM over an 18 -mo period. The final dataset contained information on 28, 137 lactations of 22, 860 cows of different parities. In total 5, 363 CM cases were recorded, but only 2, 525 CM cases could be classified as gram-positive or gram-negative. The cow factors parity, lactation stage, season of the year, information on SCC from monthly test-day records, and CM history were included in the logistic regression analysis. Separate analyses were performed for heifers and multiparous cows in both the first month of lactation and from the second month of lactation onward. For investigating whether CM was caused by gram-positive or gram-negative pathogens, quarter position was included in the logistic regression analysis as well. The IRCM differed considerably among cows, ranging between 0. 0002 and 0. 0074 per <b>cow-day</b> at risk for specific cows depending on cow factors. In particular, previous CM cases, SCC in the previous month, and mean SCC in the previous lactation increased the IRCM in the current month of lactation. Results indicate that it is difficult to distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative CM cases based on cow factors alone...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} by stakeholders {{suggested that}} ecosystem changes may be driving an increased incidence of bovine erythrocytic anaplasmosis, {{resulting in a}} reemerging cattle disease in California. The objective of this prospective cohort study was to estimate the incidence of Anaplasma marginale infection using seroconversion in a northern California beef cattle herd. A total of 143 Black Angus cattle (106 prebreeding heifers and 37 cows) {{were enrolled in the}} study. Serum samples were collected to determine Anaplasma marginale seroprevalence using a commercially available competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kit. Repeat sampling was performed in seronegative animals to determine the incidence density rate from March through September (2013). Seroprevalence of heifers was significantly lower than that of cows {{at the beginning of the}} study (P< 0. 001) but not at study completion (P= 0. 075). Incidence density rate of Anaplasma marginale infection was 8. 17 (95 % confidence interval: 6. 04, 10. 81) cases per 1000 <b>cow-days</b> during the study period. Study cattle became Anaplasma marginale seropositive and likely carriers protected from severe clinical disease that might have occurred had they been first infected as mature adults.

40|$|The goal of dry-cow therapy (DCT) is {{to reduce}} the {{prevalence}} of intramammary infections (IMI) by eliminating existing IMI at drying off and preventing new IMI from occurring during the dry period. Due to public health concerns, however, preventive use of antimicrobials has become questionable. In this study, we evaluated the effects of 8 scenarios for selecting animals for DCT, taking into account variation in parity and cow-level somatic cell count (SCC) at drying off. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate udder health, antimicrobial usage, and economics at the herd level when using different scenarios for selecting cows for DCT. To enable calculation and comparison of the effects of different scenarios to select cows for DCT in an "average" herd, we created an example herd, with a virtual herd size of 100 dairy cows to be calving during a year. Udder health, antimicrobial usage, and economics were evaluated during the dry period and the first 100 d in lactation, the period during which the greatest effect of DCT is expected. This leads to an estimated 13, 551 <b>cow-days</b> at risk during a year in a 100 -cow dairy herd. In addition to a blanket DCT (BDCT) scenario, we developed 7 scenarios to select cows for DCT based on SCC. The scenarios covered a range of possible approaches to select low-SCC cows for DCT, all based on cow-level SCC thresholds on the last milk recording before drying off. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis in the example herd varied from 11. 6 to 14. 5 cases of clinical mastitis per 10, 000 <b>cow-days</b> at risk in the different scenarios, and the prevalence of subclinical mastitis varied from 38. 8 % in scenario 1 (BDCT) to 48. 3 % in scenario 8. Total antimicrobial usage for DCT and clinical mastitis treatment varied over the scenarios from 1. 27 (scenario 8) to 3. 15 animal daily dosages (BDCT), leading to a maximum reduction in antimicrobial usage of 60 % for scenario 8 compared with BDCT. The total costs for each of the scenarios showed little variation, varying from € 4, 893 for scenario 5 to € 5, 383 for scenario 8. The effect of selective DCT compared with BDCT on udder health, antimicrobial usage, and economics is influenced by the SCC criteria used to select cows for DCT. Scenario 2 resulted in the lowest increases in clinical and subclinical mastitis compared with BDCT. The greatest reduction in antimicrobial usage was achieved under scenario 8. From an economic perspective, lowest costs were achieved with scenario 5. Drying off dairy cows with antimicrobials has an effect on udder health, antimicrobial usage, and economics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Incidence of {{clinical}} mastitis was studied in 274 herds grouped in three categories by bulk milk somatic cell count (SCC). Mean incidence rate {{of clinical}} mastitis was 0. 278, 0. 257, and 0. 252 cases per 365 <b>cow-days</b> {{at risk in}} herds with low (< or = 150, 000), medium (150, 000 to 250, 000), and high (250, 000 to 400, 000 cells/ml) bulk milk SCC, respectively. The incidence rate of clinical mastitis was not different among the three categories. Variance {{in the incidence of}} clinical mastitis among herds increased as bulk milk SCC decreased. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., or Pseudomonas spp., occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk SCC. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk SCC. Systemic signs of illness caused by clinical mastitis occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk SCC. Both overall culling rate and culling rate for clinical mastitis were not different among groups catergorized by bulk milk SCC. In herds with a high bulk milk SCC, however, more cows that produced milk with a high SCC were culled. In herds with a low bulk milk SCC, more cows were culled for teat lesions, milkability, udder shape, fertility, and character than were cows in herds with a high bulk milk SCC. In herds with a low bulk milk SCC, cows were also culled more for export and production reasons. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 2985126 R; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R
40|$|Lameness is a {{major problem}} in modern dairy {{husbandry}} and has welfare implications and other negative consequences. The behavior of dairy cows is influenced by lameness. Automated lameness detection can, among other methods, be based on day-to-day variation in animal behavior. Activity sensors that measure lying time, number of lying bouts, and other parameters were used to record behavior per cow per day. The objective of this research was to develop and validate a lameness detection model based on daily activity data. Besides the activity data, milking data and data from the computerized concentrate feeders were available as input data. Locomotion scores were available as reference data. Data from up to 100 cows collected at an experimental farm during 23 mo in 2010 and 2011 were available for model development. Behavior is cow-dependent, and therefore quadratic trend models were fitted with a dynamic linear model on-line per cow for 7 activity variables and 2 other variables (milk yield per day and concentrate leftovers per day). It is assumed that lameness develops gradually; therefore, a lameness alert was given when the linear trend in 2 or more of the 9 models differed significantly from zero in a direction that corresponded with lameness symptoms. The developed model was validated during the first 4 mo of 2012 with almost 100 cows on the same farm by generating lameness alerts each week. Performance on the model validation data set was comparable with performance on the model development data set. The overall sensitivity (percentage of detected lameness cases) was 85. 5 % combined with specificity (percentage of nonlame <b>cow-days</b> that were not alerted) of 88. 8 %. All variables contributed to this performance. These results indicate that automated lameness detection based on day-to-day variation in behavior is a useful tool for dairy managemen...|$|R
40|$|An {{intensive}} {{rotational grazing}} system for dwarf and late heading (DL) elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schumach) pasture was examined {{in a summer}} period for two years following establishment. Four 0. 05 of DL elephant grass pastures (20 × 25 m) were established on May 2003. They were rotationally grazed for 1 week, followed by a 3 -week rest period by three breeding or raising beef cattle for three and six cycles during {{the first and second}} years of establishment respectively. Before grazing, the plant height, leaf area index and the ratio of leaf blade to stem were at the highest, while tiller number increased and herbage mass tended to increase, except for the first grazing cycle both two years and for one paddock in the second year. Herbage consumption, the rate of herbage consumption and dry matter intake tended to decrease in three paddocks from the first to the third cycle in the first year, but increase as grazing occurred in the second year. Dry matter intake averaged 10. 2 - 14. 5 and 15. 4 – 23. 2 g DM/kg/live weight (LW) /day over the four paddocks in the first and second year, respectively, and average daily gains were 0. 09 and 0. 35 kg/head/day in the first and second year respectively.

To assess the effects of stocking rate and pasture characteristics on the risk of nonpoint source pollution of pasture streams, forage sward height, bare and manure-covered soil, forage species, and erosion were measured {{along the banks of}} streams in 13 pastures on 12 cow-calf operations in southern Iowa. Mean sward heights, and bare and manure-covered soil were different (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) between the 13 pastures. There were also month differences for mean sward height and manure-covered ground (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001), but not for bare soil (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). The proportions of vegetation species as tall fescue, reed canarygrass, clover, or sedge were different (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) between pastures. Proportions of tall fescue, reed canarygrass, Kentucky bluegrass, bromegrass, orchardgrass, and sedge in the vegetation species were different (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) between months. Pastures with the least proportion of tall fescue and greatest proportion of reed canarygrass had the least amount of bare soil within the streamside zones of pastures. Stepwise multiple regressions were calculated to predict using vegetative species, and sampling interval and annual stocking rates of cattle on the 13 pastures. Sward height decreased as tall fescue, bluegrass, legumes, and annual stocking of <b>cow-days</b> per acre increased (r 2 = 0. 56). The proportion of soil that was bare increased as the proportion of legumes increased and decreased as the proportion of reed canarygrass increased (r 2 = 0. 35). Manure-covered ground increased as the stocking rate per acre per sampling interval and the proportions of tall fescue and bluegrass in the vegetation increased, and decreased as broadleaf weeds and sedge increased (r 2 = 0. 47). Increased stocking rates will result in decreases in forage sward height and increases in manure cover in streamside zones. The presence of tall fescue may also increase cattle activity near streams reducing sward height and increasing manure-covered soil in the streamside zone.

40|$|Saskatchewan {{producers}} traditionally overwinter {{their cattle}} in pens in the yard. The practice of winter feeding of cattle {{directly in the}} field is increasing in popularity leading to concerns about increased nutrients being deposited in soil and potentially lost in runoff water and to ground water. In 2008 / 2009 an experiment was conducted to observe the effect of in-field winter feeding of cows on the nutrients in spring snowmelt run-off. Approximately 100 cattle were baled grazed on a Russian wild ryegrass pasture at a stocking rate of 2240 <b>cow-days</b> ha- 1 for 88 d during the winter at the Western Beef Development Center at Lanigan, SK. The spring 2009 ponded water was sampled from four basins in the control (no cattle were present) and four basins in the winter feeding treatment from the end of March to mid-April. Ground water samples from two piezometers in the control and two in the winter feeding area were gathered from the start of runoff until the middle of summer. Soil samples (0 - 10 cm) were collected in the fall 2008 before winter feeding and again in the spring 2009 after winter feeding on both the control and treated areas to examine the influence of winter feeding on soil nutrients. Orthophosphate-P and ammonium-N concentrations were elevated to levels up to 19. 9 mg PO 4 -P L- 1 and 102. 3 mg NH 4 -N L- 1 respectively in run-off from the winter feed treatment basins compared to the controls (2. 1 mg PO 4 -P L- 1 and 1. 72 mg NH 4 -N L- 1). Nitrate-N concentrations in snowmelt run-off water were similar from the winter-fed areas (0. 008 mg NO 3 -N L- 1 to 0. 739 mg NO 3 -N L- 1) and the control (0. 001 mg NO 3 -N L- 1 to 1. 046 mg NO 3 -N L- 1). This is explained by lack of sufficient time and temperature for organic N, urea and ammonium in the urine and fecal matter to convert to nitrate. In the ground water there was a slight increase in nutrient ion concentration in the winter feed basins compared to the control. Soil sampled in the spring from the winter feeding site had higher soluble nitrate, ammonium and phosphorus compared to the control. The soluble and exchangeable forms of phosphorus in the soil were lower compared to the fall soil samples for the control and winter feeding site, possibly due to immobilization by plant and microbial uptake in the spring. Caution should be used when selecting sites for in-field winter feeding system so the run-off water does not reach sensitive water bodies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} an aggregation of knowledge on bovine mastitis in the New Zealand dairy industry. Firstly, the thesis reviews the factors influencing {{the economic impact}} of bovine mastitis. Secondly, it provides information on the incidence of clinical and subclinical mastitis, as a prerequisite for estimating these costs. Thirdly, it investigates the effects of experimentally-induced Streptococcus uberis mastitis early in the dry period on milk production in the subsequent lactation. In the review of factors influencing the cost of bovine mastitis, it was clear that neither farmers nor farm advisors have a good understanding of its full economic impact. In order to better understand these costs, it is necessary to have a clear idea of the incidence and consequences of clinical and subclinical mastitis: areas of knowledge which were identified as being deficient. Hence, two studies were conducted to investigate these areas. In the first study, the incidence of clinical mastitis in Northland, New Zealand, was estimated. Furthermore, the aetiological agents causing mastitis were elicited and their chronological distributions in lactation were described. The average incidence of clinical mastitis was 0. 19 cases per 305 <b>cow-days</b> at-risk, which is higher than previously reported in New Zealand. There were approximately equal numbers of isolations of Staphylococcus aureus (23. 7 %), and Strep, uberis (23. 3 %) from clinical cases: a pattern that is remarkably different to elsewhere in the country. Clinical mastitis due to S. aureus or Strep, uberis differed between age groups, with the highest incidence of S. aureus isolations from older cows (0. 043 cases per 305 cow-days-at-risk) and lowest from 2 -year old cows (0. 014). The incidence of Strep. uberis was similar in first calving (0. 034 cases per 305 cow-days-at-risk) and older cows (5 year-old: 0. 039 cases, 6 year-old: 0. 030 cases). Overall, 12 % of cows were temporarily removed from supply and 1 % were culled for mastitis. The differences between the study in Northland and these reported elsewhere from NZ highlight the need for a national survey on the aetiology and epidemiology of bovine mastitis. A second study evaluated the effects of Strep. uberis clinical mastitis in the early dry period on milk production in the subsequent lactation. In a previous study, Strep. uberis mastitis was experimentally induced and then promptly treated. This experiment provided a data set from which the impact of Strep. uberis clinical mastitis early in the dry period on milk production in the subsequent lactation could be estimated. Results of this study indicated that an early dry period clinical mastitis due to Strep. uberis, when promptly treated, did not affect production in the subsequent lactation. For cows that suffered mastitis episode during early dry period compared to those that did not, {{there was no difference in}} milk yield (5126 vs. 5010 litres), fat yield (267 vs. 264 kg), and protein yield (182 vs. 179 kg), respectively. It was considered that the short duration of intramammary infection did not cause permanent damage to the mammary secretory tissue. It was concluded that the current estimates of the economics of mastitis in New Zealand are probably under-estimating the real cost of mastitis to its dairy industry. This was based on the higher incidence of clinical mastitis in Northland than elsewhere in the country and a failure of previous studies to take into consideration the costs associated with animals that were temporarily removed from supply (i. e. rather than culled). Additionally, as the highest frequency of new intramammary infections occurs in the first week or two after drying off, it may prove beneficial for farmers to pay more attention to checking for clinical mastitis during the early dry period...|$|R
40|$|Overwintering of cows {{is a major}} cost in a cow-calf {{production}} system on the prairies. Winter feeding hay and straw directly on pasture is a potentially more efficient and economical system compared to conventional drylot feeding in a yard. The objectives of the research described in this thesis were to compare winter feeding cattle directly on pasture to traditional drylot over-wintering of cattle and the associated mechanized spreading of manure on pasture. This trial compared the effects of winter feeding systems on pasture nutrient distribution, nutrient recovery in soil and forage, pasture forage response, cattle performance, and economics. The experiment was conducted at Lanigan, SK, on an old russian wildrye grass pasture. Pasture nutrient levels and distribution were measured before and after winter feeding, as well as forage yield, and cattle weight and condition. Nutrient capture and cycling was assessed along with {{the economics of the}} different systems. In the pasture fed systems, cattle were fed by either bale processing or bale grazing methods over the winter of 2003 - 2004. Cattle concentration was 2080 <b>cow-days</b> ha- 1, with the cattle in the field for 130 d. In the intensive system used for comparison, cattle were fed in a drylot and 67 tonnes ha- 1 of raw manure or 22 tonnes ha- 1 of compost was mechanically spread on the pasture in the fall of 2003. Soil inorganic nitrogen (N) levels (0 - 15 cm) measured in the spring where the cattle were winter fed on pasture were 3 to 4 times the unfertilized, unmanured control treatment, with a mean gain of 117 kg N ha- 1. Soil inorganic N was not significantly elevated where manure or compost had been spread by machine. Soil extractable potassium (K) was doubled on the winter feeding sites, with a mean gain of 1209 kg K ha- 1. Soil extractable K did not increase where manure or compost had been spread mechanically. Soil distribution patterns of both nutrients were highly uneven following pasture feeding, with levels of inorganic soil N ranging from 12 to 626 kg ha- 1 and extractable soil K ranging from 718 to 6326 kg ha- 1. Additional nutrients in surface residue from uneaten feed, bedding, and manure were also heavy and variable following pasture feeding. Greater retention of N and K from urine added directly to the soil in the field in the bale grazing and bale processing systems compared to the drylot system is believed to be responsible for high soil available N and K levels compared to manure hauled from the drylot into the field. Soil extractable phosphorus (P) levels (0 - 15 cm) were measured in the fall of 2005. The compost treatment had the largest increase at 2. 6 times the control, an additional 46 kg ha- 1. Mean soil P levels did not increase significantly where the cattle were wintered. Over 18 months and 3 harvests, forage dry matter yields where the cattle were fed on pasture were 3 to 5 times the control where the cattle were fed on the pasture, and 1. 4 to 1. 7 times the control where raw manure or compost was mechanically spread. Also, protein content of the forage was increased to a greater extent in the in-field feeding compared to hauled raw manure or compost, reflecting a greater conservation of N. The gain of N in the forage over 18 months on the winter feeding sites was 200 kg ha- 1 of N, almost double what was measured in soil inorganic forms. Fourteen kg ha- 1 of P was also recovered. This represented 34 % of original feed N and 22 % of original feed P that was imported into the field. Recovery of nutrients applied in the raw manure and compost sites was much lower, with only 7 % recovery of N and 4 % recovery of P in the forage. This was calculated to be 1 % of original feed N and 3 % of original feed P. The system by which the cattle were overwintered had little influence on cattle weight and condition. All systems performed favorably in maintaining body weight and condition over the winter. Some slight advantages in cattle weight gain and condition were found on the winter feeding systems compared to the in-yard drylot that appeared to be related to slightly increased feed intake. Economic calculations favored winter feeding directly on the pasture by 25 % over the drylot systems when the feed value of additional pasture growth over 18 months was included and by 56 % when the value of additional soil nutrients was factored in. Feed costs were similar between the systems but pasture feeding had savings in machinery use, fuel consumption and manure handling costs, and gains in pasture productivity. Systems that winter fed cattle directly on pasture provided gains in nutrient cycling efficiencies, pasture growth, and economic savings compared to drylot feeding systems, while maintaining similar cattle growth and condition...|$|R
