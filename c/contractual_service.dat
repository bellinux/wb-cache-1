5000|$|The UNC Food Workers Strike was a labor {{strike at}} the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill that began on February 23 and lasted until December 9, 1969. Through the {{leadership}} of Mary Smith and Elizabeth Brooks and {{with the support of}} student groups and civil rights activists, the strike was organized around a list of demands to improve the working conditions of black food workers. The protesting employees of Lenoir Hall presented this list to University Chancellor J. Carlyle Sitterson, who responded by asserting his commitment [...] "to being responsive to the educational needs of [...] [...] [...] all races, colors, and creeds" [...] but also his inability to treat any group with preference and to make significant changes on their behalf. [...] He directed a police response to campus disruptions with North Carolina Governor Robert W. Scott, further instigating the protesters and drawing widespread attention to the issue. The subsequent formation of the UNC Non-Academic Employees Union prompted Governor Scott to negotiate with and ultimately accept the terms of the protesters on March 21, 1969. UNC facility employees experienced an increase in wage and working conditions, and this lasted until food management transferred from internal to <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> provided by SAGA Food Service less than a month later. The change in employers sparked workers, many of whom participated in the first strike, to voice their discontent once again. Employees and students responded immediately, with the strike resuming, among other forms of protest, until its conclusion on December 9, 1969, when black supporters threatened to descend on the campus to elevate the issue if union negotiations did not begin.|$|E

The second scenario assumes all changes made in the first scenario as well as additional sector-specific liberalizations.

Further, in telecommunications, courier services, and commercial banking, the government’s control over one major firm in the sector is suspended.

40|$|Background: In 2012, a pilot {{health policy}} of <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> {{relations}} between general practitioners and patients was implemented in China. Due {{to the decline}} in body and cognitive function, {{as well as the}} lack of family care and narrow social support networks, the demand of health services among the elderly is much higher than that among the general population. This study aims to probe into the empty nesters’ willingness-to-pay for general practitioners using a <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> policy, investigating empty nesters’ payment levels for the service, and analyze the main factors affecting the willingness of empty-nesters’ general practitioners using <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> supply cost. Methods: This cross-sectional study adopted a multistage stratified sampling method to survey 865, city empty nesters (six communities in three districts of one city) aged 60 – 85 years. A condition value method was used to infer the distribution of the willingness-to-pay; Cox’s proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze the influencing factors of willingness-to-pay. Results: More than seventy percent (76. 6 %) of the empty nesters in this city were willing to pay general practitioners using contract service in Chongqing. The level of willingness-to-pay for the surveyed empty nesters was 34. 1 yuan per year. The median value was 22. 1 yuan per year, which was below the Chongqing urban and rural cooperative medical insurance individual funding level (60 yuan per year) in 2013. Cox’s proportional hazards regression model analysis showed that the higher the education level was, the worse the self-reported health status would be, accompanied by higher family per capita income, higher satisfaction of community health service, and higher willingness-to-pay empty nesters using a contract service. Women had a higher willingness-to-pay than men. Conclusions: The willingness-to-pay for general practitioners by <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> is high among city empty nesters in Chongqing, thus, individual financing is feasible. However, people are willing to pay {{less than half of the}} current personal financing of cooperative medical insurance of urban and rural residents. Education level, family per capita income, and self-reported health status are the main factors affecting the cost sharing intention for general practitioners using contract service supply. According to the existing situation of different empty nesters, it is important to perfect the design of general practitioners using a <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> policy system, according to differentiated personal financing levels...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{in-depth}} interviews with 24 working couples who hire domestic helpers in Hong Kong, {{this article examines}} the hiring of help as an instance of unequal social exchange in which mothers are expected to give up more than fathers. Men view hiring help as a <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> and as a 'gift' to their wives that allows them to 'buy out' of housework and childcare. Women, however, are likely to supplement their helper's contributions with their own labour since they view hired help as 'less-than-optimal' childcare. They also feel responsible for the supervision and emotional needs of their helpers by treating them as 'part of the family'. By examining the gendered meanings attached to paid domestic help, we show how men and women reproduce the traditional division of labour in the home when hiring domestic helpers, rather than relieving the tensions that working mothers face between paid employment and childcare. © BSA Publications Ltd. 2012...|$|E

The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to develop concepts and algorithms for goal-directed service selection; and (2) to compare and reconcile our goal-directed approach with a service-oriented approach. The proposed goal-directed service selection algorithm is based on a goal-directed domain description that represents the customer objectives and the business processes. We use service component architectures with formalised <b>contractual</b> <b>service</b> process definitions as a software engineering approach to architectural design and realisation of service-oriented architectures (SOA).

Proper selection and timing of such operations is critical to their effectiveness, however scheduling decisions must often be made with strict time and resource limitations imposed upon them.
