40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between the stock market and growth has attracted many researchers, the number of studies that have been carried out into the links between debt and growth is very limited. This article examines {{the relationship}} between debt markets and economic growth. Three categories of debts are considered in this analysis, using data from China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand for the years 2002 - 2009. The results show that public and private debts have contributed significantly to the growth of the region. The significant contribution of debt markets to GDP, however, is not common for all the countries in the sample and varies according to the <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> issued. Both public and foreign currency debts have contributed in a significantly positive way to South Korea’s GDP, but only public debt contributes in a significantly positive way to the growth of China and Hong Kong.

The second view is by Bulow and Rogoff (1990) who argue that the external debts are a symptom of poor economic management and performance rather than a primary cause of stifled economic growth.

40|$|This study {{documents}} that {{the stability of}} institutional ownership {{plays an important role}} in determining the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> After controlling for other determinants of the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> and correcting for the endogeneity of institutional ownership stability, three major results are uncovered. First, there is a robust negative relationship between the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and institutional ownership stability. Second, institutional ownership stability plays a bigger role in determining the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> than the institutional ownership level commonly used in the literature. Third, institutional ownership stability affects the cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> to a greater extent for firms that are subject to more severe information asymmetry and greater agency costs <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> Institutional ownership stability Corporate governance Agency problems Cost <b>of</b> <b>debt...</b>|$|R
40|$|At low and {{moderate}} levels <b>of</b> government <b>debt,</b> {{there appears to}} be little relation between the level <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and its maturity. But at high levels <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> a strong inverse relation emerges. We start the paper by documenting this inverse relation for those OECD Countries which have reached very high levels <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> We then provide a theory of the joint movements <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and maturity which can explain both sets of facts. It is based on the idea that, at high levels <b>of</b> <b>debt,</b> the government may need to decrease the maturity <b>of</b> the <b>debt</b> as debt increases, {{in order to maintain the}} credibility of its anti-inflation stance. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} firm-specific {{marginal cost}} <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> functions {{for a large}} panel of companies between 1980 and 2007. The marginal cost curves are identified by exogenous variation in the marginal tax benefits <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> The location <b>of</b> a given company’s cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> function varies with characteristics such as asset collateral, size, book-to-market, asset tangibility, cash flows, and whether the firm pays dividends. By integrating the area between benefit and cost functions we estimate that the equilibrium net benefit <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> is 3. 5 % of asset value, resulting from an estimated gross benefit <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> 10. 4 % of asset value and an estimated cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> <b>of</b> 6. 9 %. We find {{that the cost of}} being overlevered is asymmetrically higher than the cost of being underlevered and that expected default costs constitute approximately half of the total ex ante cost <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> ...|$|R
