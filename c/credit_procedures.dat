The study is an empirical investigation of perceptions and attitudes respectively of the two parties and consequently the co-existence expected of them – the commercial banks, as an important source of business funding and the small and micro-enterprise owners (SMEOs), as valued customers. Findings of the study point to the fact that SMEOs, especially the unregistered ones have a very blinkered understanding of the banks’ financial <b>credit</b> <b>procedures.</b> The consequence of which, is the perceived rigid prudential measures by banks, weak locus of loan/overdraft applications and bargaining power in terms of credit quantum, interest rates and their resultant payment defaults.

In addition, their loan-repayment patterns and interest rates were found to be rigid and indiscriminate respectively and as a result, had made them unattractive to the SMEOs.

40|$|The paper's {{intention}} is to present the functionality of the scoring and rating models approved by the New Capital Agreement and the Capital Requirements Directive {{in the context of}} credit risk management. The know-how transfers initiated the process of superseding the traditional credit risk assessment methods by new methods. The scoring and rating models are being successfully used by foreign banking institutions. A synthesis of views on credit risk assessment methods (credit scoring and credit rating) also results from many advantages that occur as well {{on the side of the}} banking institutions as on the side of their clients. The credit scoring and credit rating models automatize the banking <b>credit</b> <b>procedures</b> by providing an objective assessment of all the credit applications. In addition, standardized scoring and rating models reduce the costs related to the credit applications analysis. The existing interest in modem methods of credit risk quantification in the period of implementing the NCA/CRD inspired the author to formulate the thesis that the scoring and rating models would continue to enjoy interest on the part of the domestic banking institutions (i. e. co-operative banks). The complicated procedures of determining the capital adequacy prescribed by the CRD will make a stimulus to implementation of the models in question by the financial institutions that have hitherto been using traditional creditworthiness assessment methods, because the new methods simplify and accelerate the analysis of credit applications and have been included in the framework of admitted credit risk quantification methods for internal ratings. The universal functionality of scoring and rating makes the models more and more popular and demanded. In the long run, automation of processes and an elastic offer adapted to the client's profile will decide on the financial institution's competitive position. Wherever there is need for automatism and maximum objectiveness, the scoring- and rating-based assessment win most probably find new advocates. ...|$|E

40|$|Making {{a profit}} from credit Cue: A private credit {{offering}} institution, like the Malawi Rural Finance Company, will soon {{go out of}} business if borrowers fail to keep up their repayments. Such companies need effective ways of maximising repayments, while also deciding how they will respond to natural disasters such as drought, which can greatly effect people?s ability to pay off their loans. Many institutions have realised that lending to groups rather than individuals can improve rates of repayment. The Malawi Rural Finance Company has also taken this approach, and supports the groups who borrow from it with a variety of training packages. Excello Zidana spoke to Charles Nangwale, Credit Officer of the Northern Region Branch, and asked him what mechanisms the company was using both to support the farmers who borrow from it, and to keep itself in business. IN:		?We know people are different? OUT:		?to improve their life standard. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 56 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Charles Nangwale explaining how the Malawi Rural Finance Company balances its goals, both supporting farmers and staying in business. Transcript Nangwale	We know people are different, we are born with different characters and we want these {{people to be able to}} work together. So the first thing is, we train them on group dynamics. And after that we train them on the particular farming activity or business they want to carry out. Then we teach them our <b>credit</b> <b>procedures</b> so that they understand how we want them to run the businesses, how we want them to repay our loans. Zidana	In any society there might be some people who are definitely not honest. If they fail to honour their loans what do you do? Nangwale	We are working to assist the people but at a profit. So we have tried to be a bit clever. During the training we teach those people to draw a constitution which is supposed to govern, you know, their group. So in that constitution they are supposed to outline what are they going to do should somebody fail to repay their loan or should somebody maybe passes away, what is going to happen? The first thing is those people themselves are going to take an action against whoever has failed to repay the loan. But then if the group has failed to do that, then we come in and that?s why, you know, we have things like loan agreements so that we know we can act on these people without any legal problems. Zidana		Now during the times of natural disasters like drought what do you do? Nangwale	Drought is unpredictable and you cannot prevent drought. We know this is a problem, it is not the customer?s making, it?s something that has just happened to him. So we give those people an opportunity to reschedule their loan so that they can repay it maybe in the next two years, should there be no drought that is again. Zidana	I understand that most lending institutions before they give out loans, they think of sureties. What does your company do in this regard? Nangwale	Yes we also require these people to give us what we call collateral. Of course we don?t require collateral for all the loans because Rural Finance has targeted everybody so we know there are people out there in the villages who cannot raise collateral. So for those people we give them loans which don?t require collateral. But for those people who want loans that require collateral, we require two types of collateral, cash collateral and material collateral. In cash collateral we require our customers to pay 20 % cash deposit of the loan they are looking for. And material collateral is supposed to be 150 % of the loan they are looking for. Zidana	But as you said that your main focus is on the poor of the poorest farmers. So when we go around you see people in the villages, they are still very poor and some even complain that your company tends to take other items as part of the whole strategy of loan recovery. Is this act aimed at helping farmers? Nangwale	Yes if you remember what I said, I said Rural Finance is a company which is there to assist the farmers and the general public as a whole. But then we are supposed to do that at a profit, because if we don?t make profit then we won?t survive. When somebody has failed to pay us back there must be a way of getting back our money you see because we are in business. Much as we want to assist the farmers they shouldn?t just take that as a grant, they should actually work to pay off the loan and to improve their life standard. End of tape.

Results of research indicate that PT. Bank Jatim, Malang Branch, has conducted favorable internal control system. It becomes evident with its organization structure and credit delivery authority in which it provides functional separation in which the functions need authorization from functional manager with the authority to do the activity. A function cannot be given full responsibility to do all stages in a transaction. The credit delivery authority involves the separation of responsibility and the existence of job authority in the organization function of credit division such that the authority abuse doesn’t emerge during the pundi kencana <b>credit</b> delivery <b>procedure</b> started from initial proposition to credit realization. This remains important because every implementation of task includes other division to check and to supervise every implementation of credit activity. The next analysis will be using the analysis of healthy practice and the analysis of the capable employee in which this becomes evident with the existence of serially numbered and printed form documents with the authorization from the related officials. The authorization takes form in signature. In addition, the examination has been conducted four times a year with job rotation for once of three years. The analysis of capable employee considers whether PT. Bank Jatim employs education qualification in selecting employee candidate for certain post.

We show that credit ratings provide a "focal point" for firms and their investors, and explore the vital, but previously overlooked implicit contractual relationship between a credit rating agency (CRA) and a firm through its <b>credit</b> watch <b>procedures.</b> <b>Credit</b> ratings can help fix the desired equilibrium and as such play an economically meaningful role. Our model provides several empirical predictions and insights regarding the expected price impact of rating changes. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

International trade has received some academic attention as an application of Business Process Reengineering. A major issue in international trade is due to problems pertaining to mutual-trust between trading parties without a prior trading relationship.
