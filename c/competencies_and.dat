40|$|The {{mastery of}} {{fundamental}} movement skills (FMS) has been purported {{as contributing to}} children 2 ̆ 7 s physical, cognitive and social development and is thought to provide the foundation for an active lifestyle. Commonly developed in childhood and subsequently refined into context- and sport-specific skills, they include locomotor (e. g. running and hopping), manipulative or object control (e. g. catching and throwing) and stability (e. g. balancing and twisting) skills. The rationale for promoting the development of FMS in childhood relies {{on the existence of}} evidence on the current or future benefits associated with the acquisition of FMS proficiency. The objective of this systematic review was {{to examine the relationship between}} FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> potential health benefits in children and adolescents. Benefits were defined in terms of psychological, physiological and behavioural outcomes that can impact public health. A systematic search of six electronic databases (EMBASE, OVID MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and SportDiscus) was conducted on 22 June 2009. Included studies were cross-sectional, longitudinal or experimental studies involving healthy children or adolescents (aged 3 – 18 years) that quantitatively analysed the relationship between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> potential benefits. The search identified 21 articles examining the relationship between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> eight potential benefits (i. e. global self-concept, perceived physical competence, cardio-respiratory fitness [CRF], muscular fitness, weight status, flexibility, physical activity and reduced sedentary behaviour). We found strong evidence for a positive association between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> physical activity in children and adolescents. There was also a positive relationship between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> CRF and an inverse association between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> weight status. Due to an inadequate number of studies, the relationship between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> the remaining benefits was classified as uncertain. More longitudinal and intervention research examining the relationship between FMS <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> potential psychological, physiological and behavioural outcomes in children and adolescents is recommended...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of students’ {{participation}} in the certificate program offered by the Asian Studies Center (ASC) at the University of Pittsburgh on their perception of global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> skills development for international careers. Undergraduate and graduate students who {{were enrolled in the}} ASC’s certificate program as of March 16, 2012 (n= 125) participated in an on-line student survey. Data are used to provide a descriptive analysis, significance tests, and a multiple regression analysis that examine six research questions. The descriptive analysis explores students’ characteristics, satisfaction with the certificate program, international experience, foreign language capability, {{and the extent to which}} the certificate program increases their global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> skills for international careers. Tests were conducted to examine whether the differences in pre-post increases in students’ perception of their global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> skills development for international careers were statistically significant for all respondents as well as between disaggregated groups. The multiple regression analysis tests the correlation between three independent variables (courses taken in the certificate program, center activity participation, and students’ international experience) and each of the two dependent variables (students’ perception of increased global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> students’ perception of improved skills for international careers). Findings show that significantly different changes in students’ perception of their global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> skills development for international careers exist before their participation in the certificate program and after their participation in the certificate program. Students who stayed 1 - 6 months in an Asian country have the most significant increases in their perception of their global competency after their participation in the certificate program. Senior students have the most significant increases in their perception of their global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> skills for international careers after their participation in the certificate program. Students’ international experience and courses taken in the certificate program are important variables related to their perception of increased global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> improved skill for international careers. The effect of students’ international experience is greater than courses taken in the certificate program on their perception of their increased global <b>competency</b> <b>and</b> improved skills for international careers. ...|$|R

But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. Tony Buon and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating [...] interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions [...] and [...] emotional <b>competencies</b> <b>and</b> cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal [...] interactions.|$|E
