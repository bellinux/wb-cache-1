25|$|As of 2013, MasterCard {{is under}} {{investigation}} by the European Union for the high fees it charges tourists who use their cards in Europe, and other anti-competitive practices that could hinder electronic commerce and international trade, and high fees associated with premium credit cards. The EU's competition regulator said that these fees were of special concern because of the growing role of non-cash payments. MasterCard charges non-European tourists much more than customers using cards issued in Europe. MasterCard could be fined up to 10 percent of its 2012 revenue or around $740 million. MasterCard was banned from charging fees on <b>cross-border</b> <b>transactions</b> conducted wholly within the EU via a ruling by the European Commission in 2007. The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{transfer}} pricing {{has become one}} of the most important issues for tax authorities and companies. As the area has become more complex this has lead to an increase in disputes and a need for dispute resolution procedure. Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) is the latest dispute resolution procedure and was introduced in Sweden in 2010. APAs determine a taxpayer’s future taxation of <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> by a taxpayer. Through co-operation the taxpayer and the tax authorities reach an APA that aims to avoid double taxation. The legislation is based on the guidance from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and it serves as a framework for many domestic legislations. Other countries with more experience from APAs have implemented additional guidance from the OECD in its legislation but the Swedish legislation has left some options outside. The Swedish APA does not allow for unilateral APAs where an agreement is concluded only with one tax authority in a <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction.</b> In Sweden, only APAs negotiated with other tax authority are allowed. To increase legal certainty where unilateral APAs are the best or only way Sweden should implement them it its legislation. As the APA process is costly and complex small and medium companies cannot benefit from the advantages. In order for smaller companies to be able to take advantage of the APA program a simplified system should be implemented. In some countries the tax administrations also allows the APA to be applicable retrospective, referred to as roll-back. Through a roll-back taxpayers can avoid potential disputes regarding past transactions as well as the advantages from the APA for future transactions. This can be done while a taxpayer is under audit and is considered a less hostile alternative...|$|R

40|$|Voluntary {{markets for}} "green" power, and {{mandatory}} policies such as fuel source disclosure requirements and renewables portfolio standards, each {{rely on the}} ability to differentiate electricity by the "attributes" of the generation. Throughout North America, electricity markets are devising accounting and verification systems for generation "attributes": those characteristics of a power plant's production such as fuel source and emissions that differentiate it from undifferentiated (or "commodity") electricity. These accounting and verification systems are intended to verify compliance with market mandates, create accurate disclosure labels, substantiate green power claims, and support emissions markets. Simultaneously, interest is growing in transacting (importing or exporting) generation attributes across electricity market borders, with or without associated electricity. <b>Cross-border</b> renewable attribute <b>transactions</b> have advantages and disadvantages. Broad access to markets may encourage more renewable generation at lower cost, but this result may conflict with desires to assure that at least some renewable resources are built locally to achieve either local policy goals or purchaser objectives. This report is intended to serve as a resource document for those interested in and struggling with <b>cross-border</b> renewable attribute <b>transactions.</b> The report assesses the circumstances under which renewable generation attributes from a "source" region might be recognized in a "sink" region. The report identifies several distinct approaches that might be used to account for and verify attribute import and export transactions, and assesses the suitability of these alternative approaches. Because policymakers have often made systems "compatibility" between market areas a pre-requisite to allowing <b>cross-border</b> renewable <b>transactions,</b> this report develops criteria for "compatible information systems. " Where fully compatible information systems do not exist, certain <b>cross-border</b> attribute <b>transactions</b> may still be deemed suitably credible and verifiable to be recognized; this report also identifies possible criteria for such "compatible transactions. " The importance of credibly addressing imports and exports of renewable energy attributes should be evident. A lack of clarity as to what generation can and cannot be recognized in various markets can paralyze investment in and contracting for renewable generation. The development of rules for imports and exports will also minimize the potential for "double counting" of renewable energy attributes, will help define where and at what cost renewable plants will be built, and will directly impact the location of thebenefits that renewable generation provides. This report ultimately concludes that the "correct" approach to treating renewable energy imports and exports depends on the context and motivations behind the transaction or the mandate, and that the presence of practical constraints or multiple objectives often make selecting the best approach difficult. That said, the report urges those creating market rules to move quickly in defining valid <b>cross-border</b> <b>transaction</b> structures and to consider the implications of their decisions on the creation of viable markets for new renewable generation...|$|R
