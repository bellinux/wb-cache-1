5|$|In 1804, Coimbatore was {{established}} {{as the capital}} of the newly formed Coimbatore district and in 1866 it was accorded municipality status with Robert Stanes as its Chairman. The city experienced a textile boom in the early 19th century due to the decline of the cotton industry in Mumbai. Post independence, Coimbatore has seen rapid growth due to industrialisation. Coimbatore was ranked the best emerging city in India by India Today in the 2014 annual Indian <b>city</b> <b>survey.</b> The city was ranked fourth among Indian cities in investment climate by Confederation of Indian Industry and 17th among the top global outsourcing cities by Tholons.

2500|$|Infrastructure {{work now}} began in Marshall Heights. A <b>city</b> <b>survey</b> in 1949 found that just 30 {{percent of all}} homes in Marshall Heights had access to running water and the city sewer system. City {{engineers}} estimated in May 1950 {{that it would take}} $2 million to give the 500 homes in Marshall Heights water and sewer lines, and to grade and pave every street. But with an annual infrastructure budget of just $1 million a year for the entire city, they said improvements in Marshall Heights would take time. Nevertheless, the District agreed to spend $320,000 on water and sewer mains, and paving secondary streets, in 1950 alone. Paving of main streets, and adding sidewalks, curbs, and gutters was not planned, as this was not deemed urgent. By November, 30 homes on five blocks between E. 50th and E. 51st Streets had received water and sewer mains. Another $100,000 was spent on Marshall Heights infrastructure in 1952. By the end of 1952, 134 homes in Marshall Heights had water and sewer. But only 72 homeowners had actually hooked up to the system. City officials said the cost of a hookup, which ran from $1,000 to $1,500, and the $135 frontage fee were simply too high for most residents to afford. The city had the option of going to court to force residents to hookup and pay the frontage fee, but officials said this was useless because residents simply didn't have the income. Spending large amounts of money on Marshall Heights deeply angered some city officials. William H. Cary, Jr., director of the D.C. Bureau of Public Health Engineering, claimed, [...] "This will never be a place the District government will be proud of." [...] But work continued, and additional street grading and water and sewer lines were laid in 1957. [...] To counteract criticism that Marshall Heights residents didn't care about their neighborhood, the Marshall Heights Civic Association engaged in a two-month-long campaign to remove trash and weeds, sweep streets, improve empty lots, and generally eliminate blight from the neighborhood. The campaign won extensive media notice. The city spent a total of $700,000 on roads and water and sewer lines by the end of 1958.|$|E
