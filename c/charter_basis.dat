The new service, which initially operated on a seasonal <b>charter</b> <b>basis,</b> became a year-round scheduled operation in 1949. In the beginning, {{there was a}} flat £32 one-way fare to take a group of four passengers along with their car across the Channel.

For example, a group of four travelling with a small car was charged only £27, while the comparable fare for four people travelling with a large car remained at £32. By the end of 1949, this operation fully utilised five Freighters, which carried 2,700 cars and 10,000 passengers. These figures represented a significant increase {{over the previous year}} when only 178 cars and their occupants, as well as some motorcycles and bicycles had been carried {{until the end of the}} season in September.|$|E
