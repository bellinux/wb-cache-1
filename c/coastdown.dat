40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Accurate measurement of a vehicle's resistance to motion on a road (the 'road load'), and the separation of this resistive force into its contributory components is of fundamental importance to generate the data required for vehicle performance assessment, the calibration of a modem chassis dynamometer and for comparing the drag of different vehicles or vehicle configurations. Established methods of determining road load on a test track are the <b>coastdown</b> and steady state torque tests, but environmental variability (largely due to ambient wind) and differences in the vehicle operating conditions cause wide variation in the results. This thesis describes a comprehensive study into methods of acquiring and analysing road load data at a test track. A mathematical model of the vehicle travelling in a straight line, {{in the presence of}} ambient wind, is developed and may be applied to measured data obtained in both the <b>coastdown</b> and the steady state test modes. The model includes the aerodynamic drag, tyre losses, transmission and un-driven wheel losses and the variation of aerodynamic drag with yaw angle. Experimental data obtained at a test track, using advanced instrumentation (including on-board anemometry and wheel torque meters) are analysed to obtain estimates of the coefficients in the road load equation. The results from an initial study demonstrate the importance of measuring the local wind at the test vehicle and the transmission losses if the total drag is to be accurately measured and separated into its contributory components. The <b>coastdown</b> method is shown to be more accurate and repeatable than the steady state method, and is therefore used as the basis of an advanced test procedure. Up to four coefficients can be determined from the <b>coastdown</b> data using a parameter optimisation routine. This routine fits the mathematical model to the measured <b>coastdown</b> profile to obtain estimates of the road load coefficients including the variation of aerodynamic drag coefficient with yaw angle. Results using this analytical method show that all four coefficients can be determined from <b>coastdown</b> data if there is sufficient ambient wind, and hence lay the basis for an advanced test method using only data from track tests. Constrained methods, where {{one or more of the}} parameters is fixed, can be used to investigate a single source of drag. The reduction in the total number of tests required to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy in the variable coefficients when using the constrained method is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Model-based {{diagnostic}} {{techniques can}} be used to identify the faults that affect rotating machines. In general, the most important faults and malfunctions can be modelled by means of a suitable set of equivalent excitations that are applied to the nodes of a finite element model of the machine rotor train.

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis of thermal stratification {{in the upper}} plenum of the MONJU fast breeder reactor was performed. Calculations were performed for a 1 / 6 simplified model of the MONJU reactor using the commercial code, CFX- 13. To better resolve the geometrically complex upper core structure of the MONJU reactor, the porous media approach was adopted for the simulation. First, a steady state solution was obtained and the transient solutions were then obtained for the turbine trip test conducted in December 1995. The time dependent inlet conditions for the mass flow rate and temperature were provided by JAEA. Good agreement with the experimental data was observed for steady state solution. The numerical solution of the transient analysis shows the formation of thermal stratification within the upper plenum of the reactor vessel during the turbine trip test. The temporal variations of temperature were predicted accurately by the present method in the initial rapid <b>coastdown</b> period (∼ 300 seconds). However, transient numerical solutions show a faster thermal mixing than that observed in the experiment after the initial <b>coastdown</b> period. A nearly homogenization of the temperature field in the upper plenum is predicted after about 900 seconds, which is a much shorter-term thermal stratification than the experimental data indicates.

40|$|The AFR- 300, Advanced Fast Reactor (300 Mwe), {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a Generation IV concept. It {{could also be used}} to dispose of surplus weapons grade plutonium or as an actinide burner for transmutation of high level radioactive waste. AFR- 300 uses metallic fuel and sodium coolant. The design of AFR- 300 takes account of the successful design and operation of EBR-II, but the AFR- 300 design includes a number of advances such as an advanced fuel cycle, inspectability and improved economics. One significant difference between AFR- 300 and EBR-II is that AFR- 300 is considerably larger. Another significant difference is that AFR- 300 has no auxiliary EM pump in the primary loop to guarantee positive core flow when the main primary pumps are shut down. Thus, one question that has come up in connection with the AFR- 300 design is whether natural circulation flow is sufficient to prevent damage to the core if the primary pumps fail. Insufficient natural circulation flow through the core could result in high cladding temperatures and cladding failure due to eutectic penetration of the cladding by the metal fuel. The rate of eutectic penetration of the cladding is strongly temperature dependent, so cladding failure depends on how hot the cladding gets and how long it is at elevated temperatures. To investigate the adequacy of natural circulation flow, a number of pump failure transients and a number of design options have been analyzed with the SASSYS- 1 systems analysis code. This code has been validated for natural circulation behavior by analysis of Shutdown Heat Removal Tests performed in EBR-II. The AFR- 300 design includes flywheels on the primary pumps to extend the pump <b>coastdown</b> times, {{and the size of the}} flywheels can be picked to give optimum <b>coastdown</b> times. One series of transients that has been run consists of protected loss-of-flow transients with various values for the combined moment of inertia of the pump, the motor and the flywheel giving <b>coastdown</b> times from 70 seconds to 586 seconds. In this transient series both the main pump motors and the pony motors lose power. Another series of loss-of-flow cases involved staggered failures of the pony motors. The main pump motors fail, the reactor scrams, and the pumps coast down to pony motor speed. Then at various times the pony motors are assumed to fail. If the pony motors fail at the wrong time, then the resulting transient can be more severe than if the pony motors failed at the same time as the main motors. A third series of cases involved a reactor scram followed by failure of both the main pump motors and the pony motors at various times. For all of these cases, satisfactory natural circulation behavior can be obtained if the right design options are used...|$|E
