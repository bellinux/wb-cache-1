40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} {{of this research}} are to develop the variables which moderate the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> transportation services and to analyze the moderating effects of the variables. The conceptual and operational definitions of the variables were ascertained from prior research. The {{reliability and validity of}} collected data were tested by various methods and hypotheses are tested by a moderated regression analysis. The results are as follows. First, the moderating variables on the relationship between <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> transportation services are identified as internal orientation and market orientation. The former has three sub-dimensions such as collaboration between departments, work standardization and process improving and the latter has three sub-dimensions such as intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination, and responsiveness.

A model of job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention is developed and tested in one field study. In this study, using a 250 employees of a Turkish manufacturing company, were given questionnaires to complete during regular working hours; 188 completed questionnaires were returned [...] Job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention are popular topics in the study of work related attitudes. The main objective {{of this article is to}} test the relationships among job satisfaction, organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention. Structural equation modeling to test research hypotheses is used and the model that has high reliability and validity is developed. The results indicate that job satisfaction is one of the most antecedents of organizational <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> turnover intention and suggest that high levels of job satisfaction results in higher <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> lower turnover intention so job satisfaction positively influences on affective <b>commitment,</b> continuance <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> normative <b>commitment</b> while it is negatively impact on turnover intention.

Christopher Douglas argues that had Jardine been playing regularly, he would have been made captain for the final Test, when Chapman was dropped in favour of the sounder batsman Bob Wyatt. The sensation of the Test series was Donald Bradman, who dominated the English bowling to score 974 runs with unprecedented speed and certainty, making the English selectors realise that something must be done to address his skill.
