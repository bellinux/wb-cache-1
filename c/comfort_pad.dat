5000|$|One variant is {{a cooler}} with writing pad having an area {{meant to be}} used for placing a book or a writing pad - {{designed}} with students in mind, although the bigger size limits its mobility and the weight usually results in tired legs for the user when used for a prolonged period of time. A recent addition to the above is an attachable laptop cooler and a <b>comfort</b> <b>pad</b> built into one.|$|E
50|$|Cycling {{places a}} good deal of stress on the hands, in the form of {{prolonged}} pressure against handlebars and transmission of sudden road shocks through handlebars to the hands. The severity of discomfort can be mitigated somewhat by riding position, but is essentially inherent in most designs of upright bicycle. However, choice of weight distribution between the saddle and handlebars is usually determined by other factors, such as aerodynamics, control and long-term <b>comfort.</b> <b>Padded</b> gloves or handlebar grips are therefore useful to increase comfort for a given geometry.|$|R
50|$|Footwear: A strong pair {{of shoes}} or boots. Skate style shoes are the {{favourite}} among dirtsurfer riders as they offer <b>comfort,</b> strength, and <b>padding.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{shoulder}} pads {{consist of a}} hard plastic outer shell with shock-absorbing foam padding underneath. The pads fit over the shoulders and the chest and rib area, and are secured with various snaps and buckles. Shoulder pads give football players their typical [...] "broad-shouldered" [...] look, and are fitted to an adult player by measuring across the player's back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade with a soft cloth measuring tape and then adding 1/2 inch. For <b>comfort,</b> shoulder <b>pads</b> are sometimes worn {{in conjunction with a}} {{shoulder pads}} cushion of foam rubber over a cotton half-tee.|$|R
50|$|Hexpad uses {{high quality}} closed cell {{athletic}} foam padding, the same padding density and impact resistance {{that is used}} in pads for American football and other impact sports. Hexpad is lightweight allowing for greater coverage and <b>comfort</b> than traditional <b>padding</b> systems. The spaces between the cells allow moisture movement and breathability for temperature regulation.|$|R
50|$|Carriages may seat between 6 and 40 persons, {{and can be}} roofed or not, {{featuring}} open {{or closed}} sides and various levels of interior <b>comfort</b> such as <b>padded</b> seats. If open, depending on climate they may feature plastic or fiberglass corrugated panels overhead, to divert rain and provide some measure of shade. Alternative designs may use a cloth awning overhead for similar purposes.|$|R

5000|$|In 1968, {{after one}} year of production, the GTX was given a {{completely}} new look. A new hourglass body replaced the more box-like body of 1967. The Road Runner was introduced by Plymouth as a budget performance version of the Belvedere. There were major changes made {{in the design of}} all the Plymouth B-bodies. The Road Runner's base engine was the new 383 cuin L [...] "Super Commando" [...] V8 (renamed the [...] "Road Runner 383"), while the high performance 440 was still standard in the GTX. The TorqueFlite automatic transmission was standard on the GTX, with it being a US$206 option in the Road Runner. The GTX used the Sport Satellite trim and was offered in two models, the two-door convertible and the two-door hardtop. The Road Runner used the Belvedere trim, and had less insulation and <b>comfort</b> items (<b>padding,</b> vinyl roof, trim), which reduced weight, helped produce better track times, and kept it in the low price field.|$|R
