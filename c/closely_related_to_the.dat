5|$|The {{findings}} indicate that based on mitochondrial DNA, common ravens {{from the rest of}} the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more <b>closely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pied crow (C. albus) than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be paraphyletic.|$|E
