40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine whether}} any {{impairments}} {{in health and}} social lives can be found under different kinds of <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours,</b> and whether such effects are related to specific characteristics of these working hours. METHODS: Two studies - a company based survey (N= 660) and an internet survey (N= 528) - have been conducted. The first one was a questionnaire study (paper and pencil) on employees working under some 'typical' kinds of different flexible working time arrangements in different companies and different occupational fields (health care, manufacturing, retail, administration, call centres). The second study was an internet-based survey, using an adaptation of the questionnaire from the first study. RESULTS: The results of both studies consistently show that high variability of working hours is associated with increased impairments in health and well-being and {{this is especially true}} if this variability is company controlled. These effects are less pronounced if variability is self-controlled; however, autonomy does not compensate the effects of variability. CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations for an appropriate design of <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> should be developed in order to minimize any impairing effects on health and psychosocial well-being; these recommendations should include - besides allowing for discretion in <b>controlling</b> one's (<b>flexible)</b> working <b>hours</b> - that variability in <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> should be kept low (or at least moderate), even if this variability is self-controlled...|$|R
30|$|Our {{results are}} in {{contrast}} to a growing international empirical literature, recently reviewed by Maani and Cruickshank (2010), that documents a clear adverse effect of housework on wages and that points at the gendered nature of housework with women spending much more time on housework activities than men (especially when being married) as one possible explanation of the gender pay gap. In particular, we arrive at different conclusions than the only other study using German data by Anger and Kottwitz (2009) who report large, adverse effects of housework on wages for both men and women, but who constrain their analysis to full-time working, married individuals and also pool East and West German observations in their GSOEP sample. In contrast, we make use of a second data set, the German Time Use Survey, to assess the robustness of our results and also apply instrumental-variables estimators to check whether our results suffer from endogeneity problems in the extent of housework activities. What is more, Anger and Kottwitz (2009) do not <b>control</b> for <b>flexible</b> working arrangements likely to be positively correlated with hours spent on housework activities and also likely to yield negative compensating wage differentials, thereby adding downward bias to their housework coefficient, whereas we <b>control</b> for <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> arrangements.|$|R

These data first indicate that, contrary to popular wisdom, women workers do not have more flexible schedules than men. Second, the really striking differential is by race: black workers have much more rigid schedules than white workers. Third, workers with more authority at the workplace typically have more flexibility than subordinate workers.

40|$|Objectives The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> and work-life balance in the educational sector in Finland. Furthermore, researching this {{main objective}} was done by analyzing and critically reviewing the literature on the flexibility and work-life balance, by interviewing teachers about their work flexibility and by theoretically analyzing and by interpreting the data gathered from the interviews. Summary This study examines the perceived impact of <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> on work-life balance in the educational sector in Finland. The literature review explains the history and development of work-life balance practices and flexible working arrangements. It talks about teaching as a profession and reveals the perceived teacher workload and work-life balance. Furthermore, a qualitative research was conducted in Finland which aimed to provide new, in-depth information and understanding about the relationship between <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> and work-life balance. Conclusions The findings of the research indicated that the perceived teacher work-life balance in Finland is satisfactory. However, teacher workload has increased significantly. Teachers’ work is also very seasonal since there are busier periods such as exam weeks, which increase considerably work, stress and pressure. Therefore, work-life balance fluctuates as well as the amount of flexibility. One finding is that teachers perceived <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> to be a positive thing. However, it was found that flexibility is more beneficial for the work life than for the non-work life. <b>Flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> can be risky since flexibility can easily lead to work colonializing the other aspects of life. Therefore, <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> do not necessarily affect positively work-life balance. In addition, strategies were found to have a decisive role when utilizing <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> to maintain a good work-life balance...|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{have found}} that rigid dietary control is {{connected}} to higher psychological distress, including disordered and disinhibited eating. Two approaches have been touted by certain scholars and/or health organizations as healthier alternatives: intuitive eating and flexible control—yet these approaches have not been compared {{in terms of their}} shared variance with one another and psychological well-being (adjustment and distress). The present study explored these connections among 382 community women and men. Findings revealed that intuitive eating and <b>flexible</b> <b>control</b> are inversely related constructs. Intuitive eating was related to lower rigid control, lower psychological distress, higher psychological adjustment, and lower BMI. In contrast, <b>flexible</b> <b>control</b> was strongly related in a positive direction to rigid control, and was unrelated to distress, adjustment, and BMI. Further, intuitive eating incrementally contributed unique variance to the well-being measures after <b>controlling</b> for both <b>flexible</b> and rigid <b>control.</b> <b>Flexible</b> <b>control</b> was positively associated with psychological adjustment and inversely associated with distress and BMI only when its shared variance with rigid control was extracted. Collectively, these results suggest that intuitive eating is not the same phenomenon as <b>flexible</b> <b>control,</b> and that <b>flexible</b> <b>control</b> demonstrated substantial overlap and entanglement with rigid control, precluding the clarity, validity, and utility of <b>flexible</b> <b>control</b> as a construct.

40|$|L'auteur présente les horaires flexibles, leurs avantages pour l'employeur et pour l'employé, leurs modalités d'application et les réactions de différentes parties à cette forme d'aménagement du temps de travail. For {{the last}} five years rigid working {{schedules}} have increasingly been under attack and many new experiences have been tried in many European countries, particularly in Germany and Switzeriand. The essence of these experiences has been to adapt working schedules to each worker through a <b>flexible</b> <b>hour</b> system. The basic principle of such a system is the free and individual choice of entry and exit time within certain limits. The <b>flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> system generally distinguishes three separate components to a working day : a core time when all employees must be at their job and two flexible time periods, at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the working day. Such a system has advantages for both the employer and the employee. As for the employer, such a system facilitates time Computing, encourages a decrease of short term absenteism and turnover, a reduction of internal traffic, a decrease of accidents on the way to work, a reduction of overtime, greater hiring advantages, and a longer service to the consumer. Moreover management workers may work in a more peaceful atmosphere, the social climate is ameliorated and internal conflicts are reduced. As for the employees, a reduction of transportation time has been noted, family and personal needs are given a better chance to be satisfied, and a change of attitude towards work was underlined. There is no best way to design and install such a system. There are many variations to it and adaptation is surely favorized under such a system. Experience, however, teaches some ground rules. First such a system much be progressively introduced. Experimentation is greatly encouraged. Second, it takes time for the system to give good results. Third, trial and error is often the best method. Fourth, rules must be established to avoid misunderstandings. Fifth, pragmatism is the golden rule. Sixth, a clear distinction must be made between exceeding hours and overtime. Seventh, a lot of information is necessary before and during the introduction of the system. <b>Flexible</b> working <b>hours</b> practically require a form of control. This control, however, should itself be as flexible and as discreet as possible. Self control is to be aimed at. Such a control can be made by a time card, posted or not, by a punch clock, by special individual meter or by computer. To the same extent that <b>flexible</b> working <b>hour</b> system is well accepted by employees, to the same extent does it find obstruction at the middle management level. That the system is applied to middle management is perceived as a move to put them on the same level as blue collar workers. But the basic reluctance of white collars comes from the revised notion of authority required by a <b>flexible</b> <b>hour</b> system. If one group needs particular attention when <b>flexible</b> <b>hours</b> are introduced, it is middle management. Eventhough early reluctance of unions has been greatly dissipated, they still feel that such a system decreases the possibility of human contacts and that the greater responsibility left to the workers is subtle moral constraint. Up to now, <b>flexible</b> <b>hours</b> have been very successful. This is not to say that they are a panacea nor that they will settle all personnel problems...|$|R
