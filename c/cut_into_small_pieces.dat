5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E

25|$|The {{price of}} energy inputs and the {{environmental}} costs of every nuclear power plant continue long after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Both nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities must be decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses. After a cooling-off period that may {{last as long as}} a century, reactors must be dismantled and <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> to be packed in containers for final disposal.

25|$|Gui are grilled dishes, {{which most}} {{commonly}} have meat or fish {{as their primary}} ingredient, but may in some cases also comprise grilled vegetables or other vegetable ingredients. At traditional restaurants, meats are cooked {{at the center of}} the table over a charcoal grill, surrounded by various banchan and individual rice bowls. The cooked meat is then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> and wrapped with fresh lettuce leaves, with rice, thinly sliced garlic, ssamjang (a mixture of gochujang and dwenjang), and other seasonings.

25|$|The {{financial}} costs of every {{nuclear power plant}} continues for some time after the facility has finished generating its last useful electricity. Once no longer economically viable, nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment facilities are generally decommissioned, returning the facility and its parts to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses, such as greenfield status. After a cooling-off period that may last decades, reactor core materials are dismantled and <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> to be packed in containers for interim storage or transmutation experiments.

25|$|Agrobacterium-mediated {{transformation}} {{is the easiest}} and most simple plant transformation. Plant tissue (often leaves) are <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces,</b> e.g. 10x10mm, and soaked for 10 minutes in a fluid containing suspended Agrobacterium. The bacteria will attach {{to many of the}} plant cells exposed by the cut. The plant cells secrete wound-related phenolic compounds which in turn act to upregulate the virulence operon of the Agrobacterium. The virulence operon includes many genes that encode for proteins that are part of a Type IV secretion system that exports from the bacterium proteins and DNA (delineated by specific recognition motifs called border sequences and excised as a single strand from the virulence plasmid) into the plant cell through a structure called a pilus. The transferred DNA (called T-DNA) is piloted to the plant cell nucleus by nuclear localization signals present in the Agrobacterium protein VirD2, which is covalently attached {{to the end of the}} T-DNA at the Right border (RB). Exactly how the T-DNA is integrated into the host plant genomic DNA is an active area of plant biology research. Assuming that a selection marker (such as an antibiotic resistance gene) was included in the T-DNA, the transformed plant tissue can be cultured on selective media to produce shoots. The shoots are then transferred to a different medium to promote root formation. Once roots begin to grow from the transgenic shoot, the plants can be transferred to soil to complete a normal life cycle (make seeds). The seeds from this first plant (called the T1, for first transgenic generation) can be planted on a selective (containing an antibiotic), or if an herbicide resistance gene was used, could alternatively be planted in soil, then later treated with herbicide to kill wildtype segregants. Some plants species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana can be transformed by dipping the flowers or whole plant, into a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, typically strain C58 (C=Cherry, 58=1958, the year in which this particular strain of A. tumefaciens was isolated from a cherry tree in an orchard at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York). Though many plants remain recalcitrant to transformation by this method, research is ongoing that continues to add to the list the species that have been successfully modified in this manner.|$|E

The {{most commonly}} received resources for Manokotak residents were moose (%79.6 of households). Moose were not usually {{seen in the}} lower Kuskokwim River drainages until the early 1940s. Moose meat (tuntuviim kemga) was preserved by freezing and drying. Rarely was moose meat preserved by smoking or caning. Hunters who harvested moose at spring camps in the mountains preserved meat by cutting it into strips and hanging it on racks or bushes to dry in the sun, making jerky. This jerky was eaten without further preparation, or it was boiled. Virtually all of the moose was used. Bones were cracked and the marrow was removed. Fat from the back and rump was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> and eaten uncooked along with meals at home and when in the field. Part of the stomach was cleaned and prepared, and the heart, liver, and kidneys were also eaten.

Moose was cooked in variety of ways including boiling, roasting, stewing, frying and in soups.|$|E
2500|$|Galician cuisine often uses {{fish and}} shellfish. The {{empanada}} is a meat or fish pie, with a bread-like base, top and crust with the meat or fish filling usually {{being in a}} tomato sauce including onions and garlic. Caldo galego is a hearty soup whose main ingredients are potatoes and a local vegetable named grelo (Broccoli rabe). The latter is also employed in LacÃ³n con grelos, a typical carnival dish, consisting of pork shoulder boiled with grelos, potatoes and chorizo. Centolla {{is the equivalent of}} king crab.

Another popular dish is octopus, boiled (traditionally in a copper pot) and served in a wooden plate, <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> and laced with olive oil, sea salt and pimentÃ³n (Spanish paprika).
