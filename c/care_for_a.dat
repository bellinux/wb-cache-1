5|$|Most of the <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> young bat {{comes from}} the mother. However, in monogamous species, the father plays a role. In addition, allo-suckling, where a female suckles young that is not hers, occurs in several species. This may serve to {{increase}} colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides {{with the development of}} an adult body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is likely due to the species' blood-based diet which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} two major factions within it – the Enclave and the Brotherhood of Steel, {{both of whom}} differ to their {{counterparts}} in the west. While the Enclave is similar in goal to their western brethren, the eastern branch of the Brotherhood of Steel seeks to assist the people of the wasteland, though a small group rejected this and became outcasts who seek to resume their original goal of salvaging high-level technology. Other factions include a small group of former slaves who seek to inspire others for freedom by restoring the Lincoln Memorial, a group of wastelanders that feast on blood, and a group who tend and <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> region of the wastes where plants have become abundant.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

40|$|Children {{between the}} ages of 6 - 17 years {{suffering}} from childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) need constant attention as {{they are more likely to}} be accident proned, hospitalized, disruptive, and educationally challenged. The constant attention required for children with ADHD may impose stress on mothers and primary caregivers, yet this stress has not been sufficiently studied. The objective of this study was to fill a gap in literature by studying the stress experienced by African immigrant mothers living in the United States who are living with and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD, and then comparing the level of stress reported by African immigrant mothers and African American mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with and without ADHD. The study had a quantitative, case-control design, and used the parental stress index-short form (PSI-SF) and a 9 -item demographic questionnaire as the survey instruments. One hundred twenty-five African immigrant and African American mothers participated in the study. Data collected from the mothers were analyzed for descriptive. ANOVA and Regression analysis were performed using SPSS version 21. The results showed that African immigrant mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD had significantly higher stress levels than those not <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD. African American mothers also <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD had significantly higher stress than African American mothers not <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD. African immigrant mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD had significantly lower stress than African American mothers <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child with ADHD. These findings may initiate interventions that would help mothers provide quality <b>care</b> of life <b>for</b> themselves and for their children suffering form ADHD...|$|R

25|$|In Canada, it was Alberta {{under the}} Conservative {{government}} that had experimented most with increasing {{the role of}} the private sector in healthcare.

25|$|Many {{drug users}} {{do not get}} {{prenatal}} <b>care,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of reasons including {{that they may not}} know they are pregnant. Many crack addicts get no medical care at all and have extremely poor diets, and children who live around crack smoking are at risk of inhaling secondary smoke. Cocaine using mothers also have a higher rate of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{person at risk}} for pressure ulcers and those with bedsores is the redistribution of pressure so that no pressure {{is applied to the}} pressure ulcer. In the 1940s Ludwig Guttmann introduced a program of turning paraplegics every two hours thus allowing bedsores to heal. Previously such individuals had a two-year life-expectancy, normally succumbing to blood and skin infections. Guttmann had learned the technique from the work of Boston physician Donald Munro.|$|E
