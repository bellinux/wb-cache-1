40|$|Päämies-agentti-suhde syntyy, kun yksi tai useampi osapuoli (päämies) sitovat toisen osapuolen (agentti) suorittamaan puolestaan palvelun. Sopimuksessa delegoidaan osa päätöksenteosta agentille. Päämies-agentti-ongelma syntyy, kun päämiehellä ei ole käytössään riittävästi informaatiota agentin toiminnasta ja toiminnassa vallitsee epäsymmetrisen informaation tilanne. Epäsymmetrisen informaation tilanne johtaa epäsuotuisan valinnan ongelmiin, moraalikadon ongelmiin sekä tehottoman työnteon ongelmiin. Tutkimuksessa pyrittiin selvittämään mitä päämiehen ja agentin välisiin toimintasuhteisiin liittyviä ongelmia havaittiin suomalaisissa kiinteistökehityshankkeiden rakennusvaiheissa ja miten ongelmia pyrittiin minimoimaan tai estämään. Tutkimuksessa luotiin teoreettinen viitekehys päämies-agentti-teorian pohjalta rakennuttamishankkeille, jonka jälkeen kerättiin empiirinen aineisto haastattelemalla yhdeksää kiinteistökehitystä tekevää yritystä. Kerätty aineiston tulokset esitettiin empiirisessä osiossa ja analyysiosiossa havaitut ilmiöt yhdistettiin päämies-agentti-teorian ilmiöihin. Tutkimuksessa havaittiin useita ongelmia ja ristiriitatilanteita, jotka ovat suoraan tai välillisesti seurausta päämies-agentti-ongelman aiheuttamista ongelmista. Toiminnassa ilmenevä kommunikointiongelma johti resurssipulan ongelmiin, ongelmiin sovitun työjärjestyksen noudattamisessa sekä sopimuksenvastaiseen toimintaan työmaalla. Työn valvonnan puute johti erilaisiin laatuongelmiin ja rakentamisen virheisiin. Puutteet sopimusmenettelyssä ja sopimuksissa mahdollistivat urakoitsijan opportunismin ja johtivat erilaisiin laatuongelmiin, aikataulullisiin viivästymisiin sekä budjetin ylityksiin. Tutkimuksessa luotiin uutta tietoa siitä miten toimintasuhteiden ongelmat ilmenevät ja miten niitä pyrittiin minimoimaan tai estämään suomalaisissa kiinteistökehityshankkeiden rakennusvaiheissa. Principal-agent {{relationship}} is a contract under which {{one or more}} persons (the principal(s)) engage another person (the agent) to perform some service on their behalf which involves delegating some decision making authority to the agent. Principal-agent problem arises if the principal cannot verify what the agent is actually doing {{and there is an}} information asymmetry in the relationship. Asymmetric information leads to problems regarding adverse selection, moral hazard, and hold-up. The purpose of this research was to define what principal-agent relationship related problems arise in the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> of a real estate development project and what means of minimizing and preventing those problems the interviewed companies utilize. The theoretical framework of the study was conducted based on the principal-agent theory and the data was collected from nine interviews from different companies performing real estate development. In the empirical part of the research the gathered data was presented and in the analysis part they were analysed using the theoretical framework. Several principal-agent problem related conflicts or problems were observed in the research. Communication problems in the relationship led to resource problems, confusion regarding the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> order and actions contrary to agreement. Insufficient monitoring led to quality problems and errors in the <b>construction</b> <b>phase.</b> Inaccurate <b>contracts</b> made it possible for the agent to deceive the principal and raised agent opportunism. This led to problems with quality, prolonged projects and additional costs. New information about the principal-agent problem in real estate development projects was produced in this research. The research showed what problems raised in the activities of the companies interviewed and what mechanics the companies used in order to minimize or prevent the problems...|$|R

40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a {{powerful}} tool {{which can be used}} to analyse the environmental effects associated with buildings. Even though there are numerous LCA studies carried out on buildings only a handful of studies have concentrated on the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> of buildings. The few studies that have considered the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> have been reluctant to investigate commercial buildings largely due to lack of data. Most of the studies either ignore or approximate the effects of the <b>construction</b> <b>phase,</b> stating the insignificance of them compared to the total environmental impacts of a building over its life cycle. Many studies have concluded a total effect of 3 to 11 percent in the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> compared that to the total effects. However, the large impacts at an aggregate level that would concern the designers and the builders have been ignored by these studies. Thus this paper attempts to comprehensively analyse the significance of the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> and suggest a methodology for analysing the environmental effects in the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> of a building. The outcome of this paper would provide a guideline for the researchers to concentrate on the <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> in their analyses...|$|R
50|$|Design Team :The {{detailed}} {{design of the}} Padma Multipurpose Bridge is being delivered {{by a team of}} international and national consultants headed by AECOM. The team comprises AECOM, SMEC International, Northwest Hydraulic Consultants and ACE Consultants, with additional assistance from Aas-Jakobsen and HR Wallingford.The Project comprises two phases. Phase 1 of the Project includes the Design Phase leading through procurement action to the award of <b>construction</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Phase</b> 2 is the <b>Construction</b> <b>Phase.</b> Phase 1 of the project commenced on the 29 January 2009. A dedicated Project Office was set up in Dhaka in March 2009. Detailed design of the main bridge was carried out in AECOM's Hong Kong office. All work carried out by the design team was carried out within the framework of AECOM's Quality Management System (QMS) which is independently accredited to AS/NZS ISO 9001. The QMS is designed to control all project work undertaken by the team. A project specific Design Management Plan was established {{at the outset of the}} project, In March 2009, the Government of Bangladesh requested AECOM to accelerate the design with a view to ensuring construction could be completed before the end of 2013. This necessitated the mobilisation of additional personnel within the design team. Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) established an internationally recognised Panel of Experts comprising five national and five international experts to review the design at regular intervals. In addition, an Independent Checking Engineer, Flint & Neill, was engaged to review the design criteria, specification and drawings produced by the design team to ensure the design meets the project requirements and to undertake an independent check of the {{detailed design}} of the main bridge and river training works. A key feature of the detailed design was the integration of Bangladesh counterparts into the design team, which allowed the successful training of a significant number of Bangladesh personnel in all aspects of the project and the subsequent transfer of the high level of technology involved in this large and complex project.|$|R

30|$|Based on {{the results}} of lithological mapping of the {{selected}} wall sections, several types of limestones such as ooidal peloidal (i.e. oolitic), travertine and bioclastic ones were the most widely used lithotypes in the different <b>construction</b> <b>phases</b> of the monument. Besides Figs.  3 and 4 that represent different types of limestone on the different <b>construction</b> <b>phases</b> of wall 1, oolitic, red compact, sandy, marly sandy, bioclastic limestones and travertine were identified in walls 4 and 5 as well, belonging to the middle—second half of fourteenth century/second Gothic reconstruction, the eleventh century/ÁRPÁD reconstruction and the intervention that took place in 2005. Rhyolite was also widely used in some <b>construction</b> <b>phases</b> (e.g. wall 2 —end of fifteenth century/King Matthias expansion, and wall 3 —twelfth century/ÁRPÁD reconstruction). The use of granite in the last <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> was also remarkable (wall 2 —end of fifteenth century/King Matthias expansion).|$|R

Powerful crepido brings the stylobate of columns in Doric order, made of sandstone. The stone drainage leading rainwater away from the roof of the portico kept its original place. The ambulation was 11 m wide. The eastern, southern and western sides were formed by four-column Ionic propylaea. During the third <b>construction</b> <b>phase</b> the plastic decoration of the complex was replaced. The portico around the area is made of marble. The largest number of well-preserved original remains date back to the fourth and final <b>construction</b> <b>phase.</b> Over the existing crepido a new stylobate of syenite blocks was placed. It bore a marble arcade of free-standing columns in the Roman Corinthian order.|$|R
