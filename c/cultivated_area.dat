5|$|The legume vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is said not to be invasive outside its <b>cultivated</b> <b>area.</b> Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian {{research}} unit of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas regarding the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane <b>cultivated</b> <b>area</b> and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E
5|$|The largest area of {{production}} {{is also the}} Netherland, with 76% of the global <b>cultivated</b> <b>area,</b> followed by France, Chile, Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia. Approximately ten countries produce lilies commercially altogether. About half of the commercial production is for cut flowers. Many of these countries export bulbs as well as supplying the domestic market. The Netherland produces about 2,200 million lily bulbs annually, of which 96% is used domestically and the remainder exported, principally within the European Union. One particularly important crop is the production of Lilium longiflorum, whose white flowers are associated with purity and Easter.|$|E

In 1957, Diệm's government suggested the 5–year plan (1957–1961), which aimed at expanding <b>cultivated</b> <b>area</b> to 20 percent and improving agricultural production to 25%, restoring exploitative industry and developing infrastructure.

Production of Betel nut is also a sustaining business of Mon state, as the Mon peasants preserved their heredity land onwards along with the government regulations, however, there are some many parts of uncultivated crude land in the area closed to neighbour Karen state. Moreover, modern business development includes growing of cashew trees (acajoύ, in Portuguese), from which they collect the cashew nut for market elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|A {{thousand}} men {{cut down the}} jungle, drained the marshes and swamps, the streams were cleared of reeds which were burnt, canals created {{so there was no}} opportunity for standing water, holes were filled in, stagnant pools were oiled and hard standings for the horses were constructed. Even a <b>cultivated</b> <b>area</b> at the source of the Ain es Sultan (Jericho's water supply) was treated by 600 members of the Egyptian Labour Corps over a period of two months. No breeding of the larvae could be demonstrated three days after the work was complete but the areas had to be continually maintained by special malarial squads of the Sanitary Section and the Indian Infantry Brigade. These measures were successful as during the six months to September the incidence of malaria in Chauvel's force was just over five per cent with most cases occurring on the front line or in No Man's Land; while incidence of malaria in the reserve areas was very low.|$|E
25|$|Alwar has an {{important}} place in Agriculture production in Rajasthan. Total geographical area of the district is 7,83,281 hectares which is about 2.5 per cent of the State. In 2010–2011 the net <b>cultivated</b> <b>area</b> is 5,07,171 hecters from which about 83 per cent area viz. – 4,51,546 is irrigated and remaining 17 per cent area viz. – 82,903 is unirrigated. Double cropped area is 252 hectares of which 32,230 hecter (12%) area is irrigated and remaining 2,19,819 hecter (88%) area is unirrigated. Thus, the total cropped area of the district is 8,12,873 hecters. In Kharif season Bajra, Maize, Jowar, Kharif pulses, Arhar, Sesamum, Cotton, Guar etc. are sown in about 3,29,088 hectare (42%) and in Rabi season Wheat, Barley, Gram, Mustard, Taramira, Rabi pulses etc. are sown in about 4,52,527 hectare (58%). The main source of irrigation are wells and Tube Wells. By 26064 Tube Wells about 192861 hectare area is being irrigated and by 57196 Wells about 265169 hectares area is irrigated. By other sources like canals, tanks about 404 hectares area is irrigated. About 35470 electric motors and 66502 Diesel pump sets are being used for Irrigation purposes. The normal rainfall for the district is 657.3mm. The average rainfall in last ten years in the district is 724mm. The rainfall distribution in the district is uneven and scattered which resulted some times flood problems and some time draught position which affect the Agriculture production as well as cropping pattern in Kharif & Rabi season. Thus, the Agriculture in the district by and large depends on rainfall distribution. The average rainfall in 2016 up to September is 217mm.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by the Society for Range Management and can be found at: [URL] is known about how cultivation legacies affect the outcome of rehabilitation seedings in the Great Basin, even though both frequently co-occur on the same lands. Similarly, there is little known about how these legacies affect native species re-establishment into these seedings. We examined these legacy effects by comparing <b>areas</b> historically <b>cultivated</b> and seeded to adjacent areas that were seeded but never cultivated, for density of seeded crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L. ] Gaertn.) and native perennial grasses, vegetation cover, and ground cover. At half of the sites, historically <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> had lower crested wheatgrass density (P< 0. 05), and only one site had a higher density of crested wheatgrass (P< 0. 05). Likewise, the native shrub Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young) had lower cover (P< 0. 05) in historically <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> at half the sites. Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda J. Presl.) density was consistently lower in historically <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> relative to those seeded-only. At sites where black greasewood (Sarcobatus vermiculatus [Hook. ] Torr.) and bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf. ] Swezey) were encountered, there was either no difference or a higher density and cover within historically <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> (P< 0. 05). Likewise, cover of exotic forbs, especially halogeton (Halogeton glomeratus [M. Bieb. ] C. A. Mey.), was either not different or higher in historically <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> (P< 0. 05). Bare ground was greater in historically <b>cultivated</b> <b>areas</b> at three sites (P< 0. 05). These results suggest that cultivation legacies can affect seeding success and re-establishment of native vegetation, and therefore should not be overlooked when selecting research sites or planning land treatments that include seeding and or management to achieve greater native species diversity...|$|R
