40|$|Modern {{precision}} pneumatic drills (1 - 500 kg/ha) used in {{the cultivation}} of high density crops such as winter cereals (up to 400 plants/m 2) are very high performance equipment that triple the working width (up to 9 m) and rates (up to 14 km/h) compared to those used fifteen years ago. Most of enterprises commercialize such devices using as cornerstone a central pneumatic distributor in combination {{with a large number}} of radial outlets (24 - 48). In spite of the unquestionable advantages of these devices with regard to more conventional gravitational distributors, the main drawback remains the lack of transversal uniformity which has proven to be fairly sensitive to seed size and shape, to slight air flow changes related to partial obstructions of outlets, elbows and grips in discharge outlets, or vibrations and inclinations of the <b>central</b> <b>distributor,</b> as well associated to inadequate maintenance of the machine by untrained operators. Moreover, the lack of behavior predictability derives in a certain discredit of the pneumatic procedure. This work proposes a theoretical-empirical methodology to analyze the pneumatic circuit and its interaction with a variety of seeds types to be delivered, and selected operational machinery settings, within the aim of elaborating a test protocol which combined with low cost instrumentation will serve a base for predictive maintenance. Experimental data gathered in static and dynamic tests performed by the authors on at least two different seeders together with published information available on technical papers will be reviewed and used for further discussion on reliable diagnosis procedure...|$|E
40|$|The insulin {{signaling}} pathway is critical in regulating glucose levels and is associated with diabetes, obesity, and longevity. A tyrosine phosphorylation cascade creates docking sites for protein interactions, initiating subsequent propagation of the signal throughout the cell. The phosphotyrosine interactome of this medically important pathway {{has not yet been}} studied comprehensively. We therefore applied quantitative interaction proteomics to exhaustively profile all potential phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction sites in its key players. We targeted and compared insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS- 1 and IRS- 2) as <b>central</b> <b>distributors</b> of the insulin signal, the insulin receptor, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and the insulin receptor-related receptor. Using the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) approach with phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated bait peptides, we found phosphorylation-specific interaction partners for 52 out of 109 investigated sites. In addition, doubly and triply phosphorylated motifs provided insight into the combinatorial effects of phosphorylation events in close proximity to each other. Our results retrieve known interactions and substantially broaden the spectrum of potential interaction partners of IRS- 1 and IRS- 2. A large number of common interactors rationalize their extensive functional redundancy. However, several proteins involved in signaling and metabolism interact differentially with IRS- 1 and IRS- 2 and thus provide leads into their different physiological roles. Differences in interactions at the receptor level are reflected in multisite recruitment of SHP 2 by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor and limited but exclusive interactions with the IRR. In common with other recent reports, our data furthermore hint at non-SH 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-mediated phosphotyrosine binding...|$|R

40|$|Neurological {{findings}} suggest that the human striate cortex (V 1) is an indispensable component of a neural substratum subserving static achromatic form perception in its own right and not simply as a <b>central</b> <b>distributor</b> of retinally derived information to extrastriate visual areas. This view is further supported by physiological evidence in primates that the finest-grained conjoined representation of spatial detail and retinotopic localization that underlies phenomenal visual experience for local brightness discriminations is selectively represented at cortical levels by the activity of certain neurons in V 1. However, at first glance, support for these ideas would appear to be undermined by incontrovertible neurological evidence (visual hemineglect and the simultanagnosias) and recent psychophysical results on 2 ̆ 7 crowding 2 ̆ 7 that confirm that activation of neurons in V 1 may, at times, be insufficient to generate a percept. Moreover, a recent proposal suggests that neural correlates of visual awareness must project directly to those in executive space, thus automatically excluding V 1 from a related perceptual space because V 1 lacks such direct projections. Both sets of concerns are, however, resolved within the context of adaptive resonance theories. Recursive loops, linking the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) through successive cortical visual areas to the temporal lobe by means of a series of ascending and descending pathways, provide a neuronal substratum at each level within a modular framework for mutually consistent descriptions of sensory data. At steady state, such networks obviate the necessity that neural correlates of visual experience project directly to those in executive space because a neural phenomenal perceptual space subserving form vision is continuously updated by information from an object recognition space equivalent to that destined to reach executive space. Within this framework, activity in V 1 may engender percepts that accompany figure-ground segregations only when dynamic incongruities are resolved both within and between ascending and descending streams. Synchronous neuronal activity on a short timescale within and across cortical areas, proposed and sometimes observed as perceptual correlates, may also serve as a marker that a steady state has been achieved, which, in turn, may be a requirement for the longer time constants that accompany the emergence and stability of perceptual states compared to the faster dynamics of adapting networks and the still faster dynamics of individual action potentials. Finally, the same consensus of neuronal activity across ascending and descending pathways linking multiple cortical areas that in anatomic sequence subserve phenomenal visual experiences and object recognition may underlie the normal unity of conscious experience...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the development, evaluation and modelling of an anti-segregation system ("AS-System") for. use in larger silos handling alumina in the aluminium smelting industry. This work is unlike {{much of what}} has gone before because {{it is much more}} grounded in the technical and economic consequences of segregation for a particular manufacturing process. Segregation of particulates, i. e. separation of components due to differences in properties such as size, density etc., has an extensive literature going back as far as 1915, but this focuses mainly on the segregation process itself and largely ignores the context and the consequences. The consequence of segregation is loss of homogeneity; the impact that has on any given process, is generally not addressed very deeply. Surveying the literature on segregation, and studying the total processes of aluminium production, creates a basis for understanding the importance of segregation for aluminium production, as well as the importance of powder technology in general for this industry. A method for quantification of segregation in this production process, based on sampling, has been established. This was intended to give the fundamental information necessary for measuring the extent of the problem and the degree of improvement achieved. By placing sampling points along the logistic chain for the alumina, and by sampling these points for a long enough period, information about the influence of the various handling steps on the bulk solids can be identified. Segregation by particle size is the main type of influence, although the work has shown that attrition is another. Standardised statistical expressions have been used for analysing the bottlenecks of the logistic loops, and study of the results has led to a useful way of expressing the level of segregation, the change of segregation level in a handling step (silo filling and discharge), and improvements in this change. The degree of segregation when handling alumina has proven to be quite considerable in terms of effects on the production process. The effects on the efficiency of the aluminium smelting process, and the environment, have both been evaluated. Variations in the alumina due to segregation have been found to correlate with both dust concentration in the smelter pot room, and anode effects (an unwanted upset in the smelting process). An economical evaluation of an investment in anti segregation systems has been made. This evaluation has shown significant economic consequences, clearly justifying both the investigations of segregation, and the implementation of anti segregation measures. To remedy the effects of air current segregation in the aluminium industry, a complete Anti Segregation System (AS-System) based around Anti Segregation Tubes (AST) utilising a special inlet configuration has been developed. In a number of full size installations, this solution has proved itself capable of handling the variations and transients of process conditions which occur in the industry, with a large operational capacity range, due to the special inlet configuration. The effect of the full scale installed anti segregation systems have been measured, and compared to other systems. The AS-System clearly demonstrated a homogenising effect no matter how low the ingoing variations in particle size were. Other commercial systems which have been evaluated {{have turned out to be}} no more than Segregation Effect Damping Systems, since they only seem to reduce the segregation effect after it has happened, instead of trying to eliminate the problem by directly attacking the segregation mechanism itself which is what the AS-System does. A new scaled down test rig for the AS-System was developed, consisting of three ASTs fed from a <b>central</b> <b>distributor.</b> To test the potential effect of the AS-System, to determine its efficiency in countering segregation, tests with repeated filling and emptying of a scale silo were carried out. The results clearly showed that the AS-System very much reduced segregation, compared to conventional filling, even in a small-scale silo. Improved models have been developed for the function of the AST and these have been verified against measurements from the new test rig. The early version of the test rig for the AST used only one centre-mounted tube, with one pressure measurement in the top of the tube. The first models were based on the assumption of the pressure being linear, and assumed full dispersion of the falling material inside the tube; and calibrated from the single pressure measurement inside at the top of the tube. Although this simple model calculated very conservative values of the negative pressure, the model was used for the initial development and design of the AST, and later the ASSystem (Anti Segregation System). A second model was derived, where the material velocity was calculated based on free fall. This model was also based on the idea of full dispersion, but was in better agreement with measured values during further tests, which showed a considerable deviation from the original assumption of a linear pressure distribution once intermediate pressure measurements were available. When using the multi-phase-flow-simulation-program-code FLUENT to simulate the pressure distribution of the AST, the results were quite disappointing, however the FLUENT program was able to identify an initial positive pressure generated by the flow from the inlet box to the tube. Implementing this initial pressure into the simple non-linear model above, both the trend and values correspond quite well with the measured values. A single particle drag model was tried, but dismissed after calculating the maximum possible capacity for known tubes and finding the predictions to be unrealistically low. A new approach was introduced, modelling the fall of the powder in a continuous layer along the inner wall of the tube on one side, creating skin drag along the surface between the falling solid powder and the air. The length of the tube and the width of the chosen AST profile define this surface. This approach assumes that the powder falls like a layer along the tube wall. Previous theory for pressure drop in pneumatic conveying inspired this approach, but it had not previously been used for gravity flow in vertical tubes, and as a result the novel Solid Surface Body Drag Model (SSBDM) was developed. This analytical model gives very good correspondence with the measured data for the pressure distribution inside the AST, yet is extremely simple to use. When comparing the model with measured data, the SSBDM was able to predict the pressure distribution within the error boundaries of the test measurements. A method for design of the AST was derived from the SSBDM, using a dimensionless parameter function determined for the pressure drop model. The models giving the design indicate that the capacity is more than proportional to the cross sectional area of a chosen tube profile, which is in agreement with observations. The model suggests that the capacity is proportional to the cross sectional area in the power of 1. 25. This model allowed the study of the effect of tube shape, which revealed that a square profile for the AST does not seem to be the optimum design; rather, a rectangular profile should be chosen for maximum capacity. The model suggests that the capacity is proportional to the width of the side of the tube along which the powder layer is falling, but proportional to the perpendicular side in a rectangular profile in the power of 1. 5. The model gives an equation for pressure drop which can also be utilised to place the first valve on the tube. It also shows that for high capacities, and large silos, a system consisting of several ASTs should be chosen (AS-System). Predictions from the model have been tested against the measured capacities of full scale installed systems and give good agreement. Overall, the AS-System has been shown to be cost-effective in reducing segregation; results measured from the full scale installations show a homogenising factor (reduction in variation of the material being handled) of 1 - 1. 5. As a result of these verifications and the simplicity of the model presented in this thesis, the plant engineer can confidently design a system which will function correctly and make a positive, predictable improvement in the homogeneity of the alumina in his plant...|$|E
40|$|Urban freight {{distribution}} problems vary {{in nature}} and {{can be characterized as}} economically, environmentally or socially grounded. Urban freight distribution operates in urban areas were space is in short supply. These residency areas are the homes of many people. Since most vehicles still drive on conventional energy sources, greenhouse gas emission is a big problem in cities. Safety and noise issues regarding old vehicles operating in urban areas also {{have a negative impact on}} liveability of cities. The social need to sustain urban freight distribution and to develop and improve the urban freight distribution system in high-density urban areas is large. The concept of sustainable developments can be divided in three principles, which include economic growth, social equity and environmental protection. The context of urban freight distribution is rather complex. This complexity is created by the multi- actor context of urban freight distribution and the fact that stakeholders do not always carry (social) cost and benefits both. Cargo owners and distributors are at the centre of the system and possess a high degree of power to influence the UFD system and therefore cannot be left out of the process. Overall, they have a neutral attitude towards sustaining urban freight distribution (which is the main goal of the problem owner, the municipality of Delft). Their attitude is neutral since they cannot earn money directly in operating in a sustainable manner. This makes it difficult to implement solutions, create sense of urgency to activate involved stakeholders to make a change. ‘Maatwerk Distributie’ (MD) has developed a Last Mile Scan (LMS). This is a calculation model that is developed to calculate and predict cost structures of last mile trips in urban areas. The main purpose of development is to gather information for both the municipality of Delft as well as participants of the LMS, which are freight carriers. The research objective is: to identify the needs of stakeholders involved in the urban freight distribution system of Delft and to conduct a validation study on the LMS calculation model to be able to provide recommendations to the municipality of Delft on how to improve usage and extent lifespan the LMS model in order to sustain UFD in Delft. This thesis seeks to answer the main research question: How can data and information collected by the LMS be of extended usage to the municipality of Delft to serve the purpose of improving urban freight distribution taking into account all stakeholder interests such as economic inefficiencies, (greenhouse) emissions, noise nuisance, air quality, safety and congestion issues? The conceptual framework developed by Sargent describes the process of how to get from one entity to another (R. G. Sargent, 2005). This conceptual framework is an approach that could be applied and help in building valid and credible simulation model. This framework is used as guidance in the validation process of the LMS model. In order to ensure the LMS is validated properly the four phases of the validation process of the framework are conducted. These phases are conceptual model validation, operational validation, computerized model verification and data validity. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. Sensitivity analysis can support validation of a model. The LMS model uses different variables and constants to estimate and give an indication of cost of a specific shipping. The black box and the CRD are conceptual models developed to conduct conceptual model validation. The relations between variables used by the model are logic. Although only the direction of the relation is evaluated at this stage, the LMS model seems to be fairly reasonable, but simplified representation of the real situation. Total distance of a trip is calculated using an API tool developed by Google. This application ensures a high accuracy of distances since it uses precise coordinates to calculate covered distances. The formula used for calculating distance per stop is plausible because distance per stop can be calculated by multiplying the number of stops times an average distance per stop. Total time is dependent on driving and unloading time. Driving time is dependent on average velocity of a vehicle and total distance covered. The general dimension of velocity is kilometre per hour; velocity = distance / time; time = distance / velocity. This relation is correct. Unloading time is dependent on the amount of small and large packages delivered multiplied by a constant ‘average unloading time’ per package/pallet. Unloading time can be estimated by using a constant average time for unloading small/large packages because every unit takes time to deliver. Total costs are calculated and dependent on total time multiplied by cost per hour and total distance multiplied by cost per kilometre. This is a plausible method. The formulas to calculate distance, time and cost of a last mile trip and relations between variables used to conduct these calculations are plausible. The benchmark methodology and strict rules that Research Company Panteia practise ensures data collection is done properly and is significantly reliable. Input data on assumptions like velocities of vehicles and cost per minute and kilometre seems correct. Data collected throughout field research is less reliable. It is difficult to state that these assumptions correspond with real world values, because background information on scope of the field research is not available and unknown. Constants are still assumptions and not valid as truth-values. Operational validity is impossible due to a lack of real data, which makes it impossible to crosscheck output of the LMS model with real data from the field. Freight carriers themselves do not know the cost of the last mile. This validation step cannot be conducted. In the sensitivity analysis, all output variables are higher in case of scenarios where constants are higher. This means that all hypotheses are correct and that the LMS model gives the expected results in light of sensitivity of changing different assumptions. This argument strengthens validity of the model because, the model generates realistic and logic outputs when varying input variables and constants. Overall, concluded from the validation process the LMS model is a reasonable representation of the problem entity and conceptualization and computerized model verification phases have been conducted properly. Data validity is not valid (yet) and should be improved on certain assumptions and the scope of the field research that supports these assumptions can be more extensive. Field research methods are basic and the actual size of the research is too small to gather a significant and crucial amount of reliable information and data. Operational validity is impossible due to a lack of real data and lack of knowledge of freight carriers on the exact cost of their last mile trip. Therefore, the LMS model cannot be labelled as valid because not all validation phases are successfully completed. The majority of trips, around 75 %, cover a smaller distance then 10 kilometres. This means that the most last-mile trips do not cover a large distance. The average time of all trips is 100 minutes. This is relatively long since the average distance covered in 100 minutes is only 8, 59 kilometres. The cost of all trips is distributed evenly between 0 and 100 euro. The centre of gravity lies between 10 and 35 euro. The average cost of all trips is 36, 56 euro. All scatterplots of output variables cost, time and distance show expected relationships and results. The structure of the LMS model is linear based. All formulas between variables used in the LMS model are linear. Outcomes of graphs of the relationships between distance, time and cost show linear featured as well. These types of relationships are in line with expectations and therefore strengthen validity of the LMS model slightly. Interesting output variables that are not directly calculated by the LMS model yet, but can be created by applying a simple mutation of output variables of the data sample. These mutated variables can be seen as criteria or key performance indicators to see how different freight carriers are performing. KPIs that are explored in this paragraph are cost per unit; cost per minute; cost per kilometre; cost per m 3. The trend line of total cost of PostNL is a significant steeper linear relationship as the trend line of total cost LMS. This implies that as shipping load increases (packages + pallets) alternative shipping method PostNL is more expensive in comparison to a shipment conducted by a freight carrier internal. The intersection is interesting and lies at a shipping load of 5 units (packages + pallets). In the majority of cases (data points) a shipping load of 5 or smaller (relatively smaller shipments) are cheaper to be shipped by an alternative shipping method (PostNL). In majority of cases, larger loading ratios (relatively larger shipments) benefit to be executed by a freight carrier internally. Distributors can be classified based on all parameters in the LMS model or parameters not yet present but easily created by a simple mutation. The possibilities are endless since all attributes and KPI’s can be used as inputs and/or evaluation fields both. The right setting for the municipality is probably a combination of economic and environmental parameters. A conclusion drawn from the cluster analysis is that clusters with a large shipping load score well on environmental aspects (defined environmental key performance indicators). In addition, these groups of carriers also score well on economic aspects (defined specific economic key performance indicators) concluded from the cluster analysis on economic aspects. This strengthens the conclusion that smaller shipments perform less good in general (both in economic and environmental terms) and can better use an alternative shipping method. The practical usability of the cluster analysis is three-folded. The analysis gathers detailed knowledge on available data derived by the LMS model. This information can be used to develop custom policy for specific freight carriers that are performing undersize. The results can contribute in mediating cooperation between involved freight carriers because cluster analysis provides them with specific knowledge on their performance on economic and environmental indicators. The main goal of the municipality of Delft is to increase awareness among distributors and to mediate between (smaller) freight carriers and a larger and cleaner <b>central</b> <b>distributor.</b> This approach can contribute in achieving a sustainable urban freight distribution system. The focus of the LMS model is too narrow, since it addresses one group of stakeholders only. The rate of success or the potential improvement that can be achieved by cooperating is relatively low since other stakeholders do not see the benefit of the LMS model. Distributors think in means of an entire supply chain from origin towards destination. This perspective is geographically larger and can have one or more last-mile regions in it. The LMS calculation model has a last-mile perspective. Another shortcoming was data availability during the development phase. Development of the LMS without accurate data or field research with a significant level of detail or size is difficult and can result in a too simplified model. During development, arbitrary decisions on assumptions and how to structure the LMS model had to be made. These decisions have not always resulted in finding the right level of accuracy of output variables. The deterministic nature of the model can be seen as a shortcoming of the model. In a real world, every trip differs from another. Another debatable characteristic is the linearity of the model. The model does not take into account the theory of economies of scale. Shipments above a certain amount are therefore biased. The first recommendation is that data availability and the amount of data collected can be increased significantly by making it compulsory for freight carriers to participate in the LMS. This can be done to introduce a system that freight carriers need to have a certificate to operate in the urban area of Delft. All stakeholders receive a certificate if they provide the municipality with information by participating and filling out the last mile scan. The LMS model should be improved and extended on the following aspects: improve the usability of the LMS, include stochastic inputs (further research is needed), include environmental aspects, extent output variables (KPIs) with specific defined cost parameters, extent output variables with total cost of an alternative shipping method and include benchmark results. The usability of the LMS is an important factor that ensures collected data is gathered more. The interface needs to be user friendly and attractive to increase the amount of freight carriers completing the scan. The interface should be improved significantly. This can be realized by development of an application that can be used on smartphones and simultaneously develop a new website. This can result in higher degree of usability and an increased benefit to freight carriers. The deterministic nature of the model can be upgraded by using stochastic input variables instead of deterministic set values in order to move towards a better representation of reality. This can be reached by replacing assumptions and constants into stochastic input variables. Future research needs to be conducted to explore stochastic distributions of used assumptions from the LMS model. Applying footprints to carriers by including environmental aspects. This provides the municipality of Delft with information on performance of individual freight carriers on aspects other than economical. Information on vehicle types should be extended by year of built since this is an important factor that is needed to estimate environmental performance. Footprints should be created as output variables in the LMS model. These footprints are exhaust per stop and exhaust per unit. General total emission parameters that needs to be included are: CO, NOx, NO 2, PM 10 and PM 2, 5. Finally, the outcome of the LMS model needs to be extended significantly by including more detailed key performance indicators. Conducting a few simple mutations can compute specific cost KPIs. This information is crucial for both freight carriers as the municipality of Delft since total cost, time and distance does not give them enough insight on level of performance. Specific cost output variables are cost per minute, cost per unite, cost per kilometre and cost per cubic. The alternative shipping method (conducted by PostNL) should be defined as output variable. The cost of this alternative needs to be visible to freight carriers so they can compare outcome of the LMS model (estimation cost of last mile trip) with an alternative shipping method directly to create a sense of urgency. Finally, all these KPIs should be compared using a benchmark methodology to provide freight carriers not only with information on individual performance but also give them knowledge on performance relatively to similar freight carriers.

It was {{serialized}} in Shogakukan's monthly Ikki magazine from March 2003 to January 2009, spanning {{a total of}} ten volumes. Set in Japan in 2020, it follows the story of female student Rin Ogata as she comes across a two-wheeled automobile robot known as a Rideback. In 2009, it was adapted into an anime television series by Madhouse. At Anime <b>Central</b> 2010, anime <b>distributor</b> Funimation announced that they have licensed the series for North America with its release planned for 2011.|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to study the {{individual}} phase holdup characteristics in a cocurrent three-phase fluidized bed. An antenna type modified air sparger has been used in the gas-liquid distributor section, for uniform mixing of the fluids with the gas moving as fine bubbles to the fluidizing section. This arrangement also reduces the pressure drop encountered through a conventional distributor used for the purpose. To overcome the non-uniformity of flow through the column (i. e. the <b>central</b> region), a <b>distributor</b> plate with 20 % open area has been fabricated with concentric circular punched holes of increased diameter from centre to the wall. Model equations have been developed by factorial design analysis for predicting various individual phase holdups...|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} digital {{audiovisual}} content in Australia, so far, has not exhibited a clearly dominant trend towards owning or renting. This article analyses the historical reasons that individuals {{have chosen to}} own audiovisual content rather than rent it; sets out evidence of recent trends in the ownership and renting of audiovisual and music content and books in Australia and overseas; and concludes with some speculation about the factors that will influence those trends in the future. Several rationales or potential rationales for consumer ownership of content still seem relevant, even if satisfying them will be challenging for content makers and <b>distributors.</b> <b>Central</b> to them all {{is the question of}} what ownership actually means for the consumers who choose it, especially the level of control it allows...|$|R
5000|$|The {{plan was}} based on road and {{allotment}} layout being primarily dictated by pedestrian movement within the neighbourhood. The suburb was to include dedicated open space of not less than 3 hectares per 1,000 head of population, to cater for active and passive recreational activities. The developer was also required to construct a new section of road to facilitate access to and within the new suburb. The road layout and design {{was based on}} a hierarchical function of roads, conforming to the road strategy in the Unanderra area, with main <b>distributors</b> (<b>Central</b> Road and Cordeaux Road), and minor collector roads to service the area. Such things as bus routes, services (schools), accessibility around the suburb by both cars and pedestrians, and protection of the environment, were all factored into the development (Dunk, K.R., 1979).|$|R
50|$|Enoki Films USA {{held the}} North American license to the anime {{and called the}} series Ursula's Kiss, and gave each {{character}} English names. However, the American <b>distributor,</b> <b>Central</b> Park Media, chose to use the original title and character names. The dubbed and subbed versions were released to VHS in 1998 by Central Park Media under their Software Sculptors label. There were {{a total of four}} releases each containing either three or four episodes. These same episodes were released to two bilingual DVD volumes in 1999 with six or seven episodes each. These DVDs were known as the Rose Collection. However, after releasing the first 13 episodes to VHS and DVD, Central Park Media had difficulties licensing the remaining 26 episodes and the dub was put on hiatus despite the show's popularity. After settling all legal issues, they released the remaining 26 episodes of the anime series to bilingual DVDs in 2002 and 2003, though the show's popularity had declined in the years since. The entire series was later sold in the form of three DVD box sets.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 April 2015, the Russian film <b>distributor</b> <b>Central</b> Partnership {{announced}} that the film would be withdrawn from cinemas in Russia, although some media stated that screening of the film was blocked by the Russian Ministry of Culture. The decision was made following the press screening the day before. The Ministry of Culture and the Central Partnership issued a joint press release stating that the screening of the film before the 70th anniversary of the Victory Day was unacceptable. The Ministry of Culture claimed that it received several questions on the film's contents, primarily concerning [...] "distortion of historical facts, peculiar treatment of events before, {{during and after the}} Great Patriotic War and images and characters of Soviet people of that era". Russian minister of culture Vladimir Medinsky welcomed the decision, but stressed that it was made solely by the Central Partnership. However, in his personal statement Medinsky complained that the film depicts Russians as [...] "physically and morally base sub-humans", and compared the depiction of Soviet Union in the film with J. R. R. Tolkien's Mordor, and wished that such films should be screened neither before the 70th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War, nor any other time. However, he also stated that the film would be available in Russia on DVD and online.|$|R
5000|$|But {{it was the}} {{distribution}} business that continued {{to lead the way}} through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994). [...] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired <b>Central</b> Air Conditioning <b>Distributors,</b> Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & Cooling Supply and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier. This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.|$|R
