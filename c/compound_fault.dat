In engineering practices, there is always more than one fault in the gearbox, which is demonstrated as <b>compound</b> <b>fault.</b> Hence, it is equally important for gearbox <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis. Both bearing and gear faults in the gearbox tend to result in different kinds of transient impulse responses in the captured signal and thus {{it is necessary to}} propose a potential approach for <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis. Sparse representation is one of the effective methods for feature extraction from strong background noise. Therefore, sparse representation under wavelet bases for <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> features extraction is developed in this paper. With the proposed method, the different transient features of both bearing and gear can be separated and extracted. Both the simulated study and the practical application in the gearbox with <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> verify the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

One is a single planar fault with a dip of 20 ° {{and the other is}} a <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> having a shallow plane with a dip of 5 ° and deeper, landward plane with a dip of 20 °. The compound-fault model is preferable because it explains the initial part of the observed P-waves better. It is found that the planar fault has one asperity (patch of large slip) near the hypocenter and the other asperity to the landward side of the hypocenter. The compound-fault model shares the landward asperity with the planar-fault model, but does not have the asperity near the hypocenter. The other asperity on the <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> is found far from the hypocenter. This difference of the slip distributions suggests the importance of accurate modeling of the fault dip angle when deducing the slip distribution from teleseismic body waves.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of underdetermined blind source {{separation}} (BSS) in the diagnosis of <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> of roller bearings, an underdetermined BSS algorithm based on null-space pursuit (NSP) was proposed. In this algorithm, the signal model of faulty roller bearing is firstly used to construct an appropriate differential operator in null space. With the constructed differential operator, the mixed signals collected by the vibration sensor are decomposed into a series of stacks of narrow band signal containing the characteristics of faulty bearing. Finally, the underdetermined problem is transformed to an overdetermined problem by combining the narrow band signals and the original mixed signals into a new group of observed signals. In this way, the separation of the mixed signals can be realized. Experiments and engineering data analyses show that the problem of underdetermined BSS can be solved effectively by this approach, and then the <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> of the roller bearing can be separated...|$|E

Through the comparison with the normal state to obtain the sensitive characteristic of the fault, the absolute value deviation diagnostic approach is used to identify the fault and validate it through experiments.

40|$|<b>Compound</b> <b>faults</b> {{often occur}} in {{rotating}} machinery, {{which increases the}} difficulty of fault diagnosis. In this case, blind source separation, which usually includes independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse component analysis (SCA), was proposed to separate mixed signals. SCA, {{which is based on}} the sparsity of target signals, was developed to sever the <b>compound</b> <b>faults</b> and effectively diagnose the fault due to its advantage over ICA in underdetermined conditions. However, there is an issue regarding the vibration signals, which are inadequately sparse, {{and it is difficult to}} represent them in a sparse way. Accordingly, to overcome the above-mentioned problem, a sparsity-promoted approach named wavelet modulus maxima is applied to obtain the sparse observation signal. Then, the potential function is utilized to estimate the number of source signals and the mixed matrix based on the sparse signal. Finally, the separation of the source signals can be achieved according to the shortest path method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the simulated signals and vibration signals measured from faulty roller bearings are used. The faults that occur in a roller bearing are the outer-race flaw, the inner-race flaw and the rolling element flaw. The results show that the fault features acquired using the proposed approach are evidently close to the theoretical values. For instance, the inner-race feature frequency 101. 3 Hz is very similar to the theoretical calculation 101 Hz. Therefore, it is effective to achieve the separation of <b>compound</b> <b>faults</b> utilizing the suggest method, even in underdetermined cases. In addition, a comparison is applied to prove that the proposed method outperforms the traditional SCA method when the vibration signals are inadequate...|$|R

In order to improve the compound faults diagnose of rolling bearings via signals ’ separation, the present paper proposes a new method to identify compound faults from measured mixed-signals, which is based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method and independent component analysis (ICA) technique. With the approach, a vibration signal is firstly decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by EEMD method to obtain multichannel signals. Then, according to a cross correlation criterion, the corresponding IMF is selected as the input matrix of ICA. Finally, the compound faults can be separated effectively by executing ICA method, which makes the fault features more easily extracted and more clearly identified. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> separating, which works not only for the outer race defect, but also for the rollers defect and the unbalance fault of the experimental system...|$|E

40|$|In the {{condition}} monitoring of roller bearings, the measured signals are often compounded {{due to the}} unknown multi-vibration sources and complex transfer paths. Moreover, the sensors are limited in particular locations and numbers. Thus, {{this is a problem}} of underdetermined blind source separation for the vibration sources estimation, which makes it difficult to extract fault features exactly by ordinary methods in running tests. To improve the effectiveness of <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis in roller bearings, the present paper proposes a new method to solve the underdetermined problem and to extract fault features based on variational mode decomposition. In order to surmount the shortcomings of inadequate signals collected through limited sensors, a vibration signal is firstly decomposed into a number of band-limited intrinsic mode functions by variational mode decomposition. Then, the demodulated signal with the Hilbert transform of these multi-channel functions is used as the input matrix for independent component analysis. Finally, the compound faults are separated effectively by carrying out independent component analysis, which enables the fault features to be extracted more easily and identified more clearly. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> separation, and a comparison experiment shows that the proposed method has higher adaptability and practicability in separating strong noise signals than the commonly-used ensemble empirical mode decomposition method...|$|E

The problem adopts convex sparsity-based regularization scheme for decomposition, and non-convex regularization is used to further promote the sparsity but preserving the global convexity. A synthetic example is presented to illustrate {{the performance of the}} proposed approach for repetitive feature extraction.

Efficient incipient fault detection and accurate fault diagnosis are therefore critical to machinery normal operation. A new hybrid intelligent diagnosis method is proposed in this work to identify multiple categories of gear defection. In this method, wavelet packet transform (WPT), empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Wigner-Ville distributions (WVD), combined with autoregressive (AR) model algorithm, were performed on gear vibration signals to extract useful fault characteristic information. Then, multidimensional feature sets including energy distribution, statistical features and AR parameters were obtained to represent gear operation conditions from different perspectives. The nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, i. e. isometric mapping (Isomap), was employed in statistics to mine the intrinsic structure of the feature space in a low-dimensional space, and thus to speed up the training of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) classifier and enhance its diagnosis accuracy. Experiments with different gear faults were conducted, and the vibration signals were measured under different drive speeds and loads. The analysis results indicate that the proposed method is feasible and effective in the gear multi-fault diagnosis, and the isolation of different gear conditions, including normal, single crack, <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> of wear and spalling, etc., has been accomplished.

40|$|Gear {{mechanisms}} {{are an important}} element in a variety of industrial applications and about 80 % of the breakdowns of the transmission machinery are caused by the gear failure. Efficient incipient faults detection and accurate faults diagnosis are therefore critical to machinery normal operation. The use of mechanical vibration signals for fault diagnosis is significant and effective due to advances in the progress of digital signal processing techniques. Through virtual prototype simulation analysis and experimental study, a novel method for gear multi-faults diagnosis was presented in this paper based on the wavelet-Autoregressive (AR) model and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. The virtual prototype simulation and the experimental test were firstly carried out and the comparison results prove that the traditional Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT) analysis is not appropriate for the gear fault detection and identification. Then the wavelet-AR model was applied to extract the feature sets of the gear fault vibration data. In this procedure, the wavelet transform was used to decompose and de-noise the original signal to obtain fault signals, and the fault type information was extracted by the AR parameters. In order to eliminate the redundant fault features, the PCA was furthermore adopted to fuse the AR parameters into one characteristic to enhance the fault defection and identification. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method based on the wavelet-AR model and PCA is feasible and reliable in the gear multi-faults signal diagnosis, and the isolation of different gear conditions, including normal, single crack, single wear, <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> of wear and spalling etc., has been effectively accomplished...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{zones are}} {{ubiquitous}} structures throughout the Earth’s crust {{and as a}} fault evolves it can significantly influence the rheological and hydrological properties of the crust. Fluid flow through fault zones is typically associated with fault-fluid-rock interactions and these interactions can affect the mineralogy, strength and evolution of a fault zone. In this study, field mapping is combined with petro-physical and stable isotopic analyses of the fault rock to evaluate the fault-fluid-rock interactions that occur within different fault zones, {{and the effects of}} these reactions on fault zone and fault population evolution. At Passo Moro in the NW Itilian Alps, there are three sets of joints cross-cutting the granite gneiss and numerous faults have formed by reactivation of pre-existing joints. The distribution of faults at Passo Moro is ultimately controlled by the variability of joint density within the host rock and the pre-existing joint distribution also affects the likelihood of whether a fault will grow into a mature fault zone or not. Where the joint density is high, strain is unable to accumulate to significant levels to enable joint reactivation into faults, whereas where joint density is low, fault zones are isolated and thus there are no structures nearby to facilitate fault linkage. At Passo Moro the fault population has evolved in a similar way as that described by Martel (1990) whereby small faults link to form simple faults which connect to form <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> zones. The Virgin Fault and Spaghetti Fault would be considered as small fault zones and The Ciao Ciao Fault is equivalent to a <b>compound</b> <b>fault</b> zone. All three fault zones have different fault architectures and the small faults have been affected by different fluid-rock reactions compared to the larger fault. The small faults have experienced fault zone strengthening by K-feldspar precipitation, whereas the large fault has been weakened by muscovite precipitation. The different reactions between the fault zones are primarily controlled by the water-rock ratio which in turn is governed by permeability and the volume of fluid that infiltrates the fault zone. The Virgin Fault is considered as a rock-dominated system (K-feldspar-rich) whereas The Ciao Ciao fault is a fluid-dominated system (muscovite-rich). However, stable isotopes from both fault zones record a low water-rock ratio signifying rock-dominated conditions. Therefore the mineralogy of the fault rock is not solely controlled by the permeability defined water-rock ratio. The fluid dominated conditions promoting muscovitization in the Ciao Ciao Fault were probably enabled by an open fluid system and large volumes of fluid flowing through the fault during its lifetime. Stable isotopes indicate that water-rock ratios got lower with time in the Virgin Fault implying a limited open system, whereas muscovitization and stable water-rock ratios in the Ciao Ciao Fault point towards open system behaviour. In the Ciao Ciao Fault quartz precipitation only occurs in the foliated cataclasite within the fault core. Quartz precipitation is typically associated with closed system behaviour and suggests that the foliated cataclasite periodically ceased to be open to fluids and hence experienced cycles of higher and lower permeability. Stable isotopes show that the Virgin Fault records mineral precipitation from a metamorphic-like fluid, but after fault deactivation, the fault periodically transmitted progressively more meteoric-like fluids via a micro-fracture network. The Ciao Ciao Fault records mineral precipitation from a more meteoric-like fluid compared to the Virgin Fault, and flow through micro-fracture networks is dominated by an essentially meteoric fluid. The Ciao Ciao Fault therefore does not preserve evidence of fluids from its early history. This study indicates that the geochemical reactions that occur within a fault are controlled in part by the evolutionary stage of the fault, the fault rock permeability and the volume of fluids that pass through the fault. These results have been used to propose models for how the hydraulic properties and strength of a fault (population) evolve with time. The models produced from this study help advance our understanding of the processes that occur during the timescale of the seismic cycle, and how a population of faults will evolve in terms of mineralogy, strength and fluid flow. Such information will be of use to those involved in mineralization and mining studies, the storage of nuclear waste in crystalline rock, and earthquake prediction studies...|$|E

This thesis studies the AFTC of an electro-hydraulic driven elevator, which serves as a primary control surface of an airplane. The proposed AFTC system consists of three components: (1) A Fault Detection and Estimation (FOE) component is designed based on two robust adaptive observers. (1). Adaptive Unknown Input Observer: a disturbance decoupled observer utilizing the geometry property and measurement redundancy of the system; (2). H x /H _ adaptive observer: an optimization based observer to maximize the system's response to faults and minimize that to disturbances. The H x /H _ adaptive observer is constructed with the technique of Unitary System, which is defined as a linear system whose singular values of transfer matrix are equal.

Some of these minor folds are potential structural traps. ^ Faux_Pas is superior in several respects to current geometric techniques of balancing profiles, such as the “fault-bend fold” construction. With Faux_Pas, both the hanging wall and footwall are deformable, the faults are mechanical features, the cross sections are automatically balanced and, most important, the solutions are based on the first principles of mechanics. With the geometric techniques, folds are drawn only in the hanging wall, the faults are simply lines, the cross sections are arbitrarily balanced and, most important, the drawings are based on unsubstantiated rules of thumb.

The attitudes of both faults and joints depend on fold geometries. Faults are oriented relative to fold axial planes and axes, whilst joint attitudes are largely controlled by bedding dip and the plunge of the bedding - fracture cleavage intersection. It is tentatively suggested that the dependence of fracture attitudes upon fold geometries {{is due to the}} operation of residual stress systems. The dihedral angle between complementary shear planes has been investigated and shown to be consistently low, usually less than 50 º. Regional tension joints appear to be absent. Joint orientations in collapsed blocks of Carboniferous Limestone enclosed in Triassio breccias show that all phases of the deformation belong to the Armorican orogeny...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the weeks}} {{preceding}} the raid, Rick Ross, a self-described cult expert and deprogrammer {{affiliated with the}} Cult Awareness Network, appeared on major networks such as NBC and CBS in regard to Koresh. Ross would later describe his role in advising authorities about the Davidians and Koresh, and what actions {{should be taken to}} end the siege. He was quoted as saying that he was consulted by the ATF and he contacted the FBI on the March 4, 1993, requesting [...] "that he be interviewed regarding his knowledge of cults in general and the Branch Davidians in particular". The FBI reports that it did not rely on Ross for advice whatsoever during the standoff, but that it did interview and received input from him. Ross also telephoned the FBI on March 27 and March 28, offering advice about negotiation strategies, suggesting that the FBI [...] "attempt to embarrass Koresh by informing other members of the <b>compound</b> about Koresh's <b>faults</b> and failures in life, in order to convince them that Koresh was not the prophet they had been led to believe". The ATF also contacted Ross in January 1993 for information about Koresh.|$|R
40|$|Miniaturist as Jane Austen is, she has {{depicted}} {{the life of}} a few families. In her letter to her niece, Anna Austen, she writes: "three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on"(Chapman's Edition, 1970, P. 10). Jane’s knowledge about these families is, in no way shallow. It is rich in variation and contrasts. Jane Austen is a great novelist due to the universal significance of her novels. This universal significance is achieved in two ways. First, she creates living characters; she penetrates beneath the surface to the underlying principles of personality. She has a full understanding of human psychology and this enables her to draw intricate and complex natures. She lays bare not only the processes of their minds but also those of the heart. Second, she considers them impartially and shows them <b>compounded</b> both of <b>faults</b> and virtues like human beings. They have a universal significance; they are not national types, but representatives of essential human nature. They reveal the weaknesses and virtues of human nature in every age and country. There has been insufficient attention focused on Jane Austen’s father figures: how she created characters and what character types and father figures emerge in the full range of her stories. Characters are centre front in her stories, many of which are chiefly fine vignettes, and in Austen's theoretical statements she has consistently stressed the importance of character creation. The objective of this research is to shed light on those father figures who are the heads of the central families in Jane’s six novels. </p...|$|R
