40|$|Background: Global {{targets for}} {{reducing}} resource use {{have been set}} by {{organizations such as the}} International Resource Panel and the European Commission. However, these targets exist only at the macro level, e. g., for individual countries. When conducting an environmental analysis at the micro level, resource use is often neglected as an indicator. No sum parameter indicating all abiotic and biotic raw materials has been considered for life cycle assessment, as yet. In fact, life cycle assessment databases even lack some of the specific input flows required to calculate all abiotic and biotic raw materials. In contrast, the cumulative energy demand, an input-based indicator assessing the use of energy resources, is commonly used, particularly when analyzing energy-intensive product systems. Methods: In view of this, we analyze the environmental relevance of the sum parameter abiotic and biotic raw material demand, which we call the material footprint. First, we show how abiotic and biotic raw material demand can be implemented in the Ecoinvent life cycle assessment database. Employing the adapted database, the material footprint is calculated for 12 individual datasets of chosen materials and crops. The results are compared to those of the cumulated energy demand and four selected impact categories: climate change, ozone depletion, acidification, and terrestrial eutrophication. Results: The material footprint is generally high in the case of extracted metals and other materials where extraction is associated with a large amount of overburden. This fact can lead to different conclusions being drawn compared to common impact categories or the cumulative energy demand. However, the results show that both the range between the impacts of the different materials and the trends can be similar. Conclusions: The material footprint is very easy to apply and calculate. It can be implemented in life cycle assessment databases with a few adaptions. Furthermore, an initial comparison with <b>common</b> <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> suggests that the material footprint can be used as an input-based indicator to evaluate the environmental burden, without the uncertainty associated with the assessment of emission-based impacts...|$|E
40|$|The Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) {{provides}} a single framework for {{monitoring and evaluation}} of all EU Rural Development Programmes (RDP) in the current programming period (2007 - 2013).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study {{presented}} in this paper was to estimate, using secondary sources of data, the cost and effectiveness of three programs to combat vitamin A deficiency in Guatemala [...] the national sugar fortification program, a targeted capsules distribution program and the promotion of home food production combined with nutrition education [...] and to draw conclusions concerning priorities for Guatemala. Data on the costs and coverage were collected from implementing agencies in Guatemala. Coverage data were converted into a <b>common</b> set of <b>impact</b> <b>indicators.</b> Sensitivity analyses were conducted on variables whose precise value was uncertain. Potential impacts of improvements in program performance operations were also explored. The analysis found the cost per high-risk person achieving adequate vitamin A to be US$ 0. 98 for fortification, US$ 1. 68 - 1. 86 for capsule distribution and US$ 3. 10 - 4. 16 for food production/education. Fortification is the most efficient option if vitamin A levels in sugar are maintained at reasonable levels. Where fortified sugar is not consumed and vitamin A deficiency is highly prevalent, small-scale, targeted, complementary interventions such as capsules and food production/education may be appropriate for sustained/broader impacts. vitamin A programs cost-effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{is considered to}} be one of the main concerns in the construction industry. Environmental pollution has become a major challenge to construction projects due to the huge amount of pollution caused by construction projects. There are different types of environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint, eutrophication potential (EP), acidification potential (AP), human health (HH) particulate, ozone depletion, and smog. Each of these environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> can be linked to different phases of the construction projects. The overall environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> can be divided into direct, indirect, and operational emissions. This paper presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM) -based methodology for the assessment of environmental impacts in road construction projects. The model takes into account the overall life cycle of the road construction project, which is divided into: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction phase, maintenance phase, operational phase, recycling phase, and deconstruction phase. A case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. The proposed model solves a major problem for road construction project teams who want to assess the environmental <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> associated with their project prior to the start of the execution of their projects...|$|R

The final version is available from IEEE Computational Intelligence Society via [URL] <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> are widely accepted as possible measurements of academic journal quality. However, much debate has recently surrounded their use, and alternative journal impact evaluation techniques are desirable. Aggregation of multiple indicators offers a promising method to produce a more robust ranking result, avoiding the possible bias caused {{by the use of}} a single <b>impact</b> <b>indicator.</b> In this paper, fuzzy aggregation and fuzzy clustering, especially the Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) operators are exploited to aggregate the quality scores of academic journals that are obtained from different <b>impact</b> <b>indicators.</b> Also, a novel method for linguistic term-based fuzzy cluster grouping is proposed to rank academic journals. The work allows for the construction of distinctive fuzzy clusters of academic journals {{on the basis of their}} performance with respect to different journal <b>impact</b> <b>indicators,</b> which may be subsequently combined via the use of the OWA operators. Journals are ranked in relation to their memberships in the resulting combined fuzzy clusters. In particular, the nearest-neighbour guided aggregation operators are adopted to characterise the reliability of the indicators, and the fuzzy clustering mechanism is utilised to enhance the interpretability of the underlying ranking procedure. The ranking results of academic journals from six subjects are systematically compared with the outlet ranking used by the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA), demonstrating the significant potential of the proposed approach. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A cradle-to-grave {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) was done to identify the environmental impacts related to pentachlorophenol (penta) -treated wooden utility poles. Penta-treated utility poles commonly are used for electricity distribution and transmission, and telecommunications. In addition, this LCA has evaluated the opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts associated with penta-treated poles and has compared the penta-treated pole product to alternative products. A model of penta-treated utility pole life cycle stages was created and used to determine inputs and outputs during the pole production, treating, service life, and disposal stages. Pole production data are based on published sources. Primary wood preservative treatment data were obtained by surveying wood treatment facilities in the United States. Product service life and disposal inventory data are based on published data and professional judgment. Life cycle inventory inputs, outputs, and <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> for penta-treated utility poles were quantified per pole. In a similar manner, an inventory model was developed for the manufacture, service life, and disposal of the primary alternative products: steel and spun concrete utility poles. <b>Impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuel and water use, and emissions {{with the potential to}} cause acidification, smog, ecological toxicity, and eutrophication were quantified for each of the pole products.

40|$|Abstract Background Funders {{of medical}} {{research}} {{the world over}} are increasingly seeking, in research assessment, to complement traditional output measures of scientific publications with more outcome-based indicators of societal and economic impact. In the United Kingdom, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) developed proposals for the Research Excellence Framework (REF) to allocate public research funding to higher education institutions, inter alia, {{on the basis of}} the social and economic impact of their research. In 2010, it conducted a pilot exercise to test these proposals and refine <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> and criteria. Methods The <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> proposed in the 2010 REF impact pilot exercise are critically reviewed and appraised using insights from the relevant literature and empirical data collected for the University of Oxford’s REF pilot submission in clinical medicine. The empirical data were gathered from existing administrative sources and an online administrative survey carried out by the university’s Medical Sciences Division among 289 clinical medicine faculty members (48. 1 % response rate). Results The feasibility and scope of measuring research impact in clinical medicine in a given university are assessed. Twenty <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> from seven categories proposed by HEFCE are presented; their strengths and limitations are discussed using insights from the relevant biomedical and research policy literature. Conclusions While the 2010 pilot exercise has confirmed that the majority of the proposed indicators have some validity, there are significant challenges in operationalising and measuring these indicators reliably, as well as in comparing evidence of research impact across different cases in a standardised manner. It is suggested that the public funding agencies, medical research charities, universities, and the wider medical research community work together to develop more robust methodologies for capturing and describing impact, including more valid and reliable <b>impact</b> <b>indicators.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{quite some}} time the {{international}} scientific community has criticized the use of <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> based only on few journals registered at commercially subscribed databases such as the ISI Web of Knowledge (producer of Journal Citation Reports - JCR). Several studies focusing on different subject areas have demonstrated {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of assessing the impact of an article, or journal, from commercial and open-access databases, such as Google Scholar (Segen, 1997; Gisvold, 1999; DuBois and Reeb, 2000; Whitehouse, 2002; Baumgartner and Pieters, 2003; Cameron, 2005; Ha et al., 2006; Mingers and Harzing, 2007). Most of the studies found that there was a strong correlation between <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> measured by a commercial databases (restricted) and open-access in certain field areas (Science, Health, Biological and Applied Social), while areas usually with lesser coverage by commercial databases (Environment, Humanities, among others) end up having lower <b>impact</b> <b>indicator</b> values based on these commercial databases. Moreover, the number of publications in these last areas has shown a significant expansion recently and, therefore, they end up receiving greater impact scores when evaluated by open-access databases. In these cases the correlation between <b>impact</b> <b>indicators</b> calculated by restricted versus open-access database is significantly lower. In this exercise, developed to obtain impact values of various Brazilian scientific journals in international open-access databases, not only it could be demonstrated the role that the journal Ambiente & Água withholds in the national scientific community (and even international if considered the information published in previous editorials), but also witnesses the degree of efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of the indicators used.

5000|$|Numerous {{efforts have}} {{attempted}} to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet shock data loggers and impact sensors help monitor impacts a player receives. One example is a device created by Schutt Sports during the Arena Football League's 2008 season known as the [...] "Shockometer"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a g-force which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will {{increase the risk of}} a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device. Riddell created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit. Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the [...] season, but it was ultimately not used. In 2013, Reebok developed the Head <b>Impact</b> <b>Indicator,</b> which is a quarter-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard.

Guard rail posts are the supporting structures for highway guard rails. Transportation engineers, as well as public and regulatory interests, have increasing need to understand the environmental implications of guard rail post selection, in addition to factors such as costs and service performance. This study uses a life cycle inventory (LCI) to catalogue the input and output data from guard rail post manufacture, service life, and disposition, and a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) to assess anthropogenic and net greenhouse gas (GHG), acidification, smog, ecotoxicity, and eutrophication potentially resulting from life cycle air emissions.
