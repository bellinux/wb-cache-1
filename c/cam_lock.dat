50|$|To {{use this}} type of shower bench, the {{caregivers}} first places the shower bench with rails in the bath or shower and stabilizes it. The caregiver then aligns the bridging rails with the shower bench's rails and locks them together using a <b>cam</b> <b>lock.</b> The {{next step is to}} roll the mobile chair (with seated patient) in position, and align and lock the mobile chair's rails with the bridge's rails (on the opposite side) again using a <b>cam</b> <b>lock.</b> Once the three sets of rails are connected, the caregiver can roll the chair (with the seated patient) over the rails laterally, off the wheeled base of the mobile chair, across the bridge, and into the shower or bath. The shower bench supports the seated patient and chair during bathing or showering.|$|E
5000|$|A cam and groove {{coupling}}, {{also called}} a <b>cam</b> <b>lock</b> fitting or cam lever coupling, [...] {{is a kind}} of quick connect coupling usually used in industries as a hose connection to avoid leakage. This kind of coupling is popular because it is a simple and reliable means of connecting and disconnecting.|$|E
25|$|Knock-down {{fasteners}} usually {{consist of}} <b>cam</b> dowels <b>locked</b> by <b>cam</b> <b>locks,</b> {{also known as}} conformat fasteners, installed in adjacent members. The members are brought together and the joint is secured by turning the cam-lock.|$|R
50|$|Other {{alternative}} methods of joining materials include: crimping, welding, soldering, brazing, taping, gluing, cementing, {{or the use}} of other adhesives. The use of force may also be used, such as with magnets, vacuum (like suction cups), or even friction. Some types of woodworking joints make use of separate internal reinforcements, such as dowels or biscuits, which in a sense can be considered fasteners within the scope of the joint system, although on their own they are not general purpose fasteners. Furniture supplied in flat-pack form often uses <b>cam</b> dowels <b>locked</b> by <b>cam</b> <b>locks,</b> also known as conformat fasteners. Fasteners {{can also be used to}} close a container such as a bag, a box, or an envelope; or they may involve keeping together the sides of an opening of flexible material, attaching a lid to a container, etc. There are also special-purpose closing devices, e.g. a bread clip.|$|R
50|$|A slipper type {{torque wrench}} {{consists}} of a roller and cam (or similar) mechanism. The cam {{is attached to the}} driving head, the roller pushes against the <b>cam</b> <b>locking</b> it in place with a specific force which is provided by a spring (which is in many cases adjustable). If a torque is demanded which is able to defeat the holding force of the roller and spring, the wrench will slip and no torque will be applied to the bolt. A slipper torque wrench will not over tighten the fastener by continuing to apply torque beyond a predetermined limit.|$|R
50|$|Cam Locks: on spudguns with {{interchangeable}} {{barrels a}} <b>cam</b> <b>lock</b> is sometimes used to connect barrels to the cannon as {{it provides a}} quick and simple solution to switching barrels. Two levers {{either side of the}} socket side of the fitting rotate internal cams to lock in or release the plug side of the fitting to which a barrel is attached.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>cam</b> <b>lock</b> {{is a type}} of latch {{consisting}} of a base and a cam. The base is where the key or tool is used to rotate the cam, which is what does the latching. Cams can be straight or offset; offset cams are reversible. Commonly found on garage cabinets, file cabinets, tool chests, and other locations where privacy and security is needed.|$|E
50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless <b>cam</b> <b>locking</b> system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide release lever's transverse pin. After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|R
50|$|A camstrap is a {{piece of}} webbing with a buckle that is used to secure a {{cylinder}} or scuba tank to a buoyancy compensator or backplate. The name is derived from the cam action of the buckle to tighten and secure the strap. Also known as a cam band or tank strap. Cam straps are also typically used in whitewater rafting to tie rowing frames to the rafts. However, the cam buckle used in rafting cam straps is very different from one used in diving. The rafting cam strap has a self-locking cam lever that cannot be accidentally released. A thumb released <b>cam</b> <b>locks</b> the webbing in place and its locking action even allows tightening one handed.|$|R
5000|$|Locking options: {{various types}} of key locking or padlocking {{facility}} are available now. Key locking options include flush <b>locks,</b> <b>cam</b> <b>locks,</b> or locks incorporated into a rotating handle; padlocking facilities may be a simple hasp and staple, or else a padlocking hole may {{be included in a}} handle, often called a latchlock. More modern designs include keyless operation, either by coin deposit (which {{may or may not be}} returned when use of the locker terminates), or by using electronic keypads to enter passwords for later reopening the locker. Some older lockers used a drop-latch which was incorporated into the door handle, and slid up and down and could be padlocked at the bottom in the [...] "down" [...] position, but these are less used now. Three-point locking is not possible with this type of latch, because it needs to be operated by means of a latch that rotates rather than slides up and down; so this drop-latch is probably a less secure locking option, which may be why it is little used nowadays. Prefect Combination locks are very popular in school lockers used in the UK due to their ease of use and the time and cost saved in the removal of locker keys.|$|R
50|$|VVT-iW (Variable Valve Timing - {{intelligent}} Wide) {{was introduced}} with the 2.0L turbocharged direct-injected 8AR-FTS fitted to the Lexus NX200t. VVT-iW uses VVT-iW on the intake valves and VVT-i on the exhaust valves. The intake cam has mid-position <b>cam</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism that retards the continuously variable timing. It offers expanded valve opening angles (Wide) which enables {{the engine to}} operate in a modified-Atkinson cycle at low rpm for improved economy and lower emissions, and in the Otto cycle at high rpm for better performance, while delivering high torque throughout the rpm band.|$|E
50|$|Engineered, hollow rig matting systems {{made up of}} {{high-density}} polyethylene (HDPE). When compared to traditional rig mats, composite mats are lighter in weight yet still can handle heavy loads. Composite matting is generally more expensive upfront, but as they have a much longer lifespan than wooden mats they can be more cost-efficient. Higher quality versions of the composite rig mat will include anti-static and/or UV protection additives to prevent the formation of sparks from static electricity and to prevent cracking, physical breakdown & fading of the mat. Composite mats feature a variety of connection mechanisms, from complicated systems that use small parts and specialized tools to large aluminum <b>cam</b> <b>lock</b> systems. It is recommended that you choose a system that features noncorrosive metal parts that will not break or contaminate your work site. Composite mats {{range in size from}} 4’ x 4’ to 8’ x 14’. It is commonly thought that bigger is better with access mats, but {{it is important that the}} mats can be shipped by standard means. 7.5’ x 14’ composite mats are ideal because they will be able to fit into an ISO container.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of the end distance of <b>cam</b> <b>lock</b> fasteners on the bending moment resistance of knock-down corner joints. The preliminary study of knock-down furniture assembly plans was done in order to discover the manufacturers’ fastener typical usage in case construction. Laminated particleboard, cam fasteners and wooden dowels were used for specimen construction. L-shaped joint specimens 760 mm in length were tested by pressing the joint members together – also called a compression test in the angle plane. The study results showed that cam fasteners with end distance of 60 mm from the member edges perform the best...|$|E
5000|$|The receiver, for {{the first}} time, and from here on out, was forged into shape, then machined. Heat {{treatment}} of the receiver was localized to the areas where necessary, namely the <b>cams</b> and <b>locking</b> lugs, to prevent warping caused by overall heat treatment. Forging the receiver increased its strength and reduced the machining labor and time needed to achieve the final shape.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 {{production}} of the classic models was largely ceased {{in favor of a}} new series of pistols taking most of their features from the Charles Petter SACM style of pistols (also seen in the SIG P210 and CZ-75. Namely, these all had inverted slide rails and closed <b>cam</b> path <b>locking.</b> Many also had modular (removable) trigger assemblies. Most were double-action, though some retained the classic style single-action lockwork.|$|R
5000|$|Genuine Browning Hi-Power P-35s {{are still}} {{manufactured}} by FN Herstal of Belgium and Portugal and under licence by Fabricaciones Militares (FM) of Argentina. The Hi-Power {{remains one of}} the most influential pistols in the history of small arms. It has inspired a number of clone manufacturers (including Charles Daly of the Philippines & the US, FEG of Hungary, Arcus of Bulgaria, IMI of Israel, and others). Many modern pistols borrow features from it, such as the staggered column high-capacity magazine, and the Browning linkless <b>cam</b> <b>locking</b> system (which on modern pistols is often simplified so that the barrel locks into the ejection port, meaning the barrel and slide do not have to be machined for locking lugs). Until recently, FEG made an almost exact clone in 9mm and [...]40 S&W, but the company now manufactures a version with modifications to the barrel, linkage, and slide stop that are incompatible with genuine Hi-Powers. Arcus has also superseded its Arcus 94 Hi-Power clone with the Arcus 98DA, a model that draws heavily from the Hi-Power but is capable of double-action operation.|$|R
30|$|Calipers are the {{orthotic}} devices used in SCI {{cases with}} injury at T 6 –T 9. The classification of calipers {{has been mentioned}} in Fig.  9. They are fitted to the lower limb of SCI patients {{with the help of}} metal rods. KAFO is a type of orthotic device which stabilizes knee, ankle and foot, where the knee is supported by a caliper. In some cases, the joint is locked using a drop lock, spring loaded lock, <b>cam</b> <b>lock,</b> ball lock, dial lock or a plunger type of lock. The KAFOs are mainly used to support the patients with muscle weakness, upper motor neuron lesions and lost structural integrity [40]. However, combination of KAFO and a Shannon’s brace provides better support. Shannon’s brace is used separately or combined with KAFO to provide waist support, once the patient shows improvement. It helps the patients in restoring his functional abilities. In context to locomotion, it helps a patient to become independent of supportive/mobility aids.|$|E
50|$|McKenzie and Holland (originally McKenzie, Clunes & Holland) {{were one}} of the {{earliest}} signalling contractors in Britain and supplied many railway companies. In 1873 they introduced a new design of lever frame that would set the style of all frames to come. A dogleg on the shape of the levers allowed them to stand upright in the frame when in the normal position, which made them easier for a signalman to reach. The style of locking mechanism used by McKenzie and Holland from 1873 was known as <b>cam</b> and soldier <b>locking,</b> but <b>cam</b> and t-bar <b>locking</b> was introduced in 1886, and in the early 1890s McKenzie and Holland adopted tappet locking.|$|R

40|$|My {{expertise}} is in developing patentable user centred design solutions and this investigation focussed on solving {{how to improve}} the loading and securing of the barbell weights for users during aerobic exercise routines. The inability to load and lock the free weights is caused by disc rotation, which disrupts the users exercise routines and can cause health and safety issues through tripping and falling over. This disruptive problem frequently occurs for users who participate in multiple person exercise routines that involve barbell and dumbbell activities in fitness centres and gyms. This systematic user centred investigation, supported by patent evaluations and ergonomic product testing, has generated an entirely new anti-roll barbell design and locking system. Through ethnographic research and user testing a D-shape disc and bar locking system was developed that addressed the limitations of existing solutions, eliminating all disc rotation. This means that a user can locate, load and reload disks without requiring rotation. The D-shape bar, which introduces a flat bearing surface and <b>cam</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism also address the limitations of existing solutions by improving the locking performance. It has also resulted in an entirely new visual identity within this category of product. The inventiveness of these features have been rigorously scrutinised via 13 -month patent assessment procedure. This has lead to successful granting of a UK patent. The systematic research leading to the anti-roll design informed {{the development of an}} anti-roll dumbbell for Reebok Europe...|$|R
50|$|The P226, {{like the}} other members of the SIG Classic family, {{operates}} by the locked breech short-recoil method pioneered by John Browning. On firing, the slide and barrel are locked together for a few millimetres of rearward movement, after which the barrel is cammed down at the rear. By this time the bullet has left the barrel and the pressure has dropped to safe levels, whereupon the slide completes the rearward stroke, ejecting the spent cartridge. The recoil spring then propels the slide forward, stripping a round from the magazine and in the last few millimetres of forward movement the barrel is <b>cammed</b> upwards, <b>locking</b> the slide and barrel together again.|$|R
5000|$|There are no {{reasonable}} {{means by}} which the door locking and latching mechanisms could open mechanically in flight from a properly closed and locked position. If the lock sectors were in proper condition, and were properly situated over the closed latch <b>cams,</b> the <b>lock</b> sectors had sufficient strength to prevent the cams from vibrating to the open position during ground operation and flight. However, there are two possible {{means by which}} the cargo door could open while in flight. Either, the latching mechanisms were forced open electrically through the lock sectors after the door was secured, or the door was not properly latched and locked before departure. Then the door opened when the pressurization loads reached a point that the latches could not hold.|$|R

50|$|Developed and {{patented}} by James M. Leatherwood, the Adjustable Ranging Telescope (ART) system combines a rangefinding scale inside the telescopic sight (scope) with an adjustable cam {{built into the}} scope's mount that raises or lowers {{the rear of the}} sight to compensate for the trajectory of the bullet. The cam is preset for a specific cartridge; i.e. the 7.62 mm NATO round. In use, the shooter first adjusts the magnification of the scope such that the ranging brackets subtend the target. Since the range <b>cam</b> is <b>locked</b> to the magnification ring, the range is automatically set and the drop of the shot is accounted for. This then allows the shooter to place the scope's aiming point directly on the target without having to hold over or under to compensate for the bullet's rise and fall.|$|R
50|$|Cam {{fasteners}} are {{a simple}} type of fastener that use a cam to push {{down on the}} webbing that is passed through the cam and prevent the webbing from slipping back through the fastener. The edge of the cam lever that faces the webbing is usually knurled to provide a firmer grip on the webbing. Tension is added by pulling the excess webbing through the fastener until the necessary tension is achieved and then releasing the <b>cam</b> lever to <b>lock</b> the webbing in place.|$|R
50|$|Combination locks {{found on}} padlocks, lockers, or safes may use a single dial which interacts with several {{parallel}} discs or <b>cams.</b> Customarily, a <b>lock</b> {{of this type}} is opened by rotating the dial clockwise to the first numeral, counterclockwise to the second, and so on in an alternating fashion until the last numeral is reached. The cams typically have an indentation or notch, and when the correct combination is entered, the notches align, allowing the latch to fit into them and open the lock.|$|R
