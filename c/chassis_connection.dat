5000|$|Storage: The VRTX chassis {{includes}} {{shared storage}} slots that connect {{to a single}} or dual PERC 8 controller(s) via switched 6Gbit SAS. This controller which is managed through the CMC allows RAID groups to be configured and then allows for those RAID groups to be subdivided into individual virtual disks that can be presented out to either single or multiple blades. The shared storage slots are either 12 x 3.5" [...] HDD slots or 24 x 2.5" [...] HDD slots depending on the VRTX chassis purchased. Dell offers 12Gbit SAS disks for the VRTX, but these will operate at the slower 6Gbit rate for compatibility with the older PERC8 and SAS switches.Networking: The VRTX chassis has a built in IOM for supporting ethernet traffic to the server blades. At present the options for this IOM are an 8 port 1Gb pass-through module, a 24 Port 1Gb switch (R2401) and a 20 X 10Gb (+2*1Gb) switch (R2210). The 8 port pass through module offers 2 pass-through connections to each internal blade slot where the 24 port 1Gb switch option provides 16 internal ports (4 per blade slot) and 8 external ports {{to be used to}} uplink to the network. The R2210 has 16 internal, 4 external and two additional 1Gb external ports.The I/O modules used on the VRTX are a different size to the I/O modules of the M1000e, so I/O modules are not compatible between the systems.Management: A CMC is responsible for the management of the entire system. The CMC is similar to the CMC used in the M1000e <b>chassis.</b> <b>Connection</b> to the CMCs is done via separate RJ45 ethernet connectors.Power and cooling: The system comes with four PSUs at 110 or 230V AC. There is no option to use -48V DC PSUs. Each 1100 Watt PSU has a built-in fan. For cooling of the server-modules there are four blower-modules, each containing two fans, and for cooling {{of the rest of the}} chassis there are 6 internal fans which can only be reached by opening the chassis. The fans used are the same units as used in the PowerEdge R-720xd rack-server.KVM: Unlike the M1000e the VRTX doesn't have a separate KVM module, but it is built into the main chassis. The system only supports USB keyboard and mouse. Control of the KVM function is done via the mini LCD screen. These USB ports as well as the 15 pin VGA connector are at the front of the system.USB: The USB connectors are only for connecting keyboard and mouse; it doesn't support external storage via USB.LCD: Via the mini-LCD screen at the front of the system you can find status information of the system, configure some basic settings (such as CMC IP address) and manage the built-in KVM switch. The LCD screen functions can be controlled via a 5 button navigation system, similar to the system used on the M1000e.Serial: A single RS-232 serial communication port is provided at the back of the system. This connector is only used for local configuration to the CMC: it doesn't allow you to use this connector as serial port of a server in the system.Expansion slots: The system provides space for five PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards and 3 'full height' PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards. Via the management controller you can assign each slot to a specific server. You can only assign a PCIe slot to a server when the server is powered off as the PCIe card is recognized and initialized by the server BIOS at startup. Only certain PCIe cards are supported by Dell. Currently, VRTX support is limited to eight different PCIe cards, including six Ethernet NICs (Intel and Broadcom), a 6Git SAS adapter (LSI) and the AMD FirePro™ W7000.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validation method for indoor testing of a passenger car suspension. A study {{was done to}} design a supporting modular structure with comparable inertances {{with respect to a}} vehicle's actual suspension and body connection points. For the indoor test, the rear axle is positioned on a rotating drum. The suspension system is excited as the wheel passes over cleats fixed on the drum and transient wheel motions are recorded. The indoor test rig outputs (i. e., wheel and chassis accelerations) were compared with experimental data measured on an actual vehicle running at different speeds on the same set of cleats along a flat road. The comparison results validate the indoor testing method. The forces and moments acting at each suspension and <b>chassis</b> <b>connection</b> point were measured with a set of patented six-axis load cells. The forces, moments, wheel and subframe accelerations were measured up to 120 Hz. This study yielded a set of performance indexes by analyzing the forces and acceleration measured on the suspension system (the force measure is possible only on the indoor test rig). The influence of the running conditions and suspension settings on the indexes for vibration behaviour of the tire and suspension system was assessed and a global sensitivity analysis has been completed...|$|E

40|$|Predictable {{handling}} of a racecar may {{be achieved by}} tailoring chassis stiffness so that roll stiffness between sprung and unsprung masses are due almost entirely to the suspension. In this work, the effects of overall chassis flexibility on roll stiffness and wheel camber response, will be determined using a finite element model (FEM) of a Winston Cup racecar chassis and suspension. The FEM of the chassis/suspension is built from an assembly of beam and shell elements using geometry measured from a typical Winston cup race configuration.

For each topic, well established theories are compared to data from a real-world physical system. Finally, recommendations for minimizing cable susceptibility (and thus cable emissions) are presented. There are numerous papers and textbooks that present theoretical analyses of cable noise reduction techniques. However, empirical data is often targeted to low frequencies (e. g. 100 MHz). Additionally, a comprehensive study showing the relative effects of various noise reduction techniques is needed. These include the use of dedicated return wires, twisted wiring, cable shielding, shield connections, changing load or source impedances, and implementing load- or source-to-chassis isolation. We have created an experimental setup that emulates a real-world electrical system, while still allowing us to independently vary a host of parameters. The goal of the experiment was to determine the relative effectiveness of various noise reduction techniques when the cable is in the presence of radiated emissions from 2 MHz to 200 MHz. The electronic system (Fig. 1) consisted of two Hammond shielded electrical enclosures, one containing the source resistance, and the other containing the load resistance. The boxes were mounted on a large aluminium plate acting as the chassis. Cables connecting the two boxes measured 81 cm in length and were attached to the boxes using standard D 38999 military-style connectors. The test setup is shown in Fig. 2. Electromagnetic fields were created using an HP 8657 B signal generator, MiniCircuits ZHL- 42 W-SMA amplifier, and an EMCO 5103 TEM cell.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Automotive industry is faced with numerous power train Noise, Vibration and Harshness issues. Particularly, in the driveline area of vehicles a noise commonly referred as differential axle whine which is a tonal response and becomes apparent under cruising conditions. This {{is one of the}} key concerns in rear wheel drive commercial vehicles. Although not a failure state, it is regarded as a quality issue and a source of annoyance, which can lead to warranty concerns. The associated cost of palliation to Ford Motor Company was estimated to be 25, 000, 000 in 2003. There have been several ways of studying axle whine through experimentation and numerical analysis. In this thesis, a new approach for investigating axle whine is highlighted, which is more integrative and detailed. Multi-body dynamics model of a light truck s driveline is developed with all the appropriate components, using constrained Lagrangian dynamics. Component flexibility is included for driveshaft pieces, rear axle half-shafts and the suspension elements. The connectivity of the components is accurately modelled such as the floating effect of rear half-shafts, linear bushings between driveline components to <b>chassis</b> <b>connections,</b> as well as the non-linear effect of tapered roller bearings, supporting the wheel hubs and gears. Furthermore, integrated to the previously described large scale model a detailed hypoid gear pair model is devised. This incorporates micro-scale physics for tooth contact analysis to predict geometric properties and deflections for the gear pair. At the same time thermo-elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory with non-Newtonian friction is applied. All these phenomena at different physical scales, such as large displacement rigid body dynamics and analytical equations for the detailed model are solved simultaneously, all within the same modelling environment. This multi-physics, multi-scale approach has not hitherto been reported in the literature, and constitutes a significant contribution to knowledge. Comparative studies of the model predictions and detailed vehicle tests are carried out, the combination of which points to resonant conditions in system responses and flexible component behaviour, coincident with the adverse conditions in the hypoid gear meshing. It is shown that vehicle drive and coast conditions, promoting teeth pair separations lead to irregular (improper) meshing of the differential gears. Such conditions induce impulsive actions that promote the axle whine phenomenon. This is a major finding of the research and contributes to a better understanding of the axle whine problem...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} {{capability of}} the new RHIC low level rf (LLRF) system {{is the ability to}} synchronize signals across multiple locations. The 'Update Link' provides this functionality. The 'Update Link' is a deterministic serial data link based on the Xilinx RocketIO protocol that is broadcast over fiber optic cable at 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). The link provides timing events and data packets as well as time stamp information for synchronizing diagnostic data from multiple sources. The new RHIC LLRF was designed to be a flexible, modular system. The system is constructed of numerous independent RF Controller chassis. To provide synchronization among all of these chassis, the Update Link system was designed.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the basic requirements for transport vehicles. A special request regarding {{the adaptation of}} transport vehicles for the transport of various types of cargo was taken into consideration. Superstructures and the situation arising after mounting superstructures on wheeled transport vehicles were analyzed and the following was described: console coupling, stirrups, simplex elastic coupling, two-way elastic and rigid connection elements. Vehicle torsional elasticity is provided by a proper choice {{of the type of}} connection between the superstructure and the vehicle chassis. Applying the instructions of vehicle manufacturers for using appropriate connections between the truck superstructure and the vehicle chassis provides positive torsional elasticity of the vehicle. The paper gives the general recommendations of the Volvo, Mercedes and Renault transport vehicle producers for the use of particular connection types of locations as well as structural requirements for the mounting of concrete mixers, tippers and truck tanks on their vehicles. Introduction Achieving a high level of transport effectiveness depends on a number of factors. One of the most important ones is the possibility to increase the payload share in the gross vehicle weight. This share depends on the net vehicle weight, a method of coupling the truck superstructure with the chassis frame {{as well as on the}} truck superstructure construction. Realization of this requirement is of significant importance, particularly for large business systems since it results in the reduction of number of necessary vehicles, more economic fleet maintenance and the fleet capacity increase. It is also relatively easy to adapt the vehicle for the transportation of other loads, depending on user's current needs. The adaptation is correctly performed if manufacturer's recommendations are followed during the mounting of the superstructure on the chassis. This paper gives the analysis of the types of coupling used for particular truck superstructures. Types of truck superstructure A truck superstructure is generally a torsionally stiffer structure of the vehicle chassis and by its mounting on the vehicle main frame the torsion stiffness of the whole vehicle increases. In order to retain the vehicle torsional elasticity because of its positive reaction to strain, it is necessary to apply a particular type of coupling for a particular type of truck superstructure. Regarding the torsional stiffness, truck superstructures can be divided into three groups: 1. Torsionally elastic 2. Torsionally semielastic 3. Torsionally rigid <b>Connection</b> of the <b>chassis</b> and the truck superstructure In order to retain the vehicle torsional elasticity because of its positive reaction to strain, it is necessary to apply a particular type of coupling for a particular type of truck superstructure: Panel connection Panel connection allows longitudinal motion and prevents lateral or vertical motion of the chassis runner in relation to the main vehicle frame. Stirrup (U bolt) connection Stirrup connections enable longitudinal motion of the chassis runner in relation to the main frame but they cannot accept lateral forces, so additional leading plates are mounted for that purpose. Simplex elastic connection Simplex elastic connections enable vertical motions of the automotive frames due to the effect of longitudinal torsion moments as well as longitudinal motion of the chassis runner due to the effect of longitudinal forces and frame flexion moments. Two - way elastic connection This kind of connections is used to connect the truck tank with the vehicle automotive frame. The connection supports lateral and longitudinal forces and enables vertical motion of the automotive frame in relation to the truck tank, during the torsion and lifting of the vehicle. Stiff connection (connection plates, sheets) This type of connections enables rigid connection of the automotive frame and the chassis runner thus making them behave as a whole. Connection plates transfer longitudinal, lateral and vertical forces. They are mounted from the front of the anterior support of the rear suspension to the end of the automotive (chassis runner) frame. The upper part of the plate is welded for the chassis runner, while the lower part of the plate is bolted for the automotive frame. Guidelines for the application of particular truck superstructures A truck superstructure must not prevent the chassis movement; therefore, it is important to choose a proper type of <b>connection</b> between the <b>chassis</b> and the truck superstructure. Chassis twisting is most expressed in the area behind the driver's cabin and it should decline towards the rear of the vehicle. If a rigid superstructure is mounted on the basic frame and the coupling is also rigid, the twisting of the main frame is not gradual but sudden and restricted to a limited area where high levels of torsion stress occur. The principal rule regarding the rigidity of superstructures is: the stiffer superstructure is, the more elastic connection must be. Manufacturer's recommendations for particular types of truck superstructures Manufacturer's recommendations for concrete mixer superstructures The truck superstructure of a concrete mixer is an example of torsionally flexible mounting. Figs. 7, 8, and 9 show types and cites of connections as well as some structural requirements of Volvo, Mercedes and Renault transport vehicles [2, 3, 4, 5]. In a 6 x 2 Volvo (Fig. 7), the first three couplings are cantilevered and five other connections are achieved with midfielder plates. The mixer is mounted on 6 x 2 vehicles with suspension or on 4 x 2 or 6 x 2 vehicles with air damping. All twin - shaft trucks could be loaded with 13 t on the rear axle. Mercedes does not give much information related to the concrete mixer superstructure. To ensure stability and reduce strain of truck frames, the chassis runner is stiffened in the rear. Fig. 6 shows that the Mercedes chassis runner bends outwards, because of the possibility of embedding a larger drum or because of lowering the existing one in order to lower the focus down and thus increase the stability of the entire vehicle. Recommendations of the body tipper manufacturer A body tipper is an example of a torsionally flexible superstructure. Fig. 10 shows some types of sites and links, as well as some structural requirements of Volvo and Mercedes tippers [2, 3, 4]. Linking the main frame with the mounting one is performed using the console connection in the front part while near the axles connecting plates are used. To ensure the stability of the vehicle when unloading and to reduce stress, the frames are stiffened in the rear (Fig. 8). Recommendations of the manufacturer for mounting tanks Tank compartments are usually of circular or elliptical cross section, and as such they have large shaft, polar or torsion inertional moments. If the theories of material resistance and construction resistance are applied, it can be easily shown that the bending and torsion rigidity directly depend on the size of the moment inertia; x x c ~ I; ϕ ϕ c ~ I, from which it can be concluded that the tank is a very rigid structure regarding bending and twisting. To connect the superstructure to the vehicle base, two-way elastic connections are used. Fig. 9 shows a twin-shaft Volvo tank with the number and types of connections used in connecting the main frame with the tank compartment. Three-axle tanks and four-axle tanks with the type and number of links of the main vehicle frame with the tank compartment are also shown. Similarly to the case of the tipper MB [3], there is no much information about linking the basic frame with the tank. Fig. 9 shows only a simplified method of coupling, without defining the number of connections and a more detailed description of connections. However, an important difference observed in relation to the solution of the Volvo manufacturer is that a chassis runner is used. Conclusion The analysis of the guidelines of leading manufacturers for upgrades, transport vehicle <b>chassis</b> and their <b>connections</b> leads to the following conclusions: The connection with the basic superstructure frame is an extremely complex issue. It is necessary to consider many factors (type of connection, the connection location, size and shape of the assembly - extra frames, the types of upgrades, etc.) since its characteristics directly affect both the reliability and the payload mass. As shown in the guidelines for the implementation of certain kinds of connection upgrades, a type of interactions on the basic frame depends on the torsional stiffness of the superstructure. Truck superstructures must not move to limit the chassis and is thus important to properly choose the types of <b>connections</b> and <b>chassis</b> upgrades. The <b>connection</b> of the upgrade to the basic frame is taken as already given by the manufacturer, having in mind extensive research of the manufacturer in this field. Regardless the simplifications in the application of general recommendations, the comparative analysis shows that there is a proper connection of the base and mounting frame which eliminates the possibility of breakdown...|$|R
