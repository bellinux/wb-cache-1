40|$|This paper {{shows the}} effect of the Oxygen/Carbon atomic {{relation}} (O/C) in carbon on combustion reactivity using the char of three bituminous <b>carbons.</b> <b>Chars</b> were obtained at heating speeds of 104 K/s, temperatures of 900, 1000 and 1100 °C, and at thre eresidence times (100, 150 and 300 ms). Maximum combustion reactivity was determined through isothermal thermogravimetric analysis. Results show that the maximum reactivity of chars increases with the reduction of residence time and devolatilization temperature. There is a linear relation between the char’s maximum reactivity and the O/C atomic relation of the precursor carbon, which indicates that the increase in the amount of oxygen contained in the precursor <b>carbon</b> of the <b>chars</b> generates a significan tincrease in the reactivity of the chars...|$|R

The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, {{which in turn}} increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil shale throughput. From the fluidized bed mixer oil shale moves downward to the packed-bed pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil shale to the raw oil shale causing pyrolysis.

40|$|It {{has been}} known since the early sixties that nickel sulfide {{inclusions}} cause spontaneous fracture of toughened (thermally tempered) glass, but despite the considerable amount of work done on this problem {{in the last four}} decades, failures still occur in the field with regularity. In this study we have classified (by viewing through a 60 x optical microscope) inclusions into two groups, which are classic and atypical nickel sulfides. The classics look like the nickel sulfide inclusions found at the initiation-of-fracture of windows that have broken spontaneously. We have compared the structure and composition of the atypical inclusions with the structure and composition of the classics. All of the classic and atypical nickel sulfide inclusions studied in this work were found to have a composition in the range of Ni 52 S 48 to Ni 48 S 52. Inclusions on the nickel rich side of stoichiometric NiS were found to be two-phase assemblies, and inclusions on the sulphur rich side of NiS were single phase. It had been proposed that the atypicals were passive, and of a different composition to the classics. However, we found that the difference between passive and dangerous nickel sulfide inclusions was not a difference in composition but rather a difference in the type of material in the internal pore space. The passive 2 ̆ 7 s had <b>carbon</b> <b>char</b> in their internal pore space, whereas the pore space of dangerous inclusions contained Na 2 O.

50|$|Plant macrofossils are {{preserved}} through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually cereal grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental <b>carbon</b> (<b>charred)</b> {{when they are}} heated in a reducing atmosphere. These {{are referred to as}} 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those which are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell. Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions {{are preserved}} as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity. This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, fruit stones, nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material. Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine pits, plant remains which have been consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and fruit stones. Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside fruit stones, cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.|$|R

Four different carbonization methods were carried out (dry pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization with or without pressurized) in the catalyst preparation while among the carbonization methods, the samples which prepared from dry pyrolysis without pressurized process showed the strong acidity due to highest adsorption of acid group in the catalyst surface although the catalyst attached onto the support was the least compared to other preparation methods. Among the catalysts, the sulfonated carbon-base catalyst that is attached on the ceramic support exhibited the highest aci-dity (1. 327 mmol/g) followed by the catalyst deposited on the glass (0. 917 mmol/g) and aluminum (0. 321 mmol/g) supports. The porous structure of ceramic surface, allowed a better interaction between reactants and –SO 3 H site in the carbon. Through the FT-IR analysis, it was observed that the functional groups –COOH, –OH, and –SO 3 H were present in the active sites of the catalysts. The surface areas of  glass (Si–SC), ceramic (Ce–SC) and aluminum (Al–SC) catalysts were larger than 1 m 2 /g, whereas the pore size belongs to macroporous as the average pore size is more than 50 nm.

40|$|EN] The {{combustion}} of coal {{can result}} in trace elements, such as mercury, being released from power stations with potentially harmful effects for both {{human health and the}} environment. Research is ongoing to develop cost-effective and efficient control technologies for mercury removal from coal-fired power plants, the largest source of anthropogenic mercury emissions. A number of activated carbon sorbents have been demonstrated to be effective for mercury retention in coal combustion power plants. However, more economic alternatives need to be developed. Raw biomass gasification chars could serve as low-cost sorbents for capturing mercury since they are sub-products generated during a thermal conversion process. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate different biomass gasification chars as mercury sorbents in a simulated coal combustion flue gas. The results were compared with those obtained using a commercial activated <b>carbon.</b> <b>Chars</b> from a mixture of paper and plastic waste showed the highest retention capacity. It was found that not only a high carbon content and a well developed microporosity but also a high chlorine content and a high aluminium content improved the mercury retention capacity of biomass gasification chars.
