5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the presidential election of 1844.|$|E

While the Grand Ole Opry House's stage was replaced thereafter, the Ryman circle was restored and again placed at <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the Grand Ole Opry House before shows resumed.

25|$|Performances at the 1968 Mexico City {{games were}} {{affected}} by the altitude of the host city, specifically the long jump, in which American athlete Bob Beamon jumped 8.90 meters. Beamon's world record would stand for 23 years. The 1968 Games also introduced the now-universal Fosbury flop, a technique which won American high jumper Dick Fosbury the gold medal. Politics took <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the medal ceremony for the men's 200 meter dash, where Tommie Smith and John Carlos made a protest gesture on the podium against the segregation in the United States; their political act was condemned within the Olympic Movement, but was praised in the Black Power movement.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the European {{cultural}} elite were discovering African, Oceanic and Native American art. Artists such as Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Picasso were intrigued and {{inspired by the}} stark power and simplicity of styles of those cultures. Around 1906, Picasso, Matisse, Derain and other artists in Paris had acquired an interest in primitivism, Iberian sculpture, African art and tribal masks, {{in part because of}} the compelling works of Paul Gauguin that had suddenly achieved <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the avant-garde circles of Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on Picasso's paintings.|$|E
25|$|The {{works of}} Paul Gauguin had {{achieved}} <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the avant-garde circles of Paris following the powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. Picasso's paintings of monumental figures from 1906 were directly {{influenced by the}} paintings, sculptures and writings of Gauguin. The savage power evoked by Gauguin's work lead directly to Les Demoiselles in 1907. According to Gauguin biographer David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin's work in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio, both a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work, had several of Gauguin's works on hand, {{in an attempt to}} help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Rosy Dreams (Ružové sny) is a 1977 Czechoslovak film. Despite its {{whimsical}} poetic style, it was {{the first}} Central European feature film that put the Romani (Gypsy) community at the <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> a realistic manner. It was also a singular artistic achievement in Slovak and Czechoslovak cinema during the intensely repressive period after the Soviet invasion of 1968 by Dušan Hanák, director of several acclaimed films who maintained the integrity of his vision and style throughout the vagaries of Central European filmmaking {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. In a broader sense, Rosy Dreams was prescient in Central European cinema because it dealt with a minority group whose plight, not discussed openly then, has since become one of the key issues in several Central European societies. The clash of the communities is depicted with the subtle tender attitude inherited from the Czechoslovak New Wave.|$|E

500|$|When Sanchez was {{elevated}} to prominence at USC, {{he found himself}} a symbol of Mexican-American identity and {{a role model for}} younger generations. Sanchez was placed on <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles, home to more than 4.6 million Hispanics, the majority of whom are of Mexican descent. While there had been previous, successful Mexican-American quarterbacks such as Tom Flores, Jim Plunkett, Joe Kapp, Jeff Garcia, Tony Romo, and Marc Bulger, unlike most of his predecessors, Sanchez is a third-generation, full Mexican and none had been embraced to the extent Sanchez was. USC fans began playing up Sanchez's ethnicity by wearing items such as sarapes, lucha libre masks, and homemade [...] "¡Viva Sanchez!" [...] T-shirts. His rise to fame within the Mexican-American community was compared to that of boxer Oscar De La Hoya and baseball pitcher Fernando Valenzuela.|$|E

500|$|Few {{details of}} Luba's pre-Palomar life {{surfaced}} in earlier stories. [...] "Act of Contrition" [...] (1984) flashes {{back to her}} teenage nightclubbing days, and Hernandez recreates a panel from these flashbacks in Poison River. [...] The story traces the first eighteen years of Luba's life, known to long-time Love and Rockets fans as the [...] ("bath-giver") of the fictional Latin American village of Palomar. [...] Luba rarely takes <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the narrative; rather, she provides a focal point around which {{the stories of the}} otherwise unrelated large cast of characters come together. [...] The characters lives are intertwined in ways they are never aware of. [...] An example: a terrorist attack forces Ofelia, Luba, and Ofelia's mother Hilda to flee and permanently injures Ofelia's back; the coordinators of the attack are associates of Peter Rio, whom Luba meets and marries in the city Luba and Hilda eventually make their way to.|$|E
500|$|Canucks' {{general manager}} Pat Quinn {{originally}} intended to draft Bure in the eighth round, but after receiving word the Oilers had similar intentions selected him in the sixth. Following the announcement of Bure's draft, several other team representatives reportedly stormed the Met <b>Center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> Minnesota, where the draft was being held. [...] Formal complaints were filed resulting in {{an investigation into the}} selection. After the pick was deemed illegal by league president John Ziegler in a press release on May 17, 1990, the Canucks appealed the decision, procuring game sheets proving Bure's participation in the additional games with the help of recent Soviet acquisition Igor Larionov. It was not until the eve of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, in which Bure would have been re-entered that the draft choice was upheld. Although Larionov and Fetisov had successfully spearheaded the rebellion against Soviet ice hockey officials in the late 1980s that led to Soviet players joining the NHL, Bure's transfer to the Canucks was met with resistance, and the Soviet authorities forbade the Canucks to contact Bure personally. During the 1991 World Junior Championships, {{he said in an interview}} that he was hesitant to defect for fears the Soviets would make things difficult for his younger brother Valeri Bure, who was 15 at the time and playing in the junior league.|$|E
500|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{described}} Makoto Yuki {{as being}} an initially [...] "ambivalent, broken character" [...] and added that the character's growth took <b>center</b> <b>stage</b> <b>in</b> the film. He also remarked that the film could have [...] "been a very dark, difficult-to-see movie" [...] since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a [...] "visual style all its own". On the flip side, Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only {{the very beginning of}} the Persona 3 story, there was [...] "the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie." [...] Adding that since none of the game's key plot twists are reached, he felt that it was [...] "a very simple, straight-forward movie." [...] Eisenbeis also noted that the film had [...] "more images of teen suicide than you can shake a stick at". The [...] "Evokers" [...] which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger, were likened to guns in this context. Despite not being actual weapons, Eisenbeis stated that [...] "it still looks like they are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments." ...|$|E
