This study was aimed to analyze the competitiveness of Indonesian <b>coffee</b> bean <b>export</b> in international markets. Some policy implication would be derived following the conclusions. In addition, this study was aimed to deliver some arguments referring to organic coffee development as an alternative export development. Data used in this study was time series data ranging from 1995 to 2004 supported with some primary data. The export data were analyzed descriptively and the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) Index employed to analyze the competitiveness of Indonesian <b>coffee</b> bean <b>export.</b> The results of the analysis gave some conclusions, as follows : (1) The <b>export</b> of Indonesian <b>coffee</b> bean was product oriented not market oriented. (2) The Indonesian <b>coffee</b> bean <b>export</b> was characterized with low quality with no premium price, different from that of Vietnam <b>coffee</b> <b>export.</b> (3) Besides quality, the uncompetitive Indonesian <b>coffee</b> <b>export</b> was related to market hegemony by buyers, emerging issue of Ochratoxin A. contamination and high cost economy in export. (4) The competitiveness of Indonesian <b>coffee</b> <b>export</b> was lower than those other countries, such as Columbia, Honduras, Peru, Brazil, and Vietnam. (5) Indonesia still held opportunity to develop organic <b>coffee</b> for <b>export.</b> Some policy implications emerged from the discussion were as follows : (1) The Government should facilitate market development through the provisions of market information and export incentives. (2) The Government should develop and applied national standard of coffee bean referring to that of international, as well as, improve processing technology equipments in the farm level for both wet and dry process. (3) Besides improving quality, the improvement of competitiveness should also be carried out by reducing up to elimination of operational costs before and in exporting ports through the provisions of fiscal and monetary incentives (taxes and interest rates). (4) The development of coffee organic started with socialization of some aspects related to standard and implementation of farming, processing and trade. The Government should facilitate producers and exporters of organic coffee with the provisions of market information and incentives.

40|$|Estimates {{of factors}} {{influencing}} Cameroon's <b>exports</b> of cocoa, <b>coffee</b> and cotton are derived {{in a system}} of equations using the Engle-Granger and Johansen co-integration and error-correction representation procedures. Two co-integrating vectors involving cocoa and <b>coffee</b> <b>exports</b> as endogenous variables are identified in the system while tests for exogeneity of cotton exports are consistent with the independence of cotton from the other two commodities. These findings are corroborated by estimates of a restricted error-correction model which lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that cocoa and <b>coffee</b> <b>exports</b> are indeed determined endogenously to the system and not linked to cotton exports. Statistical significance of the error-correction terms for cocoa and coffee validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these co-integrating vectors. The combined short-run dynamic effect of lagged quantities of cocoa and coffee, export/domestic price ratio and GDP jointly explain changes in exports of cocoa whereas lagged quantities exported do not seem to have a significant short-run dynamic effect on changes in <b>coffee</b> <b>exports...</b>|$|R
