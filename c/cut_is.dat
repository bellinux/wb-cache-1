5|$|If it {{advances}} much faster, {{then the}} tool becomes choked; conversely, if it advances much slower, then an interrupted or zig-zag cut occurs. In practice {{the rate of}} <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> slightly less than the ideal rate so that the load is released on the non-cutting edge of the tool.|$|E
5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial boiling point of about 35°C and a final boiling point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> from an initial boiling point of about 150°C to a final boiling point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> another possible solution.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} Parish church, St Andrew (see Landmarks), {{there are}} several other {{religious}} sites. The Roman Catholic church, Saint Boniface, was built in 1929 by Manuel de las Casas who was descended from the uncle of Bartolomé de las Casas. The Methodist church in New <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> the third chapel on the site. The first was started in 1764 and the current building was built following a fire in 1872 which did serious damage to the chapel built in 1806. The Unitarian chapel on Pound Square dates from 1913 following the collapse of the previous building in 1911. It is the oldest nonconformist congregation in Cullompton. Hebron Evangelical Church was built in 1962. The Baptist Church is the site of a meeting house erected in 1743 on High Street.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into the tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed because of safety concerns about Victoria Bridge. Weston Lock {{on the outskirts of}} Bath is in what now forms the Newbridge. Weston <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> a man made channel, opened in 1727, for boats to approach and pass through Weston Lock, which created an island between the cut and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Final <b>Cut</b> <b>is</b> {{the twelfth}} studio album by the English {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, released on 21 March 1983 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and on 2 April by Columbia Records in the United States. It was Pink Floyd's last studio album to include founding member, bass guitarist and songwriter Roger Waters, and their only album {{on which he}} alone is credited for writing and composition. It was also the only Pink Floyd album that does not feature keyboardist Richard Wright. Waters originally planned The Final Cut as a soundtrack album for the 1982 film Pink Floyd – The Wall. With {{the onset of the}} Falklands War, he rewrote it as a concept album, exploring what he considered the betrayal of his father, who died serving in the Second World War. Waters sings most of the lyrics; lead guitarist David Gilmour provides lead vocals on only one track. The packaging, also designed by Waters, reflects the album's war theme.|$|E

5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality of the <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions). A large, flawless diamond {{is known as a}} paragon.|$|E

Such scenes include additional sequences with Donnie and his parents, Donnie's therapist Dr Thurman telling him that his drugs are placebos, and his English teacher Karen Pomeroy teaching Watership Down to her class. Close-up shots of Donnie's eyeballs were included, as well as footage of waves crashing on a beach, and a scene in which Donnie and Gretchen play the 1986 arcade game Out Run.|$|E

25|$|A <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a cross-batted shot {{played at}} a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batsman makes {{contact with the}} ball as it draws {{alongside}} or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler's pace to divert the ball. A square <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late <b>cut</b> <b>is</b> played as or after the ball passes the batsman's body and is hit towards third man. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot, but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played {{with the face of}} the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (with the face of the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving a chance for the batsman to be caught.|$|E
