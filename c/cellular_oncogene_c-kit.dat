40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by excessive B lymphocyte proliferation (1) and the spontaneous production of autoantibodies reactive {{with a variety}} of self antigens (1). Studies (2, 3) involving the families of patients with SLE have shown that genetic factors {{play a role in the}} development of this disorder.

40|$|Pharmacologic {{elevation}} of cyclic AMP (cAMP) promotes growth arrest and differentiation {{in a variety}} of transformed mammalian cells, including the HL- 60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line. However, mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. Because <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> play a pivotal role in regulating proliferation and differentiation, we examined whether cAMP-promoted differentiation of HL- 60 was preceded by a decrease in the expression of c-myc, a <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogene</b> both amplified and constitutively expressed in HL- 60. We find that cyclic AMP elevation in HL- 60 caused by three different pharmacologic regimens is followed by an abrupt, greater than 90 % decrease in steady state c-myc mRNA levels within 3 h, well before detectable changes in proliferation and differentiation. This decrease, which occurs despite protein synthetic blockade, is attributable to transcriptional down-regulation of c-myc and is accompanied by changes in chromatin structure near c-myc promoter sites. Our findings establish that cAMP, a ubiquitous intracellular regulatory messenger previously known only to enhance gene transcriptional activity in higher eukaryotic cells, can also suppress transcription of a <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogene,</b> thereby suggesting a potential mechanism for cAMP-promoted differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Oral {{cancer is}} the {{cancerous}} tissue growth located in the oral cavity. It may arise as a primary lesion originating {{in any of the}} oral tissues, by metastasis from a distant site of origin, or by extension from a neighboring anatomic struc-ture, such as the nasal cavity or the maxillary sinus. Smoking and other tobacco use are associated with about 75 percent of oral cancer cases. Alcohol use is another high-risk activity associated with oral cancer. Infection with human papillo-mavirus (HPV), particularly type 16 (there are over 120 types), is a known risk factor and independent causative factor for oral cancer. Oncogenes, gain-of-function mutations of highly regulated normal cellular counterparts (proto-oncogenes), are likely involved in the initiation and progression of oral neoplasia. <b>Cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> were initially discovered by the ability of tumor cell DNA to induce transformation in gene transfer assays. Mechanisms of activation of these <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> include point mutations and DNA re-arrangements. Several of these <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> are homologs of retroviral oncogenes (e. g., the ras genes); others are new oncogenes.

40|$|The {{structure}} and the expression of 11 <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> (protooncogenes) were analyzed in primary cells from 20 acute lymphocytic (ALL) and 31 acute myelogenous (AML) leukemia patients. Neoplastic cells, obtained prior to initiation of therapy, were purified and classified, {{on the basis of}} both surface antigen pattern and morphology, into pre-B, B, and T ALL and M 1 -M 5 AML. RNA was extracted and analyzed for expression of <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> coding for nuclear proteins (c-myc, c-myb, c-fos), the beta-chain of platelet-derived growth factor (c-sis), growth factor receptors or related proteins (c-src, c-abl, c-fes, c-erbB), or putative intermediate transducers of mitogenic signals (c-Ha-ras, c-Ki-ras, c-N-ras). Quantitative analysis of total RNA was carried out by dot blot hybridization to specific cDNA or genomic probes. Number and size of transcripts were evaluated by blot hybridization of electrophoretically fractionated poly(A) + RNA. Expression of c-myc and c-myb was detected in all leukemic cells at variable levels and was characterized by well-defined patterns within ALL subtypes. Conversely, significant levels of c-fos transcripts were detected only in myelomonocytic (M 4) and monocytic (M 5) leukemias. Among the "src-family," c-fes was expressed more in AML than ALL, and c-abl was expressed at variable but not elevated levels in all leukemia types. c-Ha-ras was uniformly expressed at low levels, as in non-neoplastic cells. c-Ki-ras transcription was detected only in T ALL; N-ras expression was barely demonstrable. The structure of these protooncogenes was not grossly modified, as evaluated by Southern analysis, except for c-myc rearrangement in B ALL. These studies indicate that <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogene</b> expression in specific subtypes of leukemic cells may relate to either the proliferative activity (c-myc, c-myb) or the differentiation state (c-fos) of the cells, or possibly to expression of receptors for putative hemopoiesis-related growth factors (c-fes, c-abl).

Results of transcription assays indicated that the rapid increase in RNA levels for the above-noted oncogenes was controlled {{at the transcriptional level}} and was related to enhanced transcription. The maximum rates of transcription for c-jun and c-fos genes occurred at 40 min postinfection, while for the c-myc gene the maximum rate occurred at about 60 min.

Another plasma cell malignancy, multiple myeloma (MM), arising spontaneously in the ageing C 57 BL/KaLwRij mice, was investigated in order to see whether the MM cells contain c-myc abnormalities of the MPC or RIC type. Rearrangement of the c-myc oncogene was found in the bone marrow cells only in 5 T 2 MM transplantation line in a mouse of the 24 th generation and in none of the seven other MM of the 5 T series which were of earlier generations. Since the mouse 5 T MM resembles the human MM very closely, including the absence of consistent structural c-myc oncogene abnormalities, it can serve as a useful experimental model for studies on the aetiopathogenesis of this disease.

40|$|Two {{cell lines}} (COLO 201 and COLO 205) derived {{independently}} {{from a single}} adenocarcinoma of the human colon each harbored an approximately 10 -fold amplification of the <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogene</b> c-myb and a proportional abundance of the 4 -kilobase mRNA derived from c-myb. By contrast, expression of c-myb could not be detected in cells {{from a variety of}} other solid tumors, including other colon carcinomas. Analysis of the amplified DNA with restriction endonucleases failed to reveal any topographical abnormalities within c-myb. Neither COLO 201 nor COLO 205 carry the double minute chromosomes and homogeneously staining regions of chromosomes that frequently serve as karyotypic signatures of amplified DNA. Instead, amplified c-myb is carried on what appear to be disomic or trisomic copies of the same anomalous marker chromosome that is characteristic of both COLO 201 and COLO 205. The karyological origin of this abnormal chromosome is not presently apparent. Our findings show c-myb expression by cells outside of the hemopoietic lineage, raise the possibility that amplification and/or ectopic expression of c-myb {{may have contributed to the}} genesis of the tumor from which the cells of COLO 201 and COLO 205 arose, and suggest that amplification of <b>cellular</b> <b>oncogenes</b> may be a more common factor in tumorigenesis than might have been suspected from available karyological data...|$|R
