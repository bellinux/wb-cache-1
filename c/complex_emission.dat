Both have important spectral features in the Thermal InfraRed (TIR) that can be studied by remote sensing, with NH 3 allowing discrimination of husbandry from other CH 4 sources. Airborne hyperspectral imagery was collected for the Chino Dairy Complex in the Los Angeles Basin {{as well as in}} situ CH 4, carbon dioxide (CO 2) and NH 3 data. TIR data showed good spatial agreement with in situ measurements and showed significant emissions heterogeneity between dairies. Airborne remote sensing mapped plume transport for ∼ 20  km downwind, documenting topographic effects on plume advection. Repeated multiple gas in situ measurements showed that emissions were persistent on half-year timescales. Inversion of one dairy plume found annual emissions of 4. 1  ×  105  kg CH 4, 2. 2  ×  105  kg NH 3, and 2. 3  ×  107  kg CO 2, suggesting 2300, 4000, and 2100 head of cattle, respectively, and Chino Dairy <b>Complex</b> <b>emissions</b> of 42  Gg CH 4 and 8. 4  Gg NH 3 implying ∼ 200 k cows, ∼ 30 % more than Peischl et al.

In this paper we propose an extended pooling problem to maximize the profit of blending reformulated gasoline on a predetermined network structure of feed stocks, intermediate storage tanks, and gasoline products subject to applicable environmental standards. A mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is introduced which is nonconvex due to the presence of bilinear, polynomial, and fractional power terms. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) relaxation of the extended pooling problem is proposed and we introduce several test cases from small to medium to large scale and solve them to global optimality. The large-scale test case involves 14 feed stocks, 5 pools, and 10 products and consists of 1104 continuous variables, 150 binary variables, and 640 nonlinear terms.

40|$|Abstract. We present here an {{analysis}} of the X-ray properties of a sample of LINER galaxies observed with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI instruments. A spatial analysis shows that the bulk of the X-ray emission is consistent with arising from a point source; some extended emission appears at weak emission levels. The X-ray spectra are formally best described by a powerlaw with photon index Γx ≈ − 2 or thermal emission from a Raymond-Smith plasma with highly subsolar abundances (Z ≤ 0. 1). Several emission mechanisms that might contribute to the observed X-ray spectra are discussed. In particular, we take the very subsolar abundances derived from Raymond-Smith fits as an indication of a more <b>complex</b> <b>emission</b> mechanism, like the presence of a second hard component or plasma out of equilibrium. 1...|$|E
30|$|At broad scales, fire {{detection}} systems that include multiple fires, such as the MODIS {{fire detection}} or burned area products, are commonly used (Knorr et al. 2012). Based on our results, the Tripod Fire <b>Complex</b> <b>emissions</b> would not {{be included in a}} large-scale emissions assessment if the MODIS burned area product were used as the fire area source of information (the Tripod Fire Complex burn area was characterized as snow or high aerosol; therefore, no fire was recorded in the system). Moreover, if the MODIS fire detection product were used to identify fire size and location, the emissions for the Tripod Fire Complex would be overestimated because fire size was overestimated by the fire detect product when compared with the NIFC fire perimeter data. Overestimating fire size using MODIS fire detection data is due, at least in part, to our assumption that each fire detect burned an entire pixel (Soja et al. 2006). Omitting fires or overestimating fire size will greatly influence the amount of fuel provided to the fuel consumption models, and under- or over-estimates of fuel consumption will directly lead to under- or over-estimating smoke emissions.|$|R
