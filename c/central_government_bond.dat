40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a novel {{approach to}} identify soft budget constraint expectations, exploiting the idea that financial investors rationally incorporate in sub-national bond prices also expectations of future bailouts by the central government. We consider as a testing ground the municipal bond market in Italy. We first build an original dataset of all the 1 388 bond issuances from 1996 (the year when the national legislation provided an organic discipline for municipal bonds) to 2011, involving 529 cities out of about 8 000. We then regress bond yields at issuance on bond characteristics, <b>central</b> <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> yields, and three proxies for bailout expectations on soft budget constraints (an index of vertical fiscal imbalance and of central government budget tightness, plus a dummy for the city being subject to the Domestic Stability Pact). Our results suggest that soft budget constraint problems arise frequently, especially in small cities and those located in the poorer South...|$|E

40|$|We analyse {{the effects}} of <b>central</b> bank <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> {{purchases}} in an estimated DSGE model for the euro area. In the model, central bank asset purchases are relevant {{in so far as}} agency costs distort banks' asset allocation between loans and bonds, and households face transaction costs when trading <b>government</b> <b>bonds.</b> Such frictions in the banking sector induce inefficient time-variation in the term premia and allow for a credit channel of <b>central</b> bank <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> purchases. Considering ad hoc asset purchase programmes like the one implemented by the ECB, we show that their macroeconomic multipliers get stronger when the lower bound on the policy rate becomes binding and when the purchasing path is fully communicated and anticipated by the agents. From a more normative standpoint, interest rate policy and asset purchases feature strong strategic complementarities during both normal and crisis times. In an environment when nominal interest rates reach their effective lower bound, optimal monetary policy is to keep the policy rate low for a longer period in time and to engage in asset purchases. Our results also point to a clear sequencing of the exit strategy, first stopping the asset purchases and later raising the policy rate. In terms of macroeconomic stabilisation, optimal asset purchase strategies deliver sizeable benefits and have the potential to largely offset the costs of the lower bound on the policy rate...|$|R

30|$|To promote mine reclamation, China {{implemented}} a bonding system in 1998 in Zhejiang province. By 2013, all 31 provinces (including autonomous regions or municipalities that are {{directly under the}} <b>central</b> <b>government)</b> have established <b>bond</b> systems.

Therefore, the older bonding programs of other countries may provide successful options and practices for reclamation bonds in China.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{a policy}} {{often used to}} defend a {{currency}} peg: raising short-term interest rates. The rationale for this policy is to stem demand for foreign reserves. Yet, this mechanism is absent from most monetary models. This paper develops a general equilibrium model with asset market frictions where this policy can be effective. The friction I emphasize {{is the same as}} in Lucas (1990) : money is required for asset transactions. When the government raises domestic interest rates, agents want to increase their holdings of domestic currency in order to acquire more domestic-currency-denominated assets. Thus, agents do not run on the reserves of the central bank, and the peg survives. A key implication of the model is that an interest rate defense can always be successful, but at great costs for domestic agents. Hence the reluctance of governments to sustain this policy for long periods of time.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} the impact of debt issued by one government in a monetary union on the yields of bonds issued by other governments in the union. These debt spillovers may occur if there is a risk of monetary accommodation, implicit or explicit inter-jurisdictional bailout provisions, or interdependent revenue sources. The analysis empirically distinguishes between two channels through which debt spillovers may affect bond yields: currency depreciation risk and default risk. Data on the yields of individual Canadian provincial <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> for the period 1983 - 2003 are employed. No evidence is found of debt spillover effects between provinces, but a 1 percentage point increase in the <b>central</b> <b>government’s</b> debt to GDP ratio raises the yield on provincial <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> by 4. 3 basis points — 3. 0 basis points by increasing the expected depreciation rate of the Canadian dollar and 1. 3 basis points by raising the risk of provincial government default. These results imply that a rise in the Canadian <b>central</b> <b>government</b> debt to GDP ratio from. 25 to. 58, equivalent to the rise that occurred between 1983 and 1995, would lead to an increase in provincial <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> yields of 142 basis points...|$|R

40|$|During an {{economic}} transition from socialism, market exchange replaces re-distribution. We study firm decisions to enter product markets {{to understand the}} factors that influence this process. Managers in Chinese State Owned Enter-prises operated within institutional constraints to make strategic decisions, and state intervention shaped which factors were salient. Firms financed through <b>central</b> <b>government</b> and <b>bond</b> issues relied less on markets. Firms funded through local government moved into markets faster; firms funded by banks were initially faster to markets but slower to markets after bank reform shifted lending policies. Thus, the accessibility, flexibility, and stability of financing shaped decisions about market entrance. KEY WORDS: Chinese transition; organizational theory; market development; economic sociology. A central component of economic transition from state socialism is the replacement of centrally controlled redistribution by market coordination of economic exchange. Accordingly, the development of markets for producer goods has been a dominant feature of China’s transformation. Market ex-change of producer goods occurred prior to reform, but it usually involved only small, rural firms and affected a small fraction of total producer good purchases (Wong, 1986). Economic reform allowed firms to begin to en-gage in market exchange of producer goods for the first time (Naughton, 1995 : 113).

5000|$|An {{important}} part of the bond market is the <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> market, because of its size and liquidity. <b>Government</b> <b>bonds</b> are often used to compare other bonds to measure credit risk. Because of the inverse relationship between bond valuation and interest rates (or yields), the bond market is often used to indicate changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve, the measure of [...] "cost of funding". The yield on <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> in low risk countries such as the United States or Germany is thought to indicate a risk-free rate of default. [...] Other bonds denominated in the same currencies (U.S. Dollars or Euros) will typically have higher yields, in large part because other borrowers are more likely than the U.S. or German <b>Central</b> <b>Governments</b> to default, and the losses to investors in the case of default are expected to be higher.

30|$|From {{most of the}} {{estimated}} results from Formula (2), the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets are positively correlated with stock markets in the same country during non-crisis periods. Furthermore, their interdependence becomes negative {{for most of the}} 39 countries during crisis periods, which is consistent with the definition of flight to quality. Unlike the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets, the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets are negatively correlated with the stock markets. This pattern is more significant for developed markets; however, the interdependence between the stock markets and the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets becomes positive for most countries during crisis periods. This is noteworthy, since the Subprime Crisis and the European Debt Crisis are not only financial crises, but also economic crises. Once a depression appears, the quality of the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> will be more affected than the short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> because short-term <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are more liquid. The performance of the developed American market is different from most of the other regions. The short-term and the long-term <b>government</b> <b>bond</b> markets are both negatively dependent on the stock markets, since America dominates the market and its <b>government</b> <b>bonds</b> are regarded as the country’s least risky financial asset, even though the U.S. was the source of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.
