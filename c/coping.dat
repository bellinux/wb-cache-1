5|$|In 1896, <b>Cope</b> began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, <b>Cope's</b> university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. <b>Cope</b> at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. <b>Cope</b> often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by <b>Cope's</b> actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in <b>Cope's</b> health. <b>Cope</b> went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited <b>Cope</b> on April 5, inquiring about <b>Cope's</b> health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of <b>Cope's</b> illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition <b>Cope</b> delivered lectures from his bed. <b>Cope</b> died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|R

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when <b>coping</b> with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for <b>coping</b> with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for <b>coping</b> with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

25|$|Among {{heterosexual}} couples <b>coping</b> with infertility, emotional approach <b>coping</b> predicted decreased {{depressive symptoms}} for both {{members of the}} couple after an unsuccessful insemination attempt. Emotional approach <b>coping</b> may also confer benefits for partners.

25|$|Individual differences, such as {{skill at}} {{engaging}} active <b>coping</b> techniques and comfort with expressing emotions, may modify {{the tendency to}} successfully employ emotional approach <b>coping.</b> Individuals high in perceived emotional intelligence may also {{be more likely to}} use emotional approach <b>coping</b> skillfully. Holding unrealistic perceptions of control may make the use of <b>coping</b> through emotional approach less likely because expressing and processing emotions could lead to evaluations that result in acknowledgement of illusions of control. Personality attributes, such as hope, can also moderate the effectiveness of emotional approach <b>coping.</b> Women with breast cancer who were high in hope and reported <b>coping</b> with emotional expression, had fewer medical appointments for cancer-related complaints, enhanced physical health and decreased distress compared to women who did not cope using emotional expression.|$|E

5|$|<b>Cope</b> {{sold his}} {{collections}} to the American Museum of Natural History in 1895; his set of 10,000American fossil mammals sold for $32,000, lower than <b>Cope's</b> asking price of $50,000.

While his collection contained more than 13,000specimens, <b>Cope's</b> fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a milliondollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of <b>Cope's</b> ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid on any of <b>Cope's</b> sales due to bad blood between <b>Cope</b> and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of <b>Cope's</b> major finds left the city. <b>Cope's</b> proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf.|$|R
25|$|The {{stressor}} and the individual's {{appraisal of}} the stressor may determine the effectiveness of emotional approach <b>coping</b> as a mechanism for managing stress. An appraisal of a stressful situation as uncontrollable may make emotional approach <b>coping</b> an advantageous <b>coping</b> mechanism. In fact, one study of undergraduates shows that {{when faced with a}} stressor individuals appraise as more uncontrollable, {{they are more likely to}} endorse using emotional approach <b>coping</b> to manage it.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} to suggest that the utility of emotional approach <b>coping</b> varies by gender. In a longitudinal study, emotional approach <b>coping</b> was found to predict increased life satisfaction and decreased depressive symptoms over time in women; however, in men, emotional approach <b>coping</b> predicted poorer adjustment over time. Some samples have also found that women report using emotional processing and expression more than men. However, research of infertile couples found no differences in the utility of emotional approach <b>coping</b> for men and women.|$|E
25|$|Negative <b>coping</b> {{responses}} of procrastinating individuals {{tend to be}} avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant <b>coping</b> is employed to reduce stress (and cognitive dissonance) associated with putting off intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators at their first knowledge of achievable goals. There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian defense mechanisms, <b>coping</b> styles and self-handicapping.|$|E
