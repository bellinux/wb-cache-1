50|$|<b>Cypenamine</b> (INN, BAN), or <b>cypenamine</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN), {{also known}} as 2-phenylcyclopentylamine, is a psychostimulant drug which was developed by a group at the William S. Merrell Chemical Company in the 1940s. It is currently known only in scientific research {{and has never been}} developed for market use. <b>Cypenamine</b> is currently legal throughout the entire world, and though its chemical structure has a vague similarity to certain controlled stimulants like fencamfamine, it is likely that it is too distant for it to be considered an illicit analogue under the United States Federal Analogue Act of the Controlled Substances Act.|$|E
50|$|Cycloalkylamines are {{chemical}} compounds featuring a cycloalkyl group and an amine. Some examples include propylhexedrine, cyclopentamine, <b>cypenamine,</b> and tranylcypromine.|$|E
50|$|The {{racemate}} (±)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine {{mixture of}} (1R,2S)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine is {{the active ingredient}} of <b>cypenamine.</b> Furthermore, the kinetic resolution of (±)-trans-2-phenylcyclopentan-1-amine by lipase B from Candida antarctica may effectivily performed by an aminolysis reaction.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cypenamine</b> is a homolog of tranylcypromine, {{containing}} {{an expanded}} alicyclic ring that is two methylene units {{larger than the}} highly strained/reactive cyclopropane. The cyclohexane homologue has been reported, although the LD50s were all less than for plain amphetamine, {{it was still a}} functional stimulant.|$|E
