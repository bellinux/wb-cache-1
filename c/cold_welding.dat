40|$|This is an {{overview}} of a current three-year project for the Cooperative Research Centre for Welded Structures entitled “Integrity of High Energy Piping”. The results of a performance evaluation conducted on an emergency <b>cold</b> <b>weld</b> (controlled deposition temperbead, TB) repair applied to a 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel header using the {{manual metal arc welding}} (MMAW) process are described. With repair rather than replace being a far more viable option, welding is increasingly used for performing repairs, replacements, retrofits and modifications to elevated temperature plants. However, with the considerable cost and time involved with performing conventional post weld heat-treatment (PWHT) repairs, in today’s economic environment utility owners are increasingly forced to turn toward other alternatives, such as <b>cold</b> <b>weld</b> repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs etc to achieve tempering of the HAZ. However, much of the research conducted on these repair techniques has used accelerated high temperature creep testing to demonstrate their integrity. How well this reflects their real-life performance is unknown. Therefore this study provides an opportunity to evaluate the effects of service exposure on the performance of an emergency <b>cold</b> <b>weld</b> repair. © 2003, The Institute of Materials Engineering Australasia Ltd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAISI Type 304 L {{austenitic}} stainless steels are extensively used in industries, and welding is an indispensable tool used for joining these materials. In a multi-pass weld, the development of residual stress {{to a large extent}} depends on the response of the weld metal, heat affected zone and parent material to complex thermo-mechanical cycles during welding. Earlier researchers on this area used either mechanical tensioning or heat treatment to modify the residual stress distribution in and around the weld. In this research, microstructural refinement with modification of residual stress state was attempted by using high pressure cold rolling followed by laser processing in 12 mm thick 304 L {{austenitic stainless}} steels which is a novel technique. The hardening of the weld metal was evaluated after <b>welding,</b> post <b>weld</b> <b>cold</b> rolling, and post <b>weld</b> <b>cold</b> rolling followed by laser processing. The residual stress was determined non-destructively by using neutron diffraction. Residual stress analysis show that post <b>weld</b> <b>cold</b> rolling was effective in modifying the longitudinal residual stress distribution throughout the entire thickness. Post <b>weld</b> <b>cold</b> rolling followed by laser processing performed in this research was to induce recrystallization of the cold rolled grains.
