5|$|The {{biological}} and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated {{based upon the}} estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the rate of cooling of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as <b>climate</b> <b>engineering,</b> which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last {{for up to five}} million years. In turn, technology may result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>engineering,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as geoengineering, also known as climate intervention, There is substantial agreement among scientists that <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> cannot substitute for climate change mitigation. Some approaches might be used as accompanying measures to sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that all types of measures for addressing climate change have economic, political, or physical limitations, some <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> approaches might eventually be used as part of an ensemble of measures. Research on costs, benefits, and various types of risks of most <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> approaches is at an early stage and their understanding needs to improve to judge their adequacy and feasibility.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{regardless}} of the economic, scientific and technical aspects, the difficulty of achieving concerted political action on global warming requires other approaches. Those arguing political expediency say the difficulty of achieving meaningful emissions cuts and the effective failure of the Kyoto Protocol demonstrate the practical difficulties of achieving carbon dioxide emissions reduction by the agreement of the international community. However, others point to support for <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> proposals among think tanks with a history of global warming skepticism and opposition to emissions reductions as evidence that the prospect of <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> is itself already politicized and being promoted as part of an argument against the need for (and viability of) emissions reductions; that, rather than <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> being a solution to the difficulties of emissions reductions, the prospect of <b>climate</b> <b>engineering</b> is being used as part of an argument to stall emissions reductions in the first place.|$|E

25|$|Most of what {{is known}} about the {{suggested}} techniques is based on laboratory experiments, observations of natural phenomena, and on computer modelling techniques.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the outcomes of}} an applied research project aimed at developing a contemporary, environmentally sustainable housing approach that takes its lead from the qualities and attributes of the Queensland vernacular timber housing, {{and that can be}} widely adopted in a similar way to its traditional predecessor. There was no intention to revive the original ‘Queenslander’ house but to build on the qualities which have made the timber house such an attractive and sustainable housing typology to develop a contemporary timber design vocabulary for project homes in Queensland. The design-led multi-disciplinary project took a critical approach to identifying the optimum solution that can be obtained by combining available building materials with market appeal and affordability, architectural design for lifestyle in Australian subtropical and tropical <b>climates,</b> <b>engineering</b> design, and environmental performance. It was also imperative that the timber systems developed be able to be adopted by the house building industry with minimal change to the conventional trade-based process of project delivery. The research included a review of available timber products including composite products, and a review of regulatory issues which impact on the use of timber in residential construction. The findings of the reviews were combined with environmental design objectives to develop a new construction system for integrating timber products in residential design...|$|R
40|$|<b>Climate</b> {{warming and}} <b>engineering</b> {{activities}} have various {{impacts on the}} thermal regime of permafrost in alpine ecosystems of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Using recent observations of permafrost thermal regimes along the Qinghai–Tibet highway and railway, the changes of such regimes beneath embankments constructed in alpine meadows and steppes are studied. The results show that alpine meadows on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau can have a controlling role among engineering construction effects on permafrost beneath embankments. As before railway construction, the artificial permafrost table (APT) beneath embankments is not only affected by <b>climate</b> change and <b>engineering</b> activities but is also controlled by alpine ecosystems. However, the change rate of APT is not dependent on ecosystem type, which is predominantly affected by <b>climate</b> change and <b>engineering</b> activities. Instead, the rate is mainly related to cooling effects of railway ballast and heat absorption effects of asphalt pavement. No large difference between alpine and steppe can be identified regarding the variation of soil temperature beneath embankments, but this difference is readily identified in the variation of mean annual soil temperature with depth. The vegetation layer in alpine meadows has an insulation role among engineering activity effects on permafrost beneath embankments, but this insulation gradually disappears because the layer decays and compresses over time. On the whole, this layer is advantageous for alleviating permafrost temperature rise in the short term, but its effect gradually weakens in the long term...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe mini-symposium was {{organized}} {{in collaboration with}} Kazuyoshi Nishijima (Kyoto University, Japan) and Mark Stewart (The University of Newcastle, Australia). The seven papers presented in this special issue were selected from among 17 technical papers originally submitted to the mini-symposium. Climate projections announce significant future climate changes. Since civil infrastructure has been designed against past climate conditions, climate changecould alsoaffect its serviceability and safety. Therefore, a comprehensive management of climate change risks should consider these new/extreme environmental conditions {{in order to reduce}} potential loss of life and assets. This special issuepresentsdifferent types of hazards/actions (floods, sea level rise, extreme wind events, and physical and chemical actions affecting structural durability) for various types of infrastructure (housing, dams, reinforced concrete structures, and energy and water supply networks). Taking into account that climate change consequences depend on design standards and exposure conditions of given locations, this special issue also includes applications to infrastructure located in several countries: Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Africa and United Kingdom. These applications and studies cover the following topics: - risk assessment of climate change effects on civil infrastructure, - cost-effectiveness and economic viability of climate adaptation technology and engineering measures, - simplified <b>climate</b> models for <b>engineering</b> purposes, and - discussions on the needs for updating engineering standards and processes.
