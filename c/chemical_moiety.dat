The precision is because reactions {{are confined to}} the surface containing an active <b>chemical</b> <b>moiety</b> that reacts with a precursor; this limits thickness to one monolayer. This self-limiting growth is essential for complete coatings since deposition does not inhibit the access by other polymeric units to non-coated sites.

In practice ALD may require a few cycles in order to achieve the desired coverage and can result in varied morphologies such as islands, isolated crystallites, or nanoparticles.

5000|$|A {{promising}} {{strategy for}} the construction of DNA-encoded libraries is represented by the use of multifunctional building blocks covalently conjugate to an oligonucleotide serving as a “core structure” for library synthesis. In a ‘pool-and-split’ fashion a set of multifunctional scaffolds undergo orthogonal reactions with series of suitable reactive partners. Following each reaction step, the identity of the modification is encoded by an enzymatic addition of DNA segment to the original DNA “core structure”. The use of N-protected amino acids covalently attached to a DNA fragment allow, after a suitable deprotection step, a further amide bond formation with a series of carboxylic acids or a reductive amination with aldehydes. Similarly, diene carboxylic acids used as scaffolds for library construction at the 5’-end of amino modified oligonucleotide, could be subjected to a Diels-Alder reaction with a variety of maleimide derivatives. After completion of the desired reaction step, the identity of the <b>chemical</b> <b>moiety</b> added to the oligonucleotide is established by the annealing of a partially complementary oligonucleotide and by a subsequent Klenow fill-in DNA-polymerization, yielding a double stranded DNA fragment. The synthetic and encoding strategies described above enable the facile construction of DNA-encoded libraries of a size up to 104 member compounds carrying two sets of “building blocks”. However the stepwise addition of at least three independent sets of chemical moieties to a tri-functional core building block for the construction and encoding of a very large DNA-encoded library (comprising up to 106 compounds) can also be envisaged.(Fig.2) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have {{developed}} a method of searching for similar spatial arrangements of atoms around a given <b>chemical</b> <b>moiety</b> in proteins that bind a common ligand. The first step in this method is to consider a set of atoms that closely surround a given <b>chemical</b> <b>moiety.</b> Then, to compare the spatial arrangements of such surrounding atoms in different proteins, they are translated and rotated so that the chemical moieties are superposed on each other. Spatial arrangements of surrounding atoms {{in a pair of}} pro-teins are judged to be similar, when there are many corre-sponding atoms occupying similar spatial positions. Be-cause the method focuses on the arrangements of surround-ing atoms, it can detect structural similarities of binding sites in proteins that are dissimilar in their amino acid sequences or in their chain folds. We have applied this method to identify modes of nucleotide base recognition by proteins. An all-against-all comparison of the arrange-ments of atoms surrounding adenine moieties revealed an unexpected structural similarity between protein kinases, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK), and casein ki-nase- 1 (CK 1), and D-Ala:D-Ala ligase (DD-ligase) at their adenine-binding sites, despite a lack of similarity in their chain folds. The similar local structure consists of a four-residue segment and three sequentially separated residues. In particular the four-residue segments of these enzymes were found to have nearly identical conformations in their backbone parts, which are involved in the recognition of adenine. This common local structure was also found in substrate-free three-dimensional structures of other pro-teins that are similar to DD-ligase in the chain fold and of other protein kinases. As the proteins with different folds were found to share a common local structure, these pro-teins seem to constitute a remarkable example of conver-gent evolution for the same recognition mechanism.
