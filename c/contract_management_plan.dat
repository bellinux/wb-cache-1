ISPL is a unique Information Technology method because where most other Information Technology methods and frameworks focus on development (e.g. DSDM, RUP), ISPL focuses purely on the procurement of information services.The target audience for ISPL consists of procurement managers, acquisition managers, programme managers, contract managers, facilities managers, service level managers, and project managers in the IT (Information Technology) area. Because of ISPL’s focus on procurement it is very suitable to be used with ITIL (for IT Service Management) and PRINCE2 (for Project Management).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Among the {{questions}} that ecosystem-based management raises for economists is how to partition uses of the many biological, chemical and physical attributes of marine ecosystems into sets of property rights that undergird total ocean wealth. An elemental basis of property rights for fisheries involves the interplay between ecological and technological interactions, including sideeffects (externalities), and transaction costs. Fisheries management typically divides ownership by species. Divided ownership is efficient where production requires specialized skills and technologies and/or where interactions are negligible. When damages caused by side-effects are substantial, divided ownership might be used either by attenuating (e. g., gear restrictions) or excluding (e. g., zoning) a subset of attribute rights, provided that the opportunity (reduced output) and transaction costs of restrictions/exclusions are less than damages in their absence. However, uncertainty about resource dynamics, the recurrent nature of interactions, the complexity of numerous contractual stipulations owing to multi-attribute resources, and practical enforcement problems make it likely that the transaction costs of divided ownership are great at this time. Alternatively, property rights could be bundled into sets wherein tradeoffs across margins which promote the total wealth of a multi-attribute, common pool asset would be decided internally by a governance organization. Bundled sets of property rights influence the choice of organizational structures (government agency, commons, unitization of firms) and <b>contracts</b> (fishery <b>management</b> <b>plans,</b> rules, private <b>contracts).</b> The discussion is illustrated with examples from U. S. fisheries in the Northeast Region...|$|R

One part of this quality assurance scheme is identifying Critical Success Factors (CSF) and Potential Pitfalls (PP) early during the Front-End Assessment. This paper reviews the conceptual framework and theory of CSFs and PP, presents what have been learned {{so far from the}} data collected through the quality assurance scheme and looks into how the theoretical background relates to the findings. In some cases it was found that what was declared as CSFs were associated to PPs when they are lacking. It was also found that what was considered CSF in some projects was, in opposite words, considered as PP in other projects. That is, evidences from the case studies largely showed that lack of Critical Success Factors are considered Potential Pitfall and vice versa. Besides, Project Organization, <b>Contract</b> <b>Management,</b> Project <b>Planning</b> and Controlling, and Stakeholder Management, were found highly associated to these CSFs and PPs, both in literature and in the case studies. However Top Management Support, External conditions such as market & politics were given less importance in the case studies than in literature.

Therefore, this paper aims to appraise the best practices of successful construction projects from the <b>contract</b> <b>management</b> perspective rather than the project management perspective alone. Best-practised <b>contract</b> <b>management</b> is defined as a certified statement of effective contract administration procedures through systematically excellent service culture, where an on-time and within-budget construction is a major criterion of project success and client satisfaction as a whole. Via comprehensive literature review, this paper materializes its objectives of reviewing the <b>contract</b> <b>management</b> concepts in construction projects, assessing the formal process of <b>contract</b> <b>management</b> carried out by the contracting parties in ensuring the successful delivery of the construction project and proposing the strategies in improving the current <b>contract</b> <b>management</b> process for construction project.

Managing contracts in construction organization is cumbersome due to multiple stakeholders being involved in the process, Hence the need for managing the contracts in a systematic and organized manner. Electronic <b>Contract</b> <b>Management</b> forms an aid to managing multiple contracts in a construction organization. Electronic <b>contract</b> <b>management</b> is a system having constant process of ensuring that a contract is well structured and reviewed appropriately. This system will streamline the business process by reducing the time taken to create, review, execute, and approve contracts. This in turn would ease activities like tracking, central storage of contract documents, and reduction in disputes.
