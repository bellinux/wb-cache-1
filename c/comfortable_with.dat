Valve decided to develop Episode One in-house, as opposed to working with outside contractors as with previous expansions, because the company was already <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the technology and construction tools of Half-Life 2.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded smoothly without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which would have made Harvey captain.

When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, who was still offering to drop himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, Burnet {{decided that}} {{research}} at the Institute should focus on immunology. Burnet reached the decision unilaterally, leaving many of the research staff disillusioned and feeling the action was arrogant; for Burnet's part he was <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the decision as he thought it to be effective. Many virologists left the Institute and settled the Australian National University's John Curtin School of Medical Research. After 1957 all new staff and students at the Institute worked on immunological problems; Burnet was involved in work relating to autoimmune diseases and the graft-versus-host reaction, and increasingly in theoretical studies of immunology, immunological surveillance and cancer.|$|E

In January 1950, Acheson replaced Kennan with Nitze, who was much more <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> the calculus of military power. Afterwards, Kennan accepted an appointment as Visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study from fellow moderate Robert Oppenheimer, Director of the Institute.|$|E

June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for {{encouraging}} him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.

Feit joined the order as a staff member and worked his way into a supervisory role at the center. Father James Porter came to the center after {{he was known to}} have begun molesting children in the 1960s, and Feit cleared him for placement in another parish. Porter was later defrocked and imprisoned after abusing as many as 100 children. Feit left the priesthood in the 1970s. He got married, moved to the Phoenix area, and had three children. He worked at the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul as a food charity volunteer for 17 years.|$|E

5|$|Pre-season {{fears of}} a {{conflict}} with Keenan were realized, as the coach reduced his time on the power play and forced him into a defensive role he was not <b>comfortable</b> <b>with.</b> Unhappy with being pushed into a checking role, and believing that the way Keenan was using him was not allowing him to give the Flames fair value on his contract, Tanguay requested a trade at the Christmas break. He and general manager Darryl Sutter agreed to keep it quiet {{so as not to}} become a distraction to the team, although Tanguay's request was revealed in the off-season. He suffered offensively, falling to 58 points.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel <b>comfortable</b> <b>with</b> intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
