40|$|An {{interferometer}} {{system for}} {{observation of the}} Jovian decameter radio waves has been achieved at Awara Campus of Fukui University of Technology. The system consists of three 100 m-class baselines with three components of log-periodic Yagi antennas. After <b>continuous</b> <b>works</b> of <b>system</b> establishment during three years, the system has finally been completed in November 2002. By utilizing the newly developed interferometer system observations of the Jovian decameter radio emissions have been carried out; as results of the observations, typical radio emissions from the Io related A and B radio sources and emissions from the Non-Io related sources have clearly been detected with excellent coincidence between fringes, of the interferometer, which have been analyzed for the possible radio sources at Jupiter. A few radio emission events related to the special sources caused by the dust groups which are circulating around Jupiter being ejected from broken nuclei of Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet have been identified. Investigating the trend of the occurrence of the dust related decameter radio emissions it has been concluded that the cosmic dust groups circulating around Jupiter have almost been diffused in space during 8 year since July 1994...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Adherence to {{the design}} values and {{ventilation}} standards (VS) after installing and also maintaining <b>continuous</b> <b>work</b> of ventilation <b>system</b> with maximum performance throughout its life are amongst the reasons of ventilation systems monitoring. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate performance of local exhaust ventilation system for control of dust by measuring the operating parameters and also to compare it with ventilation standards (VS) and design values. Material and Method: The present research is a descriptive and cross-sectional study, conducted in three sections of measuring, monitoring and evaluating the operating parameters on hoods, channels and fan of ventilation system based on the current status of the system, documentation (design), and recommended standards (VS). Static pressure, velocity pressure, surface area, and flow rate were measured based on the recommendations of various sources and ACGIH industrial ventilation manual, and the data were compared with the design and recommended values, using the SPSS software version 16.   Result: The results of paired sample t-test between flow rate and velocities of design and current status, showed significant differences in various parts. Accordingly, the results revealed a reduction of more than 50 % in the design duct velocity compared to the current duct velocity, while design duct velocity is 1. 3 more than the standard duct velocity of current status, and current duct velocity is about 65 % of standard duct velocity. Conclusion: The reduction and nonconformity of the results of measurements of operating parameters (after a minimum of two decades) with design and standard values are corroborant and sufficient reason for obstructions, abrasions, leaks, imbalance of system ducts and their inefficiency in some branches. Since there is no base line measurements for system (supposing that the <b>system</b> <b>worked</b> with maximum amounts of setup time), one of the reasons for these changes can be attributed to lack of schedule for regular and appropriate maintenance...|$|R

Isard's Revenge mostly refers back to characters and situations created in Stackpole's first four novels. Starfighters of Adumar focuses on a few major characters (including, several officers from Rogue Squadron, namely: Wedge Antilles, Tycho Celchu, Wes Janson, and Hobbie Klivian). Like the other eight novels, it details the adventures of pilots in an X-wing squadron, but it is often {{considered to be a}} book of its own that shares little resemblance or continuity {{with the rest of the}} series.|$|R

40|$|Goal of the {{integrated}} project which included eight {{small and medium-sized}} haulage companies was to analyse qualification demands and work loads of transportation managers, to develop a modular system to qualify transportation managers and to test some moduls serving as examples, to optimize their <b>work</b> <b>system</b> and to enquire criteria for job adequate technical environment. The following advances for an integrative and participative proceeding were used: -questionnaires with transportation managers, - <b>continuous</b> <b>work</b> with transportation managers of the included haulage companies in a task force, -work with transportation managers within the operational context. The result is a concept to qualify transportation managers in small and medium-sized haulage companies and to design their occupational functions based on moduls which {{are close to the}} practical work and were developed in form of a modular system. These moduls can be used as standard packages or be tailored to each company's specific needs. (orig.)

50|$|The <b>work</b> <b>system</b> {{approach}} for understanding systems includes both a static {{view of a}} current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is summarized by the <b>work</b> <b>system</b> framework, which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a <b>work</b> <b>system.</b> An easily recognized triangular representation of the <b>work</b> <b>system</b> framework has appeared in Alter (2002, 2003, 2008, 2013) and elsewhere. The <b>work</b> <b>system</b> itself consists of four elements: the processes and activities, participants, information, and technologies. Five other elements must be included in even a rudimentary understanding of a <b>work</b> <b>system’s</b> operation, context, and significance. Those elements are the products/services produced, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. Customers may also be participants in a <b>work</b> <b>system,</b> as happens when a doctor examines a patient.
