5|$|Certainly many {{problems}} remained to be resolved, including re-establishing royal {{authority over the}} provinces and resolving the <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> of which barons should control the contested lands and estates after the long civil war. Stephen burst into activity in early 1154, travelling around the kingdom extensively. He began issuing royal writs for the south-west of England once again and travelled to York where he held a major court {{in an attempt to}} impress upon the northern barons that royal authority was being reasserted. After a busy summer in 1154, however, Stephen travelled to Dover to meet the Count of Flanders; some historians believe that the King was already ill and preparing to settle his family affairs. Stephen fell ill with a stomach disorder and died on 25 October at the local priory, being buried at Faversham Abbey with his wife Matilda and son Eustace.|$|E

25|$|Knowingly {{giving a}} person a placebo {{when there is}} an {{effective}} treatment available is a bioethically <b>complex</b> <b>issue.</b> While placebo-controlled trials might provide information about the effectiveness of a treatment, it denies some patients what could be the best available (if unproven) treatment. Informed consent is usually required for a study to be considered ethical, including the disclosure that some test subjects will receive placebo treatments.|$|E
25|$|Euthanasia is a <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> in Islamic theology; however, {{in general}} it is {{considered}} contrary to Islamic law and holy texts. Among interpretations of the Koran and Hadith, the early termination of life is a crime, be it by suicide or helping one commit suicide. The various positions on the cessation of medical treatment are mixed and considered a different class of action than direct termination of life, especially if the patient is suffering. Suicide and euthanasia are both crimes in almost all Muslim majority countries.|$|E
25|$|As Erakat depicts {{in these}} anecdotes, the conflations and misconceptions of the west, {{that are a}} product of lack of {{representation}} {{of the reality of}} Arab women’s lives and experiences, as well as biased perspectives of what their cultural expressions actually mean, lead to problematic conclusions for many westerners. It is easy to draw the conclusions that some of Erakat’s peers drew in these stories she tells, because they lack the insight into how the occupation of the Palestinian territories actually impacts the daily lives of women living in these areas. By assuming that their limited knowledge is sufficient, it leads to limited understanding of this extremely <b>complex</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{establishment}} of Israel {{at the end}} of World War II was a <b>complex</b> <b>issue.</b> Based on its own experience during partition, when 14 million people were displaced and an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 people were killed in Punjab Province, India had recommended a single state, as did Iran and Yugoslavia (later to undergo its own genocidal partition). The state could allocate Arab- and Jewish-majority provinces with a goal of preventing partition of historic Palestine and prevent widespread conflict. But, the final UN resolution recommended partition of Mandatory Palestine into Arab and Jewish states based on religious and ethnic majorities. India opposed this in the final vote as it did not agree with the concept of partition on the basis of religion.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{rather than}} {{treating}} the essay as an honest {{analysis of a}} painful, <b>complex</b> <b>issue,</b> critics accused the AJC of stifling the debate. Such hysteria makes intellectuals look spoiled, thin-skinned and brittle. Best-selling authors like Noam Chomsky or billionaires like George Soros ritualistically applaud their own bravery and pretend they are lonely voices when joining the trendy intellectual pile-on against Israel. How it {{is that people who}} viciously criticize Israel and Zionism, who lecture the Jewish world about tolerating diverse opinions, suddenly cannot stomach vigorous debate when they are criticized? Nothing in the AJC essay advocates hate laws, suppressing free speech, shunning, or any other intimidation. Professor Rosenfeld did what thinkers are supposed to do – identify, catalogue, analyze, explain, and challenge.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} caveat about quicksort is {{that its}} worst-case performance is O(n2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(n2) performance, but good choice of pivots yields O(n log n) performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(nlogn). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(n) operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(nlogn) performance.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{debate on}} whether high-calorie soft drink vending {{machines}} {{should be allowed}} in schools {{has been on the}} rise. Opponents of the (soft drink) vending machines believe that soft drinks are a significant contributor to childhood obesity and tooth decay, and that allowing soft drink sales in schools encourages children to believe they are safe to consume in moderate to large quantities. Opponents argue that schools have a responsibility to look after the health of the children in their care, and that allowing children easy access to soft drinks violates that responsibility. Vending machine proponents believe that obesity is a <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> and soft drinks are not the only cause. They also note the immense amount of funding that soft drink sales bring to schools. Some people take a more moderate stance, saying that soft drink machines should be allowed in schools, but that they should not be the only option available. They propose that when soft drink vending machines are made available on school grounds, the schools should be required to provide children with a choice of alternative drinks (such as fruit juice, flavored water and milk) at a comparable price. Some lawmakers debating the issue in different states have argued that parents—not the government—should be responsible for children's beverage choices.|$|E
500|$|According to John Coplans's Roy Lichtenstein, {{the artist}} {{was fascinated by the}} drawings: [...] "isolating the woman out of the context of the {{painting}} seemed to Lichtenstein to be such an oversimplification of a <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> as to be ironical in itself"; the oversimplification referred to was Loran's representing Cézanne's work with nothing more than black lines. The work marked the first of Lichtenstein's [...] "artistic appropriations of the canonical works of Modernism" [...] that resulted from his realization of the interrelation [...] "between avant-garde and kitsch".|$|E
500|$|Currently, Australia has {{at least}} 400,000 horses roaming the continent. [...] It is also {{estimated}} that, during non-drought periods, the feral horse population increases {{at a rate of}} 20 percent per year. Drought conditions and brushfires are natural threats. Despite population numbers, feral horses are generally considered to be a moderate pest. Where they are allowed to damage vegetation and cause erosion, the impact on the environment can be detrimental, and for that reason can be considered a serious environmental threat. [...] However, because they also have cultural and potential economic value, the management of Brumbies presents a <b>complex</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|E

Namibia is a large, arid, sparsely populated and underdeveloped country which has been a war zone for many years. Our engineers will build roads, bridges, airstrips and camps for UNTAG. They will have the very serious task of clearing mines which have been laid by the various contending forces along the border between Angola and Namibia".|$|E
500|$|Biofuel {{development}} and use is a <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> {{because there are many}} biofuel options which are available. [...] Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Some researchers fear that a major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and claim that {{in some parts of the}} world the economic consequences are already visible, other researchers look at the land available and the enormous areas of idle and abandoned land and claim that there is room for a large proportion of biofuel also from conventional crops.|$|E
500|$|The episode, and {{particularly}} {{its treatment of}} rape, has been discussed in books of essays on Veronica Mars and elsewhere. Victoria E.

[...] She regarded [...] "A Trip to the Dentist" [...] {{as a way for}} Veronica to heal from her rape, writing [...] "Her healing is tied to finding out who raped her; a simple solution to a <b>complex</b> <b>issue.</b> This choice could mirror our present day stigma and lack of support for survivors of sexual assault, or it could simply allow the producers to erase her identity as a sexual assault survivor, leading the audience to believe that the strength of the character is not tied to her rape." ...|$|E

500|$|PrPC is {{a normal}} protein found on the {{membranes}} of cells. It has 209 amino acids (in humans), one disulfide bond, a molecular mass of 35–36 kDa and a mainly alpha-helical structure. Several topological forms exist; one cell surface form anchored via glycolipid and two transmembrane forms. The normal protein is not sedimentable; meaning that it cannot be separated by centrifuging techniques. Its function is a <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> that continues to be investigated. PrPC binds copper (II) ions with high affinity. The significance of this finding is not clear, but it is presumed to relate to PrP structure or function. PrPC is readily digested by proteinase K and can be liberated from the cell surface in vitro by the enzyme phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which cleaves the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) glycolipid anchor. [...] PrP {{has been reported to}} play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and intracellular signaling in vivo, and may therefore be involved in cell-cell communication in the brain.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith's {{party was}} the biggest spender on press {{advertising}} in the 1997 campaign; it spent {{three times as much}} as the Conservatives and five times as much as Labour on press adverts. Its media profile greatly eclipsed that of UKIP. Goldsmith also used his financial resources to deliver a videocassette to five million UK households in March 1997. This was a novel strategy in British politics, and was conceived as a way of reaching the electorate while bypassing the mass media. The packaging of the videocassette did not specify that it was produced by the Referendum Party but rather carried several slogans: [...] "The most important video you'll ever watch", [...] "The story the politicians don't want you to hear", and [...] "If you care about Britain, please pass this video on." [...] The 12-minute film, presented by the former That's Life! presenter Gavin Campbell, warned of a coming [...] "federal European super-state". In his analysis of the video, scholar David Hass argued that the film was deliberately designed to elicit fear in the viewer, something achieved through [...] "eerie sound effects", the image of a blue stain spreading across a map of Europe, and slow-motion shots of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl striding towards the screen. In Hass' view, the film [...] "manifestly reduced that <b>complex</b> <b>issue</b> of Europe to the lowest common denominator, and aimed to shock." ...|$|E
