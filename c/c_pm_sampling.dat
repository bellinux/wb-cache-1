The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to obtain such information for five forage sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] cultivars. Percent dry matter, crude protein, and in vitro dry matter disappearance of leaf, stem, and whole plant samples were determined for field-grown samples harvested on three different days during early head emergence (EHE) and once during physiological maturity (PM) for each cultivar. Orthogonal comparisons between EHE and <b>PM</b> <b>sampling</b> stages and among the• EHE samples were made. Results of the 2 -year study indicated that statistically significant differences existed among EHE samples and between EHE and <b>PM</b> <b>samples.</b> However, differences among EHE samples were generally much smaller than those between EHE and <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> and may be of little importance for some applications...|$|R

3000|$|Process {{capability}} indices {{have been}} used in industries to measure the performance of the processes. A process is called capable if the product meets customer expectations. There are copious studies on process capability estimations. Kotz and Johnson (2002) reviewed the studies on process capability indices during the years 1992 – 2000. Yum and Kim (2010) provided a bibliography of approximately 530 journal papers and books published during the years 2000 – 2009. The process capability indices C p, C pk and <b>C</b> <b>pm</b> are the most commonly used indices. The process capability index C [...] p [...] was proposed by Juran (1974). This process capability index cannot evaluate the capability of the process properly when the process mean and target value are not equal. Kane (1986) introduced C pk index to solve this problem. Hsiang and Taguchi (1985) proposed <b>C</b> <b>pm</b> index. The <b>C</b> <b>pm</b> process capability index considers the deviation of the process mean from its target value as well as the process variance. This index shows the ability of the process to manufacture products around the target value. Pearn et al. (1992) proposed the process capability index C pkm that have a same link between C p and C pk with <b>C</b> <b>pm.</b> Boyles (1994) proposed S pk index based on the process yield of the process. Sharma and Rao (2013) employed define, measure, analysis, improvement and control (DMAIC) approach to reduce the variation of the engine connecting rod machining process and as a result to improve the capability of the process. Also, Sharma and Rao (2014) used DMAIC approach to improve the capability of the engine crankshaft manufacturing process.|$|R

Experimental results are interpreted within the critical state model. Results deduced from vibrating reed technique are compared with ac susceptibility measurements. It is shown that both techniques give consistent results. The flux lines dynamic in high-Tc superconductors can-be studied using mechanical oscillator experiments [I] or ac susceptibility technique [2, 3]. In tliis paper, vibrating reed measurements on bulk YBa 2 Cu 307 -, polycrystals of different grain sizes are reported, and measurements on one polycrystalline sample using both techniques are compared. Using a critical-state model, important characteristics such as the critical current density and the activation energy associated with flux creep are determined for the intragranular contribution. 1.

40|$|Exposure to ambient {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{has been associated}} with adverse cardiopulmonary effects where inflammation seems to play an important role. Cellular release of inflammatory mediators is therefore commonly measured in in vitro studies of PM-induced effects. However, adsorption of such mediators to PM may interfere with these measurements and thereby possibly also influence the conclusions of such studies. The aim of the present mini review is to provide the reader with an update on what is currently known about adsorption of inflammatory mediators to PM. We also present a step-by-step method for correction of in vitro results, based on mediator adsorption experiments. Moreover, mediator adsorption and its possible consequences are exemplified with a case study demonstrating adsorption of long pentraxin 3 (PTX 3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to a selection of <b>PM</b> <b>samples.</b> The highest degree of adsorption was determined to be 65 and 95 % for PTX 3 and VEGF respectively, and for the various <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> the degree of adsorption was highly variable. In conclusion, the data and results discussed in this review underscore the importance of assessing and correcting for mediator adsorption, especially in studies involving comparison of effects induced by several different <b>PM</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R

40|$|Assessment of source {{contributions}} to the atmospheric concentrations of airborne particulate matter (PM) affecting a defined area holds a key role, both in expanding knowledge {{of the influence of}} local/regional sources on the physical - chemical characteristics of collected particles and in providing scientific support to the effectiveness of measures to be taken by authorities towards air quality improvement. Source apportionment by statistical methods comprises the use of factor analysis (FA) and of multi-linear regression analysis (MLRA). The combined application of these methods to data of PM chemical composition helps, indeed, the identification of predominant particle source categories and the apportionment of their relative {{contributions to}} the collected PM. To this purpose, the analytical procedure to be used for the chemical characterization of <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> has to provide the most possible complete information on particles composition, so that concentration data of both major and trace PM components can be included in the FA-MLRA analysis.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} (especially airborne {{particulate matter}} (PM)) can have serious effects on human health. PM exposure can increase cardiovascular and pulmonary complaints and lung cancer. These health effects reflect alterations in cellular function possibly due to damage in DNA caused by PM. A number of specialised pathways exist in mammalian cells to repair and I or by-pass different types of DNA damage. Base excision repair deals with oxidative DNA lesions which are recognised by Oggl, Nthl and Neill DNA glycosylases. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the role of different DNA repair proteins (including DNA glycosylases) in the protection of cellular DNA against PM-induced damage. To do so, the expression level of the proteins of interest was reduced in mouse cells and the level of cell death and DNA damage in these cells was studied and compared with unmodified I control cells. The oxidative capacity of PM was investigated to try and understand the mechanism involved in cellular toxicity. Different <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> were used in this study: PM collected in. Manchester during the summer and winter, diesel exhaust dust from a race car engine and standard urban dust from NIST. All the <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> could catalyse the production of oxygen radicals in the absence of cells, but DEP only could generate oxygen radicals inside cells. All the <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> caused cell death and DNA damage, but to a different extent. Urban dust caused more cells death and DNA damage than the other <b>PM</b> <b>samples.</b> Nthl and Oggl protect mammalian cells against PM-induced cell death while Neill did not have any effect. DNA polymerase K may also have a small role in the preservation of cell viability following PM exposure. Urban dust and DEP caused a higher level of DNA damage in Nthl and Oggl deficient cells than in control cells. Neill deficiency decreased the level of DNA damage following DEP exposure compared to control cells. This study showed that DNA glycosylases are important for the protection of mouse cells against PM-induced DNA damage and cell death. These results indicate that the activity of DNA repair proteins may help predict individual sensitivity to PM- induced health effects in exposed subjects.

The three processes consisted of (i) combustion of residual oil, (ii) combustion of various eastern and western U. S. coals, and (iii) combustion of diesel fuel formulations in an engine. Sulfur was found to exist in mainly sulfate forms in the emissions from all three processes, although minor to significant fractions of the sulfur were also present as thiophenic sulfur, elemental sulfur, and various other sulfur forms, depending on the fossil fuel, the combustion conditions, and the particle size of the collected fraction. Combustion of residual oil tended to form metal sulfates predominantly, although the coarse fractions (PM 2. 5 +) also contained minor amounts of sulfides of Fe, Cu and Ni, while the fine fractions (PM 2. 5) contained oxides instead of sulfides as their minor components. Due to the presence of aluminosilicates in the coal, metal species in coal emissions were more complex. Chromium was present entirely as Cr 3 + in both fine and coarse PM from combustion of eastern U. S. coals, but significant fractions of the chromium were present as more toxic and carcinogenic Cr(Vl) species in fine and coarse PM from combustion of western U. S. coals. In contrast, arsenic was present entirely as arsenate (AsO 43 -) species in all coal <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> (and residual oil <b>PM</b> <b>samples),</b> regardless of origin.

The present study aimed to optimize the design for PM in vivo toxicity screening studies in terms of dose and time between a single exposure and the determination of the biological responses in a rat model mimicking human disease resulting in susceptibility to ambient PM. Dust in thoracic PM size-range (aerodynamic diameter Results The neutrophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased tremendously after exposure to the highest RTD doses or EHC- 93. Furthermore, PM exposure slightly affected blood coagulation since there was a small but significant increase in the plasma fibrinogen levels (factor 1. 2). Pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress as well as changes in blood coagulation factors and circulating blood cell populations were observed within the range of 3 to 10 mg PM/kg of body weight without significant pulmonary injury. Conclusion The optimal dose for determining the toxicity ranking of ambient derived <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> in spontaneously hypertensive rats is suggested to be between 3 and 10 mg PM/kg of body weight under the conditions used in the present study. At a lower dose only some inflammatory effects were detected, which will probably be too few to be able to discriminate between <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> while a completely different response pattern was observed with the highest dose. In addition to the dose, a 24 -hr interval from exposure to sacrifice seemed appropriate to assess the relative toxic potency of PM since the majority of the health effects were observed one day after PM exposure compared to the other times examined. The aforementioned considerations provide a good basis for conducting PM toxicity screening studies in spontaneously hypertensive rats. </p...|$|R

The cell damages induced by PM reveled by the cell apoptosis assay showed a similar variation pattern to the DNA damages obtained by PSA, verifying the feasibility of the PSA in analyzing the oxidative capacity of <b>PM</b> <b>samples.</b> The PSA experiments showed that the particle-induced DNA damage was highest in summer, followed by spring, winter and autumn in descending order. The percentages of the oxidative damages to plasmid DNA induced by the water-soluble fractions of PM under the particle doses from 10 to 250 μg/ml were generally lower than 45 %, with some values peaking at above 50 %. The peak values were frequently present in late spring (i. e. April and May) and early summer (i. e. June) but they were scarcely observed in other seasons. These peak values were mostly associated with haze days or the days with low wind speed (less than 4 m/s), indicating that the <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> during haze had higher oxidative potential than those during non-haze periods. The oxidative potential induced by the water-soluble fraction of the PM displayed a significant positive correlation with the concentrations of the water-soluble elements Cd, Cs, Pb, Rb, Zn, Be and Bi, demonstrating that the particle-induced oxidative potentials were mainly sourced from these elements. The exposure risk represented by the mass concentration of these elements in unit volume of atmosphere was higher in summer and winter, and lower in autumn and spring.

In this study, three different <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> from diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), urban dust standard reference material SRM 1649 a and air collected in Manchester have been tested for their ability to oxidise DNA in a cell-free assay, to increase intracellular ROS levels and to induce CYP 1 A 1 gene expression in mammalian cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of PM were assessed using the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and alkaline comet assay, respectively. All <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> catalysed the Fenton reaction in a cell-free assay, but only DEP resulted in the generation of ROS as measured by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate oxidation in mammalian cells. However, {{there was no evidence that}} increased ROS was a consequence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolism via CYP 1 A 1 induction as urban dust, the Manchester dust samples but not DEP-induced CYP 1 A 1 expression. Urban dust was more cytotoxic in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than the other <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> and also induced expression of GADD 45 a in the GreenScreen Human Cell assay without S 9 activation suggesting the presence of a direct-acting genotoxicant. Urban dust and DEP produced comparable levels of DNA damage, as assessed by the alkaline comet assay, in MEFs at higher levels than those induced by Manchester PM. In conclusion, results from the cytotoxic and genotoxic assays are not consistent with ROS production being the sole determinant of PM-induced toxicity. This suggests that the organic component can contribute significantly to this toxicity and that further work is required to better characterise the extent to which ROS and organic components contribute to PM-induced toxicity...|$|R

The particle mass levels in the satellite city were slightly lower than those at the urban site, and the lowest mass levels occurred at the MTR site. The morphology and chemical composition of individual airborne particles were determined by scanning electron microscopy, and image analysis was employed to study the number-size distributions. The number-size distributions of mineral particles showed that those in the Asia-Dust storm (ADS) collections are mostly coarser than 1 ?m, while mineral particles of the non-ADS collections are predominately finer than 1 ?m. The particles in the respirable (< 2. 5 ?m) fraction accounted for 99 % of the total particles in airborne <b>PM</b> <b>samples.</b> Soot aggregates were generally the most abundant components in airborne <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> at all three sites. The fly ash (spherical) particles at the MTR site were significantly enriched over the heating period, indicating a domestic coal-burning source...|$|R
40|$|Many {{epidemiologic}} reports associate ambient {{levels of}} particulate matter (PM) with human mortality and morbidity, particularly {{in people with}} preexisting cardiopulmonary disease (e. g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infection, asthma). Because much ambient PM is derived from combustion sources, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} health effects of PM arise from anthropogenic PM that contains bioavailable transition metals. The <b>PM</b> <b>samples</b> studied derived from three emission sources (two oil and one coal fly ash) and four ambient airsheds (St. Louis...|$|R
