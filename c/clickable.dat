5|$|Cross Days is {{a visual}} novel. These are {{essentially}} played by watching {{and listening to}} episodic sequences of story and then selecting, or ignoring, <b>clickable</b> actions or responses when they are presented to the player. These choices are intricately linked to alternating routes of plot, moderately changing {{the direction of the}} story as each is made, ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of various endings. Unique to the game are yaoi routes, in which the protagonist crossdresses as a maid and engages in homosexual intercourse.|$|E
5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a <b>clickable</b> button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or <b>clickable</b> icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move to a better position.|$|E

25|$|Wikilinks are visibly {{distinct}} from other text, and if an internal wikilink {{leads to a}} page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those which link to pages which do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red. Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted <b>clickable</b> question mark after the wikilinked term.|$|E

500|$|On September 24, 2011, Leland renamed one {{of their}} bridges [...] "The Rainbow Connection" [...] to honor Henson and his work. He was also honored with a Google doodle on his 75th birthday; the Google logo had six Muppets that were <b>clickable</b> using the [...] "hand" [...] buttons.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} MacPaint did {{incorporate a}} double zoom function with only head on. Instead of a zoom function, a special magnification mode called FatBits was used. FatBits showed each pixel as a <b>clickable</b> rectangle {{with a white}} border. The FatBits editing mode {{set the standard for}} many future editors. MacPaint included a [...] "Goodies" [...] menu which included the FatBits tool. This menu was named the [...] "Aids" [...] menu in prerelease versions, but was renamed [...] "Goodies" [...] as public awareness of the AIDS epidemic grew in the summer of 1983.|$|E
500|$|Although {{continually}} {{disturbed by}} its popularity, Bogost also used Cow Clicker to parody other recent gaming and social networking trends; {{such as the}} addition of an API to allow websites {{to have their own}} <b>clickable</b> cows (in a process he dubbed [...] "Cowclickification"), the spin-off game [...] Cow Clicker Blitz (co-developed with PopCap Games co-founder Jason Kapalka), [...] "My First Cow Clicker" [...] for iOS (a parody of simplistic education apps; designed to [...] "train" [...] children on cow clicking and add the resulting clicks to their parent's total), and a [...] "Cow Clicktivism" [...] campaign where users could click on an emaciated cow to donate to Oxfam Americawith a goal of donating an actual cow to a third world country. The cow, known as the [...] "Cowclicktivist Cow", could also be unlocked for the player's pasture with a $110 donation.|$|E
500|$|The Dream's {{exterior}} uses a soft, matte plastic shell, and {{was made}} available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive [...] "chin" [...] on the bottom, which houses 5 navigation buttons ("Call", [...] "Home", [...] "Menu", [...] "Back", and [...] "End Call") and a <b>clickable</b> trackball {{in the center}} {{which can be used}} for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a [...] capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320×480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard—as the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting multitouch at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack, requiring an adapter for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) [...] "ExtUSB" [...] port located {{on the bottom of the}} device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus.|$|E

2500|$|Apple's PowerBook 500 {{series was}} its first laptop to carry such a device, which Apple {{refers to as}} a [...] "trackpad". When {{introduced}} in May 1994, it replaced the trackball of previous PowerBook models. In late 2008 Apple's revisions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro incorporated a [...] "Tactile Touchpad" [...] design with button functionality incorporated into the tracking surface. Beginning in the second generation of MacBook Pro, the entire touchpad surface acts as a <b>clickable</b> button.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] element, {{and inside}} that, [...] elements, {{each of which}} defines a single <b>clickable</b> area within the imagemap. These {{are similar to the}} [...] tag {{defining}} which URL should be opened for an ordinary web link. A title attribute may be provided, which may be rendered as a tooltip if a desktop user hovers their mouse pointer over the area. For web accessibility reasons, it is often important – and in some cases it may even be a legal or contractual requirement – to provide an alt attribute describing the link that screen reader software can read to, for example, blind users.|$|E
2500|$|The paper's website {{was also}} {{extensively}} overhauled using a new, in-house {{content management system}} known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and section pages), <b>clickable</b> video advertising and a responsive design layout. The site {{was designed to be}} more interactive, provide optimizations for mobile and touchscreen devices, provide [...] "high impact" [...] advertising units, and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate USA Today content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform and the USA Today site design throughout 2013 and 2014 (although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre-relaunch design).|$|E
2500|$|On June 12, 2013, Facebook {{announced}} on its newsroom {{that it was}} introducing <b>clickable</b> hashtags to help users follow trending discussions, or search what others are talking about on a topic. A July 2013 Wall Street Journal article identified the Facebook IPO {{as the cause of}} a change in the U.S.' national economic statistics, as the local government area of the company's headquarters, San Mateo County, California, became the top wage-earning county in the country after the fourth quarter of 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average weekly wage in the county was US$3,240, 107% higher than the previous year. It noted the wages were [...] "the equivalent of $168,000 a year, and more than 50% higher than the next-highest county, New York County (better known as Manhattan), at $2,107 a week, or roughly $110,000 a year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debbie Maria Leon of the New Straits Times {{said that}} [...] "there's {{so much to}} learn in this...fun, upbeat {{edutainment}} title" [...] and that [...] "each case is unique and challenging and offers a wealth of knowledge".

She concludes by saying [...] "a myriad of <b>clickable</b> items are lurking in every scene, waiting to unleash just some more interesting and intriguing information". Karen Campbell of The Christian Science Monitor wrote [...] "There's a bit {{of trial and error}} involved when clues are not immediately apparent. It can get tedious for adults, but children, for whom the tactic is a natural part of learning, don't seem to mind".|$|E
