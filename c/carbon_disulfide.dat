30|$|Metallic iron (Fe 0) is now {{established}} as a key material for environmental remediation, industrial wastewater treatment and safe drinking water provision (Hussam and Munir 2007; Comba et al. 2011; Gheju 2011; Gottinger et al. 2013; Noubactep 2013 a, b; Kowalski and Søgaard 2014; Ghauch 2015; Guan et al. 2015; Naidu and Birke 2015; Noubactep 2015; Zou et al. 2016). Upon well design, Fe 0 filters are able to eliminate and/or transform {{a wide array of}} biological and chemical species. Relevant species included chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, azo-dyes, bacteria, <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfides,</b> chlorinated aromatics, heavy metals nitro-aromatics and radionuclides (Johnson et al. 1996; Richardson and Nicklow 2002; Henderson and Demond 2007; McGeough et al. 2007; Fu et al. 2014; Obiri-Nyarko et al. 2014; Guan et al. 2015). These species are neutral, negatively or positively charged, polar or not, small or large in size, redox reactive or not. They are collectively removed from the aqueous phase by three mechanisms: (1) adsorption, (2) co-precipitation and (3) size-exclusion. Chemical reductive (and/or oxidative) transformations may occur within the system but are not mediated by the uncorroded iron (Ghauch 2015; Noubactep 2015; Gheju et al. 2016). The abundant literature on Fe 0 remediation has a qualitative character because no collective effort for systematic research has been made. The knowledge that the Fe 0 /H 2 O system is ion selective should support both the design of future experiments and their interpretation. If this path is followed by several research groups and the results are discussed with respect to charge/size of tested contaminants, a database would be soon available to boost the optimization of Fe 0 filters.|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{fundamental}} function of solid nanoparticle structure on boundary lubrication {{is of great}} significance.

Smaller nanosize GQDs allow the friction and wear to be reduced by up to 60 % and 91 %, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of a densely protective film on the sliding surfaces and the graphene-like debris in the contact area...|$|R

5|$|Many {{attempted}} {{methods of}} eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations {{were made in}} the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using <b>carbon</b> <b>disulfide</b> and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects to one another. Missing a single gallery can mostly lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used.|$|E

Gerberich. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 139 pages, appendix p. 138 - 139. With a newly developed symmetry-adapted tight-binding molecular dynamics (MD) capability, we performed microscopic calculations {{on a variety}} of quasi-one dimensional silicon, <b>carbon,</b> and molybdenum <b>disulfide</b> nanostructures. In symmetry-adapted MD the helical symmetry instead of the standard translational symmetry is used. In the considered nanostructures, equivalent calculations can now be performed with a substantial smaller, {{in terms of the number}} of atoms, repeating domain. The symmetry-adapted method was utilized in the studied highlighted below. The stability of the most promising ground state candidate silicon nanowires with less than 10 nm in diameter was comparatively studied with with nonorthogonal tight-binding and classical potential models. The computationally expensive tight-binding treatment becomes tractable due to the substantial simplifications introduced by the presented symmetry-adapted scheme. It indicates that the achiral polycrystalline of fivefold symmetry and the hexagonal (wurtzite) wires of threefold symmetry are the most favorable quasi-one-dimensional silicon arrangements. Quantitative differences with the classical model description are noted over the whole diameter range. Using a Wulff energy decomposition approach it is revealed that these differences are caused by the inability of the classical potential to accurately describe the interaction of Si atoms on surfaces and strained morphologies. The elastic response for a large catalog of carbon nanotubes subjected to axial and torsional strain was next derived from tomistic calculations that rely on an accurate tight-binding description of the covalent binding. The application of the computationally expensive quantum treatment is possible due to the simplification in the number of atoms introduced by accounting for the helical and ngular symmetries exhibited by the elastically deformed nanotubes. The elasticity of nanotubes larger than 1. 25 nm in diameter can be represented with an isotropic elastic continuum. The torsional plastic response of single-walled carbon nanotubes is studied with tight-binding objective molecular dynamics. In contrast with plasticity under elongation and bending, a torsionally deformed carbon nanotube can slip along a nearly axial helical path, which introduces a distinct (+ 1,&# 8722; 1) change in wrapping indexes. The low energy realization occurs without loss in mass via nucleation of a 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 dislocation dipole, followed by glide of 5 - 7 kinks. The possibility of nearly axial glide is supported by the obtained dependence of the plasticity onset on chirality and handedness and by the presented calculations showing the energetic advantage of the slip path and of the initial glide steps. Symmetry-adaptedMD combined with density-functional-based tight-binding made possible to compute chiral nanotubes as axial-screw dislocations. This enabled the surprising revelation of a large catalog of MoS 2 nanotubes that lack the prescribed translational symmetry and exhibit chirality-dependent electronic band-gaps and elastic constants. Helical symmetry emerges as the natural property to rely on when studying quasi-one dimensional nanomaterials formally derived or grown via screw dislocations. The nonlinear elastic response of carbon nanotubes in torsion was derived with the symmetry-adapted MD and a density-functional-based tight-binding model. The critical strain beyond which tubes behave nonlinearly, the most favorable rippling morphology, and the twist- and morphology-related changes in fundamental band gap were identified from a rigorous atomistic description. There is a sharply contrasting behavior in the electronic response: while in single-walled tubes the band-gap variations are dominated by rippling, multiwalled tubes with small cores exhibit an unexpected insensitivity. Results are assistive for experiments performed on nanotubes-pedal devices. Despite its importance, little is known about how complex deformation modes alter the intrinsic electronic states of carbon nanotubes. We considered the rippling deformation mode characterized by helicoidal furrows and ridges and elucidate that a new intralayer strain effect rather than the known bilayer coupling and &sigma-&pi orbital mixing effects dominates its gapping. When an effective shear strain is used, it is possible to link both the electrical and the mechanical response of the complex rippled morphology to the known behavior of cylindrical tubes. Moving on to graphene, to describe the strain stored in helical nanoribbons, we supplement the standard elasticity concepts with an effective tensional strain. Using &pi -orbital tight binding and objective molecular dynamics coupled with density functional theory, we show that twisting couples the frontier conduction and valence bands, resulting in band-gap modulations. In spite of the edges and ridges of the helical nanoribbons, from the effective strain perspective these band-gap modulations appear strikingly similar with those exhibited by the seamless carbon nanotubes...|$|R
