40|$|Glycosaminoglycan {{synthesis}} {{in normal}} adult dog knee cartilage cultured in medium containing 0, 0. 3 MM- and 0. 9 mM-Ca 2 + was 52, 67 and 78 %, respectively, {{of that in}} cartilage from the same joints cultured in a normal concentration of Ca 2 +, i. e. 1. 8 mM. Pulse-chase experiments indicated {{that the rate of}} degradiation of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage cultured in the absence of Ca 2 + was similar to that of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage cultured in 1. 8 mM-Ca 2 +. Although [35 S]sulphate incorporation into glycosaminoglycans was decreased in the presence of <b>calcipenia,</b> [3 H]leucine incorporation into protein was unaffected. The average hydrodynamic size of newly synthesized proteoglycan aggregates and purified disaggregated proteoglycans from cartilage cultured in the absence of Ca 2 + was similar to that of aggregates and disaggregated proteoglycans from cartilage cultured in 1. 8 mM-Ca 2 +...|$|E
