By examining their respective methods for assigning moral rights to a group, I elucidate problems in both accounts, showing them insufficient in their attempt to defend group ethics.

The <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> asserts that the group identity, and the only source of a group’s moral status, lies in the sum of the rights of its members, creating a group-as-a-whole. This, however, poses the practical problem of changing numbers within a group, and shifts in membership. I introduce my own group identity theory, the extension account, which provides the possibility of a group that can hold rights by virtue of its being made of autonomous individuals who all bear moral standing and are subject to the moral responsibilities relevant to their membership within the group. The extension account establishes an identity of the group-itself, separate from its members, but the origin of its moral status is extended directly from th...|$|E

40|$|Though the {{occurrence}} of night time feeding has been demonstrated in numerous species of wildfowl, accurately quantifying this behaviour visually is inherently difficult and so alternative techniques are required. During {{the course of two}} distinct projects on the ecology of brent geese Branta bernicla in England (Studies Aand B) and another in Germany (Study C) we used position-sensitive radio transmitters, attached to thin leather neck collars, to monitor feeding behaviour remotely. In this paper, we present a <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> of the method. Transmitter units emitted pulses at two different intervals depending on the orientation of a built-in tilt switch; generally shorter intervals (ca 1. 1 seconds) when a bird lowered its neck to feed and longer intervals (ca 1. 4 seconds) when in upright positions, though in some units this was reversed. Day-time observations of each radio-marked goose were required to produce predictive equations which described the proportion of time feeding in terms of mean pulse interval (Study B), number of long intervals between pulses (Study C) or the proportion of time in which pulses were received at short (or in some cases long) intervals (Study A). Coefficients of determination ranged within 0. 13 - 0. 95. These equations could be used to interpret data that was received and stored at regular intervals (30 or 60 seconds) during night time by a data logging system. Each study also assessed whether the collars affected the behaviour of the geese. No significant behavioural differences were observed for free-ranging birds wearing collars compared to nearby birds without.

40|$|Abstract Background and aim: The {{introduction}} of higher fees within HE may well impact on part-time provision from 2012. Potentially fewer students applying for courses {{may mean that}} university income will become reliant on students completing courses and so retention will assume greater significance. At the university at the centre of this research 62 % of all withdrawals on part-time foundation degrees occur within the first six weeks. This study explored how nine part-time mature students experienced entry into HE to develop {{knowledge and understanding of}} the range and nature of that experience, and the reasons why withdrawal may occur. Design: Using lifeworld the study captured the lived experience of nine students. The participants were interviewed after they had completed six weeks of their various courses and then again six weeks into their second semester. Results: The lived experience of these students evidences the complexity and individuality of returning to education. For some of the students, entering into study brought the present, past and future intensely into focus. Some questioned their own presence in HE while managing feelings of anxiety and inferiority. Established individual lifeworlds were challenged as integration into the social and academic communities of the university were negotiated. Enabling strategies included peer support within the classroom and securing confirmation that they were working at the correct academic level. Conclusion: This study shows that the lifeworld experience of these beginning students is rich and diverse and cannot be encapsulated within a <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> of the ~ student experience. For university engagement with students to be meaningful {{the findings of this study}} suggest that it needs to take account of the range of mature students' experiences including expectations, approaches to study, motivation, their past and aspirations, to develop courses that will retain students. The accounts of these students indicate that if appropriate support is given during the transitional period to enable feelings of acceptance within the social and academic environment then this can make a major contribution to retention.

40|$|Introduction: The {{impact of}} {{ergonomic}} interventions may {{be offset by}} other changes at the work place, primarily rationalizations. These have previously been shown to imply a dominant negative effect on health and risk factors, thus causing effect modification (Westgaard & Winkel 2011). The present paper aims to present assessment of potential effect modifiers in intervention studies at hospital wards in Denmark, Iceland and Sweden. Material and methods: The effect modifiers were assessed by a newly developed method (the EMA method; Edwards & Winkel 2016). It {{is a type of}} group interview including 3 - 6 participants representing all occupational groups in the investigated organization. The group is asked to write down significant changes at the workplace during the investigated period. The method also includes a semi-qualitative assessment of the potential Work Environment (WE) impact of each modifier. It aims to capture both the individual and <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> of all significant events that may have caused a significant impact in relation to the specific aim of the investigated intervention. Thirteen hospital wards went through interventions based on either the lean tool VSM (Value Stream Mapping) (6 wards) or the ErgoVSM method (Jarebrant et al, 2010) where additional focus is on ergonomic issues (7 wards). Results: In total 120 interventions were implemented. However, 322 significant modifiers were assessed to have occurred during the intervention period. Of these, 120 were assessed to imply impaired WE, 166 a positive impact, 33 no impact and 3 were not assessable. The number of significant modifier events varied between wards from 8 - 48, while the number of implemented interventions varied from 0 - 28. The semi-qualitative assessments suggested a major impact on WE due to modifiers. At seven wards the dominating impact of the modifiers was estimated to improve WE; at two wards the modifiers were estimated mainly to impair WE while four wards showed a mixture of modifiers, some estimated to improve and other to impair WE. Conclusion: Numerous effect modifiers occurred parallel to the investigated interventions. This jeopardizes any inference regarding impact of the investigated interventions on WE. The study thereby highlights the significance of considering effect modifiers in ergonomic intervention research...|$|E

40|$|This study {{considers}} two {{discourses of}} current relevance to {{national and international}} educators - early professional learning (EPL) and curriculum change.

40|$|How can {{relation}} {{be considered}} a creative force {{in the composition of}} experience? Investigating the status of relation in art, media, and philosophy, this thesis outlines an account of research-creation as a creative practice and tool for analysis. Research-creation, a term used to describe creative practices comprising artistic and theoretical components, provides the backdrop for a more general discussion of the production of knowledge beyond human cognition. By taking a radical empiricist approach, the thesis proposes to include preindividual, affective, and more-than-human elements in the conception of experience. From this point of view, experience is always relationally composed and manifests itself dynamically as an “ecology. ” One way of developing a theory and practice attentive to such ecologies of relation resides in the notion of the collective, which refers here to a dimension of experience that exceeds the mere grouping of individual elements under a common interest, ideology, or social bond. The first chapter analyzes collectivity and relation as activities of emergence and becoming. Considered as ecological activity, collectivity emphasizes how experience comprises spatio-temporal dynamics constituting embodied, actual events and their singular forms of knowledge. Using the work of the SenseLab as exemplary, this chapter clarifies how research-creation might be better understood as an investigation into aesthetic and conceptual practices that mutually shape how forms of knowledge and experience co-emerge. From here, the focus on the ecological relation moves toward immersive media environments, which emphasize perception as a relational act of immediation. Immediation as relational act challenges the paradigm of mediation between humans and machines, and instead inserts their activity into an ecological dynamic. In this chapter, research-creation interlaces with concerns in the field of digital aesthetics. Consequently, the entanglements between different temporalities in digital media processes require a rethinking of affect as a temporal operation, which is the focus of chapter three. In chapters four and the conclusion, research-creation as a relational-ecological practice opens up toward political concerns in urban planning and activism, respectively, allowing for the development of an extended conception of the aesthetic politics of the collective beyond art and academia. From a final speculative outlook the thesis asks how an ecological and <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> of research-creation might turn philosophy into an aesthetic and political practice of activation...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the thesis implies {{simultaneously}} to multiple directions. On one hand, it is methodological work that through a case study aims at discovering the possibilities of entwining different processes. The two processes that are referred to are both of artistic and designerly nature. During the methodological journey, the author aims at discovering how the artistic realm of practitioning could {{be integrated into the}} designerly one {{in a manner that is}} beneficial and enriching to the latter. Nonetheless, in addition to conducting a case study, theoretical groundings for entwining the processes are unearthed. The theoretical reasoning consists of locating ideological and epistemological confluence, ultimately resulting in a methodologically consistent framework. On the other hand, the thesis is an enquiry into a subject matter with a feminist undertone. The author has been discovering the topic also earlier within her artistic practitioning, and now, the theme of everyday womanhood is taken as a starting point for the entwined process. This originally subjective interest is transformed into a <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> of knowledge through applying several participatory methods. The involvement of multiple methods aids in discovering and sensitizing the designer to her initial topic, and makes it converge and crystallize so that the core theme becomes easier to grasp and apply in a design context. The utilised methods capitalize on inclusive and emancipatory ideologies that can be coupled due to their partly common predecessors, which are also revealed during the study. The case study concludes with critical concepts or scenarios presenting hypothetical designs that also match with these ideologies. The final concepts still include the primary interest in the multitude of experiences of womanhood, but develop the starting point according to the findings and responses achieved and gathered from the participants in the different phases of the study. The context of research within the thesis is mostly within constructive design research, but it is further enriched with both feminist and artistic methodology, whose compatibility is justified both on a theoretical and practical level. The main goal for the work is to demonstrate the positive gains that utilizing the full creative potential of a designer can yield. It aims at stretching the concept of designerly methodologies, and reclaiming the designer’s personal artistic potential. Moreover, the thesis is a subjective journey for establishing an identity of a designer – a designer who situates empowerment, transformation, and in general critical reflection in the core of her practitioning...|$|E
40|$|Androcentric by nature, {{traditional}} leisure research assumed male researchers {{knew the}} meaning of leisure activities for women, that home and work were separate spheres for women, and that the dimensions of men's leisure were also common to women's leisure. Feminist interest in leisure increased with the realisation that women' s leisure {{was a product of}} social forces. Thus differences in women's perceptions and experience of leisure reflected wider social divisions which contributed to the construction and maintenance of inequalities. Women both as narrators of their own leisure experiences, and as researchers of other women's experiences, found little evidence in women's everyday lives of leisure as traditionally defined by male researchers. A gap exists between women's leisure experiences and the theoretical constructs available to them to talk about and investigate their experiences. This gap can be narrowed by talking with women about the feelings they associate with leisure and the contexts in which they experience these feelings in relation to the beliefs associated with motherhood, family and work. The use of memory work in the study of emotion and gender suggested a method through which feminist goals and principles could be linked to a study of feelings, contexts and meanings. Using memory work in this way involved the establishment of the memory work groups; collection of written memories according to certain rules; collective examination of the memories by co-researchers for the common meanings used in their construction; appraisal of memories by the researcher in the context of existing leisure theory; and group discussion of the researcher's appraisal and negotiation by group members of a <b>collective</b> <b>account</b> of the memories. Memories were written to trigger words which have some association with leisure and to others viewed as the antithesis of leisure. For co-researchers the interactions of feelings of pleasure, relaxation, enjoyment, obligation and entitlement in containers represented by social settings, activities and physical locations were given meaning as leisure by the feeling of being free from obligation and free to choose and to implement that choice. The research supported the interlinking of values/entitlement, containers/opportunities and feelings (both positive and negative) as elements contributing to the gendered meaning of leisure. Women's desire to achieve balance in their lives mediates these interactions. An exploration of the tensions and problems encountered as a feminist doing research revealed resolution of some of these issues was possible. Others needing further reflection and wider discussion include : how do we create conditions in which participants become co-researchers with the power imbalance between all participants minirnised?; how do we balance the requirements of postgraduate researchlacademic scholarship with the needs of co-researchers?; and what do we really give back to coresearchers...|$|E

We articulate how more social and <b>collective</b> <b>accounts</b> based on social representations theory, ideology and discursive psychology can enrich our understanding of stereotypes and stereotyping. Stereotypes are not the product of individual cognitive activity alone, but are also social and collective products which function ideologically by justifying and legitimizing existing social and power relations within a society. We also discuss recent contributions to the enduring enigma within social psychology regarding the relationship between stereotypes and social reality, and identify the inherent ideological problems which plague positivist attempts to explicate this relationship. Finally, we discuss {{the need for an}} integrative social psychological theory of stereotyping which links the cognitive and psychological analyses of stereotyping to more social, structural and discursive analyses...|$|R
