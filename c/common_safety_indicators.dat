30|$|The {{simplest}} description for passive type LXs {{may be all}} LXs {{equipped with}} any warning signs, plates, devices, or any other protection equipment, which is permanent and independent of any traffic situation. The first analysis of operational LX risk was carried out {{on the basis of}} the active and passive LX types as defined per the European Railway Agency for the purpose of defining <b>Common</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicators</b> [3]. It defines an active LX as a LX where the crossing users are protected from, or warned of, the approaching train by the activation of devices when it is unsafe for the user to cross the LX. In the case of an automatic active LX (A. 1 in Fig.  1), these devices are activated by the approaching train. Manual active LXs (A. 2) are activated by humans when there is no railway signal interlocked with control train movements. In the case of passive LX (B in Fig.  1) there is no warning system and/or protection system showing when it is unsafe for the user to cross the LX. SELCAT project [2, 4] carried out an analysis of accident statistics by comparing operational risk according to the different LX types. As a basis for comparison, seven basic LX types as defined per ERA were taken into account. The individual risk for road LX user was compared as per the different LX types [5].|$|E

The European commission proposed the SAMRail [9] and SAMNET [10] projects, which aimed at railway risk management promotion in 2002 and 2003. These projects have unified the railway safety operation strategy and established general <b>safety</b> targets and <b>indicators</b> and finally formed the railway operation <b>safety</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and <b>safety</b> target allocation methods [11], based on the <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> target, the <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> <b>indicator,</b> and the <b>common</b> <b>safety</b> method.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Patient {{safety is}} a major concern in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Organizations and {{investigators}} are alike in searching for ways to improve delivery and safety of patient care. Many have reported that the existence of a patient safety and risk management system will have an effective impact on the overall patients' outcomes. Aims: To study the effectiveness of a patient safety model on patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> when implemented in a university hospital. Methods: A task force constituted by various patient safety experts was established to design a practical concept of patient safety management based on a nine steps model and applied by all hospital departments. Patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> (780) were monitored over a four years period and the model's effectiveness was analyzed on 40 selected indicators. Results: A statistical significant improvement by 67. 5 % (27 / 40) of initially measured patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> was evidenced mainly in the domains of peri-operative mortalities, neonatal mortality, return to surgeries, healthcare associated infections, safety and medication use, blood transfusion reactions, cardio pulmonary resuscitations, patient adverse events, and occurrence variance reporting. However, 12. 5 % (5 / 40) of the indicators of hospital standardized mortality and specific mortality were not improved by the model's implementation while others, 20 % (8 / 40) of the patients <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> were maintained as their initial baselines were satisfactory. Conclusions: The implementation of a patient safety management model was found to be effective in improving patient safety practices (PSP) as well as patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> (PSIs) and finally patient outcomes.

40|$|Objective. To {{improve the}} {{international}} comparability of patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> based on administrative hospital data, adjustment of country-specific rates by a proxy measure of diagnostic coding intensity was tested. Data Sources. Secondary data (numerator and denominator counts of patient <b>safety</b> <b>indicators)</b> based on adults discharged fromacute care hospitals between 2006 and 2008 was used. Study Design. A retrospective cross-sectional study using hospital administrative data was performed. Data Collection. Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States provided data according to detailed instructions. Principal Findings. Age-and sex-standardized rates varied across countries. An {{ordinary least squares}} regression model was estimated for each Patient <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> (PSI) using {{the mean number of}} secondary diagnoses among denominator cases as the predictor (R 2523 percent to 56 percent).

Conventionally, surrogate safety measures {{have been used as}} <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> in simulation models for safety assessment, in control formulations for driver assistance systems, and in data analysis of naturalistic driving studies. However, surrogate indicators only give partial insights into traffic safety i. e., they only indicate a predetermined set of possible pre-crash situations for an interacting vehicle pair. Recently, a <b>safety</b> <b>indicator</b> called the driving safety field based on field theory has been proposed for two-dimensional vehicle interactions. However, the objectivity of its functional form and validity are yet to be tested. This paper provides a qualitative and quantitative comparison of different <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> as a risk measure to demarcate their mathematical properties and evaluate their usefulness in quantifying trajectory risk.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Road {{traffic safety}} is {{receiving}} increasing attention. Different real-time <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> relying on traffic sensor {{data can be}} found in the literature. Some are based on the posterior analysis of crash and traffic data; while others are based on real time traffic risk assessment using microscopic parameters (e. g., short time headways). Other non-traffic related parameters have an impact on safety too, such as day/night, state of the road (dry/wet), etc. Yet, in most studies, not all parameters are available or considered. In this paper, individual traffic, road weather and crash data are considered on a Swiss canton (Vaud). All data sources are available for at least 4 years (2002 - 2005) on more than 200 km of motorways.

40|$|<b>Safety</b> Performance <b>Indicators</b> for roads; Searching for a {{quantitative}} road safety assessment method. <b>Safety</b> Performance <b>Indicators</b> (SPIs) are {{factors that have}} a strong causal relationship with road safety. Typical of SPIs for roads is that different road features in varying combinations can influence {{the safety of a}} road. In a multi-year project SWOV performs research into data and existing initiatives in the field of SPIs. This is done with the purpose to develop a new method to quantitatively describe, evaluate and monitor the road safety of the road network and road design. In the second year of this research project the central question was: How can the road safety of existing and future roads be integrally measured and assessed ? For an answer to this question, the authors first searched for possible SPIs for the road safety of roads. They performed a zero measurement and a pilot monitor of the two most appropriate tools: the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> and VSGS (Safe Speeds, Credible Limits). The Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> can be used {{to determine the extent to}} which the layout of a road conforms to the requirements of sustainable safety. VSGS is a tool to assess ‘safe speeds and credible speed limits’. In this framework, the following activities were carried out: 1. The Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> and VSGS were used to assess a total of 154 roads in the Dutch towns Harderwijk en Leeuwarden; these roads were urban 50 km/h roads. 2. For each road the crash density was determined based on the registration of serious road injuries during the period 1998 - 2009. 3. The convergent validity of the instruments was determined. 4. The relationship between the scores of the instruments and crash density was determined (impression). This research failed to establish a relationship between Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> scores, the VSGS scores and the crash rate. Because essential recent data on traffic volume and speeds driven was unavailable in this study, we have been unable to determine to what extent the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> or VSGS are valid instruments that can be used to classify composite features of road infrastructure as SPIs. However, a relationship was found between Sustainable Safety scores of roads, safe speeds and credible speed limits, which can be interpreted in terms of road safety. Recommendations of this study were: 1. Not all relations between the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator,</b> VSGS and crash density that were found in this study are entirely explicable. Follow-up research, in which traffic volume and actual speeds driven are also included, is necessary in order to determine the extent to which these instruments can explain risk differences. 2. The ultimate goal is to determine SPI’s for urban infrastructure that can be used to quantitatively describe, assess and monitor the (road safety) quality of the road network and road design. This requires further study into among other things: a. The development of the traffic safety on different types of sustainably safe roads: is the road layout partly or fully in accordance with Sustainable Safety requirements ? Are these roads safer than roads without a sustainably safe layout? And: can these road safety relationships be determined with the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> and/or VSGS ? b. The relationship between the individual features that are included in the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> and VSGS on the one hand, and road safety on the other (which features are/are not decisive in the relationship with road safety ?) c. The question of whether the safety of a road is determined by the most extreme (high or low) value of a road feature, or by the calculated average for the entire road. In addition, additional research is required on the relationship between, the scores of the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> and VSGS in relation with speeds driven and traffic volume on the one hand, and the risk of a (serious) crash on the other hand. d. The suitability of the Sustainable <b>Safety</b> <b>Indicator</b> scores and VSGS-scores as an alternative for road crash data to assess the road safety of roads: are all features that are measured relevant as a measure of safety ? And: are the results of both instruments valid when it comes to a demonstrable relationship with road safety ? An important prerequisite is that the quality (registration rate, substantive registration of facts) of the crash registration increases...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{is concern}} that many {{national}} non-fatal injury indicators currently in use are misleading. Objective: To {{make the case}} for the validation of existing unvalidated indicators, as well as the validation of new indicators before they are promulgated. Method: The International Collaborative Effort on Injury Statistics (ICE) Criteria were used for investigating the validity of indicators. Examples of indicators that {{have been found to be}} valid using these criteria are presented. In contrast, examples of national road <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> are also presented, whose validity is questionable. Trends in road <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> with and without threats to validity are contrasted. Results: The New Zealand Injury Prevention Strategy (NZIPS) serious injury indicators are presented as indicators with no identifiable threats to validity. National road <b>safety</b> <b>indicators</b> from Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, with identifiable threats to validity, are also presented. When trends for the valid NZIPS motor vehicle traffic crash indicators are compared with the New Zealand national road <b>safety</b> <b>indicators,</b> which have identifiable threats to validity, they show contrasting trends. This raises concerns that the current national indicators are potentially misleading. Conclusion: Validation does matter. For any indicator, it is important that it is clearly defined and specified. The specification should make it clear what parameter the indicator aims to reflect. Before use, the indicator should be validated against this target parameter. That parameter, and the indicators aimed to estimate it, should focus attention on important injuries, ie. injuries that are associated with significant mortality, threat-to-life, threat-of-disablement, loss of quality of life, or increased cost...|$|R
