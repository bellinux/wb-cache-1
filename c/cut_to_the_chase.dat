2500|$|In October 2017, Nyong'o {{wrote an}} op-ed with New York Times {{revealing}} that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed her twice in 2011, {{while she was}} still a student at Yale School of Drama. She claimed that Weinstein led her to his bedroom and announced that he wanted to give her a complete body massage, which she declined and, panicked, offered him one. Nyong'o also claimed that Weinstein wanted to take off his pants, when she rejected his advances and left the room terrified. Another encounter took place in New York, where she met with Weinstein for dinner after a screening. She quoted Weinstein: [...] "Let’s <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chase.</b> I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal." [...] She again declined and left the restaurant. She vowed that she would never work with Weinstein, hence her declining a role in Southpaw (2015). Nyong'o mentioned that she hasn't had any more encounters during her time in Hollywood and would rather work with women directors or male feminist directors, who have not abused their power.|$|E

It's no Toy Story 3, but Despicable Me is a solid alternative." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film two out of five stars, saying, [...] "So much is going on in this movie that, while there's nothing worth despising, there's not much to remember either." [...] Laremy Legel of Film.com gave the film an A-, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is darned cute. I know cute isn't to the lofty level of [...] "message storytelling" [...] but it can be entertaining to watch when done correctly." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Despicable doesn't measure up to Pixar at its best. Nonetheless, it's funny, clever and warmly animated with memorable characters." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times gave the film a B, saying, [...] "Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud craft a fun stretch run, wrapping the story with warm, fuzzy funnies and nothing to suggest a sequel, which is probably wise." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a B, saying, [...] "Until the [...] "creep + orphans = happy family" [...] formula starts demanding abrupt, unconvincing character mutations, Despicable Me is a giddy joy." [...] Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "Everyone knows that the villains are usually the most interesting characters in any movie.
