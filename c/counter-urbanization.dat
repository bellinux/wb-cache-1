Sources of primary data were structured questionnaires, market survey, inter-views and observation of farm activities Descriptive statistics, multiple regression and gross margin analyses were tools employed in data analysis. Results show that <b>counter-urbanization</b> has accelerated agricultural intensification and cultivation of marginal lands. Population density is significant and inversely related to output, while farm size, fertilizer application and fallow length were directly related to output. Labour and cropping density have not significantly affected output. The marginal values of the variable inputs were measures of their efficiency usage. The average farm size, and output per hectare are less than those of non-migrants recorded six years ago. Major sources of farmland were leasing and borrowing as opposed to inheritance.

China is rapidly urbanizing again since the 1978 economic reforms of 1978, also compared to other countries. Given the sheer size of the country and the variation in urbanization over time, China is a real testing ground for the causes and consequences of urbanization which is precisely the topic of this issue. The causes and consequences of urbanization are subdivided in four themes: (i) technology, (ii) population dynamics and migration, (iii) transport & infrastructure, and (iv) the financial sector.

40|$|The {{relocation}} of businesses beyond the consolidated city {{is an important}} aspect of recent urbanization trends. With economic restructuring driven by suburbanization and <b>counter-urbanization,</b> Southern European metropolitan areas experienced distinct growth patterns compared with north-western Europe. The present study assesses the impact of recent changes in the spatial distribution of businesses on land-use structure, sprawl trends and land consumption in a Mediterranean urban region (Athens, Greece) with the aim to identify economic drivers of sprawl and to inform urban containment strategies. Businesses showed two distinct localization patterns: manufacture, publishing and transport companies, construction and hotels were concentrated in urban municipalities; real estate, finance, high-tech, telecommunication, mining and energy enterprises settled preferentially in suburban municipalities. Dispersed urban expansion mainly reflects the spatial {{relocation of}} economic activities with high returns on capital to cheaper land.

40|$|Small towns as a {{specific}} sector of the settlement system are observed from the demographical viewpoint on {{the territory of the}} South-Moravian Region (Czechia). Altogether 23 towns with 4, 000 to 12, 000 inhabitants were analysed. A long-term analysis (1869 – 2011; population censes) as well as the last development (2008 – 2012; population balances) are taken into account. A relatively stable role of small towns in the regional settlement system throughout the period when population censes has taken place and population increases in the contemporary period were stated. The first statement can be related to the rural character of the region where small towns play irreplaceable role. The last development shows that the population increase is directly proportional to the distance from the regional metropolis and inverse to the size of small towns. This corresponds to the concept centre – periphery and to current <b>counter-urbanization</b> trends. Recent demographic development supports the role of small towns in local and micro-regional identity and landscape memory in the era of globalization.

40|$|Change, not {{stability}} is the normal situation for rural population in Po-land, throughout Europe {{and in other}} more developed parts of the world. Rural communities experience population growth, decline, and/or increas-ing socio-demographic diversity in ways that challenge local institutions such as labor markets, schools, health care and local government. However, even though demographic changes can induce changes in other social and economic domains, demography is not destiny. Changes in population size and composition do not automatically and mechanistically result in changes in economic activity, poverty rates, farm land conversion, air and water pol-lution, and/or the utilization of government services. Rather, the impacts of population change are mediated by social structure, and by the larger national and international contexts in which rural localities are embedded. This article describes the main demographic trends and changes being experienced by rural Europe at the present time, and examines their potential impact on rural people and communities. I closely examine three of these trends that pose challenges and opportunities for rural communities: (a) population growth and international migration, (b) population ageing, and (c) urbanization and <b>counter-urbanization.</b> Then, using the case study of education, I explore the multiple outcomes that may result from changes in the size and composition of rural population at the community level...|$|E

The development of these resources at the individual and community levels is both an ultimate goal of sustainable rural development (RD), and a key means to pursue it.

We assert that the US lags behind the EU in recognising the value of social capital development, but that it could learn from EU experience in terms of alternative approaches and their successes or failures. Traditionally, policies which promote the enhancement of rural human capital and strengthen social capital in rural areas have failed to attract large-scale RD funding or prominence. They have, however, gained in credibility, and influence within the policy rhetoric, in recent years. We suggest that they deserve a higher profile in RD policies given likely future trends and challenges...|$|E
40|$|In all European {{countries}} {{there has}} been a significant emigration from the countryside and this has been particularly intense in some nations after the collapse of Communist regimes. On average every year more than 15. 000 Romanian people emigrate to other countries. The purpose of this paper was to investigate by a quantitative approach over the time 2007 - 2013 the main correlation between the emigration in all Romanian counties and financial supports allocated by the Common Agricultural Policy. The methodology has used a multiple regression model comparing Fixed Effect (FE) panel data to pooled Ordinary Least Square (OLS). Hausman’s test has pointed out as the FE approach has been the best in estimating the parameters of the multiple correlation. Findings have highlighted out a positive correlation between rural emigration and financial payments allocated by the first pillar of the CAP. The impact of financial supports allocated by the second pillar of the CAP has not implied any effects in reducing emigration from Romanian countryside. In general, less favoured rural areas, characterised by a low level of assets and investments have had the highest level of permanent emigration.

Research on evolution and development mechanism of world's classic megalopolises is of great importance for guiding Chinese megalopolises’ reasonable, efficient and sustainable urbanization tracks. The development course of the world megalopolises reflects the spectacular evolution of urbanization process. With the rise of the city center and surrounding small towns, megalopolitan regions are formed and display the utilization of natural resources, market mechanisms, and planning visions to shape better living and working environments. In this paper, we intend to figure out the evolution and development mechanism of world's classic megalopolises as policy directions to content with the needs in the fast process of urbanization in China. First, the concept of world's megalopolises is introduced, followed by a description of the evolution of megalopolitan systems. Then the development mechanism of megalopolis is presented including its spatial structure layout, economy and industry layout, transportation development, as well as associated planning and regulations issues. Finally, this paper concludes the geographical and industrial advantages of megalopolis, figured out its new layout and allocation driven by tertiary industry where a new format of industrial chain is developed in compatible and complementary pattern. This paper also pointed out that megalopolises started the <b>counter-urbanization</b> strategy to relieve the crisis of excessive consumption of resources. Most metropolises worked out a coordination mechanism in line with their specific implementation at regional levels. Last, this paper concludes that the {{development of}} every megalopolis substantially relied on efficient and multi-dimension transportation systems...|$|E

40|$|It is a {{fact that}} the urban sprawl, known as the process of gradual spread out of {{urbanization}} has become a worldwide phenomenon. The growing consumption of land, {{as a result of the}} extension of highway networks, open up vast space of territory, which seems to have become an unstoppable cancer, and affects virtually all the contemporary metropolis. The expansion of the cities had its origin in the model of suburban life, which began with the generalized use of the automobile. A lifestyle based on the "american dream", one single family-home, one (or more) car (s). " But it has been since late 70 ’s of the last century, when it has had a more dramatic development, as a consequence of the crisis of metropolitan areas linked to what, it is called Post-Fordism economy and some authors have characterized as <b>counter-urbanization</b> (Berry) desurbanization (Berg), edge-cities (Garreau) metapolis (Asher) or diffuse city (Indovina). Despite the diversity of urban development, the increasing consumption of land, the excessive use of land as a scarce resource, it is a constant in the urbanization process in the early twenty-first century. The object of our contribution is to make an overwiew about urban sprawl in USA, Mexico and Spain. The use of technologies related to satellite imagery (remote sensing) allow the characterization of the phenomenon of consumption, pathological or not, of land. And this analysis suggests some hypothesis about the plurality of the contemporary urbanization processes. Roughly two models stand out: On one hand, urban development based on low densities, where the unsustainable consumption of land is presented as a paradigm of economic development and, on the other hand, an urban development with a compact city model, where recycling land, and not just increasing the consumption of land, is one of the key objectives of urban policies.

40|$|Rouen: spatial {{extension}} and quantitative slackening of <b>counter-urbanization</b> Central Pays de Caux (cantons of Fauville and Yvetot) is very {{representative of the}} inversion of population growth {{at the expense of}} towns and to the benefit of country, which occurred in France during the decade 1970 - 1980. Because demographic rural growth is basically the result of a positive migratory balance, the analysis of migrations is particularly instructive. The first stage of the study is a systemic exploratory model in which immigration mainly consists in «rurbanisation» (counterurbanisation) from large cities, in return of adults born in country and in population coming from "deep Caux" (the more rural and urban-distant part of Caux), while emigration is essentially made up of young people. Two communes (Allouville-Bellefosse and Alvimare) have been selected for an analysis of migrations based on several sources: a special survey (a quarter of the households), the study of election file and planning permission file. The nature of migrants is first investigated (where are they coming from? where are they going to?, what are their age structure and occupations?) before the analysis of their motivations. Considering the results r of surveys, some premises of the model must be challenged. Counterurbanisation from Rouen is quite negligible and migration from "deep Caux" has been strongly reduced recently. Three main immigration shifts may be observed: The settling of workers coming from Yvetot and small industrial towns in the neighbouring Seine valley and more recently from Le Havre, because of cheap building land for sale in housing estates; a return of adults born in country (expected in the model, but less important than the first flow) which are settling preferably outside the housing estates, particularly the "white collars"; at last the coming of tertiary population mainly employed in services induced in villages by the population growth. Emigrants are mainly the young less than 25 years old who are leaving considering the lack of cheap rental houses in rural space, but also the elderly, {{because of the lack of}} amenities in scattered hamlets. The paper ends with an interrogation on prospects of population growth in suburban rural spaces. It seems that paradoxically the movement is quantitatively and globally slowing down, but carries on its spatial extension. Fruit Jean-Pierre.

Human mobility {{has long been a}} subject of social science since the colonization era until the upsurge of urbanization and globalization. People have become refugees, sojourners, migrants, tourists, and commuters in the age of increasing globalization,glocalization, and <b>counter-urbanization.</b> When tourism and migration are both examined as forms of mobility, a contextual perspective is adopted. This study establishes the connection between these two concepts. Destinations often lack human, social, and economic capital in early-stage tourism development. In an era of highly increased corporeal mobility, the manner in which inward migration to certain destinations influences tourism development and the overall progress of a destination should be investigated. Set in a remote county in inland rural China, where domestic tourism migrants are drawn from development opportunities driven by tourism industries,this study contextually addresses the issue. Specifically, this study investigates the phenomenon of tourism supply-induced mobility in an early-stage tourist destination in China, and identifies the experiences,expectations, and prospects of domestic tourism migrants {{as well as those of}} local communities. The relationship between tourism and migration is considered a causal one in this study, as permanent or temporary human mobility is viewed as an end result of tourism development. Furthermore,social capital broadly refers to the socio-cultural and political aspects of an individual and a community that are indispensable to personal and collective progression. The concept is categorized as a personal social network, institutional support, and community openness in this study. An initial conceptual framework was built on the literature review and research questions. The conceptual framework was subsequently revised and consolidated based on the findings of this study. Qualitative methods were utilized to collect and analyze data. In the analysis, the study follows a constructivist and relational paradigm, as well as integrates approaches in phenomenology and narrative inquiry for data analysis and interpretation. Results of this study present the experiences of entrepreneurial migrants and migrant employees in tourism in terms of decision making and managing various relationships,challenges, and future prospects. From the standpoint of tourism projects and community-based tourism development, results are provided in relation to the experiences of tourism actors and social capital. We conclude that early-stage destinations need to attract, select, and sustain human capital. Social capital has a vital role in this process. We also establish the relationship between mobility and social networks. This study contributes to the theoretical development of integrating social capital in tourism research, as well as connecting tourism research with the mobilities paradigm. Practically,this study provides policy and planning suggestions to tourism development and rural development in China. Future studies need to quantify the dimensions of tourism development, social capital, and mobility to generalize and operationalize the results. Situations in non-Chinese,particularly Western, contexts need to be further examined for comparison. School of Hotel and Tourism ManagementPh.

40|$|Studio Capital Region {{focuses on}} the {{challenges}} in the urban nodes of global networks, which {{could be part of}} centralized, decentralized or distributed structures. Despite its immediate association to governmental/administrative cities, Capital Region is a framework to undertake a comprehensive research into the spatial issues in the leading, transforming and/or emergent urban centres with their hinterland in the globalized networks of growth, sprawl, accumulation and even <b>counter-urbanization.</b> Within this framework, the city {{is considered to be a}} fundamental object of architecture. Hence, architectural production is considered to be a projection to the “project of the city” at large. The studio aims at investigating the latencies of architectural strategies by focusing on the site-specific situations conditioned by the mentioned complexity of capital regions. ” Within this framework of the design studio, the case of State Farm founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1925 portrays an actual urban potential that currently lies in the very centre of capital city of Turkey, Ankara. The State Farm was meant to portray the ambitions of modernization project of the country by creating an epitome of scientific agricultural production, industry and leisure annexed to the newly founded capital city’s urban desires. However, the idealism of nature as a complimentary binary to the urban order of the city was shattered by the pressure of rapid growth of the city starting from 1950 ’s. Because of the migration of masses of labour to the city after 1950 ’s and especially 1980 ’s, the city that was planned for 600. 000 inhabitants has reached the population of 4, 5 million in a couple of decades. Consequently, the State Farm Land also lost its role by becoming literally surrounded by urban settlements and being fragmented by land speculations. However, with the critical framework reflecting on the utopian basis of the project of modernity, I see the actual condition of the State Farm as a temporal projection on its initial ambitions, as it needs to be realigned with the changing demands of the society and the conditions of urban growth. Yet, it’s also fact that the city of Ankara also needs a review of those initial desires of urban speculation and growth to be brought in harmony with the urgency of re-establishing an urban ecology, which is also jeopardized by the degeneration of the public space due to the dominance of the transportation system by heavy prominence of private cars in the traffic. In Ankara, the changes in the economical and political patterns have resulted in an extremely fast growth of the population, which has manifested itself in a monotone urban sprawl, lacking diverse public program. The traditional idea of the city with its dense public centre with dwelling around is not valid anymore. The city needs accessible, low threshold public spaces and programs, as a line through the city. The state farm was the first example of transformation of agriculture by using scientific methods and modern technology. But today this area does not fulfil its purpose anymore, and has lost its meaning. Its purpose was to create a new society by bringing together, modern agricultural and industrial production techniques, combining them with leisure activities and developing an urban farm. This idea didn’t last very long, because of the changing society, behaviours and economy. The temporality of this vision is obvious when we look at the current state of the city. It has lost the quality of living in harmony with nature and also the idea of conquering nature and making it part of daily life. The city, which was meant to be a garden city, finally became a car city. This is why it’s meaningful to focus on the natural artefacts and re-qualify these. The main theme of the project is Utopia as a temporal projection. In my opinion it’s only valid for a certain period of time because of the changing society and the changing needs. It’s an illusion to think that a utopian projection lasts forever; therefore, I propose a model for temporal desires. The theme of temporality is translated into a spine of urban ecology that can facilitate many public and infrastructural programs in combination. One of the strategies applied to provide low threshold public spaces and improve the life quality in Ankara was to utilize the Ankara River as the armature or the spine of my proposal to enhance the public life on the green grounds of State Farm in the middle of the Anatolian steppe land. The unfolding of public programs on this spine will provide the city with an integral backbone of leisure zone stretched out along the east-west core of the city. Ankara River is a small river that runs through the city. Because of long time exposure to sewage and industrial pollutants, it is no longer viable as a water source for irrigation. The river splits Ankara almost in half and crosses through many neighbourhoods and the city’s lowlands. There are many bridges built over it throughout the city and in some instances it is completely covered and encased in a tunnel. The proposed plan is to re-qualify the riverbed of Ankara and adopt it as a backbone of diverse public programs to utilize it both as a social and ecological infrastructure for the city. Therefore, the scarce resource of water is used as the main organizing element for providing diverse programming to the city. This is done by widening the river for more infiltration and by installing a geo-membrane on the riverbed so the water doesn’t sink into the ground and stops the flow. Along the river, constructed wetlands need to be created to clean the water of the river, and the storm water. The constructed wetlands function as decentralized water treatment plants which constantly clean the water of the river and decrease substantially the pollution by the city. The clean water will then be used to create lakes. The lakes are combined with different public programs. For example the first lake, which is closest to the city centre is combined with a beach as the main program. Like the river, the beach has been approached as a spine with different programs connected to it. This ecology functions as a concert beach, with a rock centre as the main program; because of the many emerging rock bands and the lack of a suitable place where they can perform. Similar to the urban proposal and the beach, the design of the rock centre is conceived as a compact and functional armature, which allows for diverse spatial quality of the design. This building works as the proof of concept of architecture as the generator of social events and also exhibits the pursuit to create architectural singularities within the urban program. The goal of this way of dealing with the project of the city is to create a master plan for improving the quality of the public life as well as the water quality and ecological diversity of the city.

40|$|The {{concept of}} Region {{is one of}} the {{elements}} which has differentiated Regional Economics from other fields of Applied Economics. In spite of this, however, researchers in this field of economic analysis have not paid {{a great deal of attention}} to this concept. All too often, Regions have been identified with the politico-administrative units into which nationstates have divided their territory and for which statistical information is widely available. However, a Region can be defined in many different ways. Frameworks which define regions according to analytical/theoretical criteria provide greater scope for applied studies and permit a more complete interpretation of the results contained therein. 	In this research we have proposed a concept of Region which goes beyond the administrative division of territory. Our regional aggregation has been based on agglomeration economies, one of the fundamental concepts in the fields of Economic Geography and Urban and Regional Economics. In accordance with the work of Polèse et al. (2007), the territory has been classified into analytical regions which take into account the size of the population and the distance from the main urban areas. In doing so, we achieve an aggregation which corresponds with the differences in agglomeration economies across space. However, their robustness in comparison with the administrative units commonly used has - to date - not been evaluated. The objective of the first chapter of this thesis was to prove that the functional regions defined under such economic criteria provide better defined regions - in terms of greater compactness and separation - than the administrative ones commonly used to carry out labour market studies at sub-national level. 	Using micro data from the last available Spanish Census, the functional and administrative regions are evaluated using the Theil index and the Davies-Bouldin Validation index. Applied to employment (by gender, industry and level of qualification and occupation), both indexes show better results for the analytical regions than for any of the ordinary administrative ones (NUTS I, II or III regions). In other words, the analytical classification generates areas where the distribution of employment is more homogeneous within and more heterogeneous between the regions. Agglomeration economies and distance (to the metropolis) seem to be relevant for understanding the patterns of distribution of employment, either by gender, by industry or by level of qualification and occupation. In practice, this provides a clearer way for identifying local labour markets and explaining their differences and similarities. In light of the results from the first chapter, we suggest the use of this alternative classification -subject, of course, to the availability of data - when carrying out Labour Economics studies that include a spatial dimension. 	The following chapters have provided two applications of this analytical division of the territory to Labour Economics issues: the factors affecting the probability of being employed (Chapter 2) and the effects that labour mobility and commuting have on the central regions (Chapter 3). 	In the second chapter, we presented a spatial analysis of employment at local level where, among other factors, the demographic and geographical characteristics can and do affect the outcome. The empirical results support the hypothesis that size - in terms of population - and location - in terms of distance to a metropolis - are explanatory variables for the probability of being employed. In other words, employment depends not only on the personal characteristics of the individuals (level of education, age, sex, etc.) but also on the type of analytical region - as defined in Chapter 1 - where they live. 	Regarding the importance of location, our results show a significant gap in the chances of being employed between "central" and "peripheral" types of regions, i. e., the closer the region is to the metropolis, the higher the concentration of economic activity and therefore employment. Likewise, the types of regions, i. e., the closer the region is to the metropolis, the higher the concentration of economic activity and therefore employment. Likewise, the expected negative relationship between employment and the size of the region where the individual lives is confirmed, and this seems to be stronger for non-skilled individuals than for people with university studies. 	In terms of employability, the largest Spanish metropolitan areas (MA 1) seem to be enjoying the full benefits of agglomeration economies while the smaller metropolitan areas (MA 2) seem to be suffering their negative effects. Likewise, for urban areas that cannot be considered "metropolitan areas" (UA 1 and UA 2), size does not seem to be as important as their central-peripheral location. In rural areas (less than 50, 000 inhabitants), both size and distance seem to be relevant determinants of employability. In other words, regardless of the level of studies, there are fewer chances of being employed in rural areas as opposed to urban areas and in peripheral rural areas as opposed to central rural areas. 	Recognizing the importance of these spatially differentiated results should have a significant impact on current policy discussions, shifting the focus from general solutions to more spatially customized ones where size and location are considered. Just as differences in age, gender or industrial structure are taken into account in the design of employment policies (at national or local level), these results suggest that an additional spatial dimension that somehow includes the size and location of the local area where the person lives should be considered. 	Some important migration policy implications can also be derived when using these alternative functional regions to analyze the direct and indirect effects that the arrival of workers has in the core regions. Spain has experienced over the last two decades an intense arrival of both immigrants and in-migrants to its central regions, and as a consequence (though not exclusively) of these inflows, we can observe internal migrations and/or commuting to some areas that might be more attractive. 	Using the last available Census, the estimations for Spain of an input-output multi-regional model that includes the possibility of commuting show that the arrival of in- and im-migration to the core generates a set of effects induced by the redistribution of population among other regions. The arrival of workers from the periphery to the core provokes reallocations of residence in all cases (displacement effect). However, the intensity of these reallocations increases with size, which shows the existence of some agglomeration diseconomies associated with big cities. When the possibility of commuting is also considered, the arrival of workers from the periphery to the core generates the reallocation of both jobs (economic activity) and residences. The larger cities are the ones pushing out more residents to other areas, while keeping most of the jobs. In other words, they are becoming attractive areas to work in, but not to live in (due to, among other reasons, high housing costs, congestion or other negative externalities). The oppposite is true for the smaller cities, which are attractive for residing in but for working in. The distributional pattern of residences proves to be different to the distributional pattern of jobs. 	These results highlight the idea that the effects of the arrival of population are not only felt by the recipient region/city but may generate comparatively far larger effects on other regions in the form of internal migration and commuting flows, something that policy makers should bear in mind. 	To conclude, surpassing the administrative division of the territory, this classification manages to have explanatory power in spatial Labour Economics topics while including relevant geo-economic characteristics such as location and agglomeration economies. The use of this classification has proved to offer a better understanding of the patterns of distribution of employment (by gender, by industry or by level of qualification and occupation), job opportunities, and of the probabilities of being employed depending on the level of qualification or the degree of attractiveness of a region for working or living purposes. Some other questions spatially related to the performance of regional labour markets remain unanswered. 	Future lines of research include the application of this classification to the study of labour economic issues such as the determinants of unemployment, inter-industrial labour mobility or the existence of overqualification taking into account spatial factors (i. e. the type of analytical region where the potential worker lives) which are usually ignored. Agglomeration economies and distance play an important role in the location of economic activity, and therefore should affect the labour outcomes once the worker has decided to live in certain type of region. Obviously, such a decision does not have to be permanent, and workers can move in order to improve their labour opportunities. Therefore, a further possible question of relevance is the internal migration decisions between and within analytical regions. That is, can certain regularities be observed? Are people moving from peripheral regions to central or metropolitan areas or the other way round? Are internal migrations better explained in terms of size, i. e. in terms as <b>counter-urbanization</b> or urbanization? Are these movements linked to job opportunity decisions? Can we observe any differences according to their level of qualification? Even more, workers can be employed in a certain type of region but live in another, i. e., we could observe migration on a daily basis (commuting). Is one type of analytical region attracting workers or attracting residents? Do people tend to live and work in the same type of region? Could the analytical division be improved in order to specifically include the commuting criteria used in the local labour markets literature? We believe that these questions provide a fascinating and important future research agenda...|$|E
