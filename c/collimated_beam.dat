5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the illuminating light be collimated. Fig6 shows a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> of monochromatic light illuminating the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{a positive}} or converging lens in air focuses a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> travelling along the lens axis {{to a spot}} (known as the focal point) at a distance f from the lens. Conversely, a point source of light placed at the focal point is converted into a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> by the lens. These two cases are examples of image formation in lenses. In the former case, an object at an infinite distance (as represented by a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> of waves) is focused to an image at {{the focal point of}} the lens. In the latter, an object at the focal length distance from the lens is imaged at infinity. The plane perpendicular to the lens axis situated at a distance f from the lens is called the focal plane.|$|E

In addition to broad-beam experiments, we used <b>collimated</b> <b>beams</b> and ion-electron emission microscopy to investigate the phenomena on two types of memories with different feature size. Current spikes on the supply current were observed in both devices, also with <b>collimated</b> <b>beams,</b> whereas destructive events occurred only with broad beam. We show that current spikes do not originate from charge-pump capacitors, as previously suggested, and propose that destructive events are due {{to the effects of}} temporally close heavy-ion hits on distinct areas of the tested chips...|$|R
25|$|If {{the lens}} is {{biconvex}} or plano-convex, a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> of light {{passing through the}} lens converges to a spot (a focus) behind the lens. In this case, the lens is called a positive or converging lens. The distance from the lens to the spot is the focal length of the lens, which is commonly abbreviated f in diagrams and equations.|$|E
25|$|If {{the lens}} is biconcave or plano-concave, a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> of light {{passing through the}} lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a {{negative}} or diverging lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a particular point on the axis {{in front of the}} lens. The distance from this point to the lens is also known as the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called aspheric lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam,</b> produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E

25|$|One can {{visualize}} {{the case of}} linear birefringence (with two orthogonal linear propagation modes) with an incoming wave linearly polarized at a 45° angle to those modes. As a differential phase starts to accrue, the polarization becomes elliptical, eventually changing to purely circular polarization (90° phase difference), then to elliptical and eventually linear polarization (180° phase) perpendicular to the original polarization, then through circular again (270° phase), then elliptical with the original azimuth angle, and finally {{back to the original}} linearly polarized state (360° phase) where the cycle begins anew. In general the situation is more complicated and can be characterized as a rotation in the Poincaré sphere about the axis defined by the propagation modes. Examples for linear (blue), circular (red), and elliptical (yellow) birefringence are shown in the figure on the left. The total intensity and degree of polarization are unaffected. If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, the two polarization components of a <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> (or ray) can exit the material with a positional offset, even though their final propagation directions will be the same (assuming the entrance face and exit face are parallel). This is commonly viewed using calcite crystals, which present the viewer with two slightly offset images, in opposite polarizations, of an object behind the crystal. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669.|$|E

2500|$|A Class 1 laser is {{safe under}} all {{conditions}} of normal use.

[...] It is important to realize that certain lasers classified as Class1 may still pose a hazard when viewed with a telescope or microscope of sufficiently large aperture. [...] For example, a high-power laser with a very large <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> or very highly divergent beam may be classified as Class1 if the power that passes through the apertures defined in the standard is less than the AEL for Class1; however, an unsafe power level may be collected by a magnifying optic with larger aperture.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} study the inelastic {{scattering}} of the helium atom beam due only to single-phonon contributions, an energy analysis {{needs to be made}} of the scattered atoms. [...] The most popular {{way to do this is}} through the use of time-of-flight (TOF) analysis. [...] The TOF analysis requires the beam to be pulsed through the mechanical chopper, producing <b>collimated</b> <b>beam</b> 'packets' that have a 'time-of-flight' (TOF) to travel from the chopper to the detector. [...] The beams that scatter inelastically will lose some energy in their encounter with the surface and therefore have a different velocity after scattering than they were incident with. [...] The creation or annihilation of surface phonons can be measured, therefore, by the shifts in the energy of the scattered beam. [...] By changing the scattering angles or incident beam energy, it is possible to sample inelastic scattering at different values of energy and momentum transfer, mapping out the dispersion relations for the surface modes. [...] Analyzing the dispersion curves reveals sought-after information about the surface structure and bonding. [...] A TOF analysis plot would show intensity peaks as a function of time. [...] The main peak (with the highest intensity) is that for the unscattered helium beam 'packet'. [...] A peak to the left is that for the annihilation of a phonon.
