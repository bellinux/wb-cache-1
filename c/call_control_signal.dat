40|$|Abstract — SIP is a <b>call</b> <b>control</b> and <b>signalling</b> {{protocol}} {{that was}} adopted by the 3 GPP 1 to deliver IP multimedia services to the mobile network. Cross platform IP-telephony service creation is a challenging task. Although, the emergence of JAIN-SIP 2 has reinforced {{the development and implementation of}} platform-independent IP-telephony services, the development of advanced cross-platform SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) services including video-enabled services is more challenging. Several solutions are discussed in order to extend the ability of JAIN-SIP to enhance advanced and video-enabled service creation on multiple platforms. This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of a few advanced services using JAIN-SIP in cross-platform environment including Windows, OS X and Solaris, providing more details on our proposed solution and proposing the use of Web services (WS) to bring in more features to JAIN-SIP. Some simple and intermediate services are also presented for explanation of our approach...|$|R

40|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} Emergency Telecommunications Services (ETS) {{requirements}} and identifies, {{at a high}} level, potential areas of impact by the next generation ETS requirements on the Internet Protocol networks. The current Internet Engineering Task Force activities in support of ETS are summarized. Specifically, the support for real-time interactive services is summarized in the following key areas: <b>call</b> <b>control,</b> <b>signaling</b> and quality of service, security support, and priority treatment. The paper concludes {{with a discussion of}} the remaining key issues {{that need to be addressed}} in support of ETS. Background Functioning and effective telecommunications are required during and after disasters, be they natural or man-made. At present, the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) supports a set of capabilities called the Government Emergency Telecommunications Service (GETS) that can be used during and after national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) emergencies by authorized personnel. The National Communications System (NCS) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is the key federal agency responsible for the current GETS program. At present, GETS functionality is based on the circuit-switched technology employed in the traditional PSTN. However, the telecommunications industry and market are in the midst of a significant transformation to Internet Protocol (IP) -based networks and derivative converged applications. Hence, the current GETS capabilities must evolve to reflect this transformation. NCS has already initiated the planning of the next generation of Emergency Telecommunications Services (ETS) that will use the evolving capabilities of the IP networks. The scope of the next generation ETS includes packet-based services such as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), IP video and teleconferencing, and advanced non-realtime services such as email, file transfer, and Web server access. It is expected that packet-based services that are used for ETS will be provided some preference, e. g., higher priority for completion within the IP network, compared to the other non-ETS packet services.

40|$|Prior to the {{transmission}} of payload data in any multiple access system, there is generally a need to send control information such as scheduling assignments, transmission parameters and HARQ acknowledgments. This process is <b>called</b> <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> and has {{a significant impact on}} the overall system performance. This dissertation considers different aspects of <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> and proposes some novel schemes for improving it. The dissertation is split into two parts where in the first part the focus is on {{the transmission}} of scheduling assignments, and in the second part the focus is on improving the “blind decoding” process that is used to achieve adaptive coding and modulation in transmission of control information. More specifically, in the first part of the dissertation we first compare the two conventional schemes for <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> using extensive system simulations. In doing so, we use practical assumptions on the scheduling algorithm as well as on the compression and transmission of the scheduling information. We then provide two schemes for reducing the amount of <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> that concerns {{the transmission of}} scheduling assignments. The first scheme, which is reminiscent of source coding with side information, uses the knowledge that each user has about its own channel condition to compress the scheduling information more effectively. The second scheme uses the fact that in wireless multiple access systems, a user with a given channel condition can in principle decode the data intended to the users that have weaker channels. Therefore, the idea is to send the scheduling information of different terminals in a differential manner starting from the user with the weakest channel and letting all the terminals overhear the transmission of one another. Finally, in the last section of this part we use some of the recent results in information theory to form a general framework for the comparison of different <b>control</b> <b>signaling</b> schemes. We formulate an optimization problem that for a given desired error probability finds the minimum required number of channel uses for a given signaling scheme. In the second part of the thesis, we propose three schemes for reducing the complexity of the blind decoding process. The first one is a novel scheme for fast blind identification of channel codes. More precisely, we propose an efficient algorithm that for a given sequence of received symbols and a given linear channel code, finds the posterior probability that all the parity check relations of the code aresatisfied. We then use this quantity to perform a sequential statistical hypotheses test that reduces the computational complexity of blind decoding. The idea in the second scheme is to broadcast a control message prior to the transmission of control information to instruct only a subset of the terminals (ideally only those terminals that have been scheduled for reception of payload data and hence benefit from performing a blind search attempt) to perform blind search decoding, which can be used for instance in LTE to reduce the complexity of the blind decoding process. Finally, in the third scheme we propose to split the CRC, used by the terminals to find their control information, into two parts and inject one part early in the control data stream so that the terminals can detect early if the current decoding attempt will be successful, which ultimately reduces the blind decoding complexity...|$|R

30|$|We {{design the}} MDs by {{explicitly}} exploiting the layered {{construction of the}} <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> In particular, we first generate a quantized control vector based {{on the principles of}} PPC. This vector contains the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and N− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Then, we construct M descriptions based on this control vector. The descriptions are constructed so that the current <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> and J− 1 future <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> can be obtained by combining any subset of J∈{ 1,, M} descriptions. Thus, the more packets that are received at the plant, the more future plant predictions become available. Note that on reception of at least one packet out of the M packets, the current quantized <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> can be completely recovered at the plant input side. When receiving and combining more descriptions, the quality of this <b>control</b> <b>signal</b> is not improved. Instead new <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> become available. With this approach, we thus avoid the issue of having to guarantee stability subject to a probabilistic and time-varying accuracy of the <b>control</b> <b>signals.</b> Instead, we can use ideas from quantized PPC, when assessing the stability.

40|$|Telephony used to mean using a {{telephone}} to call another telephone on the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), and data networks were used purely to allow computers to communicate. However, {{with the advent}} of the Internet, telephony services have been extended to run on data networks. Telephone calls within the IP network are known as Voice over IP. These calls are carried by a number of protocols, with the most popular ones currently being Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and H. 323. Calls can be made from the IP network to the PSTN and vice versa through the use of a gateway. The gateway translates the packets from the IP network to circuits on the PSTN and vice versa to facilitate calls between the two networks. Gateways have evolved and are now split into two entities using the master/slave architecture. The master is an intelligent Media Gateway Controller (MGC) that handles the <b>call</b> <b>control</b> and <b>signalling.</b> The slave is a "dumb" Media Gateway (MG) that handles the translation of the media. The current gateway control protocols in use are Megaco/H. 248, MGCP and Skinny. These protocols have proved themselves on the edge of the network. Furthermore, since they communicate with the call signalling VoIP protocols as well as the PSTN, they have to be the lingua franca between the two networks. Within the VoIP network, the numbers of call signalling protocols make it difficult to communicate with each other and to create services. This research investigates the use of Gateway Control Protocols as the lowest common denominator between the call signalling protocols SIP and H. 323. More specifically, it uses MGCP to investigate service creation. It also considers the use of MGCP as a protocol translator between SIP and H. 323. A service was created using MGCP to allow H. 323 endpoints to send Short Message Service (SMS) messages. This service was then extended with minimal effort to SIP endpoints. This service investigated MGCP’s ability to handle <b>call</b> <b>control</b> from the H. 323 and SIP endpoints. An MGC was then successfully used to perform as a protocol translator between SIP and H. 323. ...|$|R
