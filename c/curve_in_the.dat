Arches National Park is {{so named because}} of over 2000 natural arches inside park boundaries. While the highway does offer views of several features in the park, there is no park access along the highway.

5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth <b>curve</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve at a speed {{proportional}} to the curvature.

Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E

5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to <b>curve.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E
5|$|M-204 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved {{by the middle}} of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to smooth out a <b>curve</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road. A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to smooth out curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street or Old M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|Quainton Road {{station was}} built on a <b>curve</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line at the nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10km) {{northwest}} of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to Akeman Street. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a level crossing immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{had spent most of}} their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but {{it is likely that the}} station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.|$|E

The {{corresponding}} intersection graph has V as the set of vertices, and two vertices {{are connected}} by an edge {{if and only if}} the two corresponding <b>curves</b> intersect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane. It is shown that the set of intersection graphs of <b>curves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane is a proper subset of the set of all undirected graphs. Furthermore, the set of intersection graphs of straight line-segments is a proper subset of the set of the intersection graphs of <b>curves</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane. Finally, it is shown that for every k ≥ 3, the problem of determining whether an intersection graph of straight line-segments is k-colorable is NP-complete...|$|R

It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light <b>curve</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infrared and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} 1860s to just before World War II {{passengers}} could ride to Kittanning Point station near the Curve. Two branch railroads {{connected to the}} main line at Horseshoe <b>Curve</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century; the Kittanning Run Railroad and the railroad owned by the Glen White Coal and Lumber Company followed their respective creeks to nearby coal mines. The Pennsylvania Railroad delivered empty hopper cars to the Kittanning Point station which the two railroads returned loaded with coal. Across from the station, a spur track on the hillside supplied a coal trestle, where trains could take on fuel and water during the early 1900s. A reservoir was built {{at the apex of}} the Horseshoe Curve in 1887 for the city of Altoona; a second reservoir, below the first, was finished in 1896. The third reservoir, Lake Altoona, was completed by 1913. A macadam road to the curve was opened in 1932 allowing access for visitors, and a gift shop was built in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles <b>curve</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E
