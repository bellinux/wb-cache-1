2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was flat-sided, {{built up}} around four longerons which {{were made of}} spruce at the rear and ash forward of the cockpit. [...] Behind the cockpit, the fuselage narrowed in plan view in a gently <b>curved</b> <b>way</b> to the tail, but less usually Comper made the fuselage reduce in depth also; whilst the upper longeron was horizontal with the aircraft in flying position, the lower one was angled upwards. [...] The fin and rudder formed an approximate quadrant, though the unbalanced rudder extended down between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. [...] The nearly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper longeron. A standard curved decking, built up with stringers over frames topped the fuselage from front to rear. Forward of the cockpit the lower longerons curved strongly upwards and inwards, meeting the now inward curving upper members at the engine bulkhead, on which was mounted the 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub I flat-twin driving a two-bladed small diameter propeller. The single axle undercarriage was mounted {{on a pair of}} short V-shaped legs, each V cut out of plywood and mounted vertically on the lower longerons, so that the track was about 4ft (1.22 m). The CLA.2 sat close to the ground, with its wheels only slightly ahead of and below the wing leading edge.|$|E

The other approach generates a flat noise spectrum above the masking threshold. The noise power is not equally distributed over the frequency range, hence it is audible to various extents at different frequencies. ...|$|R
