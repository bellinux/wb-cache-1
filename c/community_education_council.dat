[...] According to Soni Sangha, the councils are mainly obscure and unknown to many parents, their forums are not well-attended, and they meet with the citywide schools chancellor.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{has three}} strands: an {{investigation}} into policy and practice in <b>community</b> <b>education,</b> with particular reference to Derbyshire; an exploration of a rationale for setting debate about the concept of community/education within a discourse of spirituality; an autobiographical/ reflective narrative which seeks to explain how professional and personal interests underpinning the first two strands became interwoven in their present form, and with what consequences for the content {{and structure of the}} thesis. Its core comprises the empirical work in chapters three to six. Based on information derived from questionnaires, interviews, participant observation, minutes and reports, this describes and analyzes {{the development and implementation of}} Derbyshire's <b>community</b> <b>education</b> policy. The role of the Community Tutor is highlighted, together with the perceptions of Tutors and lay members of <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Councils</b> of the work in which they were engaged. The latter appear as a SWOT analysis, intended to inform continuing practice. Chapter two contextualizes the empirical section by providing an historical overview of ideas and issues that have influenced the development of education, and especially of community schooling, in England. It discusses a number of typologies of <b>community</b> <b>education.</b> Chapters one and seven articulate a personal understanding of `spirit', its place in contemporary thought, and its possible relationship with `community'. Chapter eight focuses on community itself. It suggests that an `abstract quality'is often sensed in community activities. This influences the use of the term but is not encapsulated in existing definitions. It may be understood in terms of spirituality. Chapter nine draws the strands together. It illustrates how a spiritual dimension might be added to one particular typology, and explores a possible relationship between existing discourses in <b>community</b> <b>education</b> and concepts of spirituality. Implications for practice are noted. Parallels are drawn between the content of the thesis and the process of writing it. Finally, chapter ten provides an update on recent developments in Derbyshire and locates them within the broader context of human development...|$|R

50|$|In 1999 a UK wide {{organisation}} {{responsible for}} setting professional training standards for all education and development practitioners working within local communities was established and recognised by the Labour Government.

Its first chair was Charlie McConnell, the Chief Executive of the Scottish <b>Community</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Council,</b> who had played a lead role in bringing together a range of occupational interests under a single national training standards body, including community education, community development and development education. The inclusion of community development was significant as it was initially uncertain {{as to whether it}} would join the NTO for Social Care. The Community Learning and Development NTO represented all the main employers, trades unions, professional associations and national development agencies working in this area across the four nations of the UK.|$|E

30|$|<b>Community</b> <b>education</b> {{programs}} are a passive educational {{process of the}} Victorian government that ostensibly fulfil requirements under the Act. The {{programs are}} designed in coordination with other educational programs run by individual councils, those programs generally targeting school-age children and their guardians. <b>Community</b> <b>education</b> programs typically focus on safety around dogs with a particular focus on preventing the human incidence of dog bite and attack in the community, together with general advice on responsible dog ownership. Importantly, the programs usually focus on human welfare rather than the prevention of dog-to-dog bites and attacks. Each <b>community</b> <b>education</b> program is generally delineated by species and run as an isolated program over a long timeframe, relying {{in large part on}} the execution of the education programs documented in each council’s Domestic Animal Management Plan. Due to each Plan’s four year duration and the inconsistent commitment to resourcing animal management across councils, these documented council-run education programs may bear little relation to what <b>education</b> programs <b>councils</b> actually implement. Consequently, the Victorian government’s reliance on these programs in the formulation of their <b>community</b> <b>education</b> programs inadvertently exposes the community to gaps in awareness and a heightened risk of dog bite. The Victorian government-run <b>community</b> <b>education</b> programs themselves have long lead-times and, due to their necessarily broad appeal, suffer from a tenuous linkage to any actual downstream community benefits. Unsurprisingly then, the Victorian government-run <b>community</b> <b>education</b> programs are typically subject to fickle political commitment with no clear outcome in mind at commencement.|$|R
