50|$|Cyprus {{supported}} the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Belgrade to start EU accession talks by December 2012. The Foreign Minister of Cyprus Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis underlined the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Presidency's</b> priority on enlargement {{in a state}} visit in Belgrade in July 2012, including the Western Balkans region and Serbia.|$|R
50|$|In April 2009, he was {{appointed}} by the President of the Republic of Cyprus, as the Head of the <b>Cyprus</b> EU <b>Presidency</b> Secretariat, directly reporting to the President, responsible for the coordination of the preparations for the Cypriot Presidency of the Council of the EU {{in the second half}} of 2012. The Presidency rotates every six months and cooperation closer than before is provided for among the three Member States holding the Presidency in turn. The next Trio Presidency consists of Poland, Denmark and <b>Cyprus</b> (List of <b>Presidencies</b> until 2020) and the most important task for the three-Presidency team is to work out a common 18-month programme of the Trio.|$|R
50|$|Cyprus {{is one of}} {{the five}} European Union {{countries}} that does not recognise Kosovo's independence. During its EU <b>presidency,</b> <b>Cyprus</b> has not changed its policy towards Kosovo and continues to support Serbia on its European integration course. The Cypriot Minister of Commerce assessed that Serbia should be given more time to fulfil the European Council and Commission's conditions set for commencement of the accession negotiations. If those conditions are fulfilled, Cyprus will continue to support Serbia.|$|R
50|$|As from 2004 Cyprus {{has been}} a full member of the European Union. As Chinese {{officials}} have announced <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Presidency</b> of the EU from July 2012 {{has been a}} chance for China to count on a trustful friend {{to bridge the gap}} between China and Europe and serve as a middle link in this effort. Already Cyprus Government has liberalized the Foreign Direct Investment policy for not only EU Nationals. Administrative procedures have been simplified and no limitations apply in most sectors of the economy. Consequently, foreign companies now have the opportunity of investing and establishing business in Cyprus on equal terms with local investors. Further to that a new policy has been implemented allowing Chinese property buyers applying for a Permanent Residence with a minimum investment of 300,000 Euros.|$|E
40|$|Despite several {{daunting}} obstacles, the {{low expectations}} {{and the high}} level of apprehension that accompanied the start of the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Presidency,</b> Thomas Linders and Steven Blockmans find in a new CEPS Commentary that the small, remote and politically divided island nevertheless succeeded in scoring a number of positive results, {{thanks in part to the}} country’s pragmatic approach to the job and the perpetual motion of the EU legislature. As a corrective instrument to big state politics in the EU, however, the role of the Presidency remains limited. This underscores the changed nature of the rotating Presidency of the the Council of the EU since the Lisbon Treaty entered into force. Despite several daunting obstacles, the low expectations and {{the high level of}} apprehension that accompanied the start of the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Presidency,</b> this CEPS Commentary by Thomas Linders and Steven Blockmans expresses surprise that the small, remote and politically divided island succeeded in scoring a number of positive results at all, thanks in part to the country’s pragmatic approach to the jo...|$|E
40|$|The {{launch of}} the book “Stitching the Buffer Zone” {{accompanied}} an exhibition {{of the same name}} at the Artos Gallery in Nicosia, Cyprus. Organized by the ARTos Foundation, the exhibition {{was part of a larger}} event entitled “Does Europe exist?” which took place from 1 – 15 November 2012 within the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>presidency</b> of the EU Council. Stitching the Buffer Zone was a collective exhibit which featured the works and installations of architects and urbanists Anna Grichting Solder, Maria Costi de Castrillo, Stephanie Keszi and Georgia Frangoudi and included models, plans, videos and installations illustrating the design scenarios and architectural and landscapes concepts for the future transformation of the Cyprus Buffer Zone...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{prospects}} and {{challenges facing the}} Republic of Cyprus in developing {{the discovery of a}} significant offshore gas field by Noble Energy in December 2011. This discovery came close {{on the heels of the}} major discoveries in adjacent offshore Israel, further astounding the international upstream exploration and production community who had largely overlooked the prospectivity of this area. For the Republic of Cyprus, whose economy is dominated by tourism and the service sector and overshadowed by Eurozone economic malaise, this discovery offers lower domestic energy costs and substantial export revenues. However, as is often the case with unexpected fortune, decisions on how best to develop such a resource for the benefit of a nation with a history of inter-ethnic tensions are not straightforward and further complicated by Cyprus’ geographic and geopolitical setting. Anastasios Giamouridis describes the status of the Aphrodite field and juxtaposes the logical process of progressively defining options for the development of the field and the export strategy for gas produced in excess of Cyprus’ modest current and future consumption needs with the rising expectations, not just of the Cypriot government but also neighbouring countries with either aspirations to share in this source of hydrocarbon wealth or openly disputing Cyprus’ sovereign hydrocarbon ownership rights. Anastasios introduces the pros and cons of future unitisation and joint development with Israel and examines the institutional capability of the Cypriot government to guide the monetisation of the resource at a time when it is also focused on <b>Cyprus’s</b> EU <b>Presidency</b> in the second half of 2012. </p...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{researches}} {{the position}} of the Republic of Cyprus in the European Union. It consists of three chapters. The first chapter describes Cyprus as a country that is divided into two parts, yet has become an EU member state. The chapter focuses on previous and current efforts for reunification of Cyprus; the process of adoption of the euro in Cyprus and the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>presidency</b> of the Council of the EU are mentioned as well. The second chapter compares Cyprus and the other EU member states using geographic, demographic, political and primarily economic indicators from before the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008. The last chapter studies changes in these indicators after 2008, and briefly describes the Cyprus' macroeconomic adjustment programme...|$|E
40|$|In 2011 Turkish {{officials}} began indicating {{their intention}} to suspend all contact with Cyprus’s presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU), slated {{for the second half}} of 2012, given the issues surrounding the unresolved Cyprus conflict. This came as the latest development in a long and arduous path of Turkey’s application for EU membership that began in 1987. This paper provides the context – the Cyprus conflict, Turkey’s EU accession negotiations, and the Cyprus reunification talks – in understanding the reasons and consequences of Ankara’s boycott of the <b>Cyprus</b> <b>presidency.</b> The article also considers the evolving nature {{and the role of the}} rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, especially after the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, and how this may have played into Turkey’s calculations in calling for the boycott...|$|E
40|$|Turkey’s {{intention}} to boycott <b>Cyprus</b> <b>presidency</b> of the EU Council {{in the second}} half of 2012 is a logical consequence of Ankara’s policy of not recognising the Republic of Cyprus. The boycott will have a negative but limited impact on Turkey-EU relations, and will not in practice significantly affect their intensity {{in the second half}}-year. The so-called positive agenda, a new co-operation mechanism between the EU and Turkey, offers a provisional way for the two sides to circumvent the formal obstacle for mutual contacts created by the Cyprus conflict. In itself, however, the launch of the positive agenda is not a breakthrough for Turkey’s integration with the EU. Any such breakthrough is unlikely to occur until progress is made in regulating the Cyprus conflict, and some member states change their attitude towards Turkey’s accession to the EU...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{influence}} of the European Union (EU) Presidency of Cyprus from July 1 st 2012 till the end of December 2012 on Turkey-EU relations. Firstly, it analyzes the role of the Cyprus issue in Turkey-EU relationship, particularly after the accession of Cyprus to the EU in May 2004 without a resolution of the Cyprus issue. This caused a halt in negotiations between Turkey and the EU with regards to Cyprus issue, and the blockage of several chapters by France, whose former President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was against the full EU membership for Turkey. The article next evaluates the role of the “Positive Agenda”, which was introduced by the Commission in May 2012 to provide new communication channels between Turkey and the EU. Lastly, the influence of <b>Cyprus</b> <b>Presidency</b> on TurkeyEU relations and alternative scenarios for Turkey-EU relations after this period are discussed...|$|E
