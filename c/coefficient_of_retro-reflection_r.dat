For the case <b>of</b> Andreev <b>retro-reflection</b> we show that the graphene based Andreev billiard can be mapped to the normal metal-superconducting billiards with the same geometry.

40|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>retro-reflection</b> in light-pulse atom {{interferometry}} under microgravity conditions naturally {{leads to a}} double-diffraction scheme. The two pairs of counterpropagating beams induce simultaneously transitions with opposite momentum transfer that, when acting on atoms initially at rest, give rise to symmetric interferometer configurations where the total momentum transfer is automatically doubled and where a number of noise sources and systematic effects cancel out. Here we extend earlier implementations for Raman transitions {{to the case of}} Bragg diffraction. In contrast with the single-diffraction case, the existence of additional off-resonant transitions between resonantly connected states precludes the use of the adiabatic elimination technique. Nevertheless, {{we have been able to}} obtain analytic results even beyond the deep Bragg regime by employing the so-called "method of averaging," which can be applied to more general situations of this kind. Our results have been validated by comparison to numerical solutions of the basic equations describing the double-diffraction process.

40|$|Development and {{verification}} <b>of</b> a <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability {{function for}} a deformable unsaturated soil Shangyan Huang, S. L. Barbour, and D. G. Fredlund Abstract: The modelling of flow through saturated/unsaturated soils has become routine in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. The analysis {{requires that the}} <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability for an unsaturated soil be defined. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability can be estimated based on currently available procedures. However, each procedure has limitations and consequently cares should be taken {{in the selection of}} a proper procedure. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of a saturated soil is a function of void ratio. The <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of an unsaturated soil of constant volume, {{is a function of the}} degree of saturation. However, soil is deformable and both the degree of saturation and the void-ratio influence the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability of a compressible, unsaturated soil. In this paper, the literature pertaining to the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability function for an unsaturated soil of constant volume and the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability for a deformable saturated soil are reviewed. A new <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> permeability function for a deformable unsaturated porous medium is then developed.
