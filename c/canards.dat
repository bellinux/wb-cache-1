5|$|One E {{aircraft}} (AF Serial No. 56-0632) {{was modified}} as a testbed for various B-52 systems. Redesignated NB-52E, the aircraft was fitted with <b>canards</b> and a Load Alleviation and Mode Stabilization system (LAMS) which reduced airframe fatigue from wind gusts during low level flight. In one test, the aircraft flew 10knots (11.5mph, 18.5km/h) {{faster than the}} never exceed speed without damage because the <b>canards</b> eliminated 30% of vertical and 50% of horizontal vibrations caused by wind gusts.|$|E
5|$|Su-35UB: Two-seat trainer {{designed}} and built by KnAAPO. The single aircraft (T-10UBM-1) featured the <b>canards</b> and taller vertical tails of the Su-27M and a forward fuselage similar to the Su-30MKK. The Su-35UB also shared the avionics suite of the Su-30MKK, although it had a different fly-by-wire flight-control system to accommodate the <b>canards.</b> The aircraft was powered by AL-31FP engines with thrust-vectoring nozzles. Although a training aircraft, the Su-35UB {{was designed to be}} fully combat-capable.|$|E
5|$|In 1985 the Mirage IIIS fleet, nearing 20 {{years of}} {{operational}} service, began a major upgrade program {{to improve the}} capabilities of the aircraft. The interceptors were retro-fitted with <b>canards</b> manufactured by Israeli Aircraft Industries on the air intakes to improve maneuverability and stability at landing speeds, new avionics and countermeasures, and redesignated the Mirage IIIS C.70.|$|E

40|$|A {{generalized}} wind-tunnel {{model with}} <b>canard</b> and wing planforms typical of highly maneuverable aircraft was {{tested in the}} Langley 7 - by 10 -foot high-speed tunnel at a Mach number of 0. 30 {{to determine the effect}} of <b>canard</b> location, <b>canard</b> size, wing sweep, and <b>canard</b> strake on canard-wing interference to high angles of attack. The major results of this investigation may be summarized as follows: the high-canard configuration (excluding the <b>canard</b> strake and <b>canard</b> flap), for both the 60 deg and 44 deg swept leading-edge wings, produced the highest maximum lift coefficient and the most linear pitching-moment curves; substantially larger gains in the <b>canard</b> lift and total lift were obtained by adding a strake to the <b>canard</b> located below the wing chord plane rather than by adding a strake to the <b>canard</b> located above the wing chord plane...|$|R
5|$|Later {{production}} Tu-144 versions {{were more}} refined and competitive. They had retractable <b>canards</b> for better low-speed control, turbojet engines providing nearly the fuel efficiency {{and range of}} Concorde and {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|While sharing broadly the blended {{wing-body}} {{design of}} the Su-27, the Su-27M is visibly distinguished from the basic version {{by the addition of}} <b>canards,</b> which are small lifting surfaces, ahead of the wings. First tested in 1985 using an experimental aircraft, the <b>canards,</b> in complement with the reshaped wing leading-edge extension, redirected the airflow in such a way so as to eliminate buffeting at high angles of attack and allowed the airframe to sustain 10-g manoeuvres (as opposed to 9 g on the Su-27) without the need for additional structural reinforcement. More importantly, when working with the relaxed-stability design and the accompanying fly-by-wire flight-control system, the aerodynamic layout improved aircraft's manoeuvrability; it enabled the aircraft to briefly fly with its nose past the vertical while maintaining forward momentum. Because of this, theoretically, during combat the pilot could pitch the Su-27M up 120degrees in under two seconds and fire missiles at the target. Other notable visible changes compared to the T-10S design included taller vertical tails, provisions for in-flight refuelling and the use of two-wheel nose undercarriage to support the heavier airframe.|$|E
5|$|The Sukhoi Su-33 (-33; NATO {{reporting}} name: Flanker-D) is an all-weather carrier-based twin-engine {{air superiority}} fighter designed by Sukhoi and manufactured by Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association, {{derived from the}} Su-27 and initially known as the Su-27K. Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has <b>canards</b> and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable.|$|E

50|$|Gyroflug {{was founded}} in August 1978 to build and sell a two seat <b>canard</b> light {{aircraft}} of composite construction, the Gyroflug Speed <b>Canard.</b> The Speed <b>Canard</b> is similar in configuration to the popular American Rutan VariEze, but unlike the homebuilt VariEze, the <b>Canard</b> {{was intended to be}} factory built.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Canard</b> Street, {{also known}} as Route 341, runs through the {{community}} following the <b>Canard</b> River and is bisected in the middle by Route 358 which divides the community between Upper <b>Canard</b> {{to the west and}} Lower <b>Canard</b> to the east. The corner was known by the names of <b>Canard</b> Corner and Hamilton Corner but is best known by locals as [...] "Jaw Bone Corner". The name stems from a large set of whale jaw bones which were mounted at the crossroads after a whale stranded and died on the <b>Canard</b> River in the early 19th century.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Sukhoi {{embarked}} on a second modernization of the Su-27 {{to serve as an}} interim aircraft awaiting the development of the Sukhoi PAK FA (Su-57) program. Also known as Su-35, this derivative has a redesigned cockpit and weapons-control system compared to the Su-27M, and features thrust-vectoring engines in place of the omitted <b>canards.</b> The type made its first flight in February 2008. Although the aircraft was designed for export, the Russian Air Force in 2009 became the launch customer of the aircraft, the production version of which is designated Su-35S. China's People's Liberation Army Air Force is the sole foreign user of the aircraft. Other countries are reportedly in discussions with Russia about the possible purchase of the Su-35, among which is Indonesia, whose government is expected to sign a contract in the near future.|$|E
5|$|The first variant was {{designed}} during the 1980s as an upgrade of the Su-27, and was initially {{known as the}} Su-27M. This derivative incorporated <b>canards</b> and a multi-function radar that transformed the aircraft into a multi-role aircraft, and was structurally reinforced to support its heavier weight. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. As the aircraft was not mass produced due {{to the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, Sukhoi re-designated the aircraft as Su-35 to attract export orders. At the same time, the fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines installed, and the resultant Su-37 was used as a technology demonstrator. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that strongly resembled the Su-30MK family.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the <b>canards</b> (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted at}} Mach numbers of 0. 7 and 0. 9 to determine the lift interference effect of <b>canard</b> location on wing planforms typical of maneuvering fighter configurations. The <b>canard</b> had an exposed area of 16. 0 percent of the wing reference area and was located in {{the plane of the}} wing or in a position 18. 5 percent of the wing mean geometric chord above the wing plane. In addition, the <b>canard</b> could be located at two longitudinal stations. Two different wing planforms were tested: one with a leading-edge sweep angle of 60 deg and the other with a leading-edge sweep angle of 44 deg. The results indicated that although downwash from the <b>canard</b> reduced the wing lift at angles of attack up to approximately 16 deg, the total lift was substantially greater with the <b>canard</b> on than with the <b>canard</b> off. At angles of attack above 16 deg, the <b>canard</b> delayed the wing stall. Changing <b>canard</b> deflection had essentially no effect on the total lift, since the additional lift generated by the <b>canard</b> deflection was lost on the wing due to an increased downwash at the wing from the <b>canard...</b>|$|R

The <b>canard</b> was constructed with tubular spars, aluminum ribs and covered in standard aircraft fabric.|$|R
40|$|An {{approximate}} {{formula is}} derived {{for the position}} of the neutral point in <b>canard</b> aircraft.

5|$|The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N-20 was a semi-tailless {{swept wing}} jet {{similar to the}} U.S. Navy's Vought F7U Cutlass with four engines mounted {{internally}} in the wings, fold-out <b>canards</b> to improve its aerodynamics at slow speeds, and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200km/h, a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s. The FFA P-16 was a single-engine straight-wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100aircraft was awarded in 1958, but after the second crash of a pre-production model, the order was canceled. The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy loads, and the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself. In addition, {{by the middle of}} 1958, influenced by NATO concepts, the LVK had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter-air operations. Further, the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic (mobile) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons, for neither of which the P–16was suitable.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports <b>canards</b> that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have raised}} {{doubts about the}} use of <b>canards</b> on a low-observable design, stating that <b>canards</b> would {{guarantee}} radar detection and a compromise of stealth. However, <b>canards</b> and low-observability are not mutually exclusive designs. Northrop Grumman's proposal for the U.S. Navy's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) incorporated <b>canards</b> on a stealthy airframe. Lockheed Martin employed <b>canards</b> on a stealth airframe for the Joint Advanced Strike Technology (JAST) program during early development before dropping them due to complications with aircraft carrier recovery. McDonnell Douglas and NASA's X-36 featured <b>canards</b> and was considered to be extremely stealthy. Radar cross-section can be further reduced by controlling canard deflection through flight control software, as is done on the Eurofighter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the effect of <b>canard</b> setting angle on the aerodynamic characteristic of a Blended Wing Body (BWB). <b>Canard</b> effects to BWB aerodynamic characteristics are not widely investigated. Hence the focus of the study is to investigate the variations of lifts, drags and moments when the angles of attack are varied at different <b>canard</b> setting angles. Wind tunnel tests were performed on BWB aircraft with <b>canard</b> setting angles, δ ranging from- 20 ˚ to 20 ˚. Angles of attack, α were varied from- 10 ˚ to 10 ˚. Aspect ratio and <b>canard</b> planform area were kept fixed. All tests were conducted in the subsonic wind tunnel at Universiti Teknologi MARA, at Mach number of 0. 1. The streamlines flow, at the upper surface of the <b>canard</b> was visualized using mini tuft. Result shows that the lift coefficient does not change much with different <b>canard</b> setting angles. As expected, the lift coefficient increases with increasing angles of attack at any <b>canard</b> setting angle. In general, the moment coefficient increases as the <b>canard</b> setting angle is increased. The results obtained in this research will be of importance to the understanding of aerodynamic behavior of BWB employing <b>canard</b> in its configuration...|$|R

40|$|For {{the design}} and {{optimization}} of a <b>canard</b> for a three surface aircraft (TSA) a preliminary aircraft design code was extended by a higher-order panel method, a transonic data base and a trim routine suitable for a three surface aircraft. Preliminary aim of the <b>canard</b> study was the preliminary design of an optimum <b>canard</b> geometry for the DLR-F 11 TSA - wind tunnel model under the design constraints of a realistic aircraft. Based on the conventional design for the wind-tunnel model, the retrofit of the geometrically fixed aircraft with a <b>canard</b> was simulated. With sensitivity studies the influence of basic <b>canard</b> geometry parameters was analyzed. Based on an optimization calculation the best set of geometry parameters which provide minimum fuel weight were determined. The analyses show that a swept back <b>canard</b> in low position located downstream the divergent nose part of the body, with high aspect ratio, low taper ratio and moderate <b>canard</b> span promises optimum performance. In addition, the <b>canard</b> lift of the TSA configuration allows to realize higher cruise lift coefficients for an improved induced drag at transonic speeds without the risk of additional wave drag. However, without the control concept of a free-floating <b>canard,</b> the static margin decreases significantly with the integration of a <b>canard...</b>|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 116) This {{graduate study}} is about {{analysis of the}} static pitch stability of a <b>canard</b> configured aircraft which flies at low Reynolds number. Design assumptions of this project are numbers for the <b>canard</b> aircraft which was designed and built by CSUN 2011 aeronautics team (winner of 6 th place in 2011 AUVSI competition). After checking and simulating of several airfoils based on <b>canard</b> configuration requirements FX 63 - 137 and SD 7062 were chosen to use for <b>canard</b> and wing.
