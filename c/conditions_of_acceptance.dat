40|$|Critical Discourse Analysis has {{recently}} begun to consider the implications of research in Evolutionary Psychology for political communication. At least three positions have been taken: (i) that this research requires Critical Discourse Analysis to re-examine and defend some of its foundational assumptions (Chilton 2005); (ii) that this research provides a useful explanatory framework for Critical Discourse Analysis in which questions can be addressed why might speakers pursue particular discursive strategies and why they might be so persuasive (Hart 2010); and (iii) that findings bare little or no relevance for Critical Discourse Analysis (Wodak 2006). In this paper, I take up the first two of these positions and in doing so, of course, implicitly disagree with the third. I consider the positions in (i) and (ii), then, specifically in relation to Sperber's (2000, 2001) notion of a ‘logico-rhetorical' module. Taking the argument which Chilton makes concerning this module one stage further, I suggest that the logico-rhetorical module evolved as much for persuasion {{as it did for}} vigilance. I further suggest that the semantic category of evidentiality operationalised in media discourse is intended to satisfy the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> laid down by the logico-rhetorical module.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} I {{consider}} Unconditional Positive Regard (UPR) first {{as it was}} described by Carl R.

I then place my emphasis on activities especially pertinent to the momentary enactment of Unconditional Positive Regard, because as {{it is one of}} many possible modes of regarding, we {{need to know how to}} enter this particular mode. In the end, I hope to have helped answer questions a student therapist might have such as ‘What can I do to develop my capacity to have Unconditional Positive Regard for clients?’ THEORY OF CARL R. ROGERS Unconditional Positive Regard is a central concept in the theories of Carl R. Rogers, both for psychotherapy and for interpersonal relations. A universal need for positive regard by others appears at about the same time a person begins to experience awareness of self (Rogers, 1959). In therapy, UPR is a quality of the therapist’s experience toward the client (p. 239). Rogers ’ writing sheds light on various aspects of this construct: Unconditional One experiencing UPR holds ‘no <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> [...] . It is at the opposite pole from a selective evaluating attitude. ’ (p. 225...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{geothermal}} energy technology {{is still considered}} an emerging technology for energy generation. Like other emerging energy technologies, how the public perceive the technology and under what conditions {{they are likely to}} accept or oppose the technology, remains relatively unknown. In response, this exploratory research utilised online focus groups to identify: (1) the extent of agreement with geothermal technology before and after information, including media reports focusing on a range of the technology’s attributes; and (2) how the characteristics of individuals with different levels of agreement vary. After information, within the sample of 101 participants, fewer reported being unsure, the minority disagreed and the majority agreed. Overall, the preference was for projects to be located away from communities. Participants that disagreed or were unsure, {{were more likely to report}} lower subjective knowledge of the technology, lower perceived benefits and higher risks, and were less likely to believe people in their community would have the opportunity to participate in consultation.

30|$|Chinese {{courts have}} long adopted “case filing with {{screening}}”, 9 {{rather than with}} registration. 10 When screening disputes, courts (specifically, the judge responsible for filing a case) only {{have the opportunity to}} admit a portion of disputes through the operation of laws, in order to streamline the adjudication process. Some disputes are filtered in the process of case filing. Only filtered disputes can formally enter the legal process (Guo 2013). The above screening and filtering processes include a legal evaluation of the condition of a dispute, such as whether or not the dispute is under the scope of the case filing. If a case does not fall within the court’s responsibility, then it is not admitted. The legal evaluation of <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> is always transparent, while lower level courts keep the political conditions of admission hidden (political evaluation), {{as a result of the}} sensitivity of specific disputes as well as local policy. For instance, it is clearly acknowledged that the following types of disputes in the people’s court of County A must receive approvals by vice presidents before these cases can be filed: (1) disputes related to social and political stability, especially sensitive cases, and class suit (2) cases that must be heard for special reports by the Party Committees, the People’s Congresses, and the upper-level courts, (3) cases related to governmental matters above the level of country and street, or at the city level, and (4) other cases that need reporting. 11 The court office responsible for case filing cannot decide to admit these types of disputes, because they are related to political and social stability. Instead, such cases have to be checked by court leaders who have more sensitive political consciousness. Initially, courts would avoid controversial issues. A dispute that can be tried does not only depend on meeting legal conditions but also depends on meeting local requirements regarding social and political stability. This is referred to as “politically legal logic” (Ding 2014). In the process of a lower level legal practice, the legal process (including case filing) is a complicated organizational and political process where multiple subjects (e.g., presidents and vice presidents of courts, judges, local officials) all can exert influences. Legal procedures are usually influenced by local governments, while local political legitimacy to a large extent formalizes the operations of the legal process (Liu 2005). This fact also reflects the competition between the inner logics of the specific power relationship and legal operations in legal practice (Bourdieu 1999). Specifically, during a case-filing procedure, the competition is reflected by filtering out various disputes that are difficult for a trial resolution or related to the benefit of court-level governments. In other words, power constrains dispute qualification such as whether or not a case can be filed, whereas laws constrain the domain, such as the types of disputes and cases.|$|E
