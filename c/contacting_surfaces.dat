The {{first step in}} the algorithm simulates contact between a skin model and virtual objects, and computes the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> to be rendered. The accuracy of this surface is maximized by simulating soft skin with its characteristic nonlinear behavior.

40|$|Abstract Background Cell-cell {{communication}} and adhesion {{are essential for}} the compaction process of early stage embryos. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a non-invasive objective calculation system of embryo compaction in order to test the hypothesis that embryos with a larger mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> result in a higher live birth rate compared to embryos with a lower mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> Methods Multilevel images of 474 embryos transferred on day 3 were evaluated by the Cellify software. This software calculates the <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> between the blastomeres. The primary outcome of this study was live birth. An ideal range of <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> was determined and the positive and negative predictive value, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the curve for this new characteristic were calculated. Results In total, 115 (24 %) transferred embryos resulted in a live birth. Selection of an embryo for transfer on its mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> could predict live birth with a high sensitivity (80 %) and high negative predicting value (83 %) but with a low positive predictive value (27 %), a low specificity (31 %) and low area under the ROC curve (0. 56). The mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> of embryos cultured in a single medium was significantly higher compared to the mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> of embryos cultured in a sequential medium (p[*]=[*] 0. 0003). Conclusions Neither the mean <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> nor the number of <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> of a day 3 embryo had an additional value in the prediction of live birth. The type of culture medium, however, had an impact on the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> of an embryo.

A close inspection of these ions shows them to contain at least two separate populations: one population covers the energy range below about 400 eV, and a second population exists in a narrow energy band centered between 3 and 4 keV. Similar distributions are found in two regions upstream of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> It is postulated that the suprathermal ions observed upstream of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> were created at the <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> Sudden movements of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> in the cometary frame of reference, in response to changes in the magnetic field pressure, or cometary production rate, give rise to an induction electric field able to accelerate the local thermal cometary ions up into the tens of electron volts range.

Based on the {{background}} of Xinghai Bay Sea-crossing Suspension Bridge, it reviews the development process of Suspension Bridge anchorage and describes the static theory of gravity anchorage of suspension bridge. Using the soft ansys, a three-dimension finite element model of the suspension bridge anchorage is established to analyze the overall stability of the anchorage foundation, the displacement and stress conditions. The anchorage in various load conditions of displacement and stress is studied by numerical calculation and comparison. The analysis result shows that the first slip area {{is not in the}} outer end of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> and there is a certain distance. The area beginning to slip also increases with the loading nodes increasing.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{studying}} and modeling static friction coefficient (SFC) and dynamic friction coefficient (DFC) of wheat grain as affected by several treatments. Significance of single effect (SE) and dual interaction effect (DIE) of treatments (moisture content and <b>contact</b> <b>surface)</b> on SFC and, SE, DIE, and triple interaction effect (TIE) of treatments (moisture content, <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> and sliding velocity) on DFC were determined using statistical analysis methods. Multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling {{was employed to}} predict SFC and DFC on different <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Predictive ability of developed MLR models was evaluated using some statistical parameters (coefficient of determination (R 2), {{root mean square error}} (RMSE), and mean relative deviation modulus (MRDM)). Results indicated that significant increasing DIE of treatments on SFC was 3. 2 and 3 times greater than significant increasing SE of moisture content and <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> respectively. In case of DFC, the significant increasing TIE of treatments was 8. 8, 3. 7, and 8. 9 times greater than SE of moisture content, <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> and sliding velocity, respectively. It was also found that the SE of <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> on SFC was 1. 1 times greater than that of moisture content and the SE of <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> on DFC was 2. 4 times greater than that of moisture content or sliding velocity. According to the reasonable average of statistical parameters (R 2  =  0. 955, RMSE =  0. 01788 and MRDM =  3. 152 %), the SFC and DFC could be successfully predicted by suggested MLR models.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{stiffness}} enhancement methodology based on using a suitably designed <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> with which cantilevered-type conducting polymer bending actuators are in contact during operation. The <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> constrains the bending behaviour of the actuators. Depending on the topology of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> {{the resistance of the}} polymer actuators to deformation, i. e. stiffness, is varied. As opposed to their predecessors, these polymer actuators operate in air. Finite element analysis and modelling are used to quantify the effect of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> on the effective stiffness of a trilayer cantilevered beam, which represents a one-end-free, the-other-end-fixed polypyrrole (PPy) conducting polymer actuator under a uniformly distributed load. After demonstrating the feasibility of the adjustable stiffness concept, experiments were conducted to determine the stiffness of bending-type conducting polymer actuators in contact with a range (20 – 40 mm in radius) of circular <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The numerical and experimental results presented demonstrate that the stiffness of the actuators can be varied using a suitably profiled <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b> The larger the radius of the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> is, the higher is the stiffness of the polymer actuators. The outcomes of this study suggest that, although the stiffness of the artificial muscles considered in this study is constant for a given geometric size, and electrical and chemical operation conditions, it can be changed in a nonlinear fashion to suit the stiffness requirement of a considered application. The stiffness enhancement methodology can be extended to other ionic-type conducting polymer actuators...|$|R
