40|$|Water soluble organic {{nitrogen}} (WSON) compounds are ubiquitous in precipitation {{and in the}} planetary boundary layer, and therefore are a potential source of bioavailable reactive nitrogen. This paper examines weekly rain data {{over a period of}} 22 months from June 2005 to March 2007 collected in 2 types of rain <b>collector</b> (<b>bulk</b> deposition and “dry+wet ” deposition) located in a semi-rural area 15 km southwest of Edinburgh, UK (N 55 ° 51 ′ 44 ″, W 3 ° 12 ′ 19 ″). Bulk deposition collectors are denoted in this paper as “standard rain gauges”, and they are the design used in the UK national network for monitoring precipitation composition. “Dry+wet ” deposition collectors are flushing rain gauges and they are equipped with a rain detector (conductivity array), a spray nozzle, a 2 -way valve and two independent bottles to collect funnel washings (dry deposition) and true wet deposition. On average, for the 27 weekly samples with 3 valid replicates for the 2 types of collectors, dissolved {{organic nitrogen}} (DON) represented 23 % of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in bulk deposition. Dry deposition of particles and gas on the funnel surface, rather than rain, contributed over half of all N-containing species (inorganic and organic). Some discrepancies were found between bulk rain gauges and flushing rain gauges, for deposition of both TDN and DON, suggesting biological conversion and loss of inorganic N in the flushing samplers...|$|E
40|$|The key aims of {{this project}} were: (i) {{investigation}} of atmospheric nitrogen deposition, focused on discrimination between bulk, wet and dry deposition, and between particulate matter and gas phase, (ii) accurate quantification of the contributions of dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen to each type of deposition, and (iii) exploration of the origin and potential sources of atmospheric water soluble organic nitrogen (WSON). This project was particularly focused on the WSON fraction because, despite it being a potentially important source of bioavailable reactive nitrogen, {{a number of questions}} regarding its deposition mechanism (wet vs. dry), composition and origin (natural, anthropogenic or mixed) remain unanswered. There are two major difficulties in WSON determination: (i) the diversity of organic nitrogen compounds compared with the inorganic forms, and (ii) the lack of a direct determination method: the derivation of organic nitrogen concentrations in an aqueous sample involves the determination of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species concentration, comprising nitrate and ammonium, the determination of the total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration, and the subtraction of the DIN concentrations from the TDN concentration. TDN determination requires a preparatory digestion step: high-temperature catalytic oxidation was the method used in this study. Ion chromatography (IC) was the method of choice for nitrate determination, whilst ammonium determination was by IC for rain samples, and by flow injection analysis for air samples collected into aqueous media.

The second stage {{of this project}} was the investigation of in situ atmospheric concentrations of WSN species, both organic and inorganic. Simultaneous daily measurements of ammonium, nitrate and WSON were made between July and November 2008 at the same semi-rural site in south-east Scotland. Discrimination between material from the gas and particle phases was achieved by means of Cofer scrubbers and PTFE membrane filters, respectively. Average concentrations of NH 3 (determined as NH 4 +), NO 2 /HNO 3 (determined as NO 3 -) and WSON in the gas phase were 82 ± 54 nmol N m- 3, 2. 6 ± 2. 5 nmol N m- 3 and 18 ± 12 nmol N m- 3 respectively, and in the particle phase were 20 ± 24 nmol N m- 3, 10 ± 9 nmol N m- 3 and 8 ± 7 nmol N m- 3 respectively (± represent standard deviation across all valid daily samples, not error of triplicate samples). Except for oxidised inorganic N, average concentrations in the gas phase were larger than in the particle phase. No evidence of solely agricultural or solely combustion sources of WSON was found, as no correlation in either phase between WSON and either NH 4 + or NO 3 - could be established. The final stage of this project was to gain a broader picture of nitrogen deposition across Europe. Rain samples were analysed for TDN and DIN from a network of 21 different sampling locations, from the south of Portugal to the north of Finland. The average DON contribution across the 21 sampling sites was ~ 19 % and, according to the data gathered in this study, DON species appeared largely unrelated specifically to agricultural or to combustion nitrogen sources, although the results varied widely from site to site. Overall, this work has shown that ON and its deposition comprises a significant component of total atmospheric reactive nitrogen. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCalutrons were {{developed}} in the laboratory of E. O. Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley. They were a modification of the cyclotrons he had invented and used in his Noble Prize winning investigations of the atomic nucleus. At the time their construction was undertaken, calutrons represented the only certain means of preparing enriched uranium isotopes {{for the construction of}} a fission bomb. The effort was successful enough that every atom of the 42 kg of 235 U used in the first uranium bomb had passed through at least one stage of calutron separation. At peak production, the first stage separators, α tanks, yielded an aggregate 258 -g/d 235 U enriched to about 10 at. % from its natural abundance level of 0. 72 at. %. The second stage separators, β tanks, used the 10 at. % material as feedstock and produced a total 204 -g/d 235 U enriched to at least 80 at. %. The latter, weapons grade, material was used in fission bombs. Under typical operating conditions, each α tank operated at a uranium beam intensity at the collectors of approximately 20 mA and each β tank at a beam intensity of approximately 215 mA at the <b>collectors.</b> <b>Bulk</b> separation of isotopes for bomb production ceased in 1945. Since that time calutrons have been used to separate stable isotopes, but on a more limited scale than wartime weapons production.

The field collections lasted from October 2, 1984 to October 1, 1985. There was little difference in chemistry between samples obtained at the bulk-collector network and those from the <b>bulk</b> <b>collector</b> at the NADP site; the mean pH and conductivity were 4. 59 and 15. 1 µmhos/cm for the network and 4. 63 and 14. 0 µmhos/cm for the <b>bulk</b> <b>collector</b> at the NADP site. The network's aerial coverage included two physiographic zones, the Ouachita Mountains and the Gulf Coastal Plain. Precipitation in the two zones had small but statistically significant differences in chemistry. Despite the zonal differences, the NADP station should adequately represent trends in atmospheric deposition for the commercial forest lands of southeastern Oklahoma. In a comparison of collector types, bulk-collector samples had higher pH values than wetfall samples at the coastal-plain site, but wetfall samples at the mountain site had the higher pH values.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} deposition of nitrogen (N) {{in the environment}} is of great concern due to its impact on natural ecosystems including affecting vegetation, reducing biodiversity, increasing tree growth in forests, and the eutrophication of aquatic systems. Taking into account the average annual N emission into the atmosphere in Germany of about 2 million t N (ammonia/ammonium, NOx), and assuming homogeneous distribution throughout Germany, an average N deposition of 45 kg/ha x year can be calculated. Such high atmospheric N deposition could be confirmed by N balances from long-term field experiments in Central Germany (e. g., the Static Fertilization Experiment in Bad Lauchstädt). By contrast, estimates by standard methods indicate a deposition of only about 30 kg N/ha x year. This is because the standard methods are using wet-only or <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors,</b> which fail {{to take into account}} gaseous deposition and the direct uptake of atmospheric N by aerial plant parts. Therefore, a new system was developed using 15 N isotope dilution methodology to measure the actual total atmospheric N input into a soil/plant system (Integrated Total Nitrogen Input, ITNI). A soil/plant system is labeled with [15 N]ammonium-[15 N]nitrate and the total input of airborne N is calculated from the dilution of this tracer by N from the atmosphere. An average annual deposition of 64 ± 11 kg/ha x year from 1994 – 2000 was measured with the ITNI system at the Bad Lauchst?dt research farm in the dry belt of Central Germany. Measurements in 1999 / 2000 at three other sites in Central Germany produced deposition rates of about 60 kg/ha x year. These data clearly show that the total atmospheric N deposition into the soil/plant system determined by the newly developed ITNI system significantly exceeds that obtained from standard wet-only and <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors.</b> The higher atmospheric N depositions found closely match those postulated from the N balances of long-term agricultural field experiments...|$|R

They were analysed for their isotopic (δD and δ 18 O) and chemical (H+, Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, NH 4 +, F−, Cl−, Br−, NO 3 −, SO 4 2 −) composition. A local meteoric water line (δD‰ = 5. 80 ± 0. 02 δ 18 O‰ + 0. 02 ± 0. 12) and a local isotopic lapse rate (− 0. 18 δ 18 O‰/ 100 m) were obtained considering the volume-weighted means of the five sampling sites. These results agree well with those obtained in nearby areas. The chemical composition of the samples allows to identify an almost entirely marine origin for chloride and sodium with decreasing deposition values at increasing distance from the coast. Nitrate and ammonium are almost completely of anthropogenic origin, calcium and potassium are overwhelmingly geogenic, sulphate has a prevailingly anthropogenic origin with a significant marine contribution and magnesium has a mixedmarine and soil dust origin.

40|$|Bulk {{precipitation}} samplers, {{which are}} continuously open, also sample gases and particles deposited on the funnel surface. Wet-only samplers, which open only during precipitation, avoid this problem, {{but can be}} bulky (leading to disruption of air flow and droplet collection) and need electrical power. We describe here a simple battery-powered modification to a standard bulk sampler that allows the separate measurement of deposition to the funnel surface and wet deposition by washing the funnel surface when precipitation is detected. Comparison of this design with a standard bulk sampler over 3 months at a site in eastern Scotland showed that dry deposition to the funnel surface contributed around 20 % of sulphate, 20 - 30 % of nitrate and 20 - 40 % of ammonium ions. There was also a significant loss of ammonium and nitrate in the modified sampler, presumably in the tubing, even though a biocide had {{been added to the}} sample bottles. This observation has implications for bulk samplers of similar design, with a sample bottle at ground level. Deposition of sea salts and calcium was greater to the flushing collectors than to the <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors,</b> implying that regular cleaning of funnel surfaces with 10 % methanol solution subtly alters the capture efficiency for larger particles...|$|R
40|$|PCDD/F air concentrations, {{deposition}} fluxes, {{and grass}} concentrations/offtakes (pg m- 2 day- 1) were measured concurrently in Bolsover, Derbyshire, England {{over 1 year}} during 1992 − 1993. The data are used here to discuss spatial and temporal differences in atmospheric PCDD/F concentrations and how the airborne PCDD/Fs transferred to the <b>bulk</b> deposition <b>collectors</b> and grass. Three sample sites are discussed, namely, a regional background site (RBS), an urban site (US), and a site close to an industrial complex (IS) {{that has been a}} suspected source of selected PCDD/F homologs. Generally, the mixture of PCDD/F 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted congeners and homologs was the same in the air, in the bulk deposition, and in the grass over a given sampling period and site. This suggests that PCDD/Fs of different levels of chlorination were transferring with similar efficiencies from the air to the collectors and grass, despite different gas−particle partitioning in the air. Deposition or transfer velocities for individual congeners/homologs to the <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors</b> throughout the whole study ranged between 0. 034 and 0. 82 cm s- 1 at the sites, averaging 0. 27 cm s- 1 for PCDD/Fs at the RBS. An experiment conducted to assess potential volatilization of soil-borne PCDD/Fs from contaminated areas near the IS showed that all the compounds had a strong affinity for the soil and that volatilization is not likely to significantly contaminate herbage growing in the contaminated soil or the overlying atmosphere near this site. Herbage PCDD/Fs were therefore derived almost exclusively from the atmosphere in this study. The similarities in the PCDD/F mixture in air and grass suggest that the different PCDD/Fs are scavenged by the grass sward from the atmosphere with similar efficiencies; the implications of this are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric and {{environmental}} pollution caused by heavy metals is nowadays {{one of the}} major environmental topics. Even though some of the heavy metals represent important trace elements for most of the organisms, their danger lies particularly in their toxicity which occurs even with little concentrations of the element, as well as their ability of bioaccumulation in food chains (Braniš, 2011). The sources of heavy metals in the atmosphere have natural and anthropogenic origin, however most of the emissions originate from the anthropogenic ones. Contamination of the atmosphere has a global character. Starting back in the 1970 s, there has been a continuous reduction of heavy metal emissions in Europe (Pacyna, 2007). According to ČHMÚ (2015), one of the most polluted areas in the Czech Republic is currently Ostrava/Karviná/Frýdek-Místek agglomeration. The aim of this thesis is to analyse and assess the results of selected heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) measurement in total atmospheric deposition, which had been collected at selected localities in Zlin Region. The localities were chosen based on an assumption that the building density can impact the composition of the atmospheric deposition and its potential contamination with heavy metals due to the presence of combustions from residential units. <b>Bulk</b> <b>collectors</b> were chosen for this research and they were continuously exposed at the localities and therefore apart from liquid vertical precipitation, the samples contained also a non-defined amount of dry deposition. The results of the measurement did not firmly confirm the original hypothesis. Incidence of most of the metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn) was only minor. An enormously high concentration of Cd and Pb occurred in one of the samples, but not repeatedly during next sampling period. This can be considered an extreme which happened because of a random cause...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of atmospheric sulfur deposition to forest {{is difficult because}} of its complex aerodynamic structure. Therefore, atmospheric deposition of sulfur to forest is often estimated by means of measuring throughfall fluxes onto the forest floor. In this paper, reported measurements of throughfall fluxes in European forests are analyzed. These fluxes are compared to deposition to <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors</b> located in nearby open land, {{to get an idea}} of the filtering efficiency of forests. In addition, fluxes are compared with deposition estimates from a long‐range transport model of air pollutants, linked to an emission generation model. According to reported measurements from 52 European conifer stands, we found that the sulfur flux was 3. 8  ±  2. 3 times greater onto the forest floor than onto precipitation collectors. In a similar data set of 13 deciduous stands this ratio was 2. 3  ±  0. 9. The ratio of throughfall flux to model estimate was 1. 8  ±  0. 9 in coniferous stands and 0. 9  ±  0. 3 in deciduous stands. For sites that are located in moderately to highly sulfur polluted areas, it is assumed that throughfall fluxes give a good estimation of the atmospheric sulfur deposition. We conclude that (1) sulfur deposition to forests is 1. 5 to 6 times higher than deposition to smooth receptor surfaces due to an efficient filtering by the forest canopy, (2) average annual sulfur deposition at a given location is 50 – 100 % greater on conifers than on deciduous trees, (3) the existing European scale model that links sulfur deposition to the pollution generation processes is quite accurate as far as deciduous forests are concerned, and (4) the model underestimates deposition to coniferous forest...|$|R

Single phase water was examined first, {{and the results were}} used as a basis for comparison for the water-air two-phase flow results. Two-phase experiments using ethylene glycol-air and single phase ethylene glycol were then conducted. The flow rates of the water-air and ethylene glycol-air phases were varied between a range of values during each experiment and the system pressure and temperatures were recorded at each combination of flow rates. The experimental data was used to calculate the number of variables, such as the heat transfer rate Q, temperature difference between the entrance and exit of the solar thermal <b>collector</b> [delta]T, average <b>bulk</b> temperature b T, the time required for raising the temperature inside the tank from 25 ℃ to 70 ℃, and the energy gained from the tank E.

Several experiments {{were conducted}} to study the effects of liquid void fraction αl. The effect of liquid void fraction showed that the heat transfer rate was highest in all experiments when the liquid void fraction was 0. 5, while the heat transfer rate was at its lowest value when the liquid void fraction was 0. 79. The effect of void fraction was found to be a controlling factor due to its impact on liquid slug length, which in turn affects the heat transfer rate.

To establish the first data set on the depositional fluxes of 210 Po in bulk precipitation and concentrations in air samples from the midwestern United States, we measured the depositional fluxes of 210 Pb and 210 Po in the bulk (wet plus dry) and dry fallout by deploying a rain <b>collector</b> (dry and <b>bulk)</b> for a period of 17 months. We also collected 30 aerosol samples during this period to assess the temporal variations of these nuclides in the surface air in Detroit, Michigan. The activity of 210 Po in the surface air ranged from below detection limit to 0. 118 mBq m− 3 (mean of 0. 072 mBq m− 3). The specific activities of 210 Po and 210 Pb in aerosols ranged between 0. 28 and 4. 48 Bq g− 1 (mean of 0. 87 Bq g− 1) and 2. 7 and 30 Bq g− 1 (mean of 13. 6 Bq g− 1), respectively; these values are about 1 – 2 orders of magnitude higher than the surface soil. The mean activity ratios of 210 Po/ 210 Pb in the bulk precipitation and dry fallout were found to be 0. 049 (n = 27) and 0. 25 (n = 8), corresponding to residence times of 15 and 75 days, respectively. Higher values in the dry fallout are attributed to resuspension of very fine older material from the ground. The 210 Po/ 210 Pb activity ratios in the aerosols varied between 0 and 0. 210 (mean of 0. 075), with corresponding residence times of 0 – 61 days (mean of 22 days). The mean deposition velocity and bulk washout ratio obtained using 210 Po is compared with those obtained for 210 Pb. From the measured aerosol mass concentrations and calculated values of the depositional velocity, the calculated depositional fluxes of aerosols are reported...|$|R
40|$|Volcanoes {{contribute}} to atmospheric pollution {{by increasing the}} amount of reactive and greenhouse gases and aerosols, making volcanic emissions one of the major natural sources of several trace elements to the atmosphere. In particular, Mt. Etna is considered to be, on the long-term average, the major atmospheric point source of many environmental harmful compounds. Their emission occurs in the form of gases, aerosols or particulate, both through continuous passive degassing from open-conduit activity and through sporadic paroxysmal eruptive activity. To estimate the environmental impact of magma-derived trace metals and their depositions processes, five <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors</b> have been deployed at various altitudes on the upper flanks around the summit craters of the volcano. Samples were collected every second week for a period of one year and analyzed for the main chemical-physical parameters (electric conductivity and pH) and for major and trace elements concentrations. The first data obtained clearly show that the volcanic contribution is always prevailing in the sampling site closest to the summit craters (∼ 1. 5 km). In the distal sites (5. 5 - 10 km from the summit) downwind of the summit craters, the volcanic contribution is also detectable but often overwhelmed by anthropogenic or other natural (seawater spray, geogenic dust) contributions. Volcanic contribution may derive from both dry and wet deposition of gases and aerosols from the volcanic plume, but sometimes also from leaching of freshly emitted volcanic ashes. In fact, in our background site (7. 5 km in the upwind direction,) volcanic contribution has been detected only following an ash deposition event. Fluorine, S and Cl, are the major elements that prevailingly characterize the volcanic contribution in bulk deposition on Mt. Etna, but high concentrations of many trace elements are also detected in the studied samples. In particular, Si, Al, Fe, Ti, Cu, As, Rb, Pb, Tl, Cd, Cr, U and Ag display, in the site most exposed to the volcanic emissions, median concentration values about two orders of magnitude higher than those measured in our background site. Furthermore some of the analysed elements display very high enrichment values with respect to the average crust and, in the closest site to the summit craters, also deposition values higher than those measured in polluted urban or industrial sites...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} concepts {{underlying the}} atmospheric input of phosphorus (P) to ecosystems, published rates of P deposition, measurement methods, and approaches to future monitoring and research. P conveyed {{through the atmosphere}} can be a significant nutrient source for some freshwater and marine ecosystems. Particle sources and sinks at the land-air interface produce variation in P deposition from the atmosphere across temporal and spatial scales. Natural plant canopies can affect deposition rates by changing the physical environment and surface area for particle deposition. Land-use patterns can alter P deposition rates by changing particle concentrations in the atmosphere. The vast majority of P in dry atmospheric deposition is conveyed by coarse (2. 5 to 10 μm) and giant (10 to 100 μm) particles, and yet these size fractions represent a challenge for long-term atmospheric monitoring {{in the absence of}} accepted methods for routine sampling. Most information on P deposition is from <b>bulk</b> precipitation <b>collectors</b> and wet/dry bucket sampling, both with questionable precision and accuracy. Most published annual rates of P deposition are gross estimates derived from bulk precipitation sampling in locations around the globe and range from about 5 to well over 100 mg P m– 2 year– 1, although most inland ecosystems receive between 20 and 80 mg P m– 2 year– 1. Rates below 30 mg P m– 2 year– 1 are found in remote areas and near coastlines. Intermediate rates of 30 to 50 mg P m– 2 year– 1 are associated with forests or mixed land use, and rates of 50 to 100 mg P m– 2 year– 1 or more are often recorded from urban or agricultural settings. Comparison with other methods suggests that these bulk precipitation estimates provide crude boundaries around actual P deposition rates for various land uses. However, data screening cannot remove all positive bias caused by contamination of bucket or <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors.</b> As a consequence, continued sampling with these standard collectors in a region will not reduce the large uncertainty in rates derived from existing data. Calibrated surface accumulation methods hold promise as a primary means to estimate P flux in future monitoring. New methods for long-term P deposition monitoring will require an intercomparison of P flux estimates from surrogate surfaces, impactor sampling of particle concentrations combined with deposition models, and “throughfall” estimates for natural canopies. With better sampling methods and more long-term monitoring data, the importance of atmospheric P deposition in ecosystem dynamics and management can be better understood and predicted...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{use of this}} {{technology}} is in residential buildings where the demand for hot water has a large impact on energy bills. This generally means a situation with a large family, or {{a situation in which}} the hot water demand is excessive due to frequent laundry washing. Commercial applications include laundromats, car washes, military laundry facilities and eating establishments. The technology can also be used for space heating if the building is located off-grid or if utility power is subject to frequent outages. Solar water heating systems are most likely to be cost effective for facilities with water heating systems that are expensive to operate, or with operations such as laundries or kitchens that require large quantities of hot water. Unglazed liquid collectors are commonly used to heat water for swimming pools but can also be applied to large scale water pre-heating. When loads are large relative to available <b>collector</b> area the <b>bulk</b> of the water heating can be done at low temperature, lower than at swimming pool temperatures where unglazed collectors are well established in the marketplace as the right choice. Because these collectors need not withstand high temperatures, they can use less expensive materials such as plastic or rubber. Many unglazed collectors are made of polypropylene and must be drained fully to avoid freeze damage when air temperatures drop below 44F on clear nights. A smaller but growing percentage of unglazed collectors are flexible meaning they can withstand water freezing solid inside their absorber. The freeze concern only need be the water filled piping and collector manifolds in a hard freeze condition. Unglazed solar hot water systems should be installed to [...] "drainback" [...] to a storage tank whenever solar radiation is insufficient. There are no thermal shock concerns with unglazed systems. Commonly used in swimming pool heating since solar energy's early beginnings, unglazed solar collectors heat swimming pool water directly without the need for antifreeze or heat exchangers. Hot water solar systems require heat exchangers due to contamination possibilities and in the case of unglazed collectors, the pressure difference between the solar working fluid (water) and the load (pressurized cold city water). Large scale unglazed solar hot water heaters like the one at the Minoru Aquatic Center in Richmond BC [...] operate at lower temperatures than evacuated tube or boxed and glazed collector systems so they require larger more expensive heat exchangers but all other components including vented storage tanks and uninsulated plastic PVC piping reduce costs of this alternative dramatically compared to the higher temperature collector types. When heating hot water we are actually heating cold to warm and warm to hot. We can heat cold to warm as efficiently with unglazed collectors as we can heat warm to hot with high temperature collectors ...|$|R
40|$|Volcanoes {{represent}} an important natural source of several trace elements to the atmosphere. For some species (e. g., As, Cd, Pb and Se) {{they may be}} the main natural source and thereby strongly influencing geochemical cycles from the local to the global scale. Mount Etna {{is one of the most}} actively degassing volcanoes in the world, and it is considered to be, on the long-term average, the major atmospheric point source of many environmental harmful compounds. Their emission occurs either through continuous passive degassing from open-conduit activity or through sporadic paroxysmal eruptive activity, in the form of gases, aerosols or particulate. To estimate the environmental impact of magma-derived trace metals and their depositions processes, rainwater and snow samples were collected at Mount Etna area. Five <b>bulk</b> <b>collectors</b> have been deployed at various altitudes on the upper flanks around the summit craters of the volcano; samples were collected every two week for a period of one year and analyzed for the main chemical-physical parameters (electric conductivity and pH) and for major and trace elements concentrations. Chemical analysis of rainwater clearly shows that the volcanic contribution is always prevailing in the sampling site closest to the summit crater (about 1. 5 km). In the distal sites (5. 5 - 10 km from the summit) and downwind of the summit craters, the volcanic contribution is also detectable but often overwhelmed by anthropogenic or other natural (seawater spray, geogenic dust) contributions. Volcanic contribution may derive from both dry and wet deposition of gases and aerosols from the volcanic plume, but sometimes also from leaching of freshly emitted volcanic ashes. In fact, in our background site (7. 5 km in the upwind direction) volcanic contribution has been detected only following an ash deposition event. About 30 samples of fresh snow were collected in the upper part of the volcano, during the winters 2006 and 2007 to estimate deposition processes at high altitude during cold periods. Some of the samples were collected immediately after a major explosive event from the summit craters to understand the interaction between snow and fresh erupted ash. Sulphur, Chlorine and Fluorine, are the major elements that prevailingly characterize the volcanic contribution in atmospheric precipitation on Mount Etna, but high concentrations of many trace elements are also detected in the studied samples. In particular, bulk deposition samples display high concentration of Al, Fe, Ti, Cu, As, Rb, Pb, Tl, Cd, Cr, U and Ag, in the site most exposed to the volcanic emissions: median concentration values are about two orders of magnitude higher than those measured in our background site. Also in the snow samples the volcanic signature is clearly detectable and decreases with distance from the summit craters. Some of the analysed elements display very high enrichment values with respect to the average crust and, in the closest site to the summit craters, also deposition values higher than those measured in polluted urban or industrial sites...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{water samples}} {{were taken in}} September/October 2010 at Mt. Schmücke in a rural, forested area in Germany during the Lagrange-type Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia 2010 (HCCT- 2010) cloud experiment. Besides <b>bulk</b> <b>{{collector}}s,</b> a three-stage and a five-stage collector were applied and samples were analysed for inorganic ions (SO 42 −,NO 3 −, NH 4 +, Cl−, Na+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, K+), H 2 O 2 (aq), S(IV), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Campaign volume-weighted mean concentrations were 191, 142, and 39 µmol L− 1 for ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate respectively, between 4 and 27 µmol L− 1 for minor ions, 5. 4 µmol L− 1 for H 2 O 2 (aq), 1. 9 µmol L− 1 for S(IV), and 3. 9 mgC L− 1 for DOC. The concentrations compare well to more recent European cloud water data from similar sites. On a mass basis, organic material (as DOC × 1. 8) contributed 20 – 40 % (event means) to total solute concentrations and {{was found to have}} non-negligible impact on cloud water acidity. Relative standard deviations of major ions were 60 – 66 % for solute concentrations and 52 – 80 % for cloud water loadings (CWLs). The similar variability of solute concentrations and CWLs together with the results of back-trajectory analysis and principal component analysis, suggests that concentrations in incoming air masses (i. e. air mass history), rather than cloud liquid water content (LWC), were the main factor controlling bulk solute concentrations for the cloud studied. Droplet effective radius was found to be a somewhat better predictor for cloud water total ionic content (TIC) than LWC, even though no single explanatory variable can fully describe TIC (or solute concentration) variations in a simple functional relation due to the complex processes involved. Bulk concentrations typically agreed within a factor of 2 with co-located measurements of residual particle concentrations sampled by a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) and analysed by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), with the deviations being mainly caused by systematic differences and limitations of the approaches (such as outgassing of dissolved gases during residual particle sampling). Scavenging efficiencies (SEs) of aerosol constituents were 0. 56 – 0. 94, 0. 79 – 0. 99, 0. 71 – 98, and 0. 67 – 0. 92 for SO 42 −, NO 3 −, NH 4 +, and DOC respectively when calculated as event means with in-cloud data only. SEs estimated using data from an upwind site were substantially different in many cases, revealing the impact of gas-phase uptake (for volatile constituents) and mass losses across Mt. Schmücke likely due to physical processes such as droplet scavenging by trees and/or entrainment. Drop size-resolved cloud water concentrations of major ions SO 42 −, NO 3 −, and NH 4 + revealed two main profiles: decreasing concentrations with increasing droplet size and “U” shapes. In contrast, profiles of typical coarse particle mode minor ions were often increasing with increasing drop size, highlighting the importance of a species' particle concentration size distribution for the development of size-resolved solute concentration patterns. Concentration differences between droplet size classes were typically < 2 for major ions from the three-stage collector and somewhat more pronounced from the five-stage collector, while they were much larger for minor ions. Due to a better separation of droplet populations, the five-stage collector was capable of resolving some features of solute size dependencies not seen in the three-stage data, especially sharp concentration increases (up to a factor of 5 – 10) in the smallest droplets for many solutes...|$|R
