This reflects the need to acquire external resources and develop internal human capital. Synergy effects were also evident in particular industries. On balance there was little evidence of perquisite consumption and some evidence that boards do have a disciplining role. Copyright � 2008 The Author. ...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian apparel {{industry}} has experienced erosion of its market share to imported products. Exporting {{is a strategy}} to counteract this situation, yet only about 3 % of total Canadian apparel shipments are exported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the attitudes <b>of</b> Canadian apparel <b>CEOs</b> toward exporting and compare characteristics of exporters and non exporters. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 511 apparel manufacturers, with 56 usable questionnaires returned.

40|$|<b>CEOs</b> <b>of</b> family {{firms in}} the S&P 1500, {{particularly}} those with founding CEOs, engage in more frequent insider trading, and make larger insider trades, than do the <b>CEOs</b> <b>of</b> non-family firms. Moreover, the trades made by founding CEOs are more profitable than those made by the <b>CEOs</b> <b>of</b> non-family firms. This finding is more pronounced for family firms {{that are difficult to}} value or that have poor corporate governance. Founding CEOs’ excess stock trading returns arise both from trades made before earnings surprises and those made outside earnings announcement periods. Finally, founding CEOs’ trades forecast their company’s future stock returns better than those made by the <b>CEOs</b> <b>of</b> non-family firms.

Although both IPO and sellout firms have higher option-based compensation in the year prior to the event, it is more dominant in firms that go public.
