40|$|Lightweight {{design has}} an {{important}} role for rail vehicles. To achieve a significant mass reduction, the consistent usage of all lightweight design strategies is necessary. For this reason, an innovative method has been developed at the Institute of Vehicle Concepts at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), supported by Bombardier Transportation; this method follows an integral lightweight design approach. By using this methodical procedure, the mass of car bodies and train concepts can be estimated without defining the design. In this way {{it is possible to}} compare different train and car concepts in relation to their lightweight design potential in an early phase. The car and train concept with the greatest lightweight design potential defines the global dimensions of the related <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>shell.</b> The <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>shell</b> is subjected to topology optimisation using the loads of relevance for the design. The resulting load-bearing structure comprises load paths adapted to the force flows. These load paths form the basis for an Innovative mass-optimised, modular car body design. The highly loaded car body segment over the running gear is explicitly designed. It is dimensioned by ideally adapting the wall thickness of the structural elements to the loads. The structural behaviour of the design is verified using a real demonstrator...|$|E

Finite element simulations can help to gain insight into this development. In this work, a simulation model is proposed and used to study the appearance of distortions in a steel sheet over different temperature cycles. The model takes chemical shrinkage and thermal deformation as well as gelation and stress relaxation into account. It was found that the heating rate can affect distortions. Lowering the cure temperature only lowers distortions for high temperature rates. Low heating rates can reduce distortions...|$|R

The AFX brand continued production until {{the company was}} forced into receivership in 1983. Aurora designed the AFX cars with interchangeable <b>car</b> <b>body</b> <b>shells</b> usually compatible with each chassis they released during these years. The original 1971 A/FX chassis utilized {{an updated version of}} the existing pancake motor design of Aurora's [...] "Thunderjet 500" [...] line, popular in the 1960s.

The <b>car</b> <b>bodies</b> designed to fit the shorter original chassis featured a clever snap-on design while the bodies for the Specialty chassis were affixed with a small screw. In late 1974, Aurora redesigned both the original and Specialty chassis and exposed the bottom of the motor magnets.
