5|$|Structurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly {{changed from}} its 14th-century predecessor.

Trésor took {{its name from the}} reign of Henry IV, when it had <b>contained</b> <b>the</b> royal treasury.

Bazinière was named after Bertrand de La Bazinière, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663. Bertaudière was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century. Liberté tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, or because it was used to house prisoners who had more freedom to walk around the castle than the typical prisoner. Puits tower <b>contained</b> <b>the</b> castle well, while Coin formed the corner of the Rue Saint-Antoine.|$|E
