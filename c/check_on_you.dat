500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, <b>check</b> <b>on</b> me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that her pace could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|R

30|$|Charmaz (2014) proposes {{different}} strategies which grounded theorist should undertake. First, {{data collection and}} analysis is carried out simultaneously. At this stage, theoretical sampling is used to collect further data that account for variations and similarities emerged from tentative categories. Second, data are analyzed through coding to look for processes and actions rather than themes and structures. The coding procedures consist of four phases: initial coding, focused coding, axial coding, and theoretical coding. The aim of initial coding is “to remain open to all possible theoretical directions indicated by your readings of the data” (Charmaz 2006 a, p. 46). In initial coding, data are divided into separate segments, looked for, and compared with other pieces of data to explore similarities and differences (Strauss and Corbin 1998). Concurrent with initial coding, In Vivo coding is used to “preserve participants’ meanings of their views and actions” (Charmaz 2006 b, p. 54) and “provide a crucial <b>check</b> <b>on</b> whether <b>you</b> have grasped what is significant” to the participant, and may help “crystallize and condense meanings” (p. 57).|$|R

All I had was my four-wheel drive tray back and my swag, which you were expected to buy yourself. You basically made do with what you had. I travelled and camped out all week with small communities of people who were living in the bush. My classroom was a piece of tarpaulin and you were your own resource. There was no-one to <b>check</b> up <b>on</b> <b>you</b> so you needed to be honourable in your own teaching and you had to make do with what you had. " Lorraine Hodgson Pathways to Expertise is a collection of stories from fourteen experienced educators who have worked in the Northern Territory, Australia. Their experience ranges from the early childhood classroom to the secondary classroom and into administrative roles. Each story provides a unique snapshot of the diverse and challenging nature of being an educator in the Northern Territory. While the pathways for each educator may have been different, each story in this collection reveals an unswerving, active long-term commitment to improving educational outcomes for all students...|$|R

But {{if you are a}} repeated offender, they are regular visitors, generally coming every 2 weeks or so and calling your residence to <b>check</b> up <b>on</b> what <b>you</b> have been up to.

40|$|Consider {{repeated}} measures data with many zeroes. For {{the case with}} one grouping factor and one repeated measure, we examine several models, assuming that the nonzero data are roughly lognormal. One of the simplest approaches is to model the zeroes as left-censored observations from the lognormal distribution. A random effect is assumed for subjects. The censored model makes a strong assumption {{about the relationship between}} the zeroes and the nonzero values. To <b>check</b> <b>on</b> this, <b>you</b> can instead assume that some of the zeroes are “true ” zeroes and model them as Bernoulli. Then the other values are modeled with a censored lognormal. A logistic model is used for the Bernoulli p, the probability of a true nonzero. The fit of the pure left-censored lognormal can be assessed by testing the hypothesis that p is 1 (Moulton and Halsey, 1995). The model can also be simplified by omitting the censoring, leaving a logistic model for the zeroes and a lognormal model for the nonzero values. This is approximately equivalent to modeling the zero and nonzero values separately. In contrast to the censored model, this model assumes only a slight relationship (a covariance component) between the occurrence of zeroes {{and the size of the}} nonzero values. The models are compared in terms of an example with data from children’s private speech. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{narrator is}} driving to London {{in his new}} BMW 1975 when {{he picks up a}} hitchhiker. The man, who looks rather like a rat, {{mentions}} that he's going to the horse races, but not to bet or work the ticket machines. The narrator is intrigued and says that he's a writer. They get to talking about the car, and the narrator proudly states that it can hit one hundred and twenty-nine miles per hour. The hitchhiker doubts that, so once they hit a straight patch of road, the narrator steps on the gas. They're almost there when a policeman on a motorcycle zooms past and signals them to stop. The cop {{is a bit of a}} bully and threatens to have the narrator thrown in prison. He takes down his address and also the address of the hitchhiker. Then he gives them a ticket and leaves and they continue on their way. The narrator is worried about the ticket, but the hitchhiker says it will be fine. They begin talking about their careers again, and eventually the hitchhiker announces that he is a [...] "fingersmith". He is so skilled with his hands that he even manages to remove the narrator's belt without him noticing. He attends the races and steals money from the winners. [...] "That policeman's going to <b>check</b> up <b>on</b> <b>you</b> pretty thoroughly", the narrator says. [...] "Doesn't that worry you a bit?" [...] The hitchhiker responds that no one will be <b>checking</b> up <b>on</b> him, as policemen have notoriously bad memories. [...] "What's memory got to do with it?" [...] the narrator asks. [...] "It's written down in his book, isn't it?" [...] The hitchhiker proudly announces that he's stolen both books from the policeman. [...] "Easiest job I ever done." [...] They pull off the road to burn the books.|$|R

The paperless pipe dream may never happen, but cheap digital optics and a mundane 40 -year old technology (OCR) are converging to change the game. The mindless convenience of my $ 6000 kiosk suggests OCR will become a regulated munition* in the coming intellectual property and privacy wars.
