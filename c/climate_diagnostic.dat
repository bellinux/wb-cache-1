5000|$|During the 1970s, the [...] "butterfly effect" [...] or [...] "chaos" [...] was the {{dominant}} theme of predictability research, {{and the community}} was sceptical {{about the prospects for}} dynamical seasonal prediction. Shukla's research led to the notion of predictability in the midst of chaos, {{and the development of a}} scientific basis for the prediction of climate which derives from the influence of the slow variations of the atmosphere's lower boundary conditions and their interactions with the atmosphere. Recognizing the enormous scientific implications and potential benefits to society from accurate and reliable seasonal forecasts, Shukla took an extraordinary and risky decision to resign from his tenure professorship at the University of Maryland, and start a nonprofit institute, IGES, in his garage. Work by Shukla and his scientific colleagues has inspired routine dynamical seasonal prediction by numerous weather and climate centres around the world, helping society manage agricultural and economic activities, saving lives and property. Shukla also recognised the importance of land surface processes in climate variability and predictability and therefore established the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA). Recognition of the importance of atmosphere-land interactions in climate dynamics has led to numerous research programs, field experiments, and space-missions. Another important contribution made by Shukla was his proposal in the early 1980s to carry out retrospective analysis of atmospheric observations. COLA scientists conducted the first pilot reanalysis as proof of concept at a time when the community was sceptical about the feasibility of reanalysis. Reanalysis of past data and <b>climate</b> <b>diagnostic</b> studies are now an important component of climate research.|$|E

40|$|Persistent winter {{inversion}}s {{result in}} poor air {{quality in the}} Intermountain West of the United States. Although the onset of an inversion {{is relatively easy to}} predict, the duration and the subsequent breakup of a persistent inversion event remains a forecasting challenge. For this reason and for this region, historic soundings were analyzed for Salt Lake City, Utah, with reanalysis and station data to investigate how persistent inversion events are modulated by synoptic and intraseasonal variabilities. The results point to a close linkage between persistent inversions and the dominant intraseasonal (30 day) mode that characterizes the winter circulation regime over the Pacific Northwest. Meteorological variables and pollution (e. g., particulate matter of # 2. 5 -mm diameter, PM 2. 5) revealed coherent variations with this intraseasonal mode. The intraseasonal mode also modulates the characteristics of the synoptic (6 day) variability and further influences the duration of persistent inversions in the Intermountain West. The interaction between modes suggests that a complete forecast of persistent inversions is more involved and technically beyond numerical weather prediction models intended for the medium range (; 10 day). Therefore, to predict persistent inversions, the results point to the adoption of standard medium-range forecasts with a longer-term <b>climate</b> <b>diagnostic</b> approach...|$|E

Interactions between these urban and rural stresses, in turn, are likely to generate additional stresses.

The present study focused on describing the space-time evolution of dengue in Brazil from 2001 to 2012 and analyzing the relationship of the reported cases with socio-demographic and environmental factors. The analytic units used in the preparation of thematic maps were municipalities. Statistical tests and multilevel regression models were used to evaluate the association between dengue incidence and the following factors: <b>climate,</b> <b>diagnostic</b> period, demographic density, percentage of people living in rural areas, Gross Domestic Product, Gini index, percentage of garbage collection and the rate of households with a sewage network. The largest accumulation of dengue cases in Brazil was concentrated on the Atlantic coast and in the interior part of São Paulo State. The risk of dengue in subtropical and tropical climates was 1. 20 - 11 times lower than that observed in semi-arid climates. In 2009 - 2010 and 2011 - 2012, the risks were ten and six times higher than in 2003 - 2004, respectively. Dengue is a common infection in the Brazilian population, with the largest accumulation of dengue cases concentrated on the Atlantic coast and in the interior area of São Paulo State. The high dengue rates observed in the Brazilian coastal region suggest that the cases imported from neighboring countries contribute to the spread of the disease in the country. Our results suggest that several socio-demographic and environmental factors resulted in the increase of dengue in the country over time. This is likely applicable to the occurrence of other arboviruses like Zika and chikungunya.

The recent devastation in the Philippines by the Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 demonstrated the type of extreme events that Vietnam might encounter in its coastal regions: i. e. widespread flooding, extremely high winds, and storm surges – these being compounded by the rising sea level. This situation poses a significant threat to the lives, properties, and ecosystems in Central Vietnam during its peak typhoon season from October to November. Recent research [Murakami et al., 2011; Chen, J et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2012] has found that late-summer typhoons initiated between Vietnam and the Philippines have become increasingly frequent since 1995, and the amount of rain associated with typhoons may also increase due to increasing sea surface temperature (SST) supplying more moisture and heat into the air. Since over two thirds of the October-November typhoons that affect Vietnam develop west of the Philippines [Chen, J et al., 2012], their increased frequency and intensity is of grave concern. Various international organizations have identified Central Vietnam {{as one of the most}} vulnerable places facing significant socioeconomic impacts of climate change [McElwee, 2012]. According to the WWF-Indochina Programme [WorldBank, 2001], Central Vietnam belongs to the globally significant landscapes where a great majority of endemic species is potentially at severe risk in the short term, and at high risk in the long term.
