We evaluate in this one the accessible territorial data for the actors, and the <b>cartographic</b> <b>files</b> of the administrative or statistical entities to represent them. We analyze the sources of information, and determine its accessibility in the various countries of the European Union. We moreover deal with problems of the relevant territorial scales and cartographic representation of the data. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The São Domingos stream, a {{tributary}} of the Araguaia River, establishes itself as direct area of influence of urban and rural municipality of Conceição do Araguaia, Pará. Thus, this research sought through Geotechnologies as techniques of Remote Sensing and GIS to characterize and verify the dynamics of land use in the sub-basin of the stream São Domingo. Thus, we conducted research library collections and the acquisition of analog and digital products (topographic maps, digital images, <b>cartographic</b> <b>files)</b> that could be processed with the help of ArcGIS 9. 3 software. Thus, morphometric variables were obtained from the sub-basin studied, as well as thematic maps of slope and hipsometria, beyond the temporal evaluation (2000 - 2011) of spatial changes occurring in the same soil.

The characteristics of Telčsko microregion viewed from natural and socio [...] economical aspects are involved as an integral part into this thesis. There are villages with developing potential and prevailing residential function singled out in this elaboration. In case of the selected villages with developing potential, the analysis of the entrepreneurial possibilities with the emphasis on primary sector or on its combination with processing of primary products, agritourism and with production of energies from renewable resources has been realized here. The method of structured interviews with significant officials is used for deeper exploration. These debates are focused on economical, social and environmental aspects of the development. The research results are photodocumentated and summarized in <b>cartographic</b> <b>files...</b>|$|R

Census Tract boundaries are available 1910-present and Block Group and Block boundaries avaialable 1990-present.

40|$|The term WEBGIS (alternatively WEB-based GIS, Online GIS, Distributed GIS) {{is used to}} {{indicate}} via Internet/Intranet use of Geographic Information Systems functions, so to supply georeferred information to users. As well as in no-web applications, element of fundamental importance is cartography, or, in other terms, the representation of hearth surface (or part of it), to which databases are linked. Presence of <b>cartographic</b> <b>files</b> in web does not imply WEBGIS: sometimes there are only static pages to which user accesses without activation of spatial analysis. In this paper, considering bibliographic research and experiments conducted at Geomatic Laboratory of Faculty of Sciences and Technologies of University of Naples “Parthenope”, an overview on state of art concerning maps in WEB and in WEBGIS is supplied. Particularly, criteria for distinction and classification of possibilities to insert and use geographic data in Internet and to manipulate them are evidenced. Principal characteristics of languages, formats and standards to insert in Internet maps are considered, such as HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics); particular attention is reserved to GML (Generalized Markup Language) from OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium), which can include in each feature both spatial information as well as attributes (generally included in linked alphanumeric databases) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{large amount}} of data {{accumulated}} in soil surveys should always be available for research and practical use in agriculture, rural planning, and so on. For this purpose, the data must be managed by a well-organized computer-based system. This paper describes the basic function and organization of the system (COSMAS) now under development by the authors. The site description and horizon observation of a soil survey are written on a standardized card in numerical and letter codes. Both {{the location of the}} observation site and the boundaries of the general soil map in the coordinate system of the base map are recorded by means of a peripheral device, the 2 ̆ 2 tablet. 2 ̆ 2 Thus data obtained in the field and in the laboratory are filed by means of the packaged program, SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Four files are now in operation: site description, horizon description, analytical data, and <b>cartographic</b> <b>files,</b> all of which can be cross-referenced with one another. SPSS performs not only statistical analysis, but also such file management as data selection, recoding, and transformation. The processed information can be obtained in a form inherent to SPSS, or in various forms by programs developed by the authors, for example, soil survey report in text, contour maps, soil attribute maps, and transect-attribute diagrams. As an example of its use, it would be explained here how COSMAS helped us to understand the distribution pattern of different soil materials in a given area...|$|R
40|$|To update {{a portion}} of an {{existing}} cartographic database, the common practice is to relate the new data file to the existing file by means of survey control points that are included in both files. In {{the absence of such}} survey control points, well-defined points such as building corners can be used. This paper presents an algorithm to perform recognition of common buildings represented as vector data. The algorithm starts with a Fourier-based initial matching. A sequence of validity checks combined with robust estimation provides a complete recognition of common buildings. The two maps may have different scales, different coordinate systems, and no identifying cartographic labels. Experimental results have demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. 1 INTRODUCTION This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic updating of existing digital <b>cartographic</b> data <b>files</b> by the recognition of common polygonal features, such as buildings, in the two files. Consider, for example, the two f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} Fortaleza Master Plan process proposed by José Otacílio Saboya Ribeiro {{in the year of}} 1947, highlighting its infl uence on the socio-spacial coastline of the municipality. The focus of this analysis is on the urban form and we sought to study the topographical plans, comparing and contrasting them with the available documents, so we intend to understand how was the process of occupation of Fortaleza coastline in 1940 decade. The study is based in the topographic plan and seeks the ideological construction of the urban space. In this analysis we used the Saboya Ribeiro's <b>cartographic</b> images <b>file,</b> correlating them with other sources, especially newspapers (Correio do Ceará and O Povo). From the discussion of those topographic plans it is possible to notice the searching of a new direction to the coastline of Fortaleza in the 1940 decade. The coastline was employed as an argument for public urban structure interventions with the changing of the use and occupation of the land, making this historic period as a milestone that redirected the forma urbis of Fortaleza coastline...|$|R
