The emergence of electronic publishing has created opportunities to increase the range of formats available for conveying scientific content. We introduce the Graphical Explanation Markup Language, GEML, implemented as an XML format for defining molecular documentaries which exploit the interactive capabilities of electronic publishing. GEML builds upon existing molecular structure definitions such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) standard file format. GEML provides a library of gestures (or actions) commonly used for structural explanations, and is extensible. XML allows us to separate explicit statements about how to highlight a molecular structure from the implementation of these instructions. We also present GEIS (Generator of Explanatory Interactive Systems), a program that takes as input a GEML <b>documentary</b> definition <b>file</b> and produces all the files necessary for an interactive, webbased molecular documentary.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{attempts}} {{to question the}} encoding of textual fragments using the TEI guidelines. The fragment corresponds to part or a (small) portion of a whole that is missing. Whether it is a rest of an object that disappeared or an unfinished embryo of a work in progress, the fragment is transmitted to us disconnected from the complete and finished opus that would give him his nature, function, and finality. Since the TEI is an encoding scheme that views the text as an ordered hierarchy of content objets (OHCO), {{as it has been}} analyzed thorougly, it's not possible to use it without giving each element a tag situated in that hierarchy, and therefore its semantics and functionality. In that perspective, one can ask wether or not the choice of the TEI as en encoding scheme can be misleading and produce as a result improper interpretations ?But above all, editing fragments consists in establishing it in a set that will determine the way they are read and interpreted. A new signification will be necessarily induced by the new configuration. Can this presentation bias that promotes groundlessly one order in a textual hierarchy superior to the others be avoided ? The solution may be found in the dynamic edition, the one that can offer every possible presentation without imposing one as more important than the others. The critical electronic edition of the <b>documentary</b> <b>files</b> of Gustave Flaubert's last novel"Bouvard et Pécuchet" relies on that viewpoint. This project aims to propose an edition that could give the fragments of citations he collected and started to organize the mobility they deserve, as the volume was very far from finished when he died. For this project, the TEI is used very pragmatically with two goals. The first consist in "recording" a base structure corresponding to the way these fragments are scripted on the pages of the manuscripted. The second is {{to use it as a}} base for en extraction of the editorial units the edition will present away from the original context of the page. This strategy was only possible because the abstract models of the inscription of the fragments and of the edition that has to be made were clearly established. It shows that strongly embedded markup which is often depreciated, provided that project the only efficient way of extracting these fragment with oll the contextual information that is necessary for a reader to make sense of them, in an dynamic edition that tries to avoid the presentational bias of the printed edition...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Parents are {{children}} s {{first and most}} enduring educators. When parents and professionals work together, the results {{have a positive impact}} on the child s development and learning. Parental and professional relationships benefit all: teachers, parents, and students. The major objective of this study is to investigate the existing practice of parental involvement in the education of their children in primary school and to find strategies to increase parental involvement based on the views of interviewees in the study and from document analysis. To get in depth information about the degree of parental involvement in the education aspect, the degree of Parent-Teacher interaction at school and Parent-Child interaction at home was also assessed through interviews. Document analysis was also very helpful for this study to asses whether the policy guide lines and <b>documentary</b> <b>files</b> in the school and the sub city inspire parents to become involved in primary school education. Parent-Teacher and Parent-Child interaction was also investigated. The investigations considered the factors that are included in the students ecology and gave more attention to those included in the home, school, and community, in addition to the relation between the school and the family. To make the findings and the study more clear, related literature and theoretical aspects of the ecological theory (Bronfenbrenner) and other theoretical perspectives were included in this study. This study therefore used a qualitative research approach and analysis with a case study design in order to study the phenomenon in depth. Data was obtained through different instruments of data collection which included semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion and document analysis. The views were gathered from nine main informant parents and three information rich participants who were purposefully selected from the target school. The data was analyzed using interpretational analysis in which the data obtained from different informants and document analysis was classified under categories and sub categories. Data from each category was cross-checked and conclusions and recommendations were drawn based on the data. The overall results in this study seemed to show that, initiative which was taken by the school to involve parents in economic aspects of the school was satisfactory. But the school and the teacher s initiative to involve parents in primary school education was very low and parents initiative to become involved in the academic aspect of the school was also low. This study has also found that parents were involved only to a limited extent in decision making activities in the school. The findings further point out that there were barriers which made the relationship between parents and the school weak. The Parent s economic problems, low academic status, busy life in the society, lack of awareness, the perception of female parents, weakness of the school in inspiring parents to become involved in the education, exclusion of parents from being involved in decision making, (especially in planning), limitedness of parent-teacher interaction at school, inconvenient meeting day, and low level of parent-child interaction at home were found to be the major barriers in the whole process of co-operation between parents and the school. Therefore, this study found that the extent of parental involvement in primary school education was very limited. It is then necessary to make a concerted effort to increase parent s involvement in schools through collaboration with different entities such as schools, parents, government and non-governmental organizations...|$|R

Due to its large turnover, football may offer the stage for the commission of a wide variety of misconducts and corrupt activities. Progressively over the last decade, Italian football has severely suffered from a number of corruptive malpractices, in some cases also perpetrated with the aid of organised crime groups. A number of scandals have been put under the spotlight of public opinion, such as the ones of Calciopoli (“City of Football”) and of Calcio scommesse (“Football Bets”). In all, the search for profit seemed to have pushed the game into the background, and from the law enforcement investigations a widespread culture of illegality has emerged. Despite attracting a great deal of media attention and public demise, corrupt practices perpetrated within or through football organisations have seldom been analysed by scholars against the backdrop of relevant criminological perspectives.

In order to evaluate the risk (social damages and economical los�s) associated with these processes, the available historical data and information on happened events (from bibliographical and <b>documentary</b> sources, press, <b>files,</b> data bases, etc.) has been compiled and analysed exhaustively, includ ing also the information related to the economic and social losses (damages, victims, direct and indirect economical losses, govem�ntal and insurance companies data, etc.). The analysis of the historical information has allowed to estimate the distribution and extent of the damages and losses due to floods and earthquakes in Spain, as well as the vulnerability of the national territory. The estimation of the damages and losses for the next three dec ades has been approached from the study of the flood and earthquake potential hazard in Spain, estimating the probabilities of occurrence of these processes with different magni tude/intensity for the period of reference. The present economic and social conditions of the territory have been considered, carrying out probabilistic estimations and valuing hypo thetical situations of potential damage scenarios. The results allow to know the hazard (probability of occurrence of proces�s of certain magnitude) and risk degree (potential damages and losses) of every municipality of the country...|$|R
