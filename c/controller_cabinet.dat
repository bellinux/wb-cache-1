5000|$|InSync is a {{plug-and-play}} system {{that works with}} existing traffic control cabinets and controllers. Its two main hardware components are IP video cameras and a processor, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "the eyes" [...] and [...] "the brain" [...] of the system, respectively. Mounted video cameras determine the number of vehicles present and how long the vehicles have been waiting (also known as delay). The processor, a solid state machine, resides in the traffic <b>controller</b> <b>cabinet</b> at the intersection. The system calls up the traffic signal state that best serves actual demand while coordinating its decision with other intersections.|$|E
50|$|In {{the areas}} that are prone to power interruptions, adding battery backups to the traffic {{controller}} systems can enhance {{the safety of the}} motorists and pedestrians. In the past, a larger capacity of uninterruptible power supply would be required to continue the full operations of the traffic signals using incandescent lights. The cost for such system would be prohibitive. After the newer generations of traffic signals that use LED lights which consume 85-90% less energy, it is now possible to incorporate battery backups into the traffic light systems. The battery backups would be installed in the traffic <b>controller</b> <b>cabinet</b> or in their own cabinet adjacent to the controller.|$|E
5000|$|As an overlay system, InSync’s {{hardware}} components {{plug into}} existing traffic cabinet hardware. The system is Ethernet- and web-based, compatible with all modern <b>controllers,</b> <b>cabinets</b> and detection devices {{and does not}} require removal or upgrades of any hardware or software. Installation of the InSync system consists of installing in each cabinet a processor, equipment panel and method to transmit detection calls (such as cabling or detector cards). If InSync’s video detection is used, installation also includes installing cameras for each approach. If existing detection methods are preferred (InSync:Tesla), Rhythm Engineering will integrate the installed inputs with the adaptive system. Once cables are pulled from the camera locations to the traffic cabinet, installation of the cameras and in-cabinet hardware typically requires about four hours per intersection. After the hardware is installed, the initial configuration {{of the system is}} performed by Rhythm Engineering engineers. The time from an agency or contractor ordering the system to full operation is less than 90 days.|$|R

5000|$|Hardware and {{software}} configuration of disk subsystems are examined: RAID levels and configuration, block and stripe size allocation, and {{the configuration of}} disks, <b>controller</b> cards, storage <b>cabinets,</b> and external storage systems such as SANs. Transaction logs and temporary spaces are heavy consumers of I/O, and affect performance for all users of the database. Placing them appropriately is crucial.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} used method of detection is induction loops. Other methods include magnetometers, video, infrared, radar and microwave detection. A typical loop detector installation could be approximately six foot square or six feet wide by thirty feet long. Other shapes may also be used including circular and hexagonal loops. These are cut into, or buried {{below the surface of the}} roadway. The preferred wire is stranded copper with an insulating cover which is then loosely surrounded by a protection jacket. Electrically this is a 'flat' coil in the pavement structure that detects vehicles by changes in the magnetic inductance field of the coil when ferrous metal from a vehicle passes through the field. The electronic sensor in the <b>controller</b> <b>cabinet</b> senses the change in the magnetic field. The output from the sensor electronics is a 'switch' closure. This can be an electro-mechincial relay or solid-state. The 'switch' is normally closed (NC) in the de-engerized state but held open when power is applied to the circuit. This is called 'Fail-Call' so that if there is a failure in the sensor electronics the output will place a 'Call' to the controller as if a vehicle is present on the loop detector.|$|E
40|$|When a {{malfunction}} {{occurs in}} a traffic signal <b>controller</b> <b>cabinet,</b> the signal is automatically placed into malfunction flash mode as a safety precaution. During this event, drivers are presented with one of two possible scenarios: flashing yellow on the major street and flashing red on the minor street, or flashing red on all the approaches. Volumes and percentages of car stopping were collected at fifty-one study intersections in the Atlanta regions. By means of the VISSIM microsimulation software a sample of intersections was simulated under the two malfunction scenarios and the signalized one. Based on output data such as delay and queue, the performances of each simulated intersection is compared and recommendations on which mode of flash must be used in case of malfunction are provided.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Reducing congestion on U. S. urban roadways has become a top priority of state departments of transportation nationwide. The development and construction of freeway management systems have recently begun to help reduce this problem. Today, modem traffic control systems are necessary to obtain maximum possible efficiency from our freeway systems. A major component of freeway management systems is the induction loop detector. This research effort evaluated the methods by which crosstalk could be controlled effectively in a freeway management situation and, thereby, make the most efficient use of induction loop detectors. Tests were conducted to evaluate the distance at which no crosstalk was observed between two adjacent induction loop detectors. Tests were also conducted to measure the potential of crosstalk within a <b>controller</b> <b>cabinet</b> and in twisted and untwisted lead wires. As a part of this ongoing research, attention was also given to determine the distance of no spillover at detector unit sensitivity-settings of Low, Medium, and High. All of these tests were performed using two different types of detector units, viz., Detector Systems stand-alone detector units, and Naztec rackmounted units. It was observed that a distance of 48 inches (1. 21 meters) between the edges of two adjacent induction loop detectors eliminated crosstalk between them. The tests also indicated that there was no crosstalk on twisted and untwisted lead wires. Furthermore, there was no measurable evidence of crosstalk in the <b>controller</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Three different speeds of 20, 40, and 60 mph (32, 64, and 97 km/h, respectively) were used to study the detection zone between two loop detectors connected to the same detector unit. It was observed that, if two 6 feet-by- 6 feet (1. 83 by 1. 83 meters) loop detectors are placed at a spacing of 20 feet (6 meters) from lead-edge to lead-edge, they act as a single long loop detector. It has been established that the use of multiple small loops is more advantageous than using a single long loop detector...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{prediction}} of traffic situations {{is a vital}} issue in modern Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Particularly the real time detection and proper assessment of incidents may save live and may contribute to keep the transport network available. However, the influence factors of traffic are subject to multi changes; the influence factors are varying traffic demand, weather, seasons, etc. This allows only a very poor performance in real time assessment of traffic situations. This article focuses {{on the fact that}} the possible traffic patterns – depicted as time series – vary only very little on each site, representing specific traffic situations or “normal time series”. That the use of intelligent dedicated digital signal processing systems and communication media is in a position to improve the requirement of Real-Time traffic situational analysis in an efficient and effective way. Digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters are used to analyse sensor measurement data in a way that allows an instantaneous assessment about the actual traffic situation and the detection of abnormal behaviour. A FIR filter cascade is used, each filter represents a specific normal time series like working day, weekend day, rain, winter, etc. The representation of each normal time series is achieved by discrete transformation of the normal time series in order to generate its frequency spectrum and by designing a filter structure with a corresponding frequency response. The deployment of the FIR filters can be in Traffic Control Centres with a vast amount of computational power as well as in the <b>controller</b> <b>cabinets</b> of local sensors on the basis of Digital Signal Processors...|$|R

Maintaining an efficient traffic signal operation is a challenging task for many traffic management agencies. Due to the intensive labor cost required, {{most of the}} traffic signals in the US are retimed once every 2 - 5 years. However, {{it has been shown}} in the past that traffic delay increases 3 - 5 % per year simply because the timing plans are not kept up to date. For many resource-constrained agencies, it would be desirable to reduce the signal re-timing costs by automating all or portion of the manual process. The research makes one-step forward towards this direction. In this research, we developed a performance monitoring and visualization tool for arterial traffic signal systems, aiming at reducing the labor cost for signal retiming, and helping to identify signal parameter adjustment opportunities. Specifically, an automated data collection unit (DCU) was developed to collect high-resolution event-based data from signal <b>controller</b> <b>cabinets.</b> Using the high-resolution data, two parameter fine-tuning algorithms were proposed, one for offset and another for green splits. To fine-tune signal offsets, a practical procedure to construct the time space diagram (TS-Diagram) to visualize the progression quality on arterials was proposed. The TS-Diagram was calibrated and validated using the field data collected from the DCUs and the probe vehicle runs. Reasonable agreements between the field observations and the generated TS-Diagrams were found. A field experiment was then carried out, to illustrate how decisions of changes could be made by intuitively evaluating the TS-Diagram. For green splits, an adjusted measure of effectiveness (MOE), the utilized green time (UGT), was proposed for performance evaluation. The information was further tabulated in the form of ring-and-barrier diagram to facilitate evaluation. Field examples were also illustrated to demonstrate implementation potentials for green split evaluation and fine-tuning...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the impact of using air guides attached {{to the front of the}} shelves in an open fronted multi-deck refrigerated display cabinet (ODC). A 2 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of an ODC was created. The infiltration heat loads with and without the guides were predicted. A higher infiltration heat load without the guides was predicted than when the guides were fitted. The reduction in entrainment was predicted to be 34 % equating to an overall reduction in heat load of 24 %. Two cabinets were tested with and without the guides to the EN 23953 test standard. Adding the air guides reduced the maximum temperature test pack by 0. 6 ºC as well as reducing the energy consumption by 15 %. When the <b>cabinet</b> <b>controller</b> was adjusted so that the maximum pack temperatures were the same for the two tests, the aerofoils reduced energy consumption by 17 %...|$|R

The study was consisted of 2 stages: calibration of temperature and RH in cabinet drier and Study of physical and chemical characteristics changes of red onions during curing process at selected temperatures. Research method used was experimental method with descriptive analysis followed by regression and correlation analysis. Curing time in a cabinet dryer was varied as follows; 0 hours, 32 hours, 80 hours, 92 hours, and 104 hours. Observations were conducted at curing includes tuber water content, water content {{of the outer shell}}, VRS levels, levels of total dissolved solids, tuber hardness, neck diameter, decrease weight, color of the outer shell and sensory characteristics of the bulbs, tubers neck, and outer shell. The results showed that the curing of shallot in a cabinet dryer at a temperature 45 ºC ± 0, 6 ºC, and RH 69 % ± 0, 4 % by adjusting the temperature <b>controller</b> on the <b>cabinet</b> dryer at position 47 °C produce bulbs with a good outer skin apparance. During curing process, quality of the onion bulb was improved as indicated by increased the size of the bulb diameter, tubers hardness, levels of dissolved solids, the intensity of red color at tuber skin, levels of VRS, with a reduction in root neck diameter, and decrease water content of the outer shell. This condition was marked also by dry out the outer shell and neck bulbs. Onion dried in a cabinet dryer at a temperature of 44. 5 ± 0. 6 ° C and RH 59. 8 ± 0. 8 % for 92 hours produced tubers with the best quality during curing.

Diplomska naloga obravnava nadzor in optimizacijo porabe električne energije varilne naprave, robota in mize – treh največjih porabnikov robotske varilne celice. V prvem delu so predstavljeni njeni porabniki: glavna stikalna omara, robotski krmilnik, robotski {{manipulator}}, miza ali pozicioner, vpenjalno-pozicionirno orodje, varilni sistem, čistilnik, dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča. Robotski krmilnik vodi mnogokratne naloge z možnostjo vodenja do osem robotov. V glavni stikalni omari se nahajajo vsi napajalni gradniki celice. Gibljivi strojni del celice sta robotski manipulator in miza z vpenjalno-pozicionirnim orodjem. Varilni sistem sestavljajo varilni izvor, povezni paket in varilna pištola. Čistilnik skrbi za čiščenje šobe varilne pištole. Dvoročni samostoječi pult in komandna plošča, na kateri so vsa glavna stikala, se uporabljata za upravljanje celice. Z meritvami parametrov robota, mize in varilne naprave smo izdelali dve preglednici nadzora porabe električne energije in dve predlogi HMI (human-machine interface). V njih se podatki sami preračunajo do porabe električne energije v kilovatnih urah in stroškov porabe v evrih za en, sto tisoč ter tri milijone zvarjenih kosov. V primerjavi varilna naprava porabi med tri do štirikrat več električne energije kot robot in miza skupaj, razmerje je odvisno predvsem od izbranega varilnega postopka. Porabo električne energije je možno najbolj optimizirati pri varilni napravi z dobro izbiro in nastavitvijo varilnega postopka z nanašanjem varilnega materiala s pulziranjem toka. Pri robotu in mizi je največji prihranek energije možen z izklopom servo regulacije motorjev robota, medtem ko robotska varilna celica v času odmorov za malico ne obratuje. Hardware producers {{strive to}} offer their customers a technologically perfected robotic cell. Two important factors that customers take into consideration are the overview of energy consumption and a possibility for optimization {{with regard to the}} energy cost savings. This thesis deals with the electricity consumption of a welding machine, robot and positioner, three main energy consumers of a robotic welding cell. The first part of the thesis describes the consumers of a robotic welding cell: robot <b>controller,</b> main switch <b>cabinet,</b> robot manipulator, positioner, clamping-positioning tool, welding system, cleaner, two-handed stand-alone counter and command panel. The robot controller performs multiple tasks and has the possibility to supervise up to eight robots. The power components are located in the main switching cabinet. The moving parts of the robotic welding cell are the robot manipulator and the positioner with the clamping-positioning tool. The welding system is composed of a welding source, a connecting package and a welding pistol. The cleaner carries out cleaning of the welding pistol 2 ̆ 7 s nozzle. The two-handed stand-alone counter and the command panel with all the main switches are used to operate the robotic welding cell. By measuring the parameters of the robot, the positioner and the welding source we compiled two tables showing electricity consumption and designed two HMI (human-machine interface). The tables automatically calculate the electricity consumption for one, 100, 000 and 3 million welded products in kilowatt hours and the costs in EUR. In comparison to the robot with the positioner, the welding source consumes three to four times more power, whereby the ratio mainly depends on the selected welding process. The electricity consumption of the welding tool can be best optimized by good setting and choosing the right welding process. With regard to the robot and the positioner, the most electricity can be saved by deactivating the servo regulation of the robot motors during the lunch time, when the robotic welding cell is not in operation...|$|R
