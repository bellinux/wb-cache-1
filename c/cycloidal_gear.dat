40|$|In the paper, {{the design}} and {{operation}} of the planetary cycloidal transmission have been discussed. The transmission is a synthesis of the planetary and the straight-line mechanism.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} {{near the}} beginning of the article, the attainment of a nonfluctuating velocity ratio is dependent on the profile of the teeth.Friction and wear between two gears is also dependent on the tooth profile. There are a great many tooth profiles that provides a constant velocity ratio. In many cases, given an arbitrary tooth shape, it is possible to develop a tooth profile for the mating gear that provides a constant velocity ratio. However, two constant velocity tooth profiles are the most commonly used in modern times: the cycloid and the involute. The cycloid was more common until the late 1800s. Since then, the involute has largely superseded it, particularly in drive train applications. The cycloid is in some ways the more interesting and flexible shape; however the involute has two advantages: it is easier to manufacture, and it permits the center-to-center spacing of the gears to vary over some range without ruining the constancy of the velocity ratio. <b>Cycloidal</b> <b>gears</b> only work properly if the center spacing is exactly right. <b>Cycloidal</b> <b>gears</b> are still used in mechanical clocks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Robots {{that use}} <b>cycloidal</b> <b>gears,</b> belts, or long shafts for {{transmitting}} motion from the motors to the driven rigid links display visco-elastic phenomena {{that can be}} assumed to be concentrated at the joints. For the design of advanced, possibly nonlinear, trajectory tracking control laws {{that are able to}} fully counteract the vibrations due to joint elasticity, full state feedback is needed. However, no robot with elastic joints has sensors available for its whole state, i. e., for measuring positions and velocities of both motors and links. Several nonlinear observers have been proposed in the past, assuming different reduced sets of measurements. We introduce here a new observer which uses only motor position sensing, together with accelerometers suitably mounted on the links of the robot arm. Its main advantage is that the error dynamics on the estimated state is independent from the dynamic parameters of the robot links, and can be tuned with standard decentralized linear techniques (locally to each joint). We present an experimental validation of this observer for the three base joints of a KUKA KR 15 / 2 industrial robot and illustrate the control use of the obtained results. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The tooth {{flanks of}} bevel gears with {{involute}} teeth are still cut using approximations such as Tredgold’s and octoid curves, while {{the geometry of}} the exact spherical involute is well known. The modeling of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes, however, still represents a challenge to geometers. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop algorithms for the geometric modeling of these gears. As a matter of fact, the modeling of gears with skew axes and involute teeth is still an open question, as it is not even known whether it makes sense to speak of such tooth geometries. This paper is a contribution along these lines, as pertaining to gears with skew axes and cycloid teeth. To this end, the authors follow and extend results reported by Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20 th century concerning the general synthesis of gears with skew axes. The main goal is to shed light on the geometry of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes. The dualization of the tooth profiles of spherical <b>cycloidal</b> <b>gears</b> leads to ruled surfaces as conjugate tooth flanks such that at any instant the contact points are located on a straight line. A main result reported herein is Theorem 5, which is original. All results are proven by means of a consistent use of dual vectors representing directed lines and rigid-body twists...|$|R

40|$|Gears with {{involute}} profile {{have been used}} broadly as power transmission mechanisms. High speed reduction ratios can be obtained with trains of gears, resulting in high power losses due to friction. Compound planetary gears allow obtaining high speed reduction ratios with a lower number of gears involved in the power transmission, hence transmitting it with higher efficiency. Although high efficiency is a main requisite for speed reducers, for some applications it may be desirable to have an irreversible mechanism. A modern trend in power transmission systems is to use <b>cycloidal</b> profile <b>gears.</b> These systems present low backlash, high load capability and higher efficiency due to the rolling motion. Furthermore, their large transmission ratio in single stage allows more compact designs. The present paper deals {{with the development of}} a simplified model for the calculation of efficiency of cycloidal speed reducers. The followed approach takes into account the main parameters influencing the efficiency, in particular, the friction and the geometrical properties of the components. The resulting model is used to investigate the relation among efficiency and reduction ratio in order to define the conditions for the irreversibility.

40|$|The digital {{revolution}} has fundamentally changed our lives by giving us {{new ways to}} express ourselves through digital media. For example, accessible multimedia content creation tools allow people to instantiate their ideas and share them easily. However, most of these outcomes only exist on-screen and online. Despite the growing accessibility of digital design and fabrication tools the physical world and everyday objects surrounding us have been largely excluded from a parallel explosion of possibilities to express ourselves. Increasingly, webbased services allow professional and non-professional audiences to access computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) tools like 3 D-printing and laser-cutting. Nonetheless, there are few (if any) design tools and methods for creating complex mechanical assemblies that {{take full advantage of}} CAM systems. Creating unique mechatronic artifacts or "originalMachines" requires more specific and sophisticated design tools than exist today. "Object-Oriented Mechatronics" is a parametric design approach that connects knowledge about mechanical assemblies and electronics with the requirements of digital manufacturing processes. Parametric instances like gears, bearing and servos are made available as objects within a CAD environment which can then be implemented into specific projects. The approach addresses the missing link between accessible rapid-manufacturing services and currently available design tools thereby creating new opportunities for self-expression through mechatronic objects and machines. The dissertation matches mechanical components and assemblies with rapid manufacturing methods by exploring transferability of conventional manufacturing techniques to appropriate rapid manufacturing tools. I rebuild various gearing and bearing principles like four-contact point bearings, cross roller bearings, spur and helical <b>gears,</b> planetary <b>gears,</b> <b>cycloidal</b> and harmonic <b>gear</b> reducers using the laser cutter, the CNC-mill and the 3 D-printer. These explorations lead to more complex assemblies such as the PlywoodServo, 3 DprintedClock and 3 -DoF (Degree of Freedom) Head. The lessons from these explorations are summarized in a detailed "cook book" of novel mechatronic assemblies enabled by new fabrication tools. Furthermore, I use the results to develop a CAD tool that brings together several existing software packages and plug-ins including Rhino, Grasshopper and the Firefly experiments for Arduino, which will allow animation, fabrication and control of original machines. The tool is an example of an object-oriented design approach to mechatronic assemblies. A user calls a DoF (Degree of Freedom) object (parametric servo) with specific parameters like gearing and bearing types, motor options and control and communication capabilities. The DoF object then creates the corresponding geometry which can be connected and integrated with other actuators and forms. A group of roboticists and designers participated in a workshop to test the tool and make proposals for original machines using the tool. The dissertation has contributions on multiple levels. First, the actuator assembly examples and parametric design tool present a body of novel work that illustrates the benefits of going beyond off-the-shelf actuator assemblies and kit-of-parts for robotic objects. Second, this tool and the accompanying examples enable the design of more original machines with custom actuator assemblies using the latest digital fabrication tools. Finally, these explorations illustrate how new CAD/ CAM tools can facilitate an exchange between more design-oriented users and more engineering-oriented users. by Peter Schmitt. Thesis (Ph. D.)
