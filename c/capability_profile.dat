In response to this, this paper proposes the development and operation methodology for production control applications which are configured by cooperation of manufacturing software units provided by different vendors using capability profiling technology. In this methodology, a profile matcher uses the manufacturing software <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> repository to find and select adequate software units by <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> matching with the required <b>capability</b> <b>profile.</b> The manufacturing software <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> repository can be organized using a standardized method given by ISO 16100 to describe capabilities of manufacturing software units {{in terms of the}} <b>capability</b> <b>profile.</b> Based on information from the matcher's output, the production control application has been configured by combining selected software units. The application configurator organizes the production control application by plug-and-play of software units which match the <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> with the requirement. A profile matcher has been implemented. The experimentation that configured an application in a cloud environment that communicates with the equipment on the floor has been successfully done on a commercially available cloud service. This trial shows the potential for the proposed methodology as a solution for a quick and flexible configuration of a production control system...|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{identify}} {{the means by which}} information technology helps cocreate relational value in the context of interfirm relationships in the logistics industry—a large and information-intensive industry. We identify a set of IT functionalities—single-location shipping, multilocation shipping, supply chain visibility, and financial settlement—that can be used to manage the flows of physical goods, information, and finances across locations in interfirm logistics processes. Progressively more advanced sets of IT functionalities, when implemented and used in the interfirm relationship to execute logistics processes, are proposed to form four distinct IT <b>capability</b> <b>profiles</b> of increased sophistication. Interfirm IT <b>capability</b> <b>profiles</b> of higher sophistication are proposed to help cocreate greater relational value by facilitating the flows of physical goods, information, and finances across locations in the interfirm logistics process. Besides their direct role in helping cocreate relational value, these interfirm IT <b>capability</b> <b>profiles</b> are proposed to further enhance relational value cocreation when complemented by interfirm communications for business development and IT development. Our empirical study was situated in one of the world’s largest logistics suppliers and over 2, 000 of its interfirm relationships with buyers across industries. Integrated data from four archival sources on the IT functionalities implemented and used in interfirm logistics relationships, interfirm communications, relational value (share of wallet and loyalty), and multiple control variables were collected. The results show that the proposed interfirm IT <b>capability</b> <b>profiles</b> and interfirm communications have both a direct and an interaction effect on relational value. Implications for cocreating relational value in interfirm relationships with the aid of IT are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{large corpus}} of data {{obtained}} by means of empirical study of neuromuscular adaptation is currently of limited use to athletes and their coaches. One of the reasons lies in the unclear direct practical utility of many individual trials. This paper introduces a mathematical model of adaptation to resistance training, which derives its elements from physiological fundamentals on the one side, and empirical findings on the other. The key element of the proposed model is what is here termed the athlete’s <b>capability</b> <b>profile.</b> This is a generalization of length and velocity dependent force production characteristics of individual muscles, to an exercise with arbitrary biomechanics. The <b>capability</b> <b>profile,</b> a two-dimensional function over the capability plane, plays the {{central role in the}} proposed model of the training-adaptation feedback loop. Together with a dynamic model of resistance the <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> is used in the model’s predictive stage when exercise performance is simulated using a numerical approximation of differential equations of motion. Simulation results are used to infer the adaptational stimulus, which manifests itself through a fed back modification of the <b>capability</b> <b>profile.</b> It is shown how empirical evidence of exercise specificity can be formulated mathematically and integrated in this framework. A detailed description of the proposed model is followed by examples of its application—new insights into the effects of accommodating loading for powerlifting are demonstrated. This is followed by a discussion of the limitations of the proposed model and an overview of avenues for future work...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of financially and environmentally conscious manufacturing {{has resulted in}} a need for efficient process planning in today's manufacturing system. Process planning based on nominal machine tool specifications, limits predictive capabilities with regard to the final part quality. More efficient process plans can be achieved once an accurate machine tool <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> has been defined. Machine tool capability profiles deliver up-To-date resource attributes such as availability, health and applicability into the process-planning stage. A manufacturing resource's health degrades continuously throughout its life cycle due to environmental factors, part wear, operator competence, etc. Identifying and compensating for these factors during process planning may alleviate material wastage and machining estimate production time and cost via decision-making mechanisms. In this paper, the STEP-NC Standard is used to represent a model of machining resources, including worktable, spindle and tool status during a machine tool's operational lifespan. A prototype of machine tool <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> enabled process planning system is then presented and tested to highlight the advantages of this approach...|$|E
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) {{has been}} {{receiving}} growing attention {{in recent years}} as the next wave of computing revolution made possible by all types of networks of things (NoTs), where devices powered with low-cost, miniature low-power systems-on-chip (SoC) with computing and communication capabilities, and are bridged to the Internet with the assistance of gateways. More and more NoT device are designed to provide more than one functionalities to fulfill different requirements from the application domains. We believe that the true power of IoT is that functionalities of devices can work across application domains. In order to reveal the potential of IoT, the description of a device's capability needs to represent the functionalities that the device can provide. We discover the previous solutions on describing a device's capability focus mainly on hiding the vendor-specific interfaces made by different manufacturers, but they do not reflect different functionalities that a device provides. In this thesis, the concept of device <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> is proposed. Different from the previous solutions, the device <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> specified in the firmware of a device allows the device to work across different application domains. Together with device <b>capability</b> <b>profile,</b> a centralized IoT middleware framework, called rimware, is proposed. Rimware tracks every device's capability and state in a centralized manner and provides different ways for application domains to query against the device's functionalities. In addition, rimware utilizes the device <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> to carry out the enforcement of the security and privacy throughout the communication with the devices. Moreover, tasks can be scheduled through the rimware which enables functionalities from multiple devices to work together to fulfill the requirements from application domains. Optimization is applied on cases that one device working for multiple task simultaneously. An implementation of rimware that is specifically designed for BLE devices, called BlueRim, which takes advantages of BLE's very long battery life on the device side and the cloud functionality on the centralized side is provided. The fundamental features of rimware have been validated in several real-world applications from different different domains while incurring minimal code size and communication overhead on BLE devices. We believe that our approach represents an important technology in taking IoT closer to realizing the full potentials...|$|E

40|$|The {{capability}} {{approach is}} {{an approach to}} assessing well-being developed by Amartya Sen. Interest in this approach has resulted in several attempts to develop questionnaires to measure and value capability at an individual level in health economics. The methods of measuring and valuing capability used in the questionnaires are critically reviewed in this paper. It is argued that the methods used to measure capability result in a <b>capability</b> <b>profile</b> that is often an inaccurate description of the individual’s true capability set. In addition, existing methods of valuing capability do not consider that capability is a set, consisting of multiple combinations of functionings rather than a single combination, which means that existing methods of valuing capability may be inadequate. The difficulties in measuring and valuing capability faced by existing questionnaires means that using the capability approach in economic evaluations will require {{a significant amount of}} further research...|$|E
