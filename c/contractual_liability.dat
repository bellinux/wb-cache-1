40|$|Rapid {{transformations of}} the urban {{landscape}} to cope with infrastructure needs have adverse consequences on the aquatic environments from urban stormwater runoff flows and the associated pollutants washed into the rivers and lakes. The implementation of low impact design (LID) infrastructure is considered a better approach to conventional management and control of urban runoff but has been slow, or non-existent, in many new urban cities. In addition to institutional, technological, social and economic barriers, risks and concern for <b>contractual</b> <b>liabilities</b> are identified as factors prohibiting uptake of low impact design. This {{article is based on}} findings from interviews; a survey and online questionnaire. The data obtained from the online survey was analyzed using non-parametric tests. First, the study showed risk as the most dominant factor inhibiting implementation of LID infrastructure. In addition, the results show a significant difference exists between professionals with LID implementation hands-on experience versus their counterparts with theoretical knowledge alone. Due to self-efficacy of professionals with practical experience, they are more inclined to favour and promote LID infrastructure, and hence possess better propensity for <b>contractual</b> <b>liabilities</b> risk taking. Summarily, the article proposes dissemination of relevant information among practitioners to improve LID knowledge apprehension and utilization. This will reduce perception of risk that will promote uptake. In addition, team collaboration wit...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} cash {{balances}} of financial intermediaries that establish <b>contractual</b> <b>liabilities</b> with credit-sensitive customers is characterised. As stated by Merton, {{the success of}} the business activities of such firms crucially depends on their credit quality, and hence, they are obliged to rely on deposit insurance and capital cushions in order to assure that their promised payments are free of default. Unlike the Merton’s approach, the optimal guaranteeing contract is formulated in actuarial terms in this paper, because in this way the model can be extended to consider the situation of firms that can only hedge up to a limited extent. Within this framework, the equilibrium in the market determines the rate at which a unit of capital is exchange by a unit of risk, or, in other words, it determines the market price of risk. Episodes of liquidity crises are meaningful in this theoretical setting. ...|$|R

40|$|This Feature {{considers}} the debts of quasi-sovereign states {{in light of}} proposals to let them file for bankruptcy protection. States that have ceded some but not all sovereign prerogatives to a central government face distinct challenges as debtors. It is unhelpful to analyze these challenges mainly through the bankruptcy lens. State bankruptcy posits an institutional fix for a problem that remains theoretically undefined and empirically contested. I suggest a way of mapping the problem that does not work back from a solution. I highlight the implications of sovereign immunity, immortality, concurrent authority, macroeconomic policy, and democratic accountability for quasi-sovereign debt management. Bankruptcy centers on coordination failures and <b>contractual</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Neither is especially salient in quasi-sovereign debt. Along with default, fiscal transfers, and ad-hoc renegotiation, bankruptcy {{is one of several}} paths to reduce public debt overhang, but not necessarily the best path to state rehabilitation. It holds no special advantage against moral hazard from fiscal federalism and sovereign immunity. Even so, recent bankruptcy proposals have started a useful conversation joining previously disparate scholarship about credit market institutions, sovereign debt, fiscal federalism, and local government. The conversation should refocus on the problem of quasi-sovereign debt...|$|R
40|$|Conventional wisdom decrees that {{in order}} for {{insurers}} to provide cover, they require capital. One of the many methods of calculating capital requirements of short-term insurers is the insolvency put option framework. This technique was originally introduced by Merton (1977). The general argument is that bankruptcy occurs when shareholders exercise a valuable put option. Indeed, the corporation was introduced to protect shareholders from, mainly <b>contractual,</b> <b>liabilities</b> of persons who trade with the corporation. The corporation thus introduced the idea of limited liability of shareholders or as is often called the corporate veil. However, if a company defaults on its debt then equity holders have decided to allow an embedded call option to expire unexercised. As a result shareholders will behave as if they in fact hold a call option, which creates a different incentive than that suggested by the insolvency put idea. This study examines the role of capital and the influence of the insolvency put option within a short-term insurer. Specifically, it is argued that capital is not the cornerstone of a short-term insurer. Moreover, using Brownian motion and Itō calculus as well as continuous time financial models a more complete mathematical description of an insurance company is articulated by explicitly taking the embedded equity call option into account...|$|R

The declaration theory, on the other hand, grounds <b>contractual</b> <b>liability</b> purely on concurring and objective declarations of will. Inner will or actual intention is irrelevant.|$|E

Each alternative or supplemental service has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Finally, private police functions can be flexible, depending upon the financial, organizational, political, and situational circumstances of the client.|$|R
40|$|The {{modern era}} is {{a harbinger of}} ultra-modern, highly {{complicated}} and sophisticated technology, trade and industry. The 21 st century saw great economic change in market place. In the realm of supply of goods, globalisation and the advancement of technology have {{a tremendous impact on}} the production, distribution and consumption of goods. This new phenomenon has led to a major concern on the market place as the guarantor of the best interest of consumers. The disparity in the consumers’ bargaining power, resources and knowledge vis-à-vis traders in market place has led to a need for a better legal protection in the realm of supply of goods. However, achieving a fair balance between the needs of market providers and the consumers is indeed a major challenge to law makers. Applying the content analysis method, this paper aims at exploring the provisions on trader’s <b>contractual</b> <b>liabilities</b> and remedies under the consumer contract for the supply of goods in Malaysia, United Kingdom, European Union and based on the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
