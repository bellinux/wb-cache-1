50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{exported}} 373 kn of {{finished products}} (48.5% of production). 881 kn of various products were exported in 2004, including 477 kn of HBI (54% of exports) and 72 kn of rebar. It {{is considered the}} only Arab company manufacturing this material. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> were 59% of exports in 2004. Europe received about 64.4% followed by Asian and Arab countries. Higher domestic demand for rebar resulted in exports declining to 20 kn in 2004. Exports {{in the first half}} of 2005 was approximately 384 kn; mostly HBI (54%) and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (31.7%). Exports fell for long <b>products</b> (81%), <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (20%) and HBI (5%). This drop is due to the fact that the company stopped exporting rebar as well as a global recession, which led to a demand contraction for iron and steel products, particularly hot-rolled coils and HBI. Exports in 2006 exceeded one million tons, including 449 kn of <b>flat</b> <b>products.</b> During the first quarter of 2006 Lisco increased hot-rolled coils exports by 125% and exported sponge iron for the first time.|$|R
40|$|A {{performance}} evaluation {{was made of}} two, black nickel <b>coated,</b> <b>flat</b> plate solar collectors.

Performance curves and performance parameters are presented to point out the importance of the design variables which determine an efficient collector. A black nickel coated collector was found to be a good performer at the conditions expected for solar powered absorption air conditioning.

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a CFD {{approach}} to predict the resistance {{as a function of}} surface roughness by performing CFD simulations of towing tests of <b>coated</b> <b>flat</b> plates. Following a brief description of roughness and the roughness effect on flow and the turbulent boundary layer, the methodology of determination of the most suitable roughness function model {{to be used in the}} software is discussed in details. Next, the CFD approaches to represent smooth and rough velocity profile are presented. Finally, a new roughness function model is suggested and employed in the CFD software while a case study is performed to obtain the frictional resistance coefficients (CF) of <b>coated</b> <b>flat</b> plates using the modified CFD approach. The results of the new approach show a very good agreement with the experimental data and it is shown that the new approach is able to predict the resistance of ship coatings as a function of roughness height...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{produced}} 835 kn of {{long and}} <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> (444kt long products; 391 kn of <b>flat</b> <b>products),</b> including 412 kn of rebar, 391 kn of hot-rolled coils, and 412 kn of HBI. Production of long and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> grew 18% in 2004; mainly rebar (460kt); hot-rolled coils (429kt) and HBI (606kt). Lisco produced over 574 kn of finished {{products in the}} first half of 2005, increasing 65% over the first half of 2004. The company also increased liquid steel production 52%. Rebar was 57.3% of finished products, hot-rolled coils was 39.3%. Sponge iron production was 579.407 tons, 348.243 tons of HBI, 376.239 tons of billets and blooms and 281.832 tons of slabs. During the first nine months of 2005, Lisco reached its highest production ever; 1 million tons of liquid steel. This was confirmed by Secretary of the Popular Committee, Dr. Mohammad Abu Ojeila Al-Mabrouk at celebrations in September 2005 on the occasion of the passage of 15 years since the company’s mills began production, which concurs with the anniversary of the Al-Fatah Revolution in Libya. In 2005, Lisco achieved the highest rate of increase in steel production among Arab companies, which amounted to 34.8%. Its production increased by 65% in the period from January to June 2005 compared with the same period of 2004. Production of both long and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> was 1.070 tons in 2006. <b>Flat</b> <b>products</b> achieved a new output record for the company of 564kt, 13% higher than 2005. Production of bars and rods was 26% lower than 2005. Long product sales were 642 kn in 2006, a sizeable increase from 634 kn in 2005, forcing the company to import 168 kn of long products, mostly from Ukraine.|$|R

During the first quarter of 2006, 145.7 kn of rebar was sold domestically, a 9% increased compared to 1Q2005; additionally, domestic sales of hot-rolled coils increased 93 percent to 5.6 kn. Higher domestic sales volume reflected a growing trend in the Libyan market's demand and consumption rates for steel products, especially for rebar, which amounted to 138.6 kn.|$|R

50|$|Further {{factors were}} that Newcastle was {{situated}} on main rail and road routes between Johannesburg and Durban, essential {{services such as}} water and electricity were already well catered for, and the town had a basic established infrastructure with a settled community. While ore {{would have to be}} transported 1 000 km from Sishen, coking coal was available from nearby and the overall economics were favourable. It was decided that both profile and <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> would be catered for in a plant with an ultimate capacity of 8 million tons per annum of liquid steel. Subsequent changes in steel markets has meant that extension to <b>flat</b> <b>products</b> has been delayed indefinitely and the current capacity is about 2,00 million tons of liquid steel.|$|R
