25|$|A contourite is a {{sedimentary}} deposit commonly formed on <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> to lower slope settings, {{although they may}} occur anywhere that is below storm wave base. Countourites are produced by thermohaline-induced deepwater bottom currents and {{may be influenced by}} wind or tidal forces. The geomorphology of contourite deposits is mainly influenced by the deepwater bottom-current velocity, sediment supply, and seafloor topography.|$|E
25|$|Demersal fish live on or {{near the}} bottom of the sea. Demersal fish are found by the {{seafloor}} in coastal areas on the continental shelf, and in the open ocean they are found along the outer continental margin on the continental slope and the <b>continental</b> <b>rise.</b> They are not generally found at abyssopelagic or hadopelagic depths or on the abyssal plain. They occupy a range of seafloors consisting of mud, sand, gravel or rocks.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the term contourite has varied throughout the decades. Originally, Heezen et al. (1966) defined the concept, without using the actual word, as a sedimentary deposit on the <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> derived from thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents that flow parallel to bathymetric contours. They did this to emphasize the difference between these deposits and turbidites in order to explain the ubiquitous smoothness and lack of irregularities of the <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> in the Blake-Bahama Basin. Before this, it was thought that only turbidity flows were capable of depositing and reworking sediment at depths greater than the continental slope. Hollister and Heezen (1972) adopted the name contourite for these deposits and provided a list of characteristics that described their sediments. Faugères and Stow (1993) note that as research on the subject developed, the term contourite was used to describe various forms of sedimentary deposits from bottom-currents including those at much shallower depths and even in lacustrine settings. They suggested going back to the original {{definition of}} a contourite, that is for deposits at depths greater than 500 m derived from stable thermohaline-induced geostrophic bottom-currents (i.e. deepwater bottom-currents), in order to avoid using the same name when describing sedimentary deposits formed by different processes. They also suggest the umbrella term bottom-current deposit, which includes contourites and deposits generated by other bottom-currents.|$|E

25|$|Demersal fish {{live and}} feed {{on or near}} the bottom of seas or lakes (the {{demersal}} zone). They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks. In coastal waters they are found {{on or near the}} continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the <b>continental</b> <b>rise.</b> They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word demersal comes from the Latin demergere, which means to sink.|$|E
25|$|A state's {{exclusive}} {{economic zone}} starts at the seaward edge of its territorial sea and extends outward to a distance of 200 nautical miles (370.4km) from the baseline. The {{exclusive economic zone}} stretches much further into sea than the territorial waters, which end at 12 nmi (22km) from the coastal baseline (if following the rules {{set out in the}} UN Convention on the Law of the Sea). Thus, the exclusive economic zones includes the contiguous zone. States also have rights to the seabed of what is called the continental shelf up to 350 nautical miles (648km) from the coastal baseline, beyond the exclusive economic zones, but such areas are not part of their exclusive economic zones. The legal definition of the continental shelf does not directly correspond to the geological meaning of the term, as it also includes the <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> and slope, and the entire seabed within the exclusive economic zone.|$|E
25|$|Periodically, {{velocities}} {{may increase}} dramatically or even reverse due to atmospheric storms raising the local surface eddy kinetic energy, which gets partially transmitted down to abyssal depths in episodes called benthic storms. These velocities may reach magnitudes well above 40cm/s and vary significantly {{depending on the}} specific location. At the lower <b>continental</b> <b>rise,</b> south of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and at the lower slope around the Faeroe Islands these velocities may reach up to 73cm/s and 75cm/s, respectively. Bottom-current flow velocities have been measured as high as 300cm/s in the Strait of Gibraltar. These benthic storms occur only 5 to 10 times per year and usually last between 3 and 5 days, but that is enough to heavily erode benthic sediment and keep the finer grains in suspension even after flow velocities return to normal and the bedload has been deposited. During benthic storms, the eroded sediment may be transported over thousands of kilometers and deposited rather quickly (i.e. ~1.5cm/month) once the storm wanes. However, the net sedimentation rate over thousands of years may be much smaller (i.e. ~5.5cm/year) due to the intense periods of erosion during benthic storms.|$|E

25|$|The {{edge of the}} {{continental}} shelf marks the boundary where the shelf gives way to, and then gradually drops into abyssal depths. This edge marks the boundary between coastal, relatively shallow, benthic habitats, and the deep benthic habitats. Coastal demersal fishes live {{on the bottom of}} inshore waters, such as bays and estuaries, and further out, on the floor of {{the continental}} shelf. Deep water demersal fish live beyond this edge, mostly down the continental slopes and along the <b>continental</b> <b>rises</b> which drop to the abyssal plains. This is the continental margin, constituting about 28% of the total oceanic area. Other deep sea demersal fish can also be found around seamounts and islands.|$|R
500|$|An {{abyssal plain}} is an {{underwater}} plain on the deep ocean floor, usually found at depths between [...] and [...] Lying generally between {{the foot of}} a <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> and a mid-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover more than 50% of the Earth’s surface. They are among the flattest, smoothest and least explored regions on Earth.

50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the {{continental}} slope, one will find the <b>continental</b> <b>rise,</b> an underwater hill composed of tons of accumulated sediments. The general slope of the <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> is between 0.5 degrees and 1.0 degrees. Deposition of sediments at the mouth of submarine canyons may form enormous fan-shaped accumulations called submarine fans. Submarine fans form part of the <b>continental</b> <b>rise.</b> Beyond the <b>continental</b> <b>rise</b> stretches the abyssal plain, an extremely deep and flat area of the sea floor. The abyssal plain hosts many unique life forms which are uniquely adapted to survival in its cold, high pressure, and dark conditions. The flatness of the abyssal plain is interrupted by massive underwater mountain chains near the tectonic boundaries of the Earth's plates.The sediments are mostly sand and pieces of coral or rock.|$|E
