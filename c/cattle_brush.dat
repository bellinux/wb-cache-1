40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate possible effects of environmental enrichment on the behaviour and extent of coat contamination of beef calves. In total, 180 Holstein beef calves were followed for a period of 20 weeks from the age of two weeks. Feeding ration and housing conditions were similar for all calves. After arriving on the farm, calves were given an adaptation period of four weeks. After this period, they were divided into three groups: pen with Jolly Ball™ (10 pens), pen with <b>cattle</b> <b>brush</b> (10 pens) and barren pen (control group) (10 pens). Each pen housed 6 calves. Jolly Balls™ were hung at an altitude of 1. 3 m, in the middle of the pen. Cattle brushes were attached to the pen wall at an altitude of 1. 2 m. Behavioural observations were carried out two days a week, according to a scan sample method. All observations were performed by the same observer and the ethogram used was based on existing literature. Next to behaviour, the extent of coat contamination of the calves was scored three times throughout the study. Data were analysed using the statistical software program SAS 9. 3. Behavioural data lacked normality and were therefore analysed using a logistic mixed model. Contamination data were analyzed using a Fisher’s Exact Test. Behavioural results indicate that calves of the control group, without environmental enrichment, lied down more than calves in the enriched pens (P < 0. 0001). They also ran (P < 0. 0001) and jumped around (P < 0. 0001) less than the other calves. Results also revealed a difference in social behaviour; animals in enriched pens displayed more social behaviour (P < 0. 0001) than calves in non-enriched pens. There were also differences between the different forms of enrichment. In pens with a <b>cattle</b> <b>brush,</b> animals self-groomed less (P = 0. 0004) than those in control or Jolly Ball™-pens. However, there was no difference in playing behaviour between calves with the <b>cattle</b> <b>brush</b> or the Jolly Ball™. Results also indicated no association between treatment groups concerning extent of coat contamination. As a conclusion, environmental enrichment in the form of Jolly Balls™ or cattle brushes did not influence the extent of coat contamination of beef calves but did have a positive influence on their behaviour. Calves in enriched pens displayed more playing and social behavior compared to calves in non-enriched pens. The two forms of enrichment tested in this study both equally induced play behaviour in calves, so both forms can be applied successfully to enrich the otherwise barren environment of beef calves. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|While the {{provision}} of environmental enrichment generally has a beneficial effect on welfare, the effect of removing environmental enrichment from animals raised with enrichment is more unpredictable. The objective {{of the present study}} was therefore to investigate how {{the provision}} of environmental enrichment followed by the enrichment removal impacts the behavior of veal calves. At 12 weeks of age, 180 Holstein-Friesian veal calves were randomly allocated to one of 3 housing conditions (each applied in 10 pens with 6 calves per pen) : enriched pens with cattle brushes, enriched pens with Jolly ballsTM or control (no enrichment) pens. After 6 weeks, the enrichment was removed from the pens, so all pens were barren again. Starting on the day of enrichment removal, behavior of calves was observed for 3 weeks by a single observer. On fixed days (2 days per week), the observer scored the calvesÃ¢ÂÂ behaviors using focal sampling. Behavioral observations were carried out in the morning and in the afternoon. Animals of formerly enriched pens manipulated pen components more frequently (brushes: 0. 62 ÃÂ± 0. 04 and Jolly balls: 0. 56 ÃÂ± 0. 05) than animals of the control group (0. 32 ÃÂ± 0. 02); P = 0. 0001), and calves that used to have access to a <b>cattle</b> <b>brush</b> tended to self-groom less than calves that used to have access to a Jolly ballTM (0. 017 ÃÂ± 0. 0008) vs. 0. 058 ÃÂ± 0. 02; P = 0. 0646). No other behaviors were affected by the housing treatment (P > 0. 05). Our study shows that removal of environmental enrichment leads to more re-directed exploratory behaviors in veal calves, but does not affect other behavioral indicators of welfare. status: publishe...|$|E

5000|$|The {{brush of}} the tail is only useful as a guide when {{assessing}} small, stunted or young <b>cattle.</b> A <b>brush</b> that is about fetlock length or longer {{is an indication that}} the beast is twelve months old or older. This method cannot be used on cattle which have been bang-tailed. Bang tailing is the act of cutting the long hairs at the tip {{of the tail}} short to act as a simple identifier of animals and is commonly used after a procedure has been performed on an individual animal that belongs to a large mob e.g. the mob is run through a race and each animal is vaccinated - immediately after being vaccinated the animal is bang-tailed so they are identified as vaccinated and will not be given a second dose of vaccine. This is useful when large numbers of animals are being processed by a group of individuals.|$|R

The railroad has been superseded for such purposes by the 18-wheelers. Walker also used a helicopter to gather <b>cattle</b> from the <b>brush.</b> The copter greatly reduces the need for saddle horses.

50|$|This species {{occurs in}} canyons, stream sides, and rocky terrain. It has been {{collected}} {{in a variety of}} habitats in Mexico, including open desert-scrub and mesquite-grasslands, tropical areas, mountains, coastal plains, cornfields surrounded by brushland or adjacent to grassy plains and thickets of bull-horn acacia, thorn woodland, and riparian forests, characterized by live-oaks, pecans, sycamores, and Texas persimmons and an understory of briars, grasses, and weeds. It also has been found in pine-oak forest and in scrub and cacti. In Kleberg County, Texas, C. leuconotus occurs in mesquite-brushland, pastures, and native grassland, used exclusively for <b>cattle</b> ranching. Thorny <b>brush</b> and cactus are the predominant vegetation in the region of southern Texas where this species occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Dogs are {{typically}} used {{where it is}} possible or helpful to do so. The hardy Australian Kelpie or one of its crosses {{is the most popular}} breed of dog for mustering sheep and cattle in Australia. The Australian Cattle Dog or [...] "blue heeler" [...] is a popular ranch dog in the US, as is the Border Collie and related crossbreds. It may be difficult or impossible to use dogs in hot, dry or burry conditions. The use of some dogs on cows with young calves may be counterproductive as cows will chase dogs that work too close to them. Working dogs are essential in the rugged gorge country and also in scrubby locations where dogs are able to flush out <b>cattle</b> from low <b>brush.</b> The flight zone, too, is an important principle to remember when working or mustering livestock. When mustering cattle in isolated gorge country a good dog will silently move ahead of the stockman and block up the stock until the rider appears to take control. In Australia, a stockwhip is usually carried and used as needed when mustering cattle with horses. In North America, a lasso is used from horseback, both to rope and move particularly recalcitrant animals, but also as a simple goad. However, a different style of whip, also called a [...] "stock whip," [...] may be utilized by handlers on the ground.|$|R
40|$|Much of hill land pasture in the Appalachian {{region of}} the United States is weed and brush infested. In addition, over 500, 000 ha of forest in the Southeastern {{region of the}} country is invaded by kudzu (Pueraria lobata). Current weed {{management}} and control practices rely heavily on herbicides. Low cost, low input and environmentally acceptable reclamation procedures are needed to maintain these pastures and forest land in production. A field study was initiated at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture Mountain Research Station in Western North Carolina {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} utilizing goats alone (30 mature brush does/ha) or in combination with <b>cattle</b> (17 mature <b>brush</b> does/ha + 2 to 3 steers/ha- 225 kg live weight) to renovate overgrown mountain pastures and to control multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora Thunb.) bushes. Over four grazing seasons, managed defoliation with goats alone or goats with cattle resulted in a substantial increase in vegetative cover (goats: 65 to 86 %; goats + cattle: 65 to 80 %) by favorable grass and legume species (goats: 16 to 63 %; goats + cattle: 13 to 54 %) while vegetative cover decreased from 70 to 22 % in the control plot. Multiflora rose bushes were practically eliminated over the 4 -year period in both the goat (100 %) or goat + cattle (92 %) treatments.
