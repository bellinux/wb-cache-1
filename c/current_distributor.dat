With Shout's release of the 39th volume of MST3K episodes in 2017, the company anticipated that only about a dozen episodes from the original series' run will never make it to home video due to licensing rights of the movies featured.|$|E

5000|$|With the Elektra acquisition, {{the next}} step was forming an {{in-house}} distribution arm for the co-owned labels. By this time, Warner-Reprise's frustrations with its <b>current</b> <b>distributors</b> had reached breaking point; Joe Smith (then Executive Vice-President of Warner Bros.) recalled that the Grateful Dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums. These circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the group's in-house distribution arm, initially called Kinney Record Group International. By late 1972, US anti-trust laws had changed and the company was renamed Warner-Elektra-Atlantic, WEA for short, which was renamed Warner Music in 1991 (the word [...] "group" [...] was added after the formation of AOL Time Warner).|$|R

Lenovo expects to release its first products intended for Britain at the IFA trade show in Germany in September 2014. Lenovo said that entering the British market would take about nine months due to the fact that most phones in the United Kingdom are sold with service contracts. Carriers have strict requirements for the phones they sell. Lenovo plans to use its <b>current</b> <b>distributors,</b> Exertis Micro-P, Ingram Micro, and Tech Data to sell its mobile phones.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies at}} the plant scale have shown that thermal {{management}} is a crucial point in molten carbonate fuel cell operation optimisation. At the local scale, the principal mechanisms controlling the temperature map on the cell plane have been analysed {{and it has been}} shown that the fluid dynamics of the anodic and cathodic gases on the cell could have a fundamental role in thermal optimisation. So, the authors have analysed the gas flow in planner cells, using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique and identifying the characteristic fluid-dynamic parameters. The studied structure consists of a typical <b>current</b> collector/gas <b>distributor</b> formed by a plurality of arches with suitable height to provide sufficient reactant flow area, proper stiffness to accept compressive load and adequate resiliently to distribute the load and maintain electrical contact. The results of this analysis are presented and discussed in this paper, while the modelling approach is presented as a useful tool for improving the <b>current</b> collector/gas <b>distributor</b> design, identifying new technological solutions and optimising MCFC performance...|$|R
