5|$|In humans, this {{response}} is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> to carbohydrates on {{the surfaces of}} microbes. This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response. The speed of the response {{is a result of}} signal amplification that occurs after sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules, which are also proteases. After <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction. This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, <b>complement</b> <b>proteins,</b> and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|The {{base of the}} Y {{plays a role in}} {{modulating}} immune cell activity. This {{region is}} called the Fc (Fragment, crystallizable) region, and is composed of two heavy chains that contribute two or three constant domains depending on the class of the antibody. Thus, the Fc region ensures that each antibody generates an appropriate immune response for a given antigen, by binding to a specific class of Fc receptors, and other immune molecules, such as <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> By doing this, it mediates different physiological effects including recognition of opsonized particles (binding to FcγR), lysis of cells (binding to complement), and degranulation of mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils (binding to FcεR).|$|E

5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, <b>complement</b> <b>proteins,</b> and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E
25|$|As of yet, {{there have}} not been any {{reported}} cases of mycosis associated with M. plumbeus. However, studies have revealed that the spores of M. plumbeus {{have the ability to}} activate the complement system in humans via the alternative pathway. In addition, studies involving various <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> on fungal surfaces suggest that M. plumbeus spores can activate all pathways of the complement system. Mucor plumbeus is not known to produce any mycotoxins.|$|E
25|$|Antinuclear {{antibody}} (ANA) {{testing and}} anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) form {{the mainstay of}} serologic testing for SLE. Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. Clinically {{the most widely used}} method is indirect immunofluorescence (IF). The pattern of fluorescence suggests the type of antibody present in the people's serum. Direct immunofluorescence can detect deposits of immunoglobulins and <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> in the people's skin. When skin not exposed to the sun is tested, a positive direct IF (the so-called lupus band test) is an evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus.|$|E
50|$|The {{membrane}} attack {{complex is}} initiated when the <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C5 convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b.|$|R

50|$|Protein S (also {{known as}} S-Protein) is a vitamin K-dependent plasma {{glycoprotein}} synthesized in the liver. In the circulation, Protein S exists in two forms: a free form and a complex form bound to <b>complement</b> <b>protein</b> C4b-binding protein (C4BP). In humans, protein S is encoded by the PROS1 gene.|$|R
25|$|The {{complement}} system {{has the potential}} to be extremely damaging to host tissues, meaning its activation must be tightly regulated. The {{complement system}} is regulated by complement control proteins, which are present at a higher concentration in the blood plasma than the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> themselves. Some complement control proteins are present on the membranes of self-cells preventing them from being targeted by complement. One example is CD59, also known as protectin, which inhibits C9 polymerisation during the formation of the membrane attack complex. The classical pathway is inhibited by C1-inhibitor, which binds to C1 to prevent its activation.|$|E
25|$|Several of the {{proteins}} that anchor to GPI {{on the cell}} membrane are used to protect the cell from destruction by the complement system, and, without these anchors, the cells are more easily targeted by the <b>complement</b> <b>proteins.</b> Although red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are targeted by complement, red blood cells are particularly vulnerable to lysis. The complement system {{is part of the}} innate immune system and has a variety of functions, from destroying invading microorganisms by opsonization to direct destabilization by the membrane attack complex. The main proteins that protect blood cells from destruction are decay-accelerating factor (DAF/CD55), which disrupts formation of C3-convertase, and protectin (CD59/MIRL/MAC-IP), which binds the membrane attack complex and prevents C9 from binding to the cell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Functionally active {{complement}} system and <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> {{are present in}} the normal human and rodent eye. Complement activation and its regulation by ocular <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> contribute to the pathology of various ocular diseases including keratitis, uveitis and age-related macular degeneration. Furthermore, a strong relationship between age-related macular degeneration and polymorphism in the genes of certain <b>complement</b> components/complement regulatory <b>proteins</b> is now well established. Recombinant forms of the naturally occurring <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> have been exploited in the animal models for treatment of these ocular diseases.

40|$|<b>Complement</b> {{regulatory}} <b>proteins</b> in glomerular diseases. Complement activation plays {{a critical}} role in the pathogenesis of many forms of glomerulonephritis. Complement activation leads to tissue injury through various mechanisms including the generation of chemotactic factors and activation of the resident glomerular cells following C 5 b- 9 insertion. Recent advances have disclosed the mechanisms of regulation of complement activation by discovery of a number of <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins.</b> Decay accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor <b>protein</b> (MCP), and <b>complement</b> receptor type 1 (CR 1) act by inactivating C 3 /C 5 convertase. They belong to the gene superfamily known as the regulators of complement activation (RCA), and share a common structural motif called a short consensus repeat (SCR). In contrast, CD 59 works by inhibiting formation of C 5 b- 9. The glomerulus is particularly well endowed with these membrane-bound <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins.</b> DAF, MCP, and CD 59 are ubiquitously expressed by all three resident glomerular cells, while CR 1 is localized exclusively in podocytes. Expression of <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> can be changed by many factors including complement attack itself, and their expression levels are affected in various glomerular disorders. Studies utilizing cultured glomerular cells and animal models of glomerular diseases suggest important protective roles of <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> against immune-mediated renal injury. Recent progress in molecular biological techniques has made new therapeutic strategy feasible. Systemic administration of soluble recombinant <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> and local overexpression of <b>complement</b> regulatory <b>proteins</b> are promising therapeutic approaches...|$|R

50|$|When the {{paratope}} of Ig class gamma (IgG) binds its matching epitope, IgG's Fc region conformationally {{shifts and}} can host a <b>complement</b> <b>protein,</b> initiating the <b>complement</b> cascade that terminates by punching {{a hole in}} a cell membrane.

5000|$|In certain {{diseases}} or conditions, an individual's blood {{may contain}} IgG antibodies that can specifically bind to antigens on the RBC surface membrane, and their circulating RBCs can become coated with IgG alloantibodies and/or IgG autoantibodies. <b>Complement</b> <b>proteins</b> may subsequently bind to the bound antibodies and cause RBC destruction. The direct Coombs test {{is used to}} detect these antibodies or <b>complement</b> <b>proteins</b> that are bound {{to the surface of}} red blood cells; a blood sample is taken and the RBCs are washed (removing the patient's own plasma) and then incubated with anti-human globulin (also known as [...] "Coombs reagent"). If this produces agglutination of RBCs, the direct Coombs test is positive, a visual indication that antibodies (and/or <b>complement</b> <b>proteins)</b> are bound to the surface of red blood cells.|$|E
