40|$|Rigorosum thesis "Principle of {{contradiction in}} court {{proceedings}} {{and its future}} in Czech criminal process" is focused mainly {{on the extent to}} which the <b>current</b> Czech <b>criminal</b> <b>proceedings</b> reflect the principle of contradiction and also to which the existing criminal process enables any further expansion of this principle's manifestation. The thesis is trying to find the reasons why the Czech judicial practice usually refuses to accept and use certain characteristic symptoms of contradictiory proceedings in the form of an increase in activities and the burdens of the responsible parties despite the fact that the legislator tried to introduce those symptoms into statutory text explicitly.
