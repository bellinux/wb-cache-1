50|$|The main {{conceptual}} difference {{under this}} arrangement is that changes {{made to a}} prototype object are not automatically propagated to clones. This {{may be seen as}} an advantage or disadvantage. (However, Kevo does provide additional primitives for publishing changes across sets of objects based on their similarity — so-called family resemblances or clone family mechanism — rather than through taxonomic origin, as is typical in the delegation model.) It is also sometimes claimed that delegation-based prototyping has an additional disadvantage in that changes to a <b>child</b> <b>object</b> may affect the later operation of the parent. However, this problem is not inherent to the delegation-based model and does not exist in delegation-based languages such as JavaScript, which ensure that changes to a <b>child</b> <b>object</b> are always recorded in the <b>child</b> <b>object</b> itself and never in parents (i.e. the child's value shadows the parent's value rather than changing the parent's value).|$|R

5000|$|The element {{declares}} an [...] {{method to}} accept a visitor, taking the visitor as an argument. Concrete elements, derived from the element class, implement the [...] method.

30|$|Lines 5 to 9 define an {{interface}} type for the template. This type selects every <port> {{element in the}} padding document whose class attribute has “pButton” as value. Concerning indexation, the first element found in the padding document that agrees with the “port[class = pButton]” selector {{is related to the}} pButton [1] identifier; the second to the pButton [2] and so on. This procedure is particularly useful to understand the mapping specifications, defined in lines 6 to 8, between each “pButton” interface to each corresponding “button” component. Note in line 6 how iteration is defined on each pButton[i] interface instance. In line 7 the interface of a <b>child</b> <b>object</b> is specified, by using component attribute and omitting the interface attribute. When the interface parameter is omitted, it is assumed that the <b>child</b> <b>object</b> interface corresponds to the one representing the whole content of the object.|$|R
30|$|When an <{{interface}}> element defines an {{interface type}} for a composition, in particular for the template, {{it can also}} define a mapping to an interface of a <b>child</b> <b>object</b> of the composition, externalizing this mapped interface. As mappings can be established among types, <forEach> child elements {{can be used to}} iterate on these type instances.|$|R

50|$|After {{following}} these steps, two <b>child</b> <b>objects</b> will be produced for every pair of parent objects used.

50|$|Each {{analysis}} {{or design}} space within STK {{is called a}} scenario. Within each scenario any number of satellites, aircraft, targets, ships, communications systems or other objects can be created. Each scenario defines the default temporal limits to the <b>child</b> <b>objects,</b> {{as well as the}} base unit selection and properties. All of these properties can be overridden for each child object individually, as necessary. Only one scenario may exist at any one time, although data can be exported and reused in subsequent analyses.|$|E

5000|$|In prototype-based {{languages}} {{that use}} delegation, the language runtime {{is capable of}} dispatching the correct method or finding the right piece of data simply by following a series of delegation pointers (from object to its prototype) until a match is found. All that is required to establish this behavior-sharing between objects is the delegation pointer. Unlike the relationship between class and instance in class-based object-oriented languages, {{the relationship between the}} prototype and its offshoots does not require that the <b>child</b> <b>object</b> have a memory or structural similarity to the prototype beyond this link. As such, the <b>child</b> <b>object</b> can continue to be modified and amended over time without rearranging the structure of its associated prototype as in class-based systems. It is also important to note that not only data, but also methods can be added or changed. For this reason, some prototype-based languages refer to both data and methods as [...] "slots" [...] or [...] "members".|$|R

The managed objects are instances of object classes defined by the relevant AIS service specification, which defines the class attributes and administrative operations. The administrative operations specified for the object classes represent operations that can be performed on the entities represented by the objects, e.g. locking a service unit or exporting the contents of the IM in XML format. The objects in the IM are stored in a tree hierarchy where an object can have, at most, one parent object and any number of <b>child</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Accusations that Brazil {{does not}} comply with the Hague Convention hinge on {{conflicting}} interpretations of Article 12 and Article 13 of the Convention. According to Article 12, [...] "The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the {{period of one year}} ... shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment," [...] It is the second part of this article that is used as a defence in all Hague disputes in Brazil {{and one of the reasons}} why they are held up for so long. Brazilian federal courts routinely accept evidence from Brazilian abducting parents to the effect that the abducted child has become settled in his/her new environment and the U.S. State Department has claimed that Brazilian Courts erroneously treat Hague cases as custody disputes, unnecessarily delaying cases and demonstrating an unfair bias toward Brazilian citizens, especially mothers. In addition to this, Article 13 of the Convention states, “The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to orderthe return of the child if it finds that the <b>child</b> <b>objects</b> to being returned and has attainedan age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of itsviews,” while Article 13(b) states that children should not be returned to their habitual residence if “there is a grave risk that his or herreturn would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placethe child in an intolerable situation.” Brazilian abducting parents often present evidence to the court in the form of statements from the abducted child to the effect that they wish to stay in Brazil. A 1999 report by Prof. Nigel Lowe of the Cardiff University Centre for International Family Law Studies in the U.K. raised concerns about children not being returned to their place of habitual residence because of a misunderstanding of what the term 'habitual residence' meant (i.e., rather than referring to restoration of the status quo ante the abduction, abducting parents argue that it refers to the status quo and they are more likely to be able to argue this point if they can delay the judicial process long enough). Lowe states, [...] "courts need also to consider any undue parental influence on the child, either through deliberate indoctrination by the abducting parent or simplyby the natural inclination of many children to support a present parent against an absentparent." [...] The report stresses that abducted children's wishes should not override the spirit and the intent of the Convention and implies that the part of Article 13 that affirm [...] "The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the <b>child</b> <b>objects</b> to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views." [...] should be considered null and void by making that part of the Article not have any use, because for children to be considered to have the maturity to decide where they want to be they should have reached the age of 16 - the cut-off point for Hague Convention cases.|$|E
