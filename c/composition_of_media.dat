The quantity of protein secreted by these isolates into the media was not significantly different between serovars, but haemolytic activity was only detected in the unconcentrated supernatants from cultures of serovar 1 and 5 isolates. Haemolytic activity in supernatants of serovar 2, 3 and 7 isolates was detected only after the supernatants were concentrated. On Southern hybridization blots, genomic DNA of serovar 1 and 5 isolates contained regions which were similar to the cloned structural genes for ApxI (apxIA) and for ApxII (apxIIA). In contrast, genomic DNA of serovar 2, 3 and 7 isolates only contained regions similar to, if not identical with, the cloned apxIIA gene. The haemolytic activity of the culture supernatant depended on the type or <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>media</b> and adaptability of the bacteria to in vitro cultivation.

40|$|Summary. The on-line {{diagnosis}} {{is a key}} requirement of industrial processes. This is particularly true {{in the case of}} biological process due to the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>media,</b> the requirements of operating conditions and the wide variety of possible disturbances that necessitate careful and constant monitoring of the processes. Moreover, because only partial information is available in an on-line context and because of the technical and biological complexities of the involved processes, specific characteristics are required for diagnosis purposes. Several approaches like quantitative model based, qualitative model based and process history based methods were applied over the years. This chapter presents a methodological framework based on Evidence theory to manage the fault signals generated by conventional approaches (i. e., residuals from hardware and software redundancies, fuzzy logic based modules for process state assessment) and to account for uncertainty. The advantages of using evidence theory like modularity, detection of conflict and doubt in the information sources are illustrated with experimental results from a 1 m 3 fixed bed anaerobic digestion process used for the treatment of industrial distillery wastewater. ...|$|E

The research consisted of three experiments. The first experiment consisted of 3 kinds of media such as media A, B and C(A- sawdust and 100 % standard nutrition; B = sawdust and 50 % standard nutrition; and C = sawdust without nutrition) and three kinds of temperatures were 20 °C (room temperature), 4 °C (refrigerator temperature) and - 10 °C(freezer temperature). The second experiment used 4 kinds of media. They were media D, E, F and G which were stimulated by SnCh, CoCh, salicilic acid and the extract of bark of "Seno" (Castanopsis acuminatissima). The third experiment used medium B, weight 500 g and 1000 g (medium H and I). The result showed that medium H& I produced the highest fruiting body. However medium I produced the higher fruiting body compare to medium H). The added of the extract of the bark of C. acuminatissima. SnCh, CoCh and salicilic acid stimulated the fruiting body formation...|$|E
40|$|Is it {{important}} that end-users know the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> human embryo culture media? We {{argue that there}} is as strong case for full transparency concerning the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> embryo culture <b>media</b> intended for human use. Published data suggest that the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> embryo culture <b>media</b> may influence the phenotype of the offspring. A review of the literature was carried out. Data concerning the potential effects on embryo development <b>of</b> culture <b>media</b> were assessed and recommendations for users made. The safety of ART procedures, especially with respect {{to the health of the}} offspring, is of major importance. There are reports from the literature indicating a possible effect of culture conditions, including culture media, on embryo and fetal development. Since the introduction of commercially available culture media, there has been a rapid development of different formulations, often not fully documented, disclosed or justified. There is now evidence that the environment the early embryo is exposed to can cause reprogramming of embryonic growth leading to alterations in fetal growth trajectory, birthweight, childhood growth and long-term disease including Type II diabetes and cardiovascular problems. The mechanism for this is likely to be epigenetic changes during the preimplantation period of development. In the present paper the ESHRE working group on culture media summarizes the present knowledge of potential effects on embryo development related to culture media, and makes recommendations. There is still a need for large prospective randomized trials to further elucidate the link between the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> embryo culture <b>media</b> used and the phenotype of the offspring. We do not presently know if the phenotypic changes induced by in vitro embryo culture represent a problem for long-term health of the offspring. Published data indicate that there is a strong case for demanding full transparency concerning the <b>compositions</b> <b>of</b> and the scientific rationale behind the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> embryo culture <b>media.</b> This work was funded by The European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology.

Utilization of the maleate {{as the sole}} organic carbon source proceeded by stepwise conversion to fumarate and then to malate. Respiration rates of P. fluorescens on maleate, mixtures of maleate and fumarate salts, and mixtures of maleate and malate salts were measured.

International audienceAims: In this study, {{the influence of the}} incubation temperature on the D-values was described according to a simple Bigelow-like model. Methods: Model parameters were estimated from different sets of data from the literature and from our own data. For different Bacillus species and heattreatment conditions, the influence of the recovery temperature was quantified and the optimal recovery temperature was determined. Results: The impacts of species, bacterial strains belonging to the same species, heat-treatment temperature and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> recovery <b>media</b> on the model parameters were analysed. The optimum recovery temperatures differ greatly from one species to another; however, no difference appears clearly between strains belonging to the same species. D values were significantly affected by recovery temperature. This influence of recovery temperature was dependent on the species, and affected by the <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> recovery <b>media</b> but not by the heating temperature. Significance and Impact of the Study: The developed model could be useful for determining the optimal incubation temperature and quantifying the weight of the recovery temperature influence for safe security control in the canning industry...|$|R
