5|$|Samarium-doped calcium {{fluoride}} crystals {{were used as}} an active medium {{in one of the}} first solid-state lasers designed and constructed by Peter Sorokin (<b>co-inventor</b> of the dye laser) and Mirek Stevenson at IBM research labs in early 1961. This samarium laser emitted pulses of red light at 708.5nm. It had to be cooled by liquid helium and thus did not find practical applications.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Indiana, Sadler moved to Michigan as a {{teenager}} {{to work at the}} Battle Creek Sanitarium. There he met the physician and health-food promoter John Harvey Kellogg, <b>co-inventor</b> of corn flakes breakfast cereal, who became his mentor. Sadler married Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, in 1897. He worked for several Christian organizations and attended medical school, graduating in 1906. Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago with his wife, who was also a physician. He joined several medical associations and taught at the McCormick Theological Seminary. Although he was a committed member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for almost twenty years, he left the denomination after it disfellowshipped his wife's uncle in 1907. Sadler and his wife became speakers on the Chautauqua adult education circuit in 1907, and he became a highly paid, popular orator. He eventually wrote over 40 books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion but was skeptical of mediums, assisting debunker Howard Thurston, and embraced the scientific consensus on evolution.|$|E

40|$|Academic inventors are {{university}} {{scientists who}} appear as designated inventors of patents owned either by business companies, academic institutions or individuals. We analyse {{their relationships with}} <b>co-inventors,</b> who may be either academic colleagues, students, or, very often, industrial researchers. Gould and Fernandez's (1989) taxonomy of 'brokerage' roles is adjusted to patent data, and complemented with information drawn from both academic inventors' publications and replies to a short questionnaire. Only very few academic inventors are found to hold brokerage positions. Such inventors have {{a large number of}} patents, a strong publication record and a higher-than-average share of patents held by companies, rather than universities. Relationships of academic inventors with <b>co-inventors</b> from industry are weaker and less likely to be maintained than those with <b>co-inventors</b> from academia. Academic inventors in gatekeeping positions (between university and industry) maintain the strongest ties with all types of <b>co-inventors.</b> Academic inventors Technology transfer Brokerage Social network analysis...|$|R

30|$|Figure  24 {{shows the}} {{association}} between the percentage of patents invented with <b>co-inventors</b> and the four kinds of R&D expenditure. The association is significant (p[*]<[*] 0.0001) and negative {{for all types of}} R&D expenditure (GERD, BERD, GOVERD, HERD). With an increase in the percentage of R&D expenditure from any sector, the percentage of patents invented with <b>co-inventors</b> decreases, implying more local innovation. This holds promise for countries trying to enhance innovation in terms of their contribution to GDP.|$|R
