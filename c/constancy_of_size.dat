40|$|Comparisons of {{relative}} size in pictorial spaces {{under the influence}} of depth cues were investigated. Using the staircase method, 40 participants adjusted the sizes of blank cards presented in the upper visual field to the size of playing cards presented in the lower visual field. During the presentation of the stimuli, pictorial depth cues were displayed in the computer screen and participants were asked to typify the strategy used to judge the perceived sizes. The horizon and the perspective line gradient contributed to the overestimation of the perceived size of blank cards in about 8 and 12 %, respectively, and size comparisons were coherent with the <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> <b>size...</b>|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that changes to the configuration of an object 2 ̆ 7 s parts are better detected than changes to the shape/arrangement of those parts. This finding suggests that configural, rather than shape, information plays a critical role in object change detection. The current study investigated configural and shape changes in greater detail to determine what aspects of these two types of object properties, if any, were more or less important for change detection. Specifically we investigated configural changes in terms of the orientation of the part change and shape changes in terms of the non-accidental properties of the part change. Using a one-shot change detection task with a single object display, we manipulated: (i) the orientation of a configuration change (0 °, 90 ° or 180 °) and (ii) both the number and the type of non-accidental object properties (NAPs) involved in each shape change (3 NAPs were manipulated in total: curvature of axis, curvature of edges, and <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> <b>size).</b> We found that changes to the curvature of the axis were better detected than changes to either the curvature of edges or to the <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> <b>size.</b> Detection accuracy was better when there were more NAPs involved in a change. Configural changes involving 180 ° were more accurately detected than changes involving either 0 ° or 90 °. These results suggest that the axes and basic layout of parts is critical information in change detection. Implications for theories of object recognition are discussed...|$|E

Confirmation was obtained by electronic particle counts paired with scattering measurements that light scattering provides a measure of concentration of particle cross-section in the sea. The use of light scattering as a measure of particle bulk concentration is shown to require <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> the distribution <b>of</b> particle <b>size,</b> which is met under prescribed circumstances in {{the upper part of the}} sea.

40|$|Given any income distribution, to each income we {{associate}} a subgroup containing all persons whose incomes are not higher than this income and a person?s target shortfall in a subgroup is {{the gap between}} the subgroup highest income and his own income. We then develop an absolute target shortfall ordering, which, under <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> population <b>size</b> and total income, implies the Lorenz and Cowell-Ebert complaint orderings. Under the same restrictions, one distribution dominates the other by this ordering if and only if the dominated distribution can be obtained from the dominant one by a sequence of rank preserving progressive transfers, where each transfer is shared equally by all persons poorer than the donor of the transfer. The relationship of the ordering with the absolute deprivation and differential orderings, and its consistency with ranking of distributions by absolute target shortfall indices are explored. Well-known inequality indices like the absolute Gini index and the standard deviation are interpreted as absolute target shortfall indices. Finally, the possibility of a relative target shorfall ordering is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The mass of an electroweakly charged lepton {{consists}} of the two components of electric and weak nature, and regardless {{of the difference in}} masses, all leptons have an equal charge, the same charge radius as well as an identical magnetic moment. Between these currents there appear the most diverse connections, for example, in their interactions with an electroweak field of spinless nuclei. We derive the united equations which relate the structural parts of mass to charge, charge radius and magnetic moment of each lepton {{as a consequence of the}} ideas of flavor symmetry laws. Therefore, these ideas require the verification of the lepton universality from the point of view <b>of</b> a <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>size</b> implied from the multiplication of a weak mass of lepton by its electric mass. Such a principle gives the possibility to define the lepton weak masses. If this picture does not change, leptons universally interact not only with the photon or the weak boson but also with any of the corresponding types of gauge fields.

40|$|The diameters of the {{ascending}} and {{descending aorta}} {{at the level}} of the carina were measured from computerised tomograms in 200 adults without cardiac or aortic disease. At all ages the ascending aorta had a greater cross sectional area than the descending aorta, and both areas increased significantly with age. The increase was proportionately greater in the descending than in the ascending aorta and the percentage changes were similar in males and females, the latter having a smaller mean descending aortic diameter. The extent of the increase in cross sectional area of the aorta is sufficient to explain the observed fall of stroke distance that occurs with age. The effect of changing blood pressure on aortic cross sectional area, and hence the relation between stroke distance and stroke volume, was calculated from published data on aortic compliance at different ages. Assuming constant peripheral resistance, stroke distance would change by 34, 82, and 94 % for a 100 % change of stroke volume at age 20, 50, and 80 respectively. At age 80 the aorta behaves like a rigid pipe but at age 20 its elasticity is such that <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> aortic <b>size</b> cannot be assumed...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} is hypothesized to favour small body size,in males of scrambling species, that is, {{those in which}} males obtain matings by actively searching for females. I tested this hypothesis in a natural population of the scrambling emerald damselfly, Lestes sponsa. Mating efficiency (matings/visit to the pond) {{was the most important}} factor explaining variation in male lifetime mating success (LMS; 71 %). This suggests a large potential for sexual selection. Path analysis of male LMS suggested a quality factor that positively affected both mating efficiency and life span. In contrast with the small-male mating advantage hypothesis, part of this potential for sexual selection was realized as stabilizing selection on male body size, indicating that there may also be a lower limit to body size for mating efficiency. This also illustrates that the <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> body <b>size</b> may be explained by sexual selection alone. Survival explained about 20 % of the variation in LMS and random processes were potentially important for determining LMS. My results show the problems of using mating efficiency as a measure for the intensity of sexual selection and the need to distinguish between. potential and realized selection pressures, especially when comparing the importance of natural and sexual selection. I discuss mechanisms that may have caused the intermediate-male mating advantage in this scrambling species. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The mean <b>size</b> <b>of</b> {{exponentially}} dividing E. coli cells cultured {{in different}} nutrient conditions {{is known to}} depend on the mean growth rate only. However, the joint fluctuations relating cell size, doubling time and individual growth rate are only starting to be characterized. Recent studies in bacteria (i) revealed the near <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> the <b>size</b> extension in a single cell cycle (adder mechanism), and (ii) reported a universal trend where the spread in both size and doubling times is a linear function of the population means of these variables. Here, we combine experiments and theory and use scaling concepts to elucidate the constraints posed by the second observation on the division control mechanism and on the joint fluctuations <b>of</b> <b>sizes</b> and doubling times. We found that scaling relations based on the means both collapse size and doubling-time distributions across different conditions, and explain how the shape of their joint fluctuations deviates from the means. Our data on these joint fluctuations highlight the importance of cell individuality: single cells do not follow the dependence observed for the means between size and either growth rate or inverse doubling time. Our calculations show that these results emerge from a broad class of division control mechanisms (including the adder mechanism as a particular case) requiring a certain scaling form of the so-called "division hazard rate function", which defines the probability rate of dividing as a function of measurable parameters. This gives a rationale for the universal body-size distributions observed in microbial ecosystems across many microbial species, presumably dividing with multiple mechanisms. Additionally, our experiments show a crossover between fast and slow growth in the relation between individual-cell growth rate and division time, which can be understood in terms of different regimes of genome replication control.

40|$|Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme is {{preferentially}} synthesized in proliferative cells. A mouse {{muscle cell}} line resistant to 300 microM methotrexate {{was developed to}} investigate the molecular levels at which DHFR is down-regulated during myogenic withdrawal from the cell cycle. H- alpha R 300 T cells contained 540 copies of the endogenous DHFR gene and overexpressed DHFR mRNA and DHFR protein. Despite DHFR gene amplification, the cells remained diploid. As H- alpha R 300 T myoblasts withdrew from the cell cycle and committed to terminal differentiation, DHFR mRNA levels and DHFR synthesis rates decreased with closely matched kinetics. After 15 to 24 h, committed cells contained 5 % the proliferative level of DHFR mRNA (80 molecules per committed cell) and synthesized DHFR protein at 6 % the proliferative rate. At no point during the commitment process did the decrease in DHFR synthesis rate exceed the decrease in DHFR message. The decrease in DHFR mRNA levels during commitment was sufficient to account fully for the decrease in rates of DHFR synthesis. Furthermore, DHFR mRNA remained polysomal, and {{the average number of}} ribosomes per message remained constant (five to six ribosomes per DHFR mRNA). The <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> polysome <b>size,</b> along with the uniform rate of DHFR synthesis per message, indicated that DHFR mRNA was efficiently translated in postreplicative cells.

40|$|Aims Floral {{traits are}} {{frequency}} used in traditional plant systematics because <b>Of</b> their assumed <b>constancy.</b> One potential {{reason for the}} apparent <b>constancy</b> <b>of</b> flower <b>size</b> is that effective pollen transfer between flowers depends oil {{the accuracy of the}} physical fit between the flower and pollinator. Therefore, dowels are likely to he under stronger stabilizing selection for uniform size than vegetative plant parts. Moreover, as predicted by the pollinator-mediated stabilizing selection (PMSS) hypothesis, all accurate fit between flowers and their pollinators is likely to he more important for specialized pollination systems as found in many species with bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic) flowers than for species, with radially symmetric (actinomorphic) flowers. Methods In a comparative study of 15 zygomorphic and 13 actinomorphic species ill Switzerland, we tested whether variation in flower size, among and within individuals, is smaller than variation ill leaf size and whether variation in flower size is smaller ill zygomorphic compared to actinomorphic species. Important findings Indeed, variation ill leaf length was significantly larger than variation in flower length and width. Within-individual variation ill flower and leaf sizes did not differ significantly between zygomorphic and actinomorphic species. In line with the predictions of the PMSS, among-individual variation ill flower length and flower width was significantly smaller for zygomorphic species than for actinomorphic species, while the two groups did not differ in leaf length variation. This suggests that plants with zygomorphic flowers have undergone stronger selection for uniform flowers than plants with actinomorphic flowers. This supports that the uniformity of flowers compared to vegetative structures within species, as already observed in traditional plant systematics, is, at least in part, a consequence of the requirement for effective pollination...|$|R
