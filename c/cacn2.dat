50|$|Calcium cyanide {{also known}} as black cyanide, is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula <b>Ca(CN)2.</b> It is a white solid, although it is rarely observed in pure form. Commercial samples can be black-gray. It is the calcium salt of cyanide. It hydrolyses readily (even on moist air) to release hydrogen cyanide. Like other similar cyanides it is very toxic.|$|E
50|$|Cyanamide is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula CN2H2. This white solid {{is widely used}} in agriculture {{and the production of}} pharmaceuticals and other organic compounds. It is also used as an alcohol deterrent drug in Canada, Europe and Japan. The molecule features a nitrile group attached to an amino group. Derivatives of this compound are also referred to as cyanamides, the most common being calcium cyanamide (<b>CaCN2).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Frank-Caro process, {{also called}} {{cyanamide}} process, is the nitrogen fixation reaction of calcium carbide with nitrogen gas in a reactor vessel at about 1,000°C. The reaction is exothermic and self-sustaining once the reaction temperature is reached. Originally the reaction {{took place in}} large steel cylinders with an electrical resistance element providing initial heat to start the reaction. Modern production uses rotating ovens. The synthesis produces a solid mixture of calcium cyanamide (<b>CaCN2)</b> and carbon.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetisation}} M(H,T) of thin dc-sputtered Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 and Bi(2) Sr(2) <b>CaCn(2)</b> O(8) films {{has been}} measured in pulsed fields up to 50 T. A high critical current density (J(c) {{greater than or}} equal to 10 (6) A/cm(2) at T= 5 K and mu(0) H= 50 T) has been derived from the width of the M(H) loops. For Bi 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 in particular, above mu(0) H= 20 T, this critical current becomes weakly field dependent. Therefore, these materials are of considerable interest for high field applications at low temperatures. The nature of pinning centres responsible for this J(c) (H) behaviour is discussed. status: publishe...|$|E

The {{effect of}} organic and {{inorganic}} fertiliser amendments is often studied shortly after {{addition of a}} single dose to the soil but less {{is known about the}} long-term effects of amendments. We conducted a study {{to determine the effects of}} long-term addition of organic and inorganic fertiliser amendments at low rates on soil chemical and biological properties. Surface soil samples were taken from an experimental field site near Cologne, Germany in summer 2000. At this site, five different treatments were established in 1969 : mineral fertiliser (NPK), crop residues removed (mineral only); mineral fertiliser with crop residues; manure 5. 2 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹; sewage sludge 7. 6 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ or straw 4. 0 t ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ with 10 kg N as <b>CaCN₂</b> t straw⁻¹. The organic amendments increased the Corg content of the soil but had no significant effect on the dissolved organic C (DOC) content. The C/N ratio was highest in the straw treatment and lowest in the mineral only treatment. Of the enzymes studied, only protease activity was affected by the different amendments. It was highest after sewage amendment and lowest in the mineral only treatment. The ratios of Gram⁺ to Gram⁻ bacteria and of bacteria to fungi, as determined by signature phospholipid fatty acids, were higher in the organic treatments than in the inorganic treatments. The community structure of bacteria and eukaryotic microorganisms was assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and redundancy discriminate analyses of the DGGE banding patterns. While the bacterial community structure was affected by the treatments this was not the case for the eukaryotes. Bacterial and eukaryotic community structures were significantly affected by Corg content and C/N ratio. Petra Marschner, Ellen Kandeler and Bernd Marschner[URL]...|$|E
