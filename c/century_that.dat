5|$|It {{was first}} {{suggested}} in the 18th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> intracranial pressure rather than skull damage {{was the cause of}} pathology after TBI. This hypothesis was confirmed around the end of the 19thcentury, and opening the skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the late 18th and the early 19th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> the first European Americans {{explored}} the remote and hard-to-reach area. Mormon scouts visited the area in the 1850s to gauge its potential for agricultural development, use for grazing, and settlement.|$|E

5|$|The only {{region of}} the United States {{threatened}} by hurricanes was New England, although no stations recorded hurricane-force winds in the country.

5|$|Though {{it might}} seem as if the Bible {{translation}} set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was not until the 17th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|A {{sample of}} CSF {{can be taken}} via lumbar puncture. This can reveal the {{intracranial}} pressure, as well as indicate diseases including infections of the brain or its surrounding meninges. Although noted by Hippocrates, {{it was only in}} the eighteenth <b>century</b> <b>that</b> Emanuel Swedenborg is credited with its rediscovery, and as late as 1914 that Harvey W. Cushing demonstrated CSF was secreted by the choroid plexus.|$|E

Nunn in the general election. It was the only time in the 20th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games upward of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth <b>century,</b> <b>that</b> 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E
5|$|Both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder {{mentioned}} that damp wood sometimes gives off a glow and many centuries later Robert Boyle showed that oxygen {{was involved in}} the process, both in wood and in glow-worms. It was not until the late nineteenth <b>century</b> <b>that</b> bioluminescence was properly investigated. The phenomenon is widely distributed among animal groups, especially in marine environments where dinoflagellates cause phosphorescence in the surface layers of water. On land it occurs in fungi, bacteria and some groups of invertebrates, including insects.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca has {{a number}} of {{landmark}} buildings and monuments.

5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st <b>century</b> <b>that</b> national policies emerged.|$|E

5|$|In Tibnin, in modern-day Lebanon, and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader-era fortresses rebuilt. Zahir {{fortified}} {{the village}} of Harbaj, although the village and its fort were in ruins by the late 19th century. At Tabgha on the Sea of Galilee, Zahir built five fountains, one of which remained standing by the 19th <b>century.</b> <b>That</b> remaining fountain was the largest {{of its kind in}} Galilee. In {{the village of}} I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th century semi-autonomous Arab sheikh of Galilee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 8th century, the {{dominant}} Anglo-Saxon ruler was King Æthelbald of Mercia, who by 731 had become the overlord of all the provinces south of the River Humber. Æthelbald was one of a number of strong Mercian kings who ruled from the mid-7th century to the early 9th, and it was not until the reign of Egbert of Wessex in the 9th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> Mercian power began to wane.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} the 20th <b>century</b> <b>that</b> a common, {{standardized}} national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography was finally stabilized, and was almost completely uniform, {{with the exception of}} some minor deviations, {{by the time of the}} spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.|$|E
