50|$|The {{gearboxes}} {{were based}} on previous SR1900 series and shared {{the same number of}} gears and gear change pattern. The SR2400 series gearbox was discontinued and replaced with the now same model shared across entire FH and FM range. Torque increases from 1900 Nm to 2500 Nm were due to changes to machining of the gears as well as use of the new type of narrower synchromesh mechanism allowing increased gear width. The single <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> and the synchro mechanism reduced gearchange effort by about 50%. The <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> was also identical for left and right hand drive versions reducing overall production cost and assembly.|$|E

50|$|Handle {{switches}} {{are still}} used on modern trams and trains. Pneumatically or electrically linked dead-man's controls involve relatively simple modifications of the controller handle, the device that regulates traction power. If pressure is not maintained on the controller, the train's emergency brakes are applied. Typically, the controller handle is a horizontal bar, rotated {{to apply the}} required power for the train. Attached {{to the bottom of}} the handle is a rod that when pushed down contacts a solenoid or switch inside the <b>control</b> <b>housing.</b> The handle springs up if pressure is removed, releasing the rod's contact with the internal switch, instantly cutting power and applying the brakes.|$|E

50|$|The Ruger LCR is {{a compact}} {{revolver}} built by Ruger and announced in January 2009. The LCR acronym stands for 'Lightweight Compact Revolver'. It incorporates several novel {{features such as}} a polymer grip and trigger housing, monolithic receiver, and constant force trigger. At 13.5 oz, the LCR is nearly 50% lighter than the stainless steel SP101 and with only the barrel and fluted cylinder made of stainless steel. The frame is aluminum alloy and synthetic glass-filled polymer finished in matte black with Synergistic Hard Coat. The LCR operates in double-action only (DAO) as the hammer is concealed within the frame handle's fire <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> of the gun and cannot be cocked prior to firing. In {{order to create a}} crisp and light trigger pull that is non-stacking, it features a friction reducing cam, a feature seldom found on double-action revolvers (which by nature of their mechanism normally have a very heavy trigger pull).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that the 'crime <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> crisis' which has engulfed social housing is qualitatively {{different}} from most previous and current understandings of housing crisis (which have been of a quantitative nature, or been resolved to that). By contrast, the crime <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> crisis is a crisis precisely because it appears insoluble. All housing problems and policies now have to be legitimated by reference to this crime <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> crisis. The gaze of this crisis has been upon the 'social' sector, but that has also caused reflection on how to placate the crime <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> crisis in the private sector. It is this latter area that {{is the focus of}} the case study {{in the second part of}} this paper and starkly raises the central, deceptively simple, problematization for government: how to govern the ungovernable without being seen to govern. The case study concerns regulations promulgated by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive regarding the licensing of houses in multiple occupation. We argue that this regulation is symptomatic of a mutated 'housing crisis' in which the old questions of the adequacy of provision have been supplanted by new questions of responsibility for deviant behaviour...|$|E

These staircases go up to a crossover. On the north side, an unstaffed turnstile bank leads to 72nd Street; on the south side, three High Entry/Exit Turnstiles lead to 71st Street.

40|$|The SWAS {{instrument}} {{consists of}} the moving telescope assembly, the interface baseplate assembly, and the thermal <b>control</b> <b>housing.</b> The movin g telescope structure holds the primary mirror, secondary mirror, and receiver front end in precise alignment. This structure also carries the receiver cold plate radiators, which view cold space both directl y and through reflection off the primary mirror. The moving telescope assembly attaches to the interface baseplate with an open pivot frame through which flex leads from the receiver front end also pass. Two flexure-mounted linear actuators tilt the moving telescope assembly u p to +/- 3 deg in two axes. The interface plate serves as a mounting for these actuators {{as well as the}} acousto-optic spectrometer, the inst rument control electronics, the star tracker, and the balance of the receiver components. The thermal <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> attaches to the inte rface baseplate around its edge. The top cylindrical part of this hou sing serves to shade the receiver cold plate radiators from Sun and Earth influence. The bottom "D" shaped portion of the housing is therma lly isolated from the top and forms the electronlcs radiator. Heat is conducted from the Interface baseplate into this lower portion of the shell. The radiator geometry and conduction paths create a very stab le thermal environment {{in the center of the}} interface baseplate where the AOS and receiver IF amplifiers are heat sinked. The outer surface of the thermal <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> is covered with fused silica second s urface mirrors that reflect visible light and radiate infrared energy.

Although most of the original subway's entry points had steel and glass kiosks (for example, Astor Place), important stations like this one were marked with a brick and stone <b>control</b> <b>house,</b> which were referred to as such because they helped control the passenger flow.

40|$|AbstractThe {{real estate}} {{industry}} is a complex system. House price {{is the most important}} elements. House prices and the living standard of the residents are closely related. The state has adopted many policies to control high house prices. However, the effect of regulation is little, and the house prices rise even faster. This paper uses the theory and method of system engineering to study the Relationship between house price volatility risk and price tolerance of the residents in China. Based on the performance of the price fluctuations and trend analysis in our country by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, the paper mainly explores the reasons of housing price fluctuations, hazard of price fluctuations and controlling challenges. Finally, this paper gives us some policy proposals to <b>control</b> <b>housing</b> prices in the future...|$|E
40|$|Rent {{regulations}} {{can take}} many forms and have different purposes. It is argued that the often-used distinction between first- and second-generation rent control is too crude to be useful. Five main types of rent control are identified instead. The first dimension concerns whether the control covers rent changes for sitting tenants or rents generally. The second dimension is whether {{the aim is to}} protect the tenants against rents over the market level, against sudden big increases in rents or if the aim is to keep rents permanently below market levels in attractive areas. The typology is used to classify and compare the rent control systems in a number of European countries and North American cities. It is also used to describe typical patterns of change from 'harder' to 'softer' rent controls. Rent <b>Control</b> <b>Housing</b> Market Market Rents Comparative Analysis,...|$|E
