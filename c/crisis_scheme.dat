500|$|An {{alternative}} proposal was {{drawn up by}} Sir Richard Broun and Richard Sprye, who planned to use the emerging technology of mechanised transport to resolve the <b>crisis.</b> The <b>scheme</b> entailed buying a single very large tract of land around [...] from London in Brookwood near Woking, Surrey, to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis. At this distance, the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city's growth. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)—which had connected London to Woking in 1838—would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains, each carrying 50–60 bodies, travelling from London to the new Necropolis {{in the early morning}} or late at night, and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral. Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day.|$|R

As the town began to lose custom to places with railway facilities, the East Grinstead traders began to clamour for a connection; some landowners and gentry pushed for an extension from Godstone, whilst others were in favour of a branch line from Three Bridges. In 1845 the SER and LBR promoted rival bills for lines through the town, but these both came to nothing: the local townspeople withdrew their support for the SER proposal once it moved the terminus of its line from London Road to a point outside East Grinstead where St Margaret's Junction is now situated.

40|$|Many {{empirical}} studies of bank fragility employ “banking crisis ” (BC) indicators based on <b>crisis</b> dating <b>schemes</b> constructed using primarily information on government actions undertaken {{in response to}} bank distress We formulate a simple model of a banking industry in which {{the event of a}} systemic bank shock, its turning into a crisis and a government response to a crisis are explicitly defined, and use its implications to construct indicators of systemic bank shocks. Then we show that our indicators of systemic bank shocks consistently predict BC indicators based on four major banking crisis classifications. Therefore, BC indicators actually measure lagged government responses to crises, rather than the occurrence of crises per se. We then re-examine the impact of some key factors affecting the probability of a systemic bank shock and that of government responses to these shocks, including the role of bank market structure, deposit insurance, external shocks and currency crises. Disentangling systemic bank shocks and government responses to banking distress turns out to be crucial in understanding the roots of bank fragility, since key macroeconomic, structural, and institutional features of economies {{have an impact on the}} likelihood of a government response to a crisis totally different from that on the likelihood of a banking crisis.

The proposed reforms had two wideranging objectives : (i) to prevent currency and banking crises and better manage them when they occur; and (ii) to support adequate provision of net private and public flows to developing countries, particularly low-income ones. Unfortunately the progress has been uneven, asymmetric, and patchy. This is largely because the structural problems related to the supply side of capital flows have not been addressed, particularly the unipolar character of the global financial system. As a result, many East Asian economies face {{many of the same}} conditions that prevailed immediately prior to the crisis : huge capital inflows heavily tilted towards hot money, rapid appreciation of currencies in real terms, surging stock prices, and little policy space to implement countercyclical measures {{in the event of a}} crisis. The difference is that many countries have accumulated a large amount of foreign exchange reserves but at the expense of domestic investment and economic growth. In order to resolve the problems that are posed by volatile capital flows it is important to accelerate East Asian cooperation and integration, particularly with regard to the objective of using regional savings for regional infrastructure projects.

In this study, we focus on forest loss in and around one of Indonesia's largest protected areas, Kerinci Seblat National Park (KSNP), and evaluate the effectiveness of several forest protection scenarios. First, forest loss patterns from 1985 to 2002 were mapped for the southern end of the KS region and the correlates of deforestation were determined using a logistic regression analysis. This highlighted the critical threat posed to the forest by its proximity to the forest edge and to settlements, as well as its elevation and slope. This regression model was then used to map the predicted risk of remaining forest being cleared and was combined with field data to model the results of three law enforcement scenarios up to the year 2020. This found that a strategy that concentrated patrol effort at the four main access points was found to avoid the most deforestation. These results show that modelling the impact of different protection strategies can provide important insights and could be used more widely in deforestation mitigation and designing conservation landscapes...|$|R

When the Assembly met, it appeared that the Church had been fully awakened to the importance and danger of the <b>crisis.</b> A magnificent <b>scheme</b> was formed. If it had been carried into effective operation, it would have relieved the College from debt, and rendered it permanent, if not prosperous.

Several of the most popular young men in the Church were engaged as agents; the people were not illiberal in their subscriptions, and every thing seemed to promise well. Dr. Cossitt confidently believed that the College would be endowed, and that the most liberal provision would be made for the education of candidates for the ministry.

This thought originated the impulse which led to the establishment of Cumberland College at first, and afterward to the establishment of Cumberland University.|$|R
40|$|Following the {{economic}} crisis which resulted in uncertainty of trustees to meet pension obligations, institutional investors are becoming more conscious of investment risks. They risk getting less return than previously forecasted {{as a result of}} falling prices in the equity market. In turn to mitigate the risk, the investment strategy of the schemes has been greatly influenced. Pension schemes currently have a tendency to shift their investment strategy from return-seeking to a liability driven strategy. Moreover, researchers have reported that the UK ageing population will grow significantly within the next few years, thus there is an important recognition that pension schemes assets should also be increased considerably to provide sufficient income to meet pension obligations. The main issue for pension schemes investment managers is how to invest their assets to ensure that the funds will be available to pay pension obligations when due. This paper empirically studies the strategic asset allocation of UK defined benefit occupational pension schemes. It also looks at the factors influencing UK private pension schemes investment decision. The results indicate that funding level, change in market value of equity, liability profile and trustees’ attitude of risks influence asset allocation. Other rationale for schemes asset allocation is explained by factors that are not tested in this research while other causes remain unexplained. Other factors which may influence asset allocation but have not been tested in this research are actuary’s expectations, investment regulations; scheme maturity. Testing whether these factors do have an influence on asset allocation could be an interesting topic for further research. The results also indicate that wide dispersion exists in the asset allocation. Investment in equity ranges from 15. 7 % to 87. 6 % while that of bond varies from 0 % to 68 %. We found that shifts in asset allocation depend on the market conditions. Prior to the recent financial <b>crisis,</b> pension <b>schemes</b> had more equity exposure than to bond. However, following {{the economic}} crisis and the collapse of the stock market most pension schemes investment have underperformed and reported significant deficits. As a consequence pension schemes are shifting their investment into bonds.

40|$|A common {{legacy of}} banking crises {{is a large}} {{increase}} in government debt, as fiscal resources are used {{to shore up the}} banking system. Do crisis response strategies that commit more fiscal resources lower the economic costs of crises? Based on evidence from a sample of 40 banking crises we find that the answer is negative. In fact, policies that are riskier for the government budget are associated with worse, not better, post-crisis performance. We also show that parliamentary political systems are more prone to adopt bank rescue measures that are costly for the government budget. We take advantage of this relationship to instrument the policy response, thereby addressing concerns of joint endogeneity. We find no evidence that endogeneity is a source of bias.

30|$|While low {{individual}} earnings {{are an important}} part of the story, most low-paid individuals are not poor, essentially because poverty is (conventionally) assessed at the level of the household (Marx and Nolan 2014). The majority of the working poor are single earner households, whereas many part-time workers are in dual earner households. The poverty risk of part-time workers thus depends on the household context and varies widely across individuals for that reason but also across countries reflecting the differing roles that part-time work plays in the household income ‘package’ (Rodgers 2003; Debels 2008); (Horemans and Marx 2013). The fact that part-time jobs are often concentrated among women with caring responsibilities (Fouarge and Muffels 2008) also means that the households affected are more likely to include child and elderly dependants, which also affects their poverty risk since household income will be adjusted to take the number of persons relying on it into account in assessing poverty status. The final element in understanding the poverty risk for part-timers is social protection, and here, limited entitlements for part-timers to benefits may play an important role. Hours and/or earnings thresholds restrict access to unemployment benefits for part-time workers, especially for those in marginal or few-hours part-time jobs (Leschke 2007; OECD 2010). For other type of benefits like pensions and sickness, there may be restrictions as well (Buschoff and Protsch 2008). On the other hand, especially in countries where ‘making work pay’ has been prominent (Immervoll and Pearson 2009; Marx and Verbist 2008; Marchal and Marx 2015), there may be supports directed at part-time and other low-paid workers to maintain their link with the labour market (European Commission 2011). In the economic <b>crisis,</b> short-time work <b>schemes</b> to keep unemployment down have involved benefits (Hijzen and Venn 2011).|$|R
40|$|The talk {{presented}} {{an approach to}} define crisis response research in terms of relevant categories (aspects, dimensions, properties) for such research, including e. g. types of threats (hazard sources, crisis triggering events), crisis management steps which are supported, hardware technologies employed, disciplines involved or software technologies used. If existing crisis research is sorted into such a categorization scheme, foci of on-going research efforts can be identified as well as missing combinations. Such definition by examples and attribute ranges also avoids exclusions and is open for a truly interdisciplinary (trans-disciplinary) approach. Besides this top level approach, examples of emerging application tools were given that implement risk management or analysis steps. All tools are currently developed within EU FP 7 research projects and at least parts of their functionalities are relevant for crisis management. In BESECURE we apply risk management to structure an urban security enhancement process. It gives access to best practice methods for enhancing security, urban attractiveness and performance. In a similar way in cases of crisis methods can be selected in a systematic way and employed for achieving user-defined objectives. In VITRUV we show how urban planning for countering terrorism can be supported by empirical (data-base driven) and quantitative analysis. Taking measures for susceptibility, vulnerability and risk into account the software supports urban planning at plan and detail level. This allows countering crisis by preventive urban design with focus on non-physical measures, in particular rearrangement of geometries and urban space design. In ENCOUNTER risk analysis of explosive improvised (home-made) devices in urban environments is conducted taking into account organizational and physical counter measures including neutralization and removal options. This provides scenario assessment input for crisis management. In D-BOX we contribute to a toolbox for improving humanitarian demining worldwide. In particular quantitative hazard and damage analysis is applied to this domain. Also interactive databases are provided on hazards sources, neutralization, removal and personal protective equipment. Mine fields are {{at the core of}} many (long- term) crisis-like developments in developing countries. For defining a roadmap for crisis research a step-wise approach is proposed. The steps are conducted in a very exemplary and incomplete way. First, we give three examples for step-wise informed schemes for risk analysis schemes, risk management and <b>crisis</b> management <b>schemes</b> are given, respectively. Second a list of technological and societal enablers is given. Third it is shown how this enablers are expected to influence the respective risk analysis steps, with respect to short-term, medium term and long term effects, respectively. It is indicated how in a similar way the effects of the enablers on risk management and crisis management, e. g. using the residence circle, can be conducted. Finally we provide a summarizing schematic...|$|R
