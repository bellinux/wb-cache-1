30|$|Due to complexity, {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} computation {{was carried out}} only up to two electrons. I {{have been trying to}} find a student with strong computational skill to expand the QM computation to at least 12. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about. Capacitance is monophasic, i.e., each additional electron defines a single phase. And since the dielectric constant is much reduced in quantum mechanically confined systems, primarily because dielectric screening requires electrons or dipoles to move to cancel the applied electric field. Highly confined system reduces the movement, thereby reducing the screening. Now doping is basically possible because high dielectrically screened systems have very low binding energy, allowing carriers to be thermally excited at room temperatures. With drastic reduction of screening, the binding energy is too high, leading to carrier freeze-out at room temperatures. This is apart from the problem involving statistical factor due to the drastic reduction in size of the QDs. Doping is impossible.|$|R
5000|$|A {{directed}} dialogue prompt communicates {{a set of}} valid {{responses to}} the user (e.g. [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> help you? ... <b>Say</b> <b>something</b> like, account balance, order status, or more options"). An open-ended prompt does not communicate a set of valid responses (e.g. [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>I</b> help you?"). In both cases, {{the goal is to}} glean a valid spoken response from the user. The key difference is that with directed dialogue, the user is more likely to speak an option exactly as was communicated by the prompt (e.g. [...] "account balance"). With an open-ended prompt however, the user is likely to include extraneous words or phrases (e.g. [...] "I was just looking at my bill and saw that my balance was wrong."). The open-ended prompt requires a greater degree of natural language processing to extract the relevant information from the phrase (i.e. [...] "balance"). Open-ended recognition also requires a larger grammar set, which accounts for a wider array of permutations of a given response (e.g. [...] "balance was wrong", [...] "wrong balance", [...] "balance is high", [...] "high balance"). Despite the greater amount of data and processing required for open-ended prompts, they are more interactively efficient, as the prompts themselves are typically much shorter.|$|R
6000|$|While I {{acknowledge}} that I was {{not strong enough}} to keep my motives above the reach of this instinct of revenge, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> honestly <b>say</b> <b>something</b> in my own favour on the other side. No base speculation on the future relations of Laura and myself, and on the private and personal concessions which I might force from Sir Percival if I once had him at my mercy, ever entered my mind. I never said to myself, [...] "If I do succeed, it shall be one result of my success that I put it out of her husband's power to take her from me again." [...] I could not look at her and think of the future with such thoughts as those. The sad sight of the change in her from her former self, made the one interest of my love an interest of tenderness and compassion which her father or her brother might have felt, and which I felt, God knows, in my inmost heart. All my hopes looked no farther on now than to the day of her recovery. There, till she was strong again and happy again--there, till she could look at me as she had once looked, and speak to me as she had once spoken--the future of my happiest thoughts and my dearest wishes ended.|$|R
60|$|We {{can imagine}} how his mind had worked, how he had {{declared}} to himself that, as by those loving hands into which his letters, his notes, his little details,--his literary remains, as such documents used to be called,--might naturally fall, truth of his foibles and of his shortcomings could not be told, so should not his praises be written, or that flattering portrait be limned which biographers are wont to produce. Acting upon these instructions, his daughters,--while there were two living, and since that the one surviving,--have carried out the order which has appeared to them to be sacred. Such being the case, it certainly is not my purpose now to write what may be called a life of Thackeray. In this preliminary chapter I will give such incidents and anecdotes of his life as will tell the reader perhaps all about him that a reader is entitled to ask. I will tell how he became an author, and will say how first he worked and struggled, and then how he worked and prospered, and became a household word in English literature;--how, in this way, he passed through that course of mingled failure and success which, though the literary aspirant may suffer, is probably better both for the writer and for the writings than unclouded early glory. The suffering no doubt is acute, {{and a touch of}} melancholy, perhaps of indignation, may be given to words which have been written while the heart has been too full of its own wrongs; but this is better than the continued note of triumph which is still heard in the final voices of the spoilt child of literature, even when they are losing their music. Then I will tell how Thackeray died, early indeed, but still having done a good life's work. Something of his manner, something of his appearance <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>say,</b> <b>something</b> perhaps of his condition of mind; because for some few years he was known to me. But of the continual intercourse of himself with the world, and of himself with his own works, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell little, because no record of his life has been made public.|$|R

So I do not want to create some kind of impression that this is wrong. So the best thing is to remain neutral.|$|R
