Softwood is typically used in construction as structural <b>carcassing</b> <b>timber,</b> as well as finishing timber.|$|E
40|$|This thesis tests an {{approach}} to delivering affordable housing for rural Wales, through the design and development {{of a system of}} homegrown, re-engineered timber components for self build. Recent studies and policy have demonstrated an acute shortage of affordable housing in rural Wales. Consequently, the Welsh Assembly Government has committed to deliver an additional 6, 500 homes in the period 2007 - 11. However, there remains significant concern regarding the long term, sustainable delivery of affordable rural housing. This dissertation proposes a solution to this need, based on the readily available resource of homegrown softwood. Sitka Spruce has become the primary production crop of the Welsh woodlands. It is rarely used in the construction industry due to its propensity to distort and instead is utilised in low value industries, including low grade <b>carcassing</b> <b>timber.</b> It is proposed that through an innovative and radical approach, homegrown timber resources can offer a high quality, locally sourced and sustainable modern method of construction. In this study, a system of engineered homegrown timber components is designed, prototyped and tested as a self build construction solution for affordable housing in the diverse physical, social and economic context of rural Wales. Design led studies, including a ‘Pattern Book’ of house types, and realised prototypical constructions are used to inform and interrogate the proposed components and construction methodology. The primary objective of these investigations is to examine the applicability and appropriateness for self build construction. Finally, through the construction of a whole house prototype, a system of homegrown timber components and {{an approach}} to its assembly is proposed. Although limitations remain with this proposal, it has been possible to demonstrate that there is significant opportunity for an innovative, self build construction system using homegrown timber resources, to offer an efficient and sustainable solution for affordable housing in rural Wales...|$|E

40|$|Tillamook County is a rural county {{straddling}} the Northern Oregon Coast Range {{with the majority}} of the local economy based around agriculture, timber, tourism, and fishing. As part of Tillamook County’s mission statement, they strive“to enhance {{the quality of life for}} its citizens by promoting and preserving public health and safety, maintaining a stable economy, encouraging wise use of resources, and providing services in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible. ” To that end, Tillamook County, Tillamook County Economic Development Council (TCEDC), Portland State University, Oregon State University, and Tetra Tech have undergone an evaluation and technology assessment process to determine a sustainable, economically-viable, and socially-acceptable pilot installation capable of dealing with the large amount of biodegradable waste produced by the timber and dairy industries. This survey provides a technology assessment and recommendations regarding three potential technologies: thermophilic composting, gasification/pyrolysis, and direct incineration. Each of these technologies have strengths and weaknesses in dealing with the three waste streams (manure, bovine <b>carcasses,</b> and <b>timber</b> slash), and this analysis works as a decision-making guide for choosing the proper technology or array of technologies to dispose of Tillamook County’s biodegradable waste...|$|R
40|$|Bernd Behr {{will present}} a group of loosely {{connected}} works including a new large-scale video projection depicting a series of uniform white concrete housing shells set amidst mounds of dug-up earth. Shot on the construction site of a new Bauhaus-themed gated community in China the piece chronicles part of a recent New Town development designed by Albert Speer Jr. Screened in reverse, Weimar Villa (Unreconstructed) depicts an endless cycle of construction and excavation. The initial documentary nature of the video soon gives way to more ambiguous readings where distinctions between the new and ancient are suspended. A series of sculptural works in concrete extend the archaeological motif of the video into the gallery. Leaning against the wall are a collection of individual flat panels of varying shapes and sizes. Their ambiguous forms, both hard-edged industrial and petrified organic, at once appear as both pre-cast construction components for some future, unspecified structure and archaeological relics of unknown origin. A further set of freestanding sculptures entitled Quasicrystal Compass consist of hollow crystalline shapes in concrete precariously supported by modernist Arne Jacobsen tubular chair legs. Rough cast from <b>timber</b> <b>carcassing,</b> their formal language is informed as much by late Modern ‘Brutalist’ architecture as the tradition of Chinese scholars’ rocks. This new work continues Behr’s interest in places and events that have shaped narratives around {{the history of the}} built environment. By inserting itself into these narratives using both research and fiction, Behr’s practice can be seen to operate a form of associative archaeology on the peripheries of architectural modernisms. About COMMA Launched in March 2009, COMMA is a dynamic new series of commissions enabling artists to experiment and expand their practice in relation to Bloomberg SPACE and its communities. Over thirty of today's most outstanding emerging and established international artists will be invited to create new work, installations and architectural interventions in a fast paced succession of exhibitions. The program is curated by David Risley, Graham Gussin, Stephen Hepworth, Sacha Craddock and Vanessa Desclaux...|$|R
