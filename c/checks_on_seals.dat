50|$|In The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & Four Swords (2002), Four Swords {{occurs at}} some point after The Minish Cap and before Ocarina of Time. Zelda goes to the Sanctuary of the Four Sword with her friend, Link, to <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the <b>seal</b> {{containing}} the evil Wind Mage, Vaati. The seal has weakened, however, and Vaati emerges, kidnaps Zelda, and defeats Link. Later, Link finds three fairies, who instruct him to draw the Four Sword. The magical Four Sword divides him into four identical Links. The first Link wears his traditional green outfit; the second, a red version; the third, blue; and the fourth, purple. The Links must cooperate to overcome obstacles, collect keys, and storm Vaati's Palace so they can rescue Zelda and reseal the Wind Mage.|$|R
5|$|The {{contract}} to build Concord {{was awarded to}} N. F. Palmer & Co. of Chester, Pennsylvania, in the 1888 fiscal year. Her hull was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works, which laid down her keel in March 1888. Concord was launched in March 1890. After her 1891 commissioning, Concord spent {{the next few years}} sailing along the East Coast of the United States, in the West Indies, and in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1893, Concord cruised on the Asiatic Station and also sailed <b>on</b> the <b>sealing</b> patrol, keeping <b>check</b> <b>on</b> fur <b>seal</b> hunters in Alaska. After another stint in the Far East in 1894, Concord spent a year out of commission at San Francisco from May 1896 to May 1897. After spending {{most of the rest of}} 1897 in Alaskan waters, Concord returned to the Asiatic Station in January 1898. She joined Admiral George Dewey's fleet for the 1 May 1898 Battle of Manila Bay, a decisive American victory over the Spanish Fleet in the Spanish–American War.

In {{order to}} know the sealing ability under axial {{alternating}} tension load, a 88. 9 mm× 6. 45 mm P 110 premium tubing connection is established with multiple linear elastic plastic finite element model, stress and contact pressure <b>on</b> <b>sealing</b> surface and torque shoulder are analyzed under axial alternating tension load and 80 MPa inner pressure. The results show that tubing connection slide by the axial tension, while the maximum contact pressure <b>on</b> <b>seal</b> surface reduced. With the increasing of alternating cycle, the maximum equivalent stress <b>on</b> <b>seal</b> surface increased and the maximum contact pressure <b>on</b> <b>seal</b> surface decreased. And, under limited loads, contact pressure on torque shoulder is affected little caused by alternating load...|$|R
