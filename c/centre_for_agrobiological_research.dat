But, if the area's limitations in natural {{and human resources}} are not heeded, {{there will be no}} future for the development of crops, cattle or fish. A study which is about to be published suggests two ways of creating sustainable development in the region. The interior delta of the river Niger gives the fifth region of Mali an advantage over other regions of the country. Nevertheless, all the characteristics of under development are present. Between 1977 and 1987 agricultural production as a whole dropped 60 % in financial terms compared to the three preceding decades. Crop production in particular, more than livestock and fisheries has been affected by this recession. But maybe the worst victim of this state of affairs has been the natural resources which have been put under intense pressure because of the shortage and irregularity of the rainfall and the progressive diminution of the floodwaters since 1972. The soil is exhausted, pasture land is less fertile, the trees are stressed. A study undertaken jointly by the <b>Centre</b> <b>for</b> <b>Agrobiological</b> <b>Research</b> (CABO) in Wageningen, The Netherlands, and an inter-disciplinary team based in Mali, is of the opinion that all is not lost, however. 'Sustainable production systems which will restore the natural equilibrium and raise productivity are within the bounds of possibility. ' The study, entitled 'Competing for limited resources: the case of the Fifth Region,' first makes an extremely detailed assessment of the agricultural, pastoral and fishing activities, and then explores future possibilities in these fields. This study is unlike previous development projects, which were often incomplete in that they failed to recognise the ever more intense competition for these very limited resources among all concerned. One example of this is the struggle for land between pastoralists and farmers. The study suggests two possible scenarios which contain various options for sustainable development. One, which is the most risky of the two targets is a maximum gross income of approximately 66. 7 billion CFA francs for the region with an official emigration of 250, 000 people. This scenario forsees that in drought years there will be serious cereals deficits and many animals will be at risk. The second scenario is more cautious in its objectives: a total gross income of around 32. 5 billion FCFA, and an emigration of only 50, 000. In this latter case even in periods of drought food self-sufficiency would be guaranteed. This strategy is innovative in that it is takes a global view based on a variety of objectives. While it is not a recipe book for success the study lays down the elements of an overall perspective for the state and for donor agencies to make informed choices and maximize the potential outcome of their actions. Ultimately the decisions are political and the government must choose the we, forward {{in the light of the}} knowledge mad' available: for example, whether or not to protect one particular area; or whether or not to increase the price of agriculture products, and so on. But in the final analysis politicians will depend on the good will of the rural population, without whom the best and most enlightened projects will never come to fruition. The fifth region of Mali around Mopti, has considerable potential for agriculture and fisheries.

40|$|In {{the period}} 1965 - 1985 numbers of {{migrating}} geese wintering in The Netherlands increased notably: from approximately 100. 000 to 600. 000 birds. Not all these birds are present {{during the whole}} winterseason: a maximum of about {{seventy percent of the}} total number of geese occurring in The Netherlands is present at the same time during the month of January. Along with this spread in time, geese are distributed geograffically, mainly over the lower parts of the country. In this respect the province of Friesland plays a significant part since almost sixty percent of all wintering geese stay in this northern province for a longer period. Since some goose species (Branta leucopsis, Br. bernicla and Anser brachyrhynchus) have a close season, and others (Anser anser, A. fabalis and A. albifrons) can be shot only during a certain period (from September 1 st till January 31 th) and time of day (half an hour before sunrise till 10. 00 a. m.), any damage caused by goose-grazing is completely compensated for by the Dutch government, more specifically the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. A side-reflection is the recognition that all scaring techniques are effective only for a fairly short period and require not only persistence but also the presence of an area where the geese can be scared to, either a refuge or a place where they will be tolerated. This is not yet the case. Along with the increase in geesenumbers a steady rise in the number of complaints by dairy farmers became manifest every year. Per province an annual review of all complaints concerning goose-damage is presented as well as the crops concerned. Over ninety percent of these complaints concern goose-grazing on pasture land, in more than ninety seven percent restricted to the province of Friesland, the main problem being yield losses at first cut. Yearly amounts paid by the Game Fund to compensate for these losses increased from sixthousand Dfl. in 1974 to one and a half million Dfl. in 1984; every year more than half a the total amount is paid to Frisian farmers. The intensification of dairy farming in The Netherlands is discussed, the main topics being changes in grassland utilisation, the application of growing quantities of mineral fertilizers, the increase in yearly reseed and the use of new mixtures. In combination with an improved drainage this resulted in a shortening of the nonproductive winter-period. An increasing number of wintering geese benefit from the fact that more grass of a better quality is available in autumn and spring. From an inventory of methods used by the provincial Game Damage Committees to assess goose-damage, their appears to be very little conformity, mainly caused by the fact that the subject was never thoroughly studied. In order to find a uniform, standardized method for the assessment of yield losses due to goose-grazing, a four year research program was carried out by the <b>Centre</b> <b>for</b> <b>Agrobiological</b> <b>Research</b> (CABO, Wageningen). In the study area, the northern Dutch province of Friesland, the effect of goose- grazing was studied on growth and production of Lolium swards in a temperate climate. Experiments were conducted over three winter periods (1982 - 1985) of which the first two may be classified as "mild" winters, the last one was "hard" and characterized by very low grazing intensity. The difference in sward height between the grazed (g) and ungrazed (u) plots at the time of last goose-grazing (V) turns out to be an essential parameter in explaining losses in herbage production at the time of the first cut; it also provides a method for calculating growth retardation (in days) due to goose-grazing. Goose-grazing generally causes loss of herbage yield in the first cut (early bite); this effect does not occur in subsequent cuts. The extent of this loss (in kg dm) is correlated with:- the difference in sward height (grazed - ungrazed) at time V;- the undisturbed yield level at the time of harvest;- the temperature sum (T-sum) at the time of harvest. Moreover after a mild winter the T-sum at the time of the last heavy goose-grazing plays a significant role; in a hard winter this is the case with the T-sum at V. Retardation can also be calculated from the absolute yield loss (in kg dm) and net daily production of the corresponding sward (in kg dm day - 1 ). Generally speaking yield losses are bigger after a mild than after a hard winter (and so is retardation). Goose-grazing causes a reduction of the LAI-values of the grass; this results in a decline in daily dry-matter production (kg dm 100 m - 2 day - 1 ) as a result of which yield losses occur in the first cut. These losses are always bigger than the calculated herbage consumption by geese in the preceding period, both expressed in kg dm 100 m - 2 . Comparison of goose-dropping contents with the botanical composition of the grazed sward show that there is no significant food selection, the former being a true reflection of the latter. Goose-grazing may cause an improvement in early bite quality (in terms of kVEM kg dm - 1 ) but the kVEM-loss per hectare is so big that the former advantage pales into insignificance in relation to the latter loss of quantity (one feed unit VEM = 1. 65 kcal = 1. 65 * 4. 1868 J). One and even two winters of goose-grazing did not noticeably affect the total number of plant species in the sward, nor dry weight percentages or number of tillers dm - 2 per species. We could not demonstrate any permanent effect of the combination of goose-grazing, treading and manure on the P, K and N content of the upper soil layer; we did not find any effect on permeability, carrying capacity (solidity) and moisture level of that same layer. The agricultural importance of goose-droppings should be considered as insignificant: in terms of nitrogen supply for example this will be less than ten percent of the farmers N-gift for the first cut. Moreover such plant nutrients as the geese provide have come directly from the soil on which the birds feed and are not additions. A guideline is presented to the assessment of goose damage to herbage production using the difference in T-sum values at the time the sward is grazed for the last time (V) and at the time of harvest. A grassland utilization scheme is discussed, in particular for use and management of the first cut. Small adaptations in such a scheme might help in lessening the conflict between dairy farming and goose-grazing in The Netherlands...|$|E
5000|$|Synteny {{is widely}} used in {{studying}} complex genomes, as comparative genomics allows the presence and possibly function of genes in a simpler, model organism to infer those in a more complex one. For example, wheat has a very large, complex genome which is difficult to study. In 1994 research from the John Innes Centre in England and the National Institute of <b>Agrobiological</b> <b>Research</b> in Japan demonstrated that the much smaller rice genome had a similar structure and gene order to that of wheat. Further study found that many cereals are syntenic [...] and thus plants such as rice or Brachypodium {{could be used as}} a model to find genes or genetic markers of interest which could be used in wheat breeding and research. In this context, synteny was also essential in identifying a highly important region in wheat, the Ph1 locus involved in genome stability and fertility, which was located using information from syntenic regions in rice and Brachypodium.|$|R

In addition, in 2013 the Japanese National Institute <b>for</b> <b>Agrobiological</b> Sciences led a team which successfully inserted the DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene, from the Philippine upland rice variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants. This facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the IR64 + DRO1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified IR64 variety.|$|R

30|$|We {{screened}} the National Institute <b>for</b> <b>Agrobiological</b> Sciences Genebank {{database and}} identified two rice lines, BG 23 with the widest grain and LG 10 with the longest grain. Using these two lines, we performed QTL analysis for grain size. Eight QTLs were detected during the QTL analyses using F 2 populations derived from crosses between the large-grain lines BG 23 or LG 10 and the middle-size grain cultivars Nipponbare and Kasalath. Both BG 23 and LG 10 possessed large-grain alleles of four major QTLs: GW 2, GS 3, qSW 5 /GW 5, and GW 8. Other three minor QTLs {{were derived from}} BG 23. However, these QTLs did not explain the differences in grain size between these two lines. Additionally, four QTLs for grain length or width were detected in an F 2 population derived from a cross between BG 23 and LG 10; this population lacked the strong effects {{of the four major}} QTLs shared by both parent plants. Of these newly detected QTLs, the effects of two QTLs, GL 3 b and GL 6, were confirmed by progeny testing. Comparison of the length of inner epidermal cells in plants homozygous for BG 23 and LG 10 alleles indicated that GL 3 b and GL 6 genes regulate cell elongation and cell division, respectively.|$|R
