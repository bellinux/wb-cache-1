5|$|Nico Rosberg {{made his}} pit stop shortly thereafter, {{putting on the}} soft {{compound}} tyre, while Hamilton stayed out. In the meantime, Vettel had moved up into third place, right behind his teammate Räikkönen. Hamilton came into the pitlane on lap 22, and problems with his stop saw him lose position to Rosberg. Räikkönen briefly led the race but followed suit one lap later and made a pit stop, only to come out behind both Red Bull drivers. More trouble was ahead for Ferrari, as Vettel, {{who was in the}} lead at that point, retired on lap 27, when he crashed into the barriers after his rear right tyre had exploded. This incident sent the safety <b>car</b> <b>out,</b> bringing the field back together. Rosberg was now leading the race from Hamilton, Verstappen, Ricciardo and Räikkönen.|$|E
5|$|The BT49's racing career {{got off to}} an {{unsettled}} {{start when}} Brabham's lead driver, Niki Lauda, abruptly quit the sport after 10 laps of the first practice session at the penultimate race of the 1979 season, the Canadian Grand Prix. The car soon showed promise: Piquet ran third in the race on the high speed Circuit Île Notre-Dame before retiring with a broken gearbox. Lauda's replacement, Argentine novice Ricardo Zunino, was seventh of the nine who completed the race. At the season finale in wet conditions at the Watkins Glen International circuit, Zunino spun off although Piquet set the fastest lap before a driveshaft failed, putting his <b>car</b> <b>out</b> of the race.|$|E
5|$|They meet up {{with the}} rest of the family at a car museum. They steal a replica of the main villain's car from The Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their <b>car</b> <b>out</b> of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does not blame him, arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks him out of his limousine.|$|E

5|$|ZANLA {{had planned}} for four attacks {{to take place}} {{simultaneously}} but in the event only Nhongo's men did so. According to historian Elaine Windrich, Nhongo was a former employee of the tobacco farm's 37-year-old owner, Marc de Borchgrave, and held a grudge against him. The cadres shot up the farm house with AK-47 assault rifles and threw grenades through the windows, then retreated and hid amongst the local population. Nobody {{was killed in the}} attack but the farmer's eight-year-old daughter, Jane, was wounded in the foot. The isolated house had no telephone or any other means of contacting neighbours, and de Borchgrave was wary of being ambushed should he drive his <b>car</b> <b>out,</b> so after a short time comforting the children he set out across country on foot to seek help and alert the authorities. This done, he returned and took his wife and children to another farm nearby, Whistlefield, which was owned by Archie Dalgluish and his family.|$|E

25|$|In March, {{a driver}} dropped dead at Bulwell Depot {{just before he}} was due to take a <b>car</b> <b>out.</b> Consequently, all drivers were {{required}} to be medically examined periodically. A further noteworthy incident at Bulwell at this time occurred when an officer stationed at Bulwell Hall commandeered a tramcar standing at Bulwell Market Place to take 17 men to Victoria Station. This created quite a stir, for if such occasions occurred frequently the service would be thrown into disorder. From this time soldiers were carried at half fare, a later concession being the issue of prepaid ½d. and 1d. passes to wounded soldiers.|$|E

25|$|A {{tow truck}} is a vehicle used to {{transport}} motor vehicles to another location, generally a repair garage, or to recover vehicles which {{are no longer}} on a drivable surface. Vehicles are often towed {{in the case of}} breakdowns or collisions, or may be impounded for legal reasons. The tow truck was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes, Sr., of Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was a garage worker who was inspired to create the invention after he was forced to pull a <b>car</b> <b>out</b> of a creek using blocks, ropes, and six men. An improved design led him to manufacture wreckers.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB report {{concluded}} that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal aspect of the Kensington color-position signal after making a flag stop at Kensington Station. The MARC train was operating in push mode with the cab control <b>car</b> <b>out</b> front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover {{at the time of}} the collision; the MARC cab control car collided with the lead Amtrak unit, F40PH #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a GE Genesis P40DC #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a human-factors analysis had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.|$|E

25|$|Marco Andretti was {{the first}} driver to make a {{significant}} improvement on his starting position, putting himself tentatively on the pole. The next <b>car</b> <b>out,</b> Ed Carpenter, raised eyebrows with a first lap of 229.347 mph, and a four-lap average of 228.762 mph. Carpenter bumped Andretti off the top spot, but still had four drivers waiting to make attempts. Rookie Carlos Muñoz squeezed himself on to the front row, landing in second starting position. The final driver with a shot for the pole was Will Power, who was fastest in segment 1. Power's first lap was in the 229 mph range, but his third and fourth laps dropped off significantly. Power ended up 6th, and Ed Carpenter secured his first Indy 500 pole position. It {{was the first}} pole for an American-born driver since Sam Hornish, Jr. in 2006, and the first by an owner/driver since A. J. Foyt in 1975.|$|E
25|$|NASCAR {{conducts a}} {{complete}} technical inspection {{prior to the}} first practice session, before and after qualifying, and before the race. A quick safety inspection is also completed prior to each practice session after the first. Penalties for car violations are typically announced the Wednesday after a race, and can range from a simple fine to a suspension (typically a maximum of 12 races) and loss of points. After a race, the top 5 finishers, one other random car, and the first car failing to finish the race not due to an accident will have their cars inspected. The winner, random car, and first <b>car</b> <b>out</b> also have their cars and engines taken by NASCAR for further inspection at the NASCAR Research and Development Center. Further, there is one random race per year where NASCAR confiscates 15-20 engines and takes them to NASCAR's Research and Development Center for evaluation, comparison, and to help decide on future rule changes.|$|E
25|$|After {{hitting the}} wall on countless {{occasions}} {{over the previous}} two days, Chen was withdrawn from the race due to a cracked monocoque. Thus, this left the grid at 29 for the 10-lap race, and Vernay got the jump on Ericsson away from the start-finish line, and took the lead into the first corner, {{but by the time}} the drivers had reached Lisboa, Ericsson was back in front just as the safety car came out. Further back, Bianchi rode over the rear wheel of Mortara at San Francisco, causing enough damage for the Frenchman to pit. Rosenzweig collided with the barriers at the Mandarin, which brought the safety <b>car</b> <b>out</b> for three laps. Arundel's Carlin car encountered mechanical troubles under the safety car, after some debris punctured a hole in the radiator of his Volkswagen engine. This left the order as Ericsson, Vernay, Mortara (who moved up despite his collision), Bottas, Ricciardo, Vanthoor, Bird, Coletti, Mäki and Hartley. Boyd moved up five positions at the start, as he was the biggest winner off the line.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his success}} with Cooper, Brabham {{was sure he}} could do better. He {{considered}} buying Cooper in partnership with Roy Salvadori and then in late 1959 he asked his friend Ron Tauranac {{to come to the}} UK and work with him, producing upgrade kits for Sunbeam Rapier and Triumph Herald road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham continued to drive for Cooper, but on the long flight back from the 1960 season-opening Argentine Grand Prix, he had a heart-to-heart with John Cooper. John's father Charlie and the designer Owen Maddock had been reluctant to update their car, but although a Cooper had won in Argentina, other cars had been faster before they broke down. Brabham helped design the more advanced Cooper T53, including advice from Tauranac. Brabham spun the new <b>car</b> <b>out</b> of the next championship race, the Monaco Grand Prix, but then embarked on a series of five straight victories. He won from the front at the Dutch, French, and Belgian Grands Prix, where title rival Moss was badly injured in a practice accident that put him out for two months. Two other drivers were killed during the race. At the British Grand Prix, Brabham was closing on Graham Hill's BRM before Hill spun off, leaving Brabham the victory. He then came back from eighth place to second at the Portuguese Grand Prix after sliding off on tramlines and won after race leader John Surtees crashed. Brabham's points total was put out of reach when the British teams withdrew from the Italian GP on safety grounds. Mike Lawrence writes that Brabham's expertise in setting up the cars was a significant factor in Cooper's 1960 drivers' and constructors' titles.|$|E
