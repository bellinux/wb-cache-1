A variety of circuits based upon this idea are in use, particularly for MOSFET mirrors because MOSFETs have rather low intrinsic output resistance values. A MOSFET version of Figure 3 is shown in Figure 4, where MOSFETs M3 and M4 operate in Ohmic mode to play the same role as emitter resistors RE in Figure 3, and MOSFETs M1 and M2 operate in active mode in the same roles as mirror transistors Q1 and Q2 in Figure 3.

50|$|For Figure 3, a large op amp gain {{achieves}} {{the maximum}} Rout {{with only a}} small RE. A low value for RE means V2 also is small, allowing a low <b>compliance</b> <b>voltage</b> for this mirror, only a voltage V2 larger than the <b>compliance</b> <b>voltage</b> of the simple bipolar mirror. For this reason this type of mirror also is called a wide-swing current mirror, because it allows the output voltage to swing low compared to other types of mirror that achieve a large Rout only {{at the expense of}} large compliance voltages.|$|E

Polyurethane hydrogels swollen with various electrolytes were compressed at a pressure of 30 kPa, simulating a fingertap on a conventional touch screen device.

40|$|Abstract – DC-DC {{switching}} {{regulators are}} critical building blocks in electronic systems and integrating them on chip affords numerous savings in system size, cost, and design complexity. A key portion of these regulators is the frequency compensation circuit and, {{because of its}} dependence to the passive LC filter parameters in the power stage, it resists integration. This hindrance to system-on-chip (SoC) integration can be overcome by adopting a sliding-mode control scheme, which, in implementing a variation of a sigma-delta (Σ∆) converter, gives stable operation {{for a wide range}} of LC filter values, without the need for a frequency compensation circuit. However, sliding-mode boost DC-DC converters designed to tolerate wide LC variations exhibit a slow transient response because the bandwidth of the feedback circuit is necessarily low, significantly lower than the main power path’s bandwidth, which is a requirement for stability. This paper proposes a switching boost converter with a high bandwidth, bypass, Σ∆ path that yields fast transient response (up to 50 % ∆V reduction) – limited only by slew-rate conditions. The proposed converter achieves this fast response without a degradation in LC filter <b>compliance,</b> steady-state <b>voltage</b> ripple (± 0. 2 %), or efficiency. In effect, the presented strategy decouples the conflicting design requirements of high relative stability and fast transient response without requiring compensation circuits and therefore offering integrated, user-friendly solutions.

50|$|There {{are three}} main {{specifications}} that characterize a current mirror. The {{first is the}} transfer ratio (in {{the case of a}} current amplifier) or the output current magnitude (in the case of a constant current source CCS). The second is its AC output resistance, which determines how much the output current varies with the voltage applied to the mirror. The third specification is the minimum voltage drop across the output part of the mirror necessary to make it work properly. This minimum voltage is dictated by the need to keep the output transistor of the mirror in active mode. The range of voltages where the mirror works is called the compliance range and the voltage marking the boundary between good and bad behavior is called the <b>compliance</b> <b>voltage.</b> There are also a number of secondary performance issues with mirrors, for example, temperature stability.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quiescent}} current {{has to be}} constant to ensure constant collector voltages at common mode. This requirement is not so important {{in the case of}} a differential output since the two collector voltages will vary simultaneously but their difference (the output voltage) will not vary. But {{in the case of a}} single-ended output, it is extremely important to keep a constant current since the output collector voltage will vary. Thus the higher the resistance of the current source , the lower (better) is the common mode gain [...] The constant current needed can be produced by connecting an element (resistor) with very high resistance between the shared emitter node and the supply rail (negative for NPN and positive for PNP transistors) but this will require high supply voltage. That is why, in more sophisticated designs, an element with high differential (dynamic) resistance approximating a constant current source/sink is substituted for the “long tail” (Figure 3). It is usually implemented by a current mirror because of its high <b>compliance</b> <b>voltage</b> (small voltage drop across the output transistor).|$|E
50|$|For voltage amplification, {{the range}} of allowed output voltage swing in this {{amplifier}} is tied to voltage gain when a resistor load RC is employed, as in Figure 1. That is, large voltage gain requires large RC, and that in turn implies a large DC voltage drop across RC. For a given supply voltage, the larger this drop, the smaller the transistor VCB and the less output swing is allowed before saturation of the transistor occurs, with resultant distortion of the output signal. To avoid this situation, an active load can be used, for example, a current mirror. If this choice is made, the value of RC in the table above is replaced by the small-signal output resistance of the active load, which is generally at least {{as large as the}} rO of the active transistor in Figure 1. On the other hand, the DC voltage drop across the active load has a fixed low value (the <b>compliance</b> <b>voltage</b> of the active load), much less than the DC voltage drop incurred for comparable gain using a resistor RC. That is, an active load imposes less restriction on the output voltage swing. Notice that active load or not, large AC gain still is coupled to large AC output resistance, which leads to poor voltage division at the output except for large loads RL ≫ Rout.|$|E

40|$|Memristive {{devices have}} been widely {{employed}} to emulate biological synaptic behavior. In these cases, the memristive switching generally originates from electrical field induced ion migration or Joule heating induced phase change. In this letter, the Ti/ZnO/Pt structure was found to show memristive switching ascribed to a carrier trapping/detrapping of the trap sites (e. g., oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials) in ZnO. The carrier trapping/detrapping level can be controllably adjusted by regulating the current <b>compliance</b> level or <b>voltage</b> amplitude.
