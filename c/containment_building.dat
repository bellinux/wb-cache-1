5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b> The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E
25|$|With the {{pilot-operated}} {{relief valve}} still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the {{discharge from the}} pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> sump to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b> This radioactive coolant was pumped from the <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{buildings}} containing {{nuclear reactors}} are <b>containment</b> <b>buildings,</b> not all are. For instance, the Soviet RBMK reactors were not housed in <b>containment</b> <b>buildings.</b> This greatly increased {{the severity of}} the Chernobyl accident on April 26, 1986.|$|R

25|$|Unpowered {{filtering}} {{systems on}} <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> vent lines, known as Filtered Containment Venting Systems (FCVS), can safely catch radioactive materials and thereby allow reactor core de-pressurization, with steam and hydrogen venting with minimal radioactivity emissions. Filtration using an external water tank {{system is the}} most common established system in European countries, with the water tank positioned outside the <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b> In October 2013, the owners of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power station began installing wet filters and other safety systems, with completion anticipated in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b> When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in {{the air of the}} secondary <b>containment</b> <b>building,</b> an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E

25|$|Even {{without an}} {{engineered}} <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> like those used today, the SL-1 reactor building contained {{most of the}} radioactivity, though iodine-131 levels on plants during several days of monitoring reached fifty times background levels downwind. Radiation surveys of the Support Facilities Building, for example, indicated high contamination in halls, but light contamination in offices.|$|E
25|$|During the {{interaction}} between corium and concrete, very high temperatures can be achieved. Less volatile aerosols of Ba, Ce, La, Sr, and other fission products are formed during this phase and introduced into the <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> {{at a time when}} most of the early aerosols are already deposited. Tellurium is released with the progress of zirconium telluride decomposition. Bubbles of gas flowing through the melt promote aerosol formation.|$|E
25|$|Some smaller {{reactors}} {{operating in}} deregulated markets have become uneconomic to operate and maintain, due to competition from generators using low priced natural gas, {{and may be}} retired early. The 556 MWe Kewaunee Power Station is being closed 20 years before license expiry for these economic reasons. Duke Energy's Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant in Florida closed, as it could not recover the costs needed to fix its <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
50|$|The two {{signature}} <b>containment</b> <b>buildings</b> {{which would}} have housed two 1130 MWe Westinghouse pressurized water reactors and the two cooling tower complexes were located {{just north of the}} <b>containment</b> <b>buildings.</b> (see photo) The station was a near architectural one-for-one with Byron and Braidwood stations. The lower portion of the reactor vessel in Unit #1 was already installed at the time construction was halted. The turbine <b>building</b> behind the <b>containment</b> <b>buildings</b> has been demolished, although the multi-story concrete turbine foundations still stand with what remains of the Unit #1 turbine still in place. During 1990 Power Equipment Supply Co. ("PESCO") was incorporated in Indiana and was established to sell equipment and parts from the Marble Hill Facility project. PESCO also purchased equipment for resale, brokered equipment, and sold equipment on consignment for others. Public Service Indiana discontinued PESCO operations in early 1996.|$|R

25|$|On October 17, 1980, 100,000 {{gallons of}} Hudson River water leaked into the Indian Point 2 <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> from the fan cooling unit, undetected by a safety device {{designed}} to detect hot water. The flooding, covering the first 9 {{feet of the}} reactor vessel, was discovered when technicians entered the building. Two pumps that should have removed the water {{were found to be}} inoperative. NRC proposed a $2,100,000 fine for the incident.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, {{six years}} after the disaster, {{radiation}} levels inside the Unit 2 <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> were crudely estimated to be about 650 Sv/h. The estimation was revised later to 80 Sv/h. These readings were the highest recorded since the disaster occurred in 2011 and the first recorded in that area of the reactor since the meltdowns. Images showed a hole in metal grating beneath the reactor pressure vessel, suggesting that melted nuclear fuel had escaped the vessel in that area.|$|E

50|$|Marble Hill is {{currently}} owned by an undisclosed Michigan-based company and under demolition with a contract from MCM Management Corp. Since 2008, the facility has been undergoing continued demolition {{in which the}} Fuel Handling building (the smaller square building between the two <b>containment</b> <b>buildings)</b> is slowly being torn away and scrapped. In August 2010, one of the <b>containment</b> <b>buildings</b> was completely demolished and the other had its reactor core removed, and was under heavy demolition. By May 2011, most Marble Hill structures were either demolished, or under demolition. As of December 2011, both containment domes had been demolished with approximately 2/3 of the cooling stacks still standing. The control building is also under heavy demolition.|$|R
25|$|Three Mile Island Unit2 was {{too badly}} damaged and {{contaminated}} to resume operations; the reactor was gradually deactivated and permanently closed. TMI-2 had been online only 13months but {{now had a}} ruined reactor vessel and a <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> that was unsafe to walk in. Cleanup started in August 1979 and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1billion. Benjamin K. Sovacool, in his 2007 preliminary assessment of major energy accidents, estimated that the TMI accident caused a total of $2.4billion in property damages.|$|E
25|$|Over 20 {{workers had}} been injured by 18 March, {{including}} one who was exposed to {{a large amount of}} ionizing radiation when the worker tried to vent vapour from a valve of the <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b> Three more workers were exposed to radiation over 100mSv, and two of them were sent to a hospital due to beta burns on 24 March. Two other workers, Kazuhiko Kokubo, 24, and Yoshiki Terashima, 21, were killed by the tsunami while conducting emergency repairs immediately after the quake. Their bodies were found on 30 March.|$|E
25|$|Since {{heavy water}} is less {{efficient}} at slowing neutrons, CANDU needs a larger moderator to fuel ratio {{and a larger}} core for the same power output. Although a calandria-based core is cheaper to build, its size increases the cost for standard features like the <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b> Generally nuclear plant construction and operations are ≈65% of overall lifetime cost; for CANDU costs are dominated by construction even more. Fueling CANDU is cheaper than other reactors, costing only ≈10% of the total, so the overall price per kWh electricity is comparable. The next-generation Advanced CANDU Reactor (ACR) mitigates these disadvantages by having light water coolant and using a more compact core with less moderator.|$|E

25|$|Low {{pressure}} operation. Because {{the coolant}} salts remain liquid at high temperatures, LFTR cores {{are designed to}} operate at low pressures, like 0.6 MPa (comparable to the pressure in the drinking water system) from the pump and hydrostatic pressure. Even if the core fails, there is little increase in volume. Thus the <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> cannot blow up. LFTR coolant salts are chosen to have very high boiling points. Even a several hundred degree heatup during a transient or accident does not cause a meaningful pressure increase. There is no water or hydrogen in the reactor that can cause a large pressure rise or explosion as happened during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.|$|E
25|$|During the September 11 attacks, American Airlines Flight 11 flew {{near the}} Indian Point Energy Center {{en route to}} the World Trade Center. Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers/plotters, had {{considered}} nuclear facilities for targeting in a terrorist attack. Entergy says it is prepared for a terrorist attack, and asserts that a large airliner crash into the <b>containment</b> <b>building</b> would not cause reactor damage. Following 9/11 the NRC required operators of nuclear facilities in the U.S. {{to examine the effects of}} terrorist events and provide planned responses. In September 2006, the Indian Point Security Department successfully completed mock assault exercises required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. However, according to environmental group Riverkeeper, these NRC exercises are inadequate because they do not envision a sufficiently large group of attackers.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{reactors}} (the {{most common}} type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or thermal neutrons to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain neutron moderator materials that slow neutrons until their neutron temperature is thermalized, that is, until their kinetic energy approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher cross-section (probability) of fissioning the fissile nuclei uranium-235, plutonium-239, and plutonium-241, and a relatively lower probability of neutron capture by uranium-238 (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of low-enriched uranium or even natural uranium fuel. The moderator is often also the coolant, usually water under high pressure to increase the boiling point. These are surrounded by a reactor vessel, instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, radiation shielding, and a <b>containment</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
