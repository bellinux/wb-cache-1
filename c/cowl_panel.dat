40|$|The NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas is {{the home}} of the NASA WB- 57 High Altitude Research Program. Three fully {{operational}} WB- 57 aircraft are based near JSC at Ellington Field. The aircraft have been flying research missions since the early 1960 's, and continue to be an asset to the scientific community with professional, reliable, customer-oriented service designed to meet all scientific objectives. The NASA WB- 57 Program provides unique, high-altitude airborne platforms to US Government agencies, academic institutions, and commercial customers in order to support scientific research and advanced technology development and testing at locations around the world. Mission examples include atmospheric and earth science, ground mapping, cosmic dust collection, rocket launch support, and test bed operations for future airborne or spaceborne systems. During the return from a 6 hour flight, at 30, 000 feet, in the clean configuration, traveling at 175 knots indicated airspeed, in un-accelerated flight with the auto pilot engaged, in calm air, the 2 -man crew heard a mechanical bang and felt a slight shudder followed by a few seconds of high frequency vibration. The crew did not notice any other abnormalities leading up to, or for the remaining 1 hour of flight and made an uneventful landing. Upon taxi into the chocks, the recovery ground crew noticed the high frequency long wire antenna had become disconnected from the vertical stabilizer and was trailing over the left inboard wing, and that the left engine upper center removable <b>cowling</b> <b>panel</b> was missing, with noticeable damage to the left engine inboard cowling fixed structure. The missing <b>cowling</b> <b>panel</b> was never recovered. Each engine <b>cowling</b> <b>panel</b> is attached to the engine nacelle using six bushings made of 17 - 4 PH steel.

The other four bushings exhibited ratchet marks (multiple fatigue origins) which initiated in the sharp radius of the flange/cylinder fillet and were observed 300 degrees around the flange perimeter (Fig 2 - 3). Low stress, high cycle fatigue (HCF) was observed on the fracture surfaces of all four bushings (Fig 4). To improve the <b>cowling</b> <b>panel</b> joint design and enable return to flight, new cowling bushings with thicker flanges and a larger machined flange/cylinder fillet radius were installed on all <b>cowling</b> <b>panels.</b> In addition, a spacer was added to the joint to achieve the proper stack tolerance.

40|$|In this study, {{glass and}} Kevlar® fibers {{reinforced}} epoxy composites were manufactured and characterized using different techniques. The effect of thermal exposure on the flexural {{properties of the}} composites was investigated to ascertain its suitability for the intended application in <b>cowling</b> <b>panels</b> of light engine aircraft. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on both reinforced and unreinforced epoxy resin to evaluate their thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was carried out to evaluate the effects of thermal exposure, applied strain and frequency on the dynamic mechanical response of the composites. The effects of the applied resin hardener and thermal exposure on the flexural strength, flexural modulus and dynamic impact response of the composites were also investigated. The flexural properties were determined using 3 -point bending test, while the impact test was carried out using Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). TGA analysis of the reinforced and unreinforced epoxy showed no significant weight loss until the test samples were heated above 250 °C in an inert atmosphere. Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) on the composites indicated the glass transition temperature to lie between 80 and 100 °C. The results of the flexural and impact tests showed that the mechanical integrity of both glass and Kevlar® fiber reinforced epoxy composites remained unimpaired by radiative or convective heat exposure for up to 3 h until the exposure temperature exceeded 200 °C. This {{is much higher than}} the service temperature of <b>cowling</b> <b>panels</b> of light engine recreational aircrafts. When the manufactured fiber reinforced epoxy composites were exposed to temperature above 200 °C matrix degradation occurred, which became very significant when the exposure temperature was higher than 250 °C. Extensive delamination and matrix cracking occurred when the composites were exposed to the temperature range 250 °C - 300 °C for 1 h. Fiber-matrix debonding was not observed in the composite except after failure under impact loading. This is evidence {{of the fact that the}} epoxy matrix was adequately wetted by both the glass and Kevlar® fibers resulting in the strong fiber/matrix interfacial bonding. While the Kevlar® reinforced epoxy displayed a better damage tolerance under flexural and impact loading, glass fiber reinforced epoxy showed higher strength but lower damage tolerance. Glass fiber reinforced epoxy also showed more resistance to damage under exposure to thermal flux than Kevlar® reinforced epoxy. Under impact loading, the Kevlar® reinforced composite failed by delamination with no fiber rupture, whereas the glass fiber reinforced epoxy failed by matrix cracking, debonding, fiber rupture and fiber pullout. The results from this research have established the effect of radiative and convective thermal exposure on the mechanical behavior of the fabricated Kevlar® fiber and glass reinforced epoxy composites. The maximum temperature reached on the inner surface of the <b>cowling</b> <b>panels</b> of a typical light engine recreational aircraft due to heat radiations from the engine block has been estimated to be about 65 °C. This is lower than the glass transition temperature of the epoxy matrix as obtained from DMTA. The low temperature rise is due to inflow cooling air into the cowling chamber in flight. The results of the current investigations suggest the suitability of composite materials for the intended application. The intensity of thermal exposure, to which the materials will be exposed in such application, may not cause any significant damage to the mechanical integrity of the composite. However, since the difference between the possible exposure temperature and the glass transition temperature is only a little over 20 °C, a layer of thermal insulator on the inner surface of the cowling made of fiber reinforced epoxy will be desirable to further sustain the mechanical integrity of the composites when selected for use as choice materials for <b>cowling</b> <b>panels</b> of light engine aircraft...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the NASA / Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Reusable Technologies (ART) project is to advance and develop Rocket-Based Combined-Cycle (RBCC) technologies. The ART project began in 1996 {{as part of the}} Advanced Space Transportation Program (ASTP). The project is {{composed}} of several activities including RBCC engine ground testing, tool development, vehicle / mission studies, and component testing / development. The major contractors involved in the ART project are Aerojet and Rocketdyne. A large database of RBCC ground test data was generated for the air-augmented rocket (AAR), ramjet, scramjet, and ascent rocket modes of operation for both the Aerojet and Rocketdyne concepts. Transition between consecutive modes was also demonstrated as well as trajectory simulation. The Rocketdyne freejet tests were conducted at GASL in the Flight Acceleration Simulation Test (FAST) facility. During a single test, the FAST facility is capable of simulating both the enthalpy and aerodynamic conditions over a range of Mach numbers in a flight trajectory. Aerojet performed freejet testing in the Pebble Bed facility at GASL as well as direct-connect testing at GASL. Aerojet also performed sea-level static (SLS) testing at the Aerojet A-Zone facility in Sacramento, CA. Several flight-type flowpath components were developed under the ART project. Aerojet designed and fabricated ceramic scramjet injectors. The structural design of the injectors will be tested in a simulated scramjet environment where thermal effects and performance will be assessed. Rocketdyne will be replacing the cooled combustor in the A 5 rig with a flight-weight combustor that is near completion. Aerojet's formed duct panel is currently being fabricated and will be tested in the SLS rig in Aerojet's A-Zone facility. Aerojet has already successfully tested a cooled <b>cowl</b> <b>panel</b> in the same facility. In addition to MSFC, other NASA centers have contributed to the ART project as well. Inlet testing and parametrics were performed at NASA / Glenn Research Center (GRC) and NASA / Langley Research Center (LaRC) for both the Aerojet and Rocketdyne concepts. LaRC conducted an Air-Breathing Launch Vehicle (ABLV) study for several vehicle concepts with RBCC propulsion systems. LaRC is also performing a CFD analysis of the ramjet mode for both flowpaths based on GASL test conditions. A study was performed in 1999 to investigate the feasibility of performing an RBCC flight test on the NASA / Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) SR- 71 aircraft. Academia involvement in the ART project includes parametric RBCC flowpath testing by Pennsylvania State University (PSU). In addition to thrust and wall static pressure measurements, PSU is also using laser diagnostics to analyze the flowfield in the test rig. MSFC is performing CFD analysis of the PSU rig at select test conditions for model baseline and validation. Also, Georgia Institute of Technology (GT) conducted a vision vehicle study using the Aerojet RBCC concept. Overall, the ART project has been very successful in advancing RBCC technology. Along the way, several major milestones were achieved and "firsts" accomplished. For example, under the ART project, the first dynamic trajectory simulation testing was performed and the Rocketdyne engine A 5 logged over one hour of accumulated test time. The next logical step is to develop and demonstrate a flight-weight RBCC engine system...|$|E

5000|$|As is {{evidenced}} from the marginalia of his schoolbooks, James Booth developed a precocious flair for automotive design {{at an early}} age. By his twentieth fourth birthday, he had engineered and built his first car, the Bi-Autogo. It was designed to travel on two large wheels at speeds above 20 mph; at lower speeds a pair of smaller wheels could be lowered to balance the machine. Booth intended the car to be a limited production vehicle that would appeal to wealthy young men with a sporting character. Because of the tremendous engineering challenges that his design presented, however, Booth was obliged to delay construction of the prototype. In May 1913, he finally produced a vehicle that incorporated many innovative features: it had the first V-8 engine ever built in Detroit, possessed a compressed air self-starter, had a four-speed transmission, and even boasted a retractable arm rest. The engine <b>cowling</b> and body <b>panels</b> were built of aluminum, and the top speed of the car, Booth stated, was 75 mph (120 km/h). Nonetheless, lacking a power steering unit, the [...] "Bi-Autogo" [...] was extremely hard to turn at low speeds. After the prototype was fashioned and {{a complete set of}} parts were fabricated, funding for the vehicle ceased. Consequently, the [...] "Bi-Autogo" [...] never came to market.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the air flow through the radiator core. The flow through the radiator core in turn depends on other panels {{that are in the}} vicinity of the radiator and these include the radiator cover, grille, front inner <b>panel,</b> <b>cowl,</b> floor, etc. A clear understanding of the flow pattern inside the radiator cover is essential for optimizing the radiator cover shape to increase the flow through the radiator core, thereby increasing the thermal {{efficiency of}} the radiator. In this paper, CFD enabled optimization of airflow distribution inside the radiator cover is discussed. Starting from a CFD solution of the baseline design that was validated against indoor test data, a series of optimization cases were executed to arrive at the optimum configuration of the radiator cover. The airflow distribution inside the radiator cover and the flow through the radiator core was monitored to provide a quantitative basis for the optimization process. The CFD analysis was conducted using the commercial software FLUENT™, while the surface and volume mesh were generated using ANSA ™ and TGRID™, respectively. Use of ANSA ™ for surface meshing was instrumental in reducing the CFD cycle time. CFD analysis of the baseline design that was validated against test data showed that significant regions of re-circulating flow existed inside the radiator cover. This recirculation reduced the flow through the radiator core, leading to a build-up of hot air pockets close to the radiator surface and subsequent degradation of radiator thermal efficiency. The CFD enabled optimization led to radiator cover configuration that eliminated these recirculation regions and increased the flow through the radiator core by 34 %. It is anticipated that this increase in radiator core flow would significantly increase the radiator thermal efficiency...|$|R
