Four industrial sectors (the wood and furniture manufacturing industry, vehicle refinishing, the heavy-duty vehicle manufacturing industry {{as well as the}} iron and metal goods industry) show the highest sector-specific emissions; furhtermore, their coating requirements are transferable to other sectors. Hence, within those sectors case studies were carried out in eleven companies that have already implemented low-emission measures which have had an ecological and economic impact, herein described.
