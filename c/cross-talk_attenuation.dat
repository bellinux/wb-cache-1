40|$|Within the HHI Broadband Communications System, besides some digital, optical {{subscriber}} lines {{an analog}} optical subscriber {{line has been}} installed, offering as well simultaneously three color-TV-programs, one videophone channel, four stereo-broadcast programmes and additional channels for telephone and data to the subscriber. In {{order to make a}} statement about the quality of that analog optical broadband-transmission- line employed for that, extensive measurements of the signal-to-noise ratios in the TV- and stereo-broadcast channel, the signal-to-cross- modulation ratio in the frequency range of the TV-channels, the <b>cross-talk</b> <b>attenuation</b> and the harmonic ratio in the stereo-broadcast channel have been performed. Results however show, that the quality standards for national CATV-Systems cannot be achieved by this optical analog link with its load of the frequency band and with the employment of the AM-IM-modulation for TV- and videophone signals...|$|E
30|$|Just as the {{correction}} for random events, {{the implementation of}} attenuation correction is not TOF dependent. When an attenuation map for attenuation correction in PET image reconstruction is absent, {{it is possible to}} simultaneously reconstruct emission and transmission images from PET emission data only. The maximum likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) is an iterative reconstruction algorithm that uses interleaved updating of emission and attenuation maps [80]. The method, as originally proposed, did not use TOF information and, therefore, the algorithm had a non-unique solution. Consequently, the MLAA reconstruction algorithm suffers from <b>cross-talk</b> between <b>attenuation</b> and emission images. The MLAA method (with or without TOF) is limited to tracers, which have uptake in the full object, because attenuation values can only be recovered in regions with sufficient emission.|$|R
30|$|The {{reason why}} the exact shape of the {{hardware}} components to be estimated cannot be recovered by xMLAA is because the emission-based information on the hardware attenuation is available from {{a limited number of}} view angles only, as illustrated in Fig. 5 b. Additional prior information, e.g., on the shape and approximate location of the hardware components, will most likely improve the results. Moreover, dedicated limited angle reconstruction techniques for transmission tomography, e.g., employing total variation [54], may be beneficial. While <b>cross-talk</b> between <b>attenuation</b> and activity is a severe problem when applying MLAA for patient attenuation estimation [15], it is not relevant for xMLAA-based hardware estimation as presented in this work. Since the hardware components do not contain activity, consistency conditions provided by LORs crossing the hardware but not the patient force the reconstructed activity to remain close to zero, limiting (direct) cross-talk effects. Therefore, incorporating TOF information is not expected to significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of xMLAA for hardware attenuation estimation. Moreover, restricting the activity update to within the patient body outline, i.e., assuming zero activity outside the patient, was not found to be relevant.|$|R
30|$|The {{percentage}} of exchanges with cable available had an as expected positive impact (0.09) due to inter-platform competition. Moreover, the {{percentage of}} exchanges with LLU enabled also had a positive impact (0.02), but overall the results contrast {{with the findings of}} Gruber & Koutroumpis (2013). Their analysis found that diffusion and investment has taken place from intra-platform competition and less so from inter-platform competition, but it might be that the UK does not follow the same trend. It was surprising to find that the number of LLU operators at an exchange had a negative impact on speed (- 0.44), implying on face value that more intra-platform competition leads to lower speeds. However, there are two potential explanations for this finding. Firstly, this negative correlation could be due to LLU operators being attracted to providing services in exchanges with the largest number of lines attached. More lines could lead to increased technological strain on the infrastructure through contention, <b>cross-talk</b> signal <b>attenuation</b> and due to physical space limits having more premises located on copper lines far away from the exchange. Secondly, an alternative explanation is that the larger the number of resellers using the incumbent’s infrastructure via LLU, the more the incumbent is deterred from investing in NGA, as they {{would be less likely to}} reap full rewards from their investment. If this second explanation was true then the market strategy for the incumbent’s DSL platform might be to directly compete with cable through NGA investment, but leave exchanges with a large LLU presence for investment at a later stage. Further analysis on this topic could be carried out with the data used here and could prove of great importance in explaining firstly this result and secondly the investment dynamics between the incumbent and other service providers. Ranking the number of lines attached to each exchange and examining the location characteristics of different parts of the distribution would prove a useful starting point.|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{constraints}} governing information transfer between electrodes and neurons {{is crucial to}} the effective design of neural prostheses. In sensory prostheses such as cochlear implants, information is transferred to the brain by stimulating neurons to produce sensation. In motor prostheses such as cortically controlled bionic limbs, neural recordings are processed to extract information needed to control a computer or mechanical device. In each case, performance of the prosthesis hinges on how effectively information can be conveyed to or from the device at the interface between brain and machine. In this thesis, we investigate the performance capabilities and constraints of brain machine interfaces (BMIs) using an information theoretic approach. Modeling the BMI as a vector Poisson process channel, we compute the information capacity of several different types of BMI channels. Since capacity defines the ultimate fidelity limits of information transmission by any system, this approach gives us an objective way of evaluating and comparing different types of BMIs by determining the best possible performance of each system given its unique constraints. For stimulation BMIs, we examine how the capacity of the system scales with the number of inputs, {{the constraints}} on the inputs, and inter-neuronal dependencies. For control BMIs, we quantify the loss in performance that results from using extracellular recordings, where signals from multiple neurons are received on a single electrode. This performance loss can be mitigated through spike sorting, and we show how the properties of the spike sorting algorithm have direct consequences for the resulting BMI capacity. We also provide extensions to the basic models to account for signal <b>attenuation,</b> <b>cross-talk,</b> and measurement noise. Finally, we discuss the real-world significance of BMI capacity in the context of Rate-Distortion Theory, and interpret the capacity results using performance criteria that are relevant to BMIs. This framework provides a direct way to compare competing systems, and allows us to make predictions about the specific conditions necessary for a BMI to achieve a desired performance level...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part is {{explained}} what actually a structured cabling is. Its beginning, from what and why it was created. Its history when at the beginning were applied unbalanced coaxial cables, those were later replaced by balanced cables. In cabling for TVs are still used coaxial cables. Balanced cables are according to type named UTP, STP, FTP, and so on. Whit growing popularity {{of this type of}} cabling and its wide spread application was necessary to set some rules, standards, specifications and demands, how to build up the cabling from project to realization. According to these rules is the system built so there are strict rules for length of subsystems and interfaces and the whole appearance of the structure cabling. Next important point is projecting of cabling that is related to the previous points and when it’s finished, we should strictly follow it. With the project is closely connected characteristic of this cabling as <b>attenuations,</b> <b>cross-talks</b> and other transmission parameters which are measured in the practical part. In the second part is spoken about all the parts of which the structured cabling consists - metallic and optical connecting elements and cables. There are also mentioned their mechanical, electrical and transmission features. In the third part is described influence of man on the quality of structured cabling and the most common causes of lower quality and the ways how to prevent this from happening and how to manipulate with cabling not to destroy it. The final (fourth) part considers the measurement. There are measured qualities of metallic wires as the <b>attenuations,</b> delay, <b>cross-talks</b> on the near- and far-end, impedance and resistance. To all the features are mentioned schemes of the measurement on the twisted pairs. The measurement is divided into two parts. In {{the first part}} are measured five types of balanced cables of different length, category and damage influencing quality of these cables. In the second part is measured one balanced cable if it’s corresponding with category 5 for that t was made and if {{it would be possible to}} use it also for higher category 6. Values are tabularly sorted in tables...|$|R
