40|$|Although current bio-oxidation {{processes}} with mesophilic bacteria {{result from}} the occurrence of mixed populations, the mutual effect of the various species has not been studied very extensively to date. Mixed cultures made up of pure #Thiobacillus ferrooxidans$, #Thiobacillus thiooxidans$ and #Leptospirillum ferrooxidans$ strains of the DSM collection were batch tested {{for their ability to}} oxidize a <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite</b> ore. The most efficient population for pyrite oxidation was composed of the three bacterial species. The influence of the relative abundance of the different strains in the inoculum was studied. The cobalt solubilization rate obtained with #T. ferrooxidans$ increased when #L. ferrooxidans$ was present but was not affected by the initial concentration of #L. ferrooxidans$. The bioleaching with #T. ferrooxidans$ was only improved by adding #T. thiooxidans$ when the initial concentration of #T. thiooxidans$ was higher than the initial concentration of #T. ferrooxidans$. During continuous bioleaching of the <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite</b> at 20 % solids with a natural mesophilic mixed population, rod-shaped and #Leptospirillum$-like bacteria were enumerated in the liquid phase. The 100 l bioleaching unit is made up of 3 or 4 reactors arranged in cascade. The concentration of #Leptospirillum$-like organisms rose exponentially versus dissolved ferric iron, whereas the concentration of rod-shaped bacteria did not change from the value obtained in the first reactor, providing the solution contained less than 60 g/l ferric iron. At higher Fe 3 + concentrations, the rod-shaped bacteria performed the earlier steps of pyrite oxidation, whereas #Leptospirillum$-like organisms participated in the later phase of bioleaching. The effluent from the last reactor was treated with CaCO 3 in order to precipitate iron [...] . (D'après résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Deposits of the Idaho cobalt belt comprise three types: (1) strata-bound sulfide lenses in the Blackbird district, which are cobaltite and, less commonly, chalcopyrite rich with locally abundant gold, native bismuth, bismuthinite, xenotime, allanite, monazite, and the Be-rich silicate gadolinite-(Y), with sparse uraninite, stannite, and Bi tellurides, in a gangue of quartz, chlorite, biotite, muscovite, garnet, tourmaline, chloritoid, and/or siderite, with locally abundant fluorapatite or magnetite; (2) discordant tourmalinized breccias in the Blackbird district that in places have concentrations of cobaltite, chalcopyrite, gold, and xenotime; and (3) strata-bound magnetite-rich lenses in the Iron Creek area, which contain <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite</b> and locally sparse chalcopyrite or xenotime.

40|$|The {{mining and}} {{processing}} of copper in Kilembe, Western Uganda, from 1956 to 1982 left over 15 Mt. of tailings containing cupriferous and <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite</b> dumped within a mountain river valley. This pilot {{study was conducted}} to assess {{the nature and extent of}} risk to local populations from metal contamination arising from those mining activities. We determined trace element concentrations in mine tailings, soils, locally cultivated foods,house dust, drinking water and human biomarkers (toenails) using ICP-MS analysis of acid digested samples. The results showed that tailings, containing higher concentrations of Co, Cu, Ni and As compared with world average crust values had eroded and contaminated local soils. Pollution load indices revealed that 51 % of agricultural soils sampled were contaminated with trace elements. Local water supplies were contaminated, with Co concentrations that exceeded Wisconsin (US) thresholds in 25 % of domestic water supplies and 40 % of Nyamwamba river water samples. Zinc exceeded WHO/FAO thresholds of 99. 4 mg kg− 1 in 36 % of Amaranthus vegetable samples, Cu exceeded EC thresholds of 20 mg kg− 1 in 19 % of Amaranthus while Pb exceeded WHO thresholds of 0. 3 mg kg− 1 in 47 % of Amaranthus vegetables. In bananas, 20 % of samples contained Pb concentrations that exceeded the WHO/FAO recommended threshold of 0. 3 mg kg− 1. However, risk assessment of local foods and water, based on hazard quotients (HQ values) revealed no potential health effects. The high external contamination of volunteers' toenails with some elements (even after a washing process) calls into question their use as a biomarker for metal exposure in human populations where feet are frequently exposed to soil...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{continuous}} bioleaching {{operation was}} carried out in a laboratory-scale unit using a <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite</b> concentrate. The objective was to investigate mechanisms of microbial activity and mineral oxidation for a better understanding and optimisation of biomining operations, particularly the ones using stirred tank technology. A combination of scientific and technical approaches (molecular ecology and biochemistry) was used and various key operating parameters were tested (temperature, nitrogen source, CO 2 availability). The bacterial strains that dominate the culture were present in the concentrate and originated from the deposit on the mining site. Whatever the operating conditions tested, the culture composition was very stable. The iron-oxidiser Leptospirillum ferriphilum BRGM 1 was the dominant organism in standard (not limiting) conditions, and was always very well represented during the first 3 - 4 days of residence time. Sulfobacillus sp. BRGM 2 also {{played a significant role in}} the process. The role and the presence of Acidithiobacillus caldus BRGM 3 seemed of lesser importance. An increase in operating temperature from 35 °C to 45 °C had no major impact on bioleaching efficiency. When the nitrogen source was limiting, there was a negative impact on both bacterial growth and bioleaching efficiency. This was the result of a combination of factors such as less precipitate formation and decreased bacterial attachment to the pyrite surface. CO 2 limitation had a very significant negative effect on bacterial productivity and consequently on bioleaching efficiency. However, when CO 2 was a limiting factor, the population composition remained unchanged but a significant decrease in exopolysaccharide production was observed. This study gives new insights for the application of stirred tank technology to the processing of sulphide concentrates, and more specifically on the impact of key operating parameters on bioleaching performances, population dynamics and attachment of bacteria to the solid surfaces...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCorrosion {{problems}} have been encountered in reactors used in pilot plants {{for the development of}} different bacterial leaching (bioleaching) processes. A large part of this corrosion is attributable to bacterial activity, i. e. biocorrosion, and basic information is needed for a better understanding and control of this phenomenon. The bioleaching solution associated with the presence of bacteria is highly acidic and requires the use of highly corrosive-resistant steel. The selection of materials for the manufacture of industrial bioleaching reactors is difficult and random. Consequently, it is now essential to study the behavior of selected stainless steels during bioleaching in order to determine their potential suitability for industrial use. The main objective of the present study is to compare the respective resistance of two such steels to various types of corrosion and determine which of the steels is most appropriate for manufacturing reactors at an industrial scale. The corrosive medium was a solution generated during the bioleaching of a <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite,</b> where a bacterial population comprised of three species was used. Metal coupons and electrodes were made out of two grades of stainless steel and their corrosion during bioleaching was monitored by methods based on the weight loss of the coupons and on the electrochemical behavior of the stainless steel electrodes. By combining the weight loss and electrochemical results, it has been possible to show that (i) the two steels have a similar and satisfactory behavior, with a corrosion-erosion rate of less than 25 µm/year, and (ii) samples left for more than 1 month in the medium are not affected by localized corrosion, thus confirming the accelerated corrosion tests indicating the high resistance of the two stainless steels to localized corrosion...|$|E
40|$|The Shilu Fe-Co-Cu ore {{district}} {{is situated in}} the western Hainan Province of south China. This district consists of the upper Fe-rich layers and the lower Co-Cu ores, which are mainly hosted within the Neoproterozoic Shilu Group, a dominantly submarine siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary succession that generally has been metamorphosed to greenschist facies. Three facies of metamorphosed BIFs, the oxide, the silicate-oxide and the sulfide-carbonate-silicate, have been identified within the Shilu Group. The oxide banded iron formation (BIF) fades (quartz itabirites or Fe-rich ores) consists of alternating hematite-rich and quartz-rich microbands. The silicate-oxide BIF facies (amphibolitic itabirites or Fe-poor ores) comprises alternating millimeter to tens of meter scale, magnetite-hematite-rich bands with calc-silicate-rich macro- to microbands. The sulfide-carbonate-silicate BIF facies (Co-Cu ores) contain alternating <b>cobaltiferous</b> <b>pyrite,</b> cobaltiferous pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite macrobands to microbands mainly with dolomite-calcite, but also with minor sericite-quartz bands. Blasto-oolitic, pelletoidal, colloidal, psammitic, and ayptoaystalline to microaystalline textures, and blasto-bedding structures, which likely represent primary sedimentation, are often observed in the Shilu BIF facies. The Shilu BIFs and interbedded host rocks are generally characterized by relatively low but variable Sigma REE concentrations, LREE depletion and/or MREE enrichment relative to HREE, and no Ce, Gd and Eu anomalies to strongly positive Ce, Gd and Eu anomalies in the upward-convex PAAS-normalized REY patterns, except for both the banded or impure dolostones with nil Ce anomaly to negative Ce anomalies and negative La anomalies, and the minor sulfide-carbonate-silicate BIF facies with moderately negative Eu anomalies. They also contain relatively low but variable HFSE abundances as Zr, Nb, Hf, Th and Ti, and relatively high but variable abundances of Cu, Co, Ni, Pb, As, Mn and Ba. The consistently negative epsilon(Nd) (t) values range from - 4. 8 to - 8. 5, with a T-DM age of ca. 2. 0 Ga. In line with the covariations between Al 2 O 3 and TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 + FeO and SiO 2, Mn and Fe, Zr and Y/Ho and REE, and Sc and LREE, the geochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic features suggest that the precursors to the Shilu BIFs formed from a source dominated by seafloor-derived, high- to low temperature, acidic and reducing hydrothermal fluids but with variable input of detrital components in a seawater environment. Moreover, the involved detrital materials were sourced dominantly from an unknown, Paleoproterozoic or older crust, with lesser involvement from the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic Baoban Group underlying the Shilu Group. The Shilu BIFs of various fades are interpreted to have formed in a shallow marine, restricted or sheltered basin near the rifted continental margin most likely associated with the break-up of Rodinia {{as the result of}} mantle superplume activity in South China. The seafloor-derived, periodically upwelling metalliferous hydrothermal plume/vent fluids under anoxic but sulfidic to anoxic but Fe 2 +-rich conditions were removed from the plume/ vent and accumulated in the basin, and then variably mixed with terrigenous detrital components, which finally led to rhythmic deposition of the Shilu BIFs.
