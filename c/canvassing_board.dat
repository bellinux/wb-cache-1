In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion In the recount.

2500|$|Most of the post-electoral {{controversy}} {{revolved around}} Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and Volusia), as provided under Florida state law. Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (also the co-chair of George W. Bush's election efforts in Florida) announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties {{if they were}} not turned in by 5:00p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The Florida Supreme Court extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state <b>canvassing</b> <b>board,</b> while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7:00p.m., which Harris indeed rejected. On November 26, the state <b>canvassing</b> <b>board</b> certified Bush the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a concurring opinion that [...] "the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner" [...] (Bush).|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} {{of the extent to}} which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In McPherson v. Blacker, , the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 which states that a state's electors are selected [...] "in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct" [...] and wrote these words [...] "operat as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power". In Bush v. Palm Beach County <b>Canvassing</b> <b>Board,</b> , a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on McPherson. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in Bush v. Gore, , wrote: [...] "othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it." ...|$|E

5000|$|On January 12, 2009, Franken filed {{a motion}} to dismiss Coleman's contest, {{claiming}} it was [...] "an imprecise and scattershot pleading". He argued {{that even if the}} contest were to proceed, the three-judge panel should be limited to determining who would be awarded the already certified ballots and to a simple, mathematical recount to ensure the accuracy of the <b>canvassing</b> <b>board's</b> count, while no additional ballots should be reviewed. On January 22, 2009, Franken's attorneys also argued that the case should not go to trial because the U.S. Senate itself, rather than the court system, has the power under the United States Constitution to judge the election of its own members. Franken's motion to dismiss was denied by the panel on January 23.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the second}} issue, {{the court ruled}} that the {{statutory}} scheme must be interpreted in light of the Florida state constitution's declaration that [...] "all political power is inherent in the people," [...] with any ambiguities therefore construed [...] "liberally." [...] Preventing the <b>canvassing</b> <b>boards</b> from continuing to conduct recounts beyond the seven-day timeframe (specified in the law, but with ambiguity as to how firm it was intended to be), would [...] "summarily disenfranchise innocent electors voters" [...] and could not be allowed unless the recounts continued for so long as to [...] "compromise the integrity of the electoral process." [...] The court ordered counties to submit returns by November 26, until which time the stay of certification would stand.|$|R
50|$|Some {{media reports}} focused on undervotes (chad blocked hole, wrong ink or pencil used, partial oval mark not detected, {{humidity}} affected scanner, ballot feeder misalignment), while others also included overvotes (hole punched or oval filled plus a write-in name, other multi-marked ballots). A larger consortium of news organizations, including USA Today, The Miami Herald, Knight Ridder, The Tampa Tribune, {{and five other}} newspapers next conducted a full recount of all machine-rejected ballots, including both undervotes and overvotes. The organization analyzed 171,908 ballots (60,647 undervotes and 111,261 overvotes), 3102 less than the later NORC study. According to their results, Bush won under stricter standards and Gore won under looser standards. A Gore win was impossible without a recount of overvotes, {{which he did not}} request; however, faxes between Judge Terry Lewis and the <b>canvassing</b> <b>boards</b> throughout the state indicated that Lewis, who oversaw the recount effort, intended to have overvotes counted.|$|R

As rival militia units converged on the state capital in Madison, threatening to start a civil war within the state, Barstow was inaugurated in a full, public ceremony on January 7, 1856.
