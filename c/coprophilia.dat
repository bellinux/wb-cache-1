25|$|On 21 January 2006, Oaten {{resigned}} from the Liberal Democrat front bench when it was revealed by the News of the World that he had hired a 23-year-old male prostitute between the summer of 2004 and February 2005. The newspaper also alleged that Oaten had engaged in 'three-in-a-bed' sex sessions with two male prostitutes. Further allegations surfaced in the media over the following days, including an accusation that he had {{asked one of the}} prostitutes to engage in an act of <b>coprophilia.</b>|$|E
500|$|A doctor prescribes Prozac, a {{real life}} antidepressant, to Kyle for his {{apparent}} love for feces, which he describes as [...] "fecalphilia", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term <b>coprophilia.</b> Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference." [...] The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} Corey Taylor as lead vocalist; he {{had previously}} appeared on their second demo, which, in turn, resulted in them signing to Roadrunner Records. Rick Anderson of AllMusic noted that on [...] "Scissors", Taylor [...] "actually sounds like he's about to burst into tears. Taylor's aggressive, expletive-filled lyrics were noted by AllMusic; [...] " [...] lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website; {{suffice it to say}} that the members of Slipknot are not impressed with their fathers, their hometown or most anything else." [...] "Eeyore", a hidden track placed at the end of [...] "Scissors", begins after dialogue shared among the band members that was recorded while they were viewing a scene in a pornographic film that involved <b>coprophilia,</b> is heard. It has been played live many times and appears on both the DVD Disasterpieces and the live album [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1943, the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) {{received}} A Psychological Analysis of Adolf Hitler: His Life and Legend by Walter C. Langer, commissioned [...] to {{help the}} Allies understand the dictator. The report, later expanded into book form as [...] (1972), describes Hitler as having repressed homosexual tendencies and states {{that he was an}} impotent coprophile. Psychologist Henry Murray wrote a separate psychoanalytical report for OSS also in 1943, entitled Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler: With Predictions of His Future Behavior and Suggestions for Dealing with Him Now and After Germany's Surrender. He also dealt with Hitler's alleged <b>coprophilia,</b> but overall diagnosed Hitler a schizophrenic. One of Hitler's opponents in the Nazi Party, Otto Strasser, told OSS interrogators that the Nazi dictator forced Geli Raubal to urinate and defecate on him. Kershaw contends that stories circulated by Strasser as to alleged [...] "sexual deviant practices ought to be viewed as... anti-Hitler propaganda".|$|E
2500|$|The {{first of}} four {{rebuttal}} witnesses was Menas Gregory, the former manager of the Bellevue psychiatric hospital, where Fish was treated during 1930. He testified that Fish was abnormal but sane. Under cross examination, Dempsey asked if <b>coprophilia,</b> urophilia and pedophilia indicated a sane or insane person. Gregory replied that such a person was not [...] "mentally sick" [...] and that these were common perversions that were [...] "socially perfectly alright" [...] and that Fish was [...] "no different from millions of other people", some very prominent and successful, who suffered from the [...] "very same" [...] perversions. The next witness was the resident physician at The Tombs, Perry Lichtenstein. Dempsey objected to a doctor with no training in psychiatry testifying {{on the issue of}} sanity, but Justice Close overruled on the basis that the jury could decide what weight to give a prison doctor. When asked whether Fish's causing himself pain indicated a mental condition, Lichtenstein replied, [...] "That is not masochism", as he was only [...] "punishing himself to get sexual gratification". The next witness, Charles Lambert, testified that <b>coprophilia</b> was a common practice and that religious cannibalism may be psychopathic but [...] "was a matter of taste" [...] and not evidence of a psychosis. The last witness, James Vavasour, repeated Lambert's opinion. Another defense witness was Mary Nicholas, Fish's 17-year-old stepdaughter. She described how Fish taught her and her brothers and sisters several games involving overtones of masochism and child molestation.|$|E
2500|$|Robert G. L. Waite, a psychohistorian at Williams College, {{has been}} working towards an {{interdisciplinary}} exploration of Nazism since 1949, combining historiographical and psychoanalytic methods. In 1977, he published his study The Psychopathic God in which he took the view that Hitler's career {{can not be understood}} without considering his pathological personality. Waite assumed that Hitler suffered from schizotypal personality disorder, a condition that at that time was referred to as “borderline personality disorder”. The term received its present meaning only {{at the end of the}} 1970s. Until then, “borderline personality disorder” referred to a disorder in the border area of neurosis and schizophrenia, for which Gregory Zilboorg had also coined the term [...] "ambulatory schizophrenia". As cues that Hitler had this condition, Waite specified Hitler’s Oedipus complex, his infantile phantasy, his volatile inconsistency and his alleged <b>coprophilia</b> and urolagnia. Waite’s view partially corresponds with that of the Vienna psychiatrist and Buchenwald survivor Ernest A. Rappaport, who already in 1975 had called Hitler an [...] "ambulatory schizophrenic".|$|E
2500|$|The {{word has}} a {{distinguished}} Indo-European parentage, which may perhaps relate to nursery words or children's slang {{that tends to}} recur across many different cultures. It {{would appear to be}} cognate with the Greek noun , kopros, meaning [...] "poop" [...] (hence, <b>coprophilia).</b> The use as a profanity and an insult in Greek has a long history, with Constantine V (718-775 AD) being named Kopronymos ("dung-named") by his political opponents. It also exists in Germanic; in German, Swedish (kack), Scots (as both noun and verb, cack or cackie, the diminutive), whilst English [...] "poppiecock" [...] derives from Dutch pappe kak, [...] "diarrhea". [...] It exists in Turkish (kaka), Irish and Scottish Gaelic (cac), Hebrew, Hungarian, Ukrainian (какати), Russian, Lithuanian and Persian/Esphehani accent (keke). In British English, [...] "caca" [...] is occasionally used as childish slang for excrement (similar to American English [...] "poop"), a word whose level of obscene loading varies from country to country; whilst in Scotland and in Ireland, [...] "cack" [...] is occasionally used either as a mild interjection, or as an impolite adjective to mean of poor quality, broken, nonsense. It also exists as a loan in Finnish (kakka). The derivatives of this Latin word appear in Spanish, Catalan, Portuguese, Italian (cacca), Romanian, and French.|$|E
2500|$|Many songs tell a {{story about}} Hitler {{one way or the}} other, for example [...] "Gotterdammerung" [...] by Stratovarius {{directly}} mentions the history of Hitler and the Nazi regime. Bowie has also been quoted saying [...] "Hitler was the first rock star" [...] and, at one time, wanted to direct a film based on the life of Heinrich Himmler. [...] "Heads We're Dancing" [...] by Kate Bush {{tells the story of a}} woman who dances all night with a charming stranger, only to discover the following morning that he is Adolf Hitler. Texas Groove metal band Pantera wrote and recorded a song called [...] "By Demons Be Driven". It tells the story of how Hitler was plagued by paranoia and began to hate the Jewish people and religion. Australian band TISM's debut single was [...] "Defecate on My Face", which was about Adolf Hitler's supposed <b>coprophilia.</b> Australian comedy troupe the Doug Anthony Allstars had a song called [...] "Mexican Hitler", which told the story of what Hitler would have been like if he was born Mexican. It made an appearance in their television show, DAAS Kapital. The song [...] "Hitler as Kalki" [...] by apocalyptic folk band Current 93 makes use of Savitri Devi's idea that Hitler was an avatar of the Hindu god Kalki. [...] "Two Little Hitlers" [...] by Elvis Costello, superficially a song about a loveless couple but reportedly a real-life reflection of the relationship between the singer and his producer Nick Lowe (who had previously recorded a song entitled [...] "Little Hitler", the similarities leading to speculations about the origins of the later song) on the album Armed Forces. Antony and the Johnsons have released the song [...] "Hitler in My Heart" [...] on their debut in which the term [...] "Hitler" [...] is generally used as a metaphore for the bad within oneself - likewise in the song [...] "Crack Hitler" [...] by Faith No More from Angel Dust.|$|E

5000|$|The Cleveland steamer is a colloquial {{term for}} a form of <b>coprophilia,</b> where someone defecates on their partner's chest.|$|E
50|$|According to {{psychologist}} Anil Aggrawal, it is {{a synonym}} for a Cleveland steamer and {{is part of a}} <b>coprophilia</b> vocabulary that also includes the Dirty Sanchez.|$|E
50|$|The song {{could not}} be played on radio until 1993, because of the lyrical content {{included}} extensive references to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler his mistress, Eva Braun, and <b>coprophilia.</b>|$|E
50|$|She {{published}} articles on insomnia and sublimation, {{as well as}} contributing {{to the analysis of}} <b>coprophilia,</b> and to the fantasy of being part of the partner's body in sexual submission.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike <b>coprophilia</b> or coprophagy, coprophobia {{appears to}} be unknown in the animal world, with the {{exception}} of humans. In fact, the attitude to feces and defecation has become a cultural taboo.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the {{description}} is tasteless and ribald. The {{goal is to}} significantly transgress social norms. Taboo acts such as incest, rape, child sexual abuse, <b>coprophilia,</b> coprophagia, bestiality, necrophilia and murder are common themes.|$|E
50|$|It {{is related}} to wet and messy fetishism, bukkake, omorashi, mysophilia, urolagnia and <b>coprophilia,</b> but extends to other areas such as forcing the partner to wear torn or poorly fitting {{clothing}} and other actions which would render them normally unattractive.|$|E
5000|$|These nine letters ... throw a psychologically very {{remarkable}} {{light on}} his erotic nature, which, more so than any other important man, has elements of infantilism and <b>coprophilia.</b> It would actually be a very interesting study for one of your pupils.|$|E
50|$|A {{buttocks}} fetish or buttocks partialism {{refers to}} a condition wherein the buttocks becomes a primary focus of sexual attention. It may be associated with <b>coprophilia,</b> panty fetishism, eproctophilia, and sadomasochistic corporal punishment involving the buttocks. Pygophilia refers to sexual arousal caused by the buttocks.|$|E
50|$|A fetish for bodily fluids such as feces, urine, vomit, semen, {{and female}} {{ejaculate}} {{is not considered}} part of WAM. The former three are typically considered <b>coprophilia,</b> urophilia, and emetophilia; urophilia is somewhat commonly found in mainstream pornography. The latter two are also somewhat mainstream.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there may}} be no {{connection}} between <b>coprophilia</b> and sadomasochism (SM), the limited data on the former comes from studies of the latter. A study of 164 males in Finland from two SM clubs found that 18.2% had engaged in coprophilia; 3% as a sadist, 6.1% as a masochist, and 9.1% as both. 18% of heterosexuals and 17% of homosexuals in the study pool had tried <b>coprophilia,</b> showing no statistically significant difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals. In a separate article analyzing 12 men who engaged in bestiality, an additional analysis of an 11-man subgroup revealed that 6 had engaged in coprophilic behavior, compared with only 1 in the matched control group consisting of 12 SM-oriented males who did not engage in bestiality.|$|E
50|$|In sexual fetishism, scatology (usually {{abbreviated}} scat) {{refers to}} <b>coprophilia,</b> {{when a person}} is sexually aroused by fecal matter, whether in the use of feces in various sexual acts, watching someone defecating, or simply seeing the feces. Entire subcultures in sexuality are devoted to this fetish.|$|E
50|$|The DSM-III-R (1987) {{renamed the}} broad {{category}} to sexual disorders, renamed atypical paraphilia to paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), renamed transvestism as transvestic fetishism, added frotteurism, and moved zoophilia to the NOS category. It also provided seven nonexhaustive examples of NOS paraphilias, which besides zoophilia included telephone scatologia, necrophilia, partialism, <b>coprophilia,</b> klismaphilia, and urophilia.|$|E
50|$|Greenacre {{highlighted}} the voyeuristic {{elements in the}} writing of Lewis Carroll, as well as distortions of body image with respect to Lemuel Gulliver. She viewed Swift as essentially a neurotic inhibited by <b>coprophilia</b> who came close achieving adult, genital satisfaction. Carroll, on the other hand, she argues, is closer to psychotic and psychically more deeply blocked.|$|E
50|$|In common parlance, {{the word}} fetish {{is used to}} refer to any sexually arousing stimuli, not all of which meet the medical {{criteria}} for fetishism. This broader usage of fetish covers parts or features of the body (including obesity and body modifications), objects, situations and activities (such as smoking or BDSM). Paraphilias such as urophilia, necrophilia and <b>coprophilia</b> have been described as fetishes.|$|E
50|$|Pope Francis criticized {{disinformation}} in a 2016 interview, {{after being}} made {{the subject of}} a fake news website - during the 2016 U.S. election cycle he was falsely said to support Donald Trump. He said the worst thing the news media could do was spread disinformation, that it was a sin, comparing those who spread disinformation to individuals who engage in <b>coprophilia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The idea of Hitler's <b>coprophilia</b> {{was first}} {{suggested}} in The Mind of Adolf Hitler, a psychological analysis prepared in 1943 for the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) by psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer. One of the report's conclusions was that Hitler had [...] "coprophagic tendencies or their milder manifestations" [...] in his heterosexual relationships, and masochistically derived [...] "sexual gratification from {{the act of}} having a woman urinate or defecate on him." ...|$|E
50|$|Facesitting {{is common}} among {{dominant}} and submissive individuals, for demonstrating superiority and for sexual gratification. Unlike smothering, in facesitting the bottom partner is not deprived of air. The full-weight body-pressure, moisture, body odors, and darkness can {{be perceived as}} powerful sexual attractions or compulsions. The person sat upon may be in bondage, sexually submissive, or simply held down by the body-weight of the other person. In some cases, the submissive will consume the dominant's bodily waste(s) (urolagnia and <b>coprophilia).</b>|$|E
50|$|The film {{created a}} storm of {{controversy}} upon its release, with scenes of <b>coprophilia,</b> emetophilia, implied child molestation, and footage of remains of the Polish Katyn Massacre victims. The film was banned in many countries, including the United Kingdom, or severely cut; it is still banned in many countries to this day. Polish authorities banned Prucnal from using her passport over the film, which effectively banned her from entering her native country {{for a number of}} years.|$|E
5000|$|Ssempa has {{advocated}} a cessation of tribal rivalries and hatred in Uganda. He {{is a strong}} advocate of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill that includes {{the death penalty for}} gay men and lesbians. Ssempa champions the bill by showing gay pornography, depicting fisting, anilingus, and <b>coprophilia</b> in his church and at conferences, widely publicised and circulated on the internet as [...] "Eat Da Poo Poo". US President Barack Obama has referred to the bill as [...] "odious".|$|E

5000|$|The joke {{involves}} a person pitching an act to a talent agent. Typically {{the first line}} is, [...] "A man walks into a talent agent's office." [...] The man then describes the act. From this point, up to (but not including) the punchline, the teller of the joke is expected to ad-lib the most shocking act they can possibly imagine. This often involves elements of incest, group sex, graphic violence, defecation, <b>coprophilia,</b> necrophilia, bestiality, child sexual abuse, and various other taboo behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{listed by}} the DSM-5 are {{telephone}} scatologia, necrophilia, zoophilia, <b>coprophilia,</b> klismaphilia, and urophilia. Partialism {{was considered a}} Paraphilia NOS in the DSM-IV, but was subsumed into fetishistic disorder by the DSM-5. In order to be diagnosable, the interest must be recurrent and intense, present {{for at least six}} months, and cause marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning. When a specific paraphilia cannot be identified or the clinician chooses not to specify it for some other reason, the Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder diagnosis may be used instead.|$|E
