"Blue Skies" [...] {{was chosen}} as the album's first single, being {{released}} on February 28 exclusively on some news sites where Lenka commented on the song, her inspirations and news about the new album. On March 4 it was officially released on all digital platforms. The music video was released on March 10 on her YouTube channel. Directed and idealized by her husband James Gulliver Hancock, the production shows Lenka cycling through the city and lying on the green grass of the yard looking at the clouds in the sky and interpreting the song. In some scenes the clouds take the form of letters, hands, hearts and raindrops. Lenka also appears jumping in a tranpoline at various times.On May 29, a remix version of the song was released on a YouTube remix <b>channel,</b> <b>Trap</b> Nation, indirectly helping to promote the single. On January 9 Lenka released an EP of remixes of Blue Skies as a gift for their fans and to celebrate the new year.|$|E

40|$|Store-operated Ca 2 + entry depends {{critically}} {{on physical}} interactions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca 2 + sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM 1) and the Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + (CRAC) channel protein Orai 1. Recent studies support a diffusion-trap mechanism in which ER Ca 2 + depletion causes STIM 1 to accumulate at ER-plasma membrane (PM) junctions, where it binds to Orai 1, trapping and activating mobile CRAC channels in the overlying PM. To determine the stoichiometric requirements for CRAC <b>channel</b> <b>trapping</b> and activation, we expressed mCherry-STIM 1 and Orai 1 -GFP at varying ratios in HEK cells and quantified CRAC current (ICRAC) activation and the STIM 1 :Orai 1 ratio at ER-PM junctions after store depletion. By competing {{for a limited}} amount of STIM 1, high levels of Orai 1 reduced the junctional STIM 1 :Orai 1 ratio to a lower limit of 0. 3 – 0. 6, indicating that binding of one to two STIM 1 s is sufficient to immobilize the tetrameric CRAC channel at ER-PM junctions. In cells expressing a constant amount of STIM 1, CRAC current was a highly nonlinear bell-shaped function of Orai 1 expression and the minimum stoichiometry for <b>channel</b> <b>trapping</b> failed to evoke significant activation. Peak current occurred at a ratio of ∼ 2 STIM 1 :Orai 1, suggesting that maximal CRAC channel activity requires binding of eight STIM 1 s to each channel. Further increases in Orai 1 caused channel activity and fast Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation to decline in parallel. The data are well described by a model in which STIM 1 binds to Orai 1 with negative cooperativity and channels open with positive cooperativity as a result of stabilization of the open state by STIM 1...|$|R

In November 1996, a jökulhlaup triggered by a subglacial eruption and produced a catastrophic flood which incised the Skeiðarársandur. Those incised <b>channels</b> <b>trap</b> currently part of the wind transport (essentially the transport by saltation). Measures of the dominant orientations of the vegetation and petrographical analysis of the aeolian deposits provide us the opportunity to geographically delimit the blownout areas. Thus, with the ratio of (1) the loess deposit volume accumulated in the jökulhlaup channels since 1996 and (2) the blownout land surfaces, a minimum deflation rate for the east part of the Skeiðarársandur is calculated.

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} theoretically {{that it is}} possible to use the resonant coupling of exciton-polaritons in a planar microcavity and Tamm plasmons at a metal film on the surface of the structure to provide lateral spatial control of the exciton-polaritons within the cavity. The resonant coupling of the Tamm plasmons to cavity exciton-polaritons results in a triplet of hybrid plasmon–exciton-polariton modes with the lowest at a significantly lower energy than that of the unperturbed exciton-polaritons. Further, a patterned metal film on the structure surface can provide a sufficiently large lateral modulation of the excitation energy that localization of the exciton-polaritons within chosen regions of the cavity is possible. We show how the approach opens the way to a practical demonstration of polariton <b>channels,</b> <b>traps,</b> and devices, including logic gates. ...|$|R

Results showed that addition of copper nanoparticles reduces the pressure gradient, axial velocity at the center of <b>channel,</b> <b>trapping</b> and temperature. Velocity slip parameter has a decreasing effect on the velocity near the center of channel. Temperature of nanofluid increases with increase in the Grashoff number and channel inclination angle.

40|$|Communication in {{the nervous}} system takes place at {{chemical}} and electrical synapses, where neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor, and gap junction channels control propagation of electrical signals from one cell to the next. Newly developed electron crystallographic methods have revealed the structures of these <b>channels</b> <b>trapped</b> in open as well as closed states, suggesting how they work. The ACh receptor has large vestibules extending from the membrane which shape the ACh-binding pockets and facilitate selective transport of cations across a narrow membrane-spanning pore. When ACh enters the pockets it triggers a concerted conformational change that opens the pore by destabilizing a gate {{in the middle of}} the membrane made by a ring of pore-lining alpha-helical segmets. The alternative 'open' configuration of pore-lining segments reshapes the lumen and creates new surfaces, allowing the ions to pass through. The gap junction channel uses a similar structural mechanism, involving coordinated rearrangements of alpha-helical segments in the plane of the membrane, to open its pore...|$|R
50|$|Cell fate is {{regulated}} by both interactions between stem cells and interactions between stem cells and membrane proteins. Manipulating cell seeding density {{is a common}} biological technique in controlling cell-cell interactions, but controlling local density is difficult and {{it is often difficult}} to decouple effects between soluble signals in the medium and physical cell-cell interactions. Micropatterning of cell adhesion proteins can be used in defining the spatial positions of different cells on a substrate to study human ESC proliferation. Seeding stem cells into PDMS microwells and flipping them onto a substrate or another cell layer is a method of achieving precise spatial control. Gap junction communications has also been studied using microfluidics whereby negative pressure generated by fluid flow in side channels flanking a central <b>channel</b> <b>traps</b> pairs of cells that are in direct contact or separated by a small gap. However, in general, the non-zero motility and short cell cycle time of stem cells often disrupt the spatial organization imposed by these microtechnologies.|$|R

Single cell characterization {{could be related to}} many significant applications including early disease diagnosis. However to perform the single cell manipulation, firstly a single cell have to be isolated and a platform for the cell manipulation have to be provided. One of the methods to trap a single cell is by using hydrodynamic trapping in the microfluidic channel. This study provides a finite element model for single cell trapping for a yeast cell model. The objectives of the simulations are to obtain the appropriate channels' geometry and optimized ratio of the fluid's inlet and suction flow rate to trap a single yeast cell. <b>Trap</b> <b>channel</b> was designed to trap a 5 μm yeast cell with a suction hole placed in the end of the <b>trap</b> <b>channel.</b> Design geometry and the ratio of fluid flow rates for the cell trapping model were studied using the hydrodynamic resistance concept.

40|$|We present {{simultaneous}} near-field photoluminescence (PL) and Raman imaging of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with {{a spatial}} resolution better than 15 nm. Highly localized excitation {{is used to}} visualize the spatial extent of the contributing excited states. For SWNTs on glass, we typically observe highly confined PL from short segments of about 20 nm in length. The PL from micelle-encapsulated SWNTs on mica is extended along the tube up to several hundreds of nanometers. We find that near-field enhancement is much stronger for photoluminescence than for Raman scattering, an observation that is explained by the low intrinsic quantum yield of SWNTs. Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are photoluminescent quasi-one-dimensional quantum wires with great promise for application in photonics and optoand nanoelectronics. A widespread utilization in optical devices, however, appears to be constrained by their low effective photoluminescence quantum yield which, being {{on the order of}} 10 - 3 to 10 - 4, 1, 2 indicates that the excited state relaxation is dominated by very efficient nonradiative decay <b>channels.</b> <b>Trapping</b> of excitons at impurity sites or a...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{systematic}} study of the random telegraph signal (RTS) fluctuations in submicron W-array n metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (nMOSFETs) are presented and analysed. These results include the dependency of the RTS amplitude and of the capture and emission time constants, measured both in the standard transistor and in the diode configuration, on the gate, drain and substrate voltage. For the latter configuration, the drain-substrate (or source-substrate); diode of the transistor is forward biased. Application of this technique for measuring RTS noise allows us to distinguish the drain (source) traps from the well-known <b>channel</b> <b>traps.</b> It is found that besides the classical channel-related RTSs, another type occurs which is associated with lateral isolation related (or edge-related) oxide defects, located near the drain or the source contact.

The specific properties of such RTSs are studied in detail, as they may reveal useful information on their identification. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
