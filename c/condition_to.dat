5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical <b>condition,</b> <b>to</b> hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical <b>condition,</b> <b>to</b> display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

5|$|After José Antonio Camacho led Benfica {{to second}} place, the club {{offered him a}} new two-year {{contract}} as manager in June. As a <b>condition</b> <b>to</b> renewing the contract, Camacho requested that the club sign more established players, but budget restraints allowed for limited investment. After several unsuccessful player bids, Benfica added Luisão to the squad and re-signed Geovanni in August. Because their second-place finish only granted a berth in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, Benfica had to play Lazio for {{a spot in the}} group stage. They lost both legs and were relegated to the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|After {{this day}} of fierce fighting, which has been {{described}} as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division's advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no <b>condition</b> <b>to</b> remain within reach of this strong and aggressive enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether, like fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders, fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> angry faces resists extinction even after verbal instruction and {{removal of the}} shock electrode. Participants were trained in a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure with angry face or happy face conditional stimuli (CSs). Prior to extinction, half the participants in each group were informed that no more unconditional stimuli would be presented and the shock electrode was removed. In the absence of this manipulation, participants showed resistance to extinction after training with angry face CSs, but not after training with happy face CSs. Instructed extinction and electrode removal abolished fear conditioning regardless of the emotion expressed by the CS faces. This finding suggests that fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> angry faces, like fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> racial out-group faces, is more malleable than fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> snakes and spiders...|$|R

5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma.

There were initial archaeological excavations on the site in 1925, and then further work in 1970-71, 1993, 2007 and 2009.

40|$|Prepared {{learning}}, {{learning that}} is selective, resistant to extinction, evident after one trial, and encapsulated from cognition, {{is said to}} underlie animal and social phobias (O¨ hman, 2009). Resistance to extinction has been shown for fears <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders and to pictures of faces of threatening conspecifics (angry faces or faces that look different – other race faces). However, whereas fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders is encapsulated from cognition, fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of other race faces is not (Mallan et al., 2009). The present study investigated whether fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of angry faces is encapsulated from cognition. Two groups of participants were trained in a differential Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure with angry face or happy face conditional stimuli (CSs). Prior to extinction, half the participants in each group were informed that no more unconditional stimuli would be presented. In the absence of verbal instruction, participants showed resistance to extinction after training with angry face CSs, but not after training with happy face CSs. Instructed extinction abolished differential fear conditioning regardless of the emotion expressed by the CS faces. This finding suggests that unlike fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of snakes and spiders, but similar <b>to</b> fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of other race faces, fear <b>conditioned</b> <b>to</b> pictures of angry faces is malleable by cognition...|$|R

The FPV was renamed as the Citizen's Unity Party at the province and registered as a coalition of minor parties only, leaving the PJ out of it. As a result, both parties would run to the elections as unrelated parties.|$|E

It was not until the 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E

40|$|According to Jamie Whyte, {{the proper}} {{assignment}} of fulfillment <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> an agent’s set of desires proceeds in three steps. First, one identifies various desire extinction and behavioural reinforcement <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> obtain the fulfillment conditions {{of a certain}} subset of the agent’s desires. With these fulfillment conditions in hand, one then appeals to a principle connecting desire fulfillment conditions with belief truth <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> obtain the truth conditions {{of a number of}} the agent’s beliefs. Finally, one uses these belief truth <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> generate, via a third principle, the fulfillment conditions for the remaining desires. There is, however, a very straightforward reason why this strategy cannot yield the required results. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Oslo Sporveier {{decided to}} {{transfer}} all the remaining trams to Bærumsbanen. Their high speed made them well suited on the light rail, but the centre door reduced their capacity. The order of the SM53-series from Høka gave Oslo Sporveier sufficient stock to operate the street lines, and from 1952 to 1957, the company transferred the 19 trams to Bærumsbanen. Here, they were given the designation Class E. No. 163 was in too bad <b>condition</b> <b>to</b> be used on the line, and was retired.
