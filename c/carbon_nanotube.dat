40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the electrochemical performances of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> and tube-in-tube <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> reveals a dependence effect of lithium-ion storage behavior on the detailed nanostructure of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> In particular, the impurity that graphitic particles or graphene fragments inherently present in <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> {{plays a crucial role}} in the lithium-ion storage capacity of the <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> Compared to acid-washed <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes,</b> the assembly of graphitic impurity fragments in the tube-in-tube structures hinders lithium-ion diffusion, thus drastically decreasing the rate performance of lithium-ion storage.

5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials {{in the past two decades}} (e.g. graphene, <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube,</b> boron nitride nanomesh).|$|E
5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotube</b> can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, encapsulation allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, encapsulation of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E

The effects of surface modification of multiwalled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> on crystallization behavior, mechanical properties, and electrical properties of low density polyethylene/polyolefin elastomer/multiwalled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> composites were studied. The results showed that NaDDBS, KH 550, and NDZ 101 had a favorable effect of improving the dispersion of multiwalled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes,</b> but it cannot improve the interfacial interaction between multiwalled <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> and the matrix.

A diblock polyelectrolyte with methacrylic acid containing block and pyrene pendant block was synthesized by RAFT polymerization. The pyrene pendant block anchored {{on the surface}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> while the methacrylic acid containing block dissolved in methanol to disperse individual <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> The dispersed <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> have shown morphological responsive towards substrates with pyridine groups and amino groups on surface. The thickness of functionalized <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> on these substrates increased from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers due to the swelling of the methacrylic acid containing block. The methacrylic acid units were deprotonated by pyridine groups and amino groups on the surface so the polymer chains in the methacrylic acid containing block stretched into rigid rod structure leading to the swelling effect. A polythiophene-based conjugated polyelectrolyte with positive quaternary ammonium species on its side chains was synthesized by GRIM polymerization. The self-assembly behaviors of this conjugated polyelectrolyte in solvents with different polarities led to solvatochromism and different efficiencies for dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes.</b> The efficiency of this conjugated polyelectrolyte for the dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>nanotubes</b> was highest when no aggregation was formed.
