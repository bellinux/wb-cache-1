However, those 2 million who do not receive subsidies face the brunt of the 20%+ premium increases, without subsidy assistance. This may adversely impact enrollment in 2018 and beyond. Another 13 million who are covered under the ACA's Medicaid expansion (in the 31 states that chose to expand coverage) should not be directly affected by Trump's action.|$|E
25|$|President Trump's {{decision}} in November 2017 {{to end the}} cost sharing reductions subsidy, a second type of subsidy used to reduce deductibles and co-payments, was expected to increase premiums dramatically, thereby increasing the premium tax credits as well to maintain after-subsidy costs to participants {{at the same percentage}} of income. In other words, the after-subsidy cost would not rise for those with premium tax <b>credit</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Those obtaining their insurance via the exchanges without subsidies would pay up to 20 percentage points more for insurance. CBO also estimated a $200 billion increase in the budget deficit over a decade due to Trump's decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{liberalisation}} {{of economy}} {{was intended to}} end the government subsidiaries and to reduce {{the role of the}} government in national economy. Successful attempts were carried out by Sharif to expand the role of the private sector, and to redress the imbalances in social services.

This was followed by the liberalisation of the foreign exchange which was readily free, and at the same time, the interest rates were substantially liberalised, <b>credit</b> <b>subsidies</b> were cut, and energy prices were moved much closer to costs. The economic liberalisation and structural reform measures were necessary and had been overdue at that time. However, instead of being pursued with even greater vigor and effectiveness, the liberalisation programme could not substitute for adequate stabilization efforts and macroeconomic stability. By the end of 1993 which was the year of ousting the government of Nawaz Sharif, the benefits from economic liberalisation were seriously limited in the absence of reduction of effective macroeconomic policies. As it grappled with the ongoing foreign exchange crisis in early 1993–97, Pakistan’s most urgent economic need was to raise both national savings and exports.|$|E

In fiscal year 2001, FHA provided guarantees for all multifamily projects [...] regardless of program [...] on a first-come, first-served basis until the total budget authority for the multifamily programs was exhausted. FHA had obligated $ 81 million of the $ 101 million of its <b>credit</b> <b>subsidy</b> budget authority {{for the fiscal year}} by April 2001 and suspended issuing commitments for additional loans. FHA obligated most of its fiscal year 2001 subsidy budget authority by April 2001 because of unexpectedly high demand [...] five times FHA's estimate [...] for mortgage insurance under the Section 221 (d) (3) Program, which is limited to nonprofit developers and cooperatives and has a higher subsidy rate than do other programs. FHA has taken steps to avoid this situation in the future. When most of the fiscal year 2001 <b>credit</b> <b>subsidy</b> budget authority was obligated, FHA placed several multifamily projects on a waiting list until funding became available. Most of these projects were funded using the remaining budget authority and <b>credit</b> <b>subsidy</b> from projects approved earlier that were later terminated or required less subsidy than expected. FHA estimates the total dollar amount of mortgages it expects to insure each year {{on the basis of the}} last year's levels. These estimates are then adjusted for inflation, the capacity of the field offices to process loan applications, and any changes or proposed changes to the programs. GAO found that the estimation process and types of data used to calculate the fiscal year 2002 <b>credit</b> <b>subsidy</b> rates for these programs were reasonable and complied with existing guidance from the Office of Management and Budget and federal accounting standards. The fiscal year 2002 <b>credit</b> <b>subsidy</b> rate calculations reflect several changes from the fiscal year 2001 calculations, including an annual premium increase for the Section 221 (d) (4) Program, an anticipated increase in the use of the note sales program to dispose of acquired 221 (d) (3) loans, and a change in the mix of loans included in the estimation process for the Section 241 (a) Program. ...|$|R

Even though they seem to promote the rise of new bank firm relationships, subsidies have a relatively small effect on the total amount of borrowing when granted to existing clients. We also find evidence of a spillover effect of subsidies on non-subsidised interest rates, which is suggestive of possible rent-seeking activities undertaken by banks and their targeted borrowers.
