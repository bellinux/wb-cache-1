500|$|The most {{divergent}} {{views were}} expressed about Puck and Beiste's performance of [...] "Mean". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post asked, [...] "How {{could you not}} be moved by their duet in the auditorium?" [...] E! Online's Jenna Mullins called it [...] "one {{of the highlights of}} the season", and Slezak gave it a grade of [...] "A". Chaney's [...] "B+" [...] followed her statement that [...] "it was more effective than Swift's version because I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> both Puck and Beiste have had it rough", and Strecker described it as [...] "lovely and thematically perfect" [...] and gave it a [...] "B". VanDerWerff said he [...] "could have done without" [...] their duet, and Futterman was even harsher: [...] "it was quite unfortunate". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson wrote that he [...] "sort of liked" [...] how the pair were [...] "simultaneously improving upon and butchering a Taylor Swift song", and Saskin characterized it as [...] "heartfelt and passionate".|$|E
500|$|Ramanujan {{departed}} from Madras aboard the S.S. Nevasa on 17 March 1914. When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville {{was waiting for}} him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk from Hardy's room. Hardy and Littlewood began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120 theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs. Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he's at least a Jacobi", while Hardy said he [...] "can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E

Indeed, one <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these stamps, {{due to the}} poor quality of their {{printing}} for some of them, were plate-proofs done by the Greek printers to initiate themselves to these new technics... But the stamps demand {{was so strong that}} the Greek postal administration decided to use them for regular postal service anyway... for the joy of the future philatelists.|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{the middle}} of Sumatra, there is a spacious and {{extensive}} lake (presumably Lake Toba near Pannai), around the shore of which many and several ethnic groups settle, [...] from where, in the past, there was a forced exodus of inhabitants [...] to sail to and to settle in various islands. One of these ethnic groups was subjugated there and {{they were unable to}} flee for various circumstances. Someone speaking pampango (which I heard before) found out that they were not speaking pampango among themselves, but they (the Malays of Sumatra) donned the old pampango ethnic costume. And when he addressed an old man among them, the [...] replied: You are descendants of the lost, that in times past left this place to settle in other lands, and nothing was heard about them again." [...] So, Colin concluded that the Tagalogs and Pampangos, and other political or ethnic groups (meaning: Visayans and other relatively civilized groups), by symbols used in expressing language, by color of dress and costume, one <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> these came from parts of Borneo and Sumatra.|$|E
2500|$|... "My lack {{of fear of}} this barbaric {{methodology}} of death, I rely upon my faith. It {{has nothing to do}} with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E
