D. thesis {{represents}} a summative report detailing research processes and outcomes from investigating the ultimate and serviceability limit state short- and long-term behaviour {{and design of}} timber-concrete composite floors. The project enables the realization of a semi-prefabricated LVL-concrete composite floor system of up to 15 m long using 3 types of connection. Design span tables which satisfy the ultimate and serviceability limit state short- and long-term verifications for this system form the novel contribution of this thesis. In quantifying the behaviour of timber-concrete composite floors, 5 different experimental phases have been carried. 9 major achievements in meeting 9 sub-objectives have been concluded: 1) 	Three best types of connection system for timber-concrete composite floors have been identified; 2) 	The characteristic strength and secant slip moduli for these connections have been determined; 3) 	The short-term behaviour of the selected connections defined by their pre- and post-peak responses under collapse load has been established; 4) 	An analytical model for the strength evaluation of the selected connections based on the different possible modes of failure has been derived; 5) 	Easy and fast erected semi-prefabricated timber-concrete composite floor has been proposed; 6) 	The short-term ultimate and serviceability limit state behaviour of timber-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> under collapse load has been investigated; 7) 	The long-term behaviour of chosen connections defined by their creep coefficient has been determined; 8) 	The long-term behaviour of timber-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> under sustained load at serviceability limit state condition has been investigated; and 9) 	Design example and span tables for semi-prefabricated timber-concrete composite floors that satisfy both the ultimate and serviceability limit state in the short- and long-term using the gamma-method have been developed...|$|E

This paper reports {{the results of a}} two years long-term test on two 6 m span <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> made of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) under service load performed in an indoor, semi-controlled, and unheated environment. The environmental conditions were characterized by artificially induced cyclic air humidity with quasi-constant temperature.

40|$|The {{growth of}} world {{population}} {{will be the}} challenge of the century regarding the carbon footprints. The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is {{to solve the problem of}} meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded nut bolt shear connector in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the bolt shear connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in bolt shear connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> in SLS. The study of demountable <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam.</b> The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam.</b> The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint. The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical column splice connection on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical column splice connection located on the corner is evaluated by FEA. The connection is a combination of end-plate and cover plate splice column connection. Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading...|$|R

40|$|Composite steel-concrete beams are {{commonly}} used as flooring in buildings. The composite action between slab and steel joist is typically provided by shear connectors welded {{to the top of}} the steel joist and embedded in the concrete. This paper investigates the effects of material uncertainties on the numerically simulated structural response of simply-supported beam tests reported in the literature by means of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The numerical analyses are performed using a three-dimensional finite element model developed using the commercial software Abaqus and capable of predicting the response of composite steel-concrete members as well as the influence of the shear connectors without having to rely on shear connection load-slip curves obtained from push-out tests. All materials are assumed to behave in a nonlinear fashion. Contact regions between the concrete and steel elements are simulated using surface-to-surface and embedment techniques. The statistical information on the structural response obtained from MCS using different realisation sizes is compared and discussed. For the particular case studies considered in this paper it can be concluded that even a reduced number of realisations can already provide meaningful statistical representations of the structural response of the considered <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{behaviour}} of <b>composite</b> cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> {{is becoming}} important as such members are increasingly used in multistory buildings.

In this paper, three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of <b>composite</b> cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> with eye-shaped openings have been developed, taking into consideration the influence of the changes in degree of shear connections.

40|$|The Ultra Shallow <b>Floor</b> <b>Beam</b> is a {{new type}} of <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> {{fabricated}} by welding two highly asymmetric cellular tees together along the web and incorporating a concrete slab between the top and bottom flanges. The unique features of this system are circular and elongated web openings that allow tie-bars, building services and ducts passing through the structural depth of the beam. For the composite beam in bending, the longitudinal shear force is transferred by a unique shear mechanism which results from the special configuration of the beam, and shear connectors, if they are present. The work reported in this paper includes a total of 16 full-scale push-out tests aimed at investigating the longitudinal shear behaviour of these beams and the effects of additional shear connectors. A theoretical analysis was also performed to investigate the failure mechanism of the system...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} longitudinal shear transfer mechanism in <b>composite</b> shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beams.</b> The shear transfer mechanism is different with the headed shear studs used in composite construction. The shear resisting properties and behaviour of the shear transfer mechanism {{has not been}} studied previously. Experimental and analytical {{studies were carried out}} with the aims of improving and optimizing the design details, and advancing the method of shear connection in shallow <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> construction. The <b>composite</b> shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> investigated in this research is a new type of beam fabricated by welding two highly asymmetric cellular tees along the web. The shear connections of this type of composite beam are formed by the web openings, which transfer longitudinal shear force. Four types of these shear connections were studied: concrete-infill-only, tie-bar, ducting and web-welded-stud shear connections. In total, 24 push-out tests were performed in two test series to investigate the load-slip behaviour and shear resistance of the shear connections under direct shear force. The failure mechanisms of the two forms of shear connections were extensively studied, which lead {{to the development of a}} design method for the composite action. The concrete infill element passing through the web opening is subject to a complex three-dimensional stress state, and it is difficult to analyse it using the mathematical model rather than empirical formula. Finite Element Analysis of the concrete-infill-only shear connection was performed with a parametric study to further verify the design method that has been developed. Two flexural tests were carried out on a full-scale <b>composite</b> shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> with a solid slab. The shear connections investigated in the flexural tests were: concrete-infill-only and tie-bar shear connections passed through the web. The behaviour and performance of the shear connections in the flexural tests were compared with those in the push-out tests. The degree of shear connection of the two flexural tests was determined in the back analysis using plastic theory with measured material properties. Based on the findings of the push-out tests and flexural tests, two design methods of deflection check and moment resistance were developed for <b>composite</b> shallow cellular <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> at the serviceability limit state and the ultimate limit state respectively. The deflection check design method is based on the uncracked section properties of the composite beam. The moment resistance design method developed in this thesis is compatible with the design methods of BS 5950 and Eurocode 4 (EC 4) ...|$|R

It can be concluded that cellular beams in fire cannot simply be estimated by applying temperature dependent reduction factors on stiffness, as given in codes. A finite element model is then established with both material and geometrical non-linearity using shell elements to compare the experimental results. The comparison between the finite element prediction and actual tests results are quite good in terms of failure modes, load deflection behaviour and ultimate loads...|$|R
40|$|AbstractComposite steel-concrete beams {{represent}} an economic form of construction {{used in both}} building and bridge applications. The composite action is usually provided {{by the presence of}} shear connectors welded {{to the top of the}} steel joist and embedded in the concrete slab. The flexural response is strongly dependent on the rigidity provided by these connectors. Initial studies in this area highlighted that their deformability needs to be evaluated and included in the modeling for an accurate structural representation. For this purpose, different types of push-out tests have been proposed to date to describe the load-slip relationships of shear connectors. These relationships are usually used in numerical simulations when modeling experimental tests or performing parametric studies. In this context, the finite element model proposed in this paper intends to provide a representation of the <b>composite</b> behaviour of <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> without the need to rely on constitutive relationships obtained from push-out tests. The model is validated against experimental results available in the open literature carried out using simply-supported and continuous static configurations and based on composite beams with solid and composite slabs...|$|R

40|$|The Bailey-BRE Method is a {{simplified}} design approach that facilitates {{the use of}} a tensile membrane action design philosophy for <b>composite</b> <b>floors</b> under fire conditions. The method requires the division of a <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> into rectangular slab panels, composed of parallel unprotected composite beams in their interior parts, supported vertically by protected composite edge beams. Enhanced slab capacities are obtained after the unprotected beams have lost significant strength, by allowing large deflections of the slab in biaxial bending. The use of tensile membrane action generates significant cost savings in composite structures, as a large number of <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> can be left unprotected. However, the protected beams which provide vertical support to the edges of panels lose strength under the combined effects of thermal degradation and the increased loading due to biaxial bending, and this has the potential to cause panels to lose structural stability altogether. It is therefore imperative to investigate what constitutes adequate vertical support and the detrimental effects of inadequate vertical support on tensile membrane action of composite slabs in fire. This paper reports on a study of this effect, and puts forward some simple recommendations to avoid loss of stability of <b>composite</b> <b>floors</b> designed by this method...|$|R

The material costs of the structural steel, concrete, reinforcement, the shear connectors, electrodes, the anti-corrosion, fire protection and top coat painting, the formwork floor-slab panels and gas consumption are presented in detail. The power consumption costs comprise costs of sawing the steel sections, edge grinding, drilling, welding, stud welding and vibrating the concrete. The labour costs (times) presented define the costs of metal cutting, edge grinding, preparation, assembling and tacking, welding, welding of shear connectors, steel surface preparation and protection, drilling, cutting, placing and connecting the reinforcement, concreting, consolidating and curing the concrete. New approximation functions are proposed for the calculation of some manufacturing times and material consumptions.

40|$|In recent years, timber–concrete {{composite}} {{systems have}} become more widely used as a new construction technique for buildings and bridges. The main advantage is that the compressive strength of concrete is exploited {{through the use of}} composite action while timber beams are able to resist the tensile stresses. The level of composite action, which can be achieved by the system, is dependent on the type of shear connector used. There is a lack of knowledge, however, on the performance of these types of connections when subjected to cyclic loading, which is typical for bridges. Testing was performed in the Structures Laboratory of the University of Canterbury to analyse the fatigue behaviour of two types of timber–concrete connections via push-out specimens, and two beam specimens representing strips of <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> with the same connection types. The two types of connection investigated were: (i) a rectangular notch connection reinforced with a coach screw (also known as lag screw); and (ii) a connection with toothed metal plates punched into laminated veneer lumber (LVL). The stiffness of the connection was monitored throughout the cyclic loading along with the total amount of slip occurring between the concrete and timber. After the application of 2 million cycles, the push-out and beam specimens were loaded to failure in order to quantify their maximum strength. The strength of the rectangular notched connection after cyclic loading was 0. 95 times of the one without cyclic loading, while for the metal plate connection was 0. 60 times. For the metal plate connection, a continuous increase in slip was observed with increased cycles possibly due to accumulated damage from repeated loading. The rectangular notch connection displayed more resistance to changes in slip, strength and stiffness than the metal plate connection. No obvious loss of stiffness was observed in the rectangular notch connected <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> after 2 million cycles, and when tested to failure the stiffness was very similar to the same <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> that had not been cyclically loaded. The <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> with metal plate connections did not perform well and failed after 350, 000 cycles. The loss of strength, stiffness and composite action in this <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> compared to the one without cyclic loading was significant. In this respect, the rectangular notch connection system is recommended for use in bridge design as opposed to metal plate connections...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The staged {{connections}} of {{the beams}} of railway bridge track-way have the simplest design, but some design flaws result in numerous defects. The purpose of the given work is to research the actual stress-train state of the point of connection of the stringers with the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> on condition of their staged interposition. It is also necessary to determine possible effect of coupled work of deck beam grid and booms on their stress-strain state. Methodology. To reach {{the purpose of the}} study the testing of the existing bridge was conducted. To measure strains (stresses) in the span elements we used the strain gages glued to flange angles of stringers and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and to fillets of lower flange angles of stringers in the points of their support on <b>floor</b> <b>beams.</b> To measure deflections of the truss, stringers and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> from static loads we used Aistov’s and Maksimov’s deflectometers, that were installed on lower boom in the middle of span 0 - 1, as well as on both stringers and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> in the middle of the span. Deflectometers were fastened to the span and, by wire communication, to the ground surface. Findings. Stress-strain state of the point of connection of the stringers with the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> on condition of their staged interposition was obtained and analyzed. Analysis indicates that, apart from vertical bending of the stringers and beams, there is a significant effect of horizontal bending of <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and their torsion, that occur due to the coupled work of track-way beams and top booms, both for P 0 beam and for other beams. Originality. Research of stress-strain state of metal track-way staged beams while considering their coupled work with bearing trusses. Practical value. While testing the span under the train load, there are significant additional stresses from horizontal bending of <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and their torsion in the <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> flanges. The appearance of these stresses is caused by inclusion of stringers into coupled work with top booms. Appearing flaws in stringers are caused by local stress concentration due to design features of staged track way...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands {{buildings}} are designed using a grid with multiples of 3. 6 meter. Within these designs floor spans of 7. 2 meter are popular (double grid size). The deep decks of <b>composite</b> <b>floors</b> {{at this moment}} in time are designed to reach an unpropped span of 5. 5 meter. This master research is focused on finding a possible deck design for a steel-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> slab that can span 7. 2 m and that is constructed without the need of temporary supports. This resulted in the JorFlor, a light-weight, big span steel-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>floor</b> that can compete with current floor systems.

40|$|A column design {{method has}} been {{developed}} for use in braced frames with discontinuous columns using flexible cap and base plates and <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> that are either simply supported or continuous. The proposed method {{is intended to be}} used with shallow floor construction with concrete or steel/concrete composite slabs in which the floor slab occupies the depth of the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and is fully grouted to the beams so that the slab restrains the full depth of the beams. It was developed to simplify the design of square hollow sections discontinuous columns in frames using asymmetric <b>beam</b> (ASB) type <b>floor</b> construction. <b>Floor</b> <b>beams</b> are designed to carry the floor loads without interaction with the columns; columns are then designed to resist the <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> reactions assuming a deformed shape derived from end-rotations equal to the slope of the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> at the top or bottom of the column, whichever is the greater. The method incorporates the elasto-plastic behaviour of columns subject to axial compression and large end-rotations and has been verified by physical tests on full-scale square hollow sections columns and finite element analysis using non-linear geometry and material properties and including residual stresses...|$|R
