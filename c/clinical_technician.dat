30|$|Anticoagulation clinics (ACCs) are {{specialty}} {{clinics that}} manage patients with blood clotting problems. Since labor costs usually {{account for a}} substantial portion of a healthcare organization’s budget, optimizing the number and types of staff required was often the focus, especially for ACCs, where labor-intensive staff-patient interactions occur. A significant portion of tasks performed by clinical pharmacists might be completed by <b>clinical</b> pharmacist <b>technicians,</b> which are less-expensive resources. While nurse staffing models for a hospital inpatient unit are well established, these models are not readily applicable to staffing ACCs. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for determining the right staff mix of clinical pharmacists and <b>clinical</b> pharmacy <b>technicians</b> that increases the efficiency of care delivery process and improves the productivity of ACC staff. A framework is developed and applied to build a semi-automated full-time equivalent (FTE) calculator and compare various staffing scenarios using a simulation model. The FTE calculator provides the right staff mix for a given staff utilization target. Data collected from the ACCs at VA Boston Healthcare System is used to illustrate the FTE calculator and the simulation model. The result of the simulation model can be used by ACC managers to easily determine the number of FTEs of clinical pharmacists and <b>clinical</b> pharmacy <b>technicians</b> required to reach the target utilization and the corresponding staffing cost.|$|R

40|$|AbstractElectronic-detection {{technologies}} and instruments increasingly are being utilized in the biomedical field {{to perform a}} wide variety of clinical operations and laboratory analyses to facilitate the delivery of health care to patients. The introduction of improved electronic instruments for diagnosing diseases and for administering treatments has required new training of laboratory technicians in order that they may perform routine clinical operations, point-of-care testing, and laboratory analyses using these new diagnostic tools. Continuous education and competency of <b>clinical</b> laboratory <b>technicians</b> in the proper use of these new healthcare tools, such as electronic-nose (e-nose) devices, is required to obtain accurate and timely information needed for making patient management decisions and for developing better and more efficient treatments for patients than are possible with conventional methods. E-nose devices are ideal instruments for the rapid detection and diagnosis of disease via detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are effective bioindicators of disease found within human breath, fluid and tissue samples sent to clinical laboratories for analysis. The proper training of technicians in the effective use of e-nose instruments for healthcare applications requires thorough understanding of the theoretical workings of e-nose devices and practical knowledge of specialized methodologies.

40|$|Abstract- In {{only two}} decades the {{analytical}} processes in clinical chemistry laboratories have utterly changed from manual to mechanized. Continuous-flow analysis initiated the change, followed by discrete automation, automatic particle counting, kinetic analysis, chromatography and, most recently, radioimmunoassay. Today's automated processes pour out {{large amounts of}} data. In fact, with some modern machines {{it is easier to}} discard selected unwanted data on chosen samples than it is to omit the part of the analytical process that produces it. This change has totally inverted the order of difficulty of the various routine tasks in the laboratory. In the old order, performance of the analytical process outweighed the total effort for all other tasks. In the new order, data handling, in its broadest sense, outweighs all other tasks. As a result, significant problems for the laboratory involve extra-laboratory factors to a new and major extent, ranging from exact identification of specimens to proper use of re-ported data. Automated identification of specimens, from collection to report, will come rapidly as new devices are developed and accepted by <b>clinical</b> <b>technicians.</b> Appropriate end-use of freely available laboratory data poses a much more difficult challenge, as yet unmet. Before the advances brought about by automation are fully utilized major changes may be required in the approach of laboratorian and clinician alike to the proper role of the laboratory in the practice of medi-cine...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between professional categories working in transfusion services of the public blood bank network in the State of Minas Gerais and their performance in proficiency tests. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study (2007 - 2008) performed using a specific instrument, based on evidence and the results of immunohematology proficiency tests as mandated by law. RESULTS: The error rates in ABO and RhD phenotyping, irregular antibody screening and cross-matching were 12. 5 %, 9. 6 %, 43. 8 % and 20. 1 %, respectively. When considering the number of tests performed, the error rates were 4. 6 %, 4. 2 %, 26. 7 % and 11. 0 %, respectively. The error rates varied for different professional categories: biochemists, biologists and biomedical scientists (65. 0 %), <b>clinical</b> pathology <b>technicians</b> (44. 1 %) and laboratory assistants, nursing technicians and assistant nurses (74. 6 %). A statistically significant difference was observed when the accuracy of <b>clinical</b> pathology <b>technicians</b> was compared with those of other professionals with only high school education (p-value < 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractThe rapid {{development}} of new electronic technologies and instruments, utilized to perform many current clinical operations in the biomedical field, is changing the way medical health care is delivered to patients. The majority of test results from laboratory analyses, performed with these analytical instruments often prior to clinical examinations, are frequently used for management decisions pertaining to patient care rather than as aids to diagnosis. The introduction of novel, improved electronic methods and portable tools for diagnosing diseases and for administering treatments has required continuous retraining of laboratory <b>technicians</b> for routine <b>clinical</b> operations and point-of-care testing. Continuous education and competency of <b>clinical</b> laboratory <b>technicians</b> in {{the proper use of}} these new healthcare tools, such as electronic-nose (e-nose) devices, is required to obtain the highest quality information possible for management decisions and to develop efficient treatments for patients. E-nose devices often provide more accurate and timely information than conventional chemical methods. Electronic-nose devices of various types and operational technologies are beginning to be used at increasing frequency in hospitals and clinical settings because of the capability of these instruments to provide rapid, accurate information of a patient's physiological state and health in real-time, eliminating the need for time-consuming chemical tests. E-nose devices are ideal instruments for the detection and diagnosis of disease and for the rapid recognition (sensing) of chemical-bioindicator compounds as indicators of disease within human fluid and tissue samples sent to diagnostic clinical laboratories for analysis. The proper training of technicians in the effective use of e-nose instruments for healthcare applications requires thorough understanding of the theoretical workings of e-nose devices and practical knowledge of operational methodologies that must be followed in order to effectively use e-nose devices to obtain the essential patient information required by medical doctors to make accurate diagnoses and administer rapid effective treatments.

40|$|Usage in {{information}} technology (IT) have improved efficiency and quality in many industries. Healthcare has not been one of them. Although some administrative IT systems, such as those for billing, scheduling, and inventory management, are already {{in place in the}} healthcare industry, little adoption of clinical IT, such as Electronic Medical Record Systems (EMR-S) and Clinical Decision Support tools, has occurred. India's healthcare information technology market is slow with technology adoption but there is little traction shown in last couple of years. This growth is expected to hit US $ 1. 45 billion in 2018, {{more than three times the}} US $ 381. 3 million reached in 2012. The increase in adoption of electronic health records, mHealth, telemedicine, and Web-based services has made electronic patient data expand, necessitating the implementation of robust IT systems in Indian healthcare institutions. Information technology (IT) has the potential to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care. Diffusion of IT in health care is generally low (varying, however, with the application and setting) but surveys indicate that providers plan to increase their investments. Drivers of investment in IT include the promise of quality and efficiency gains. Barriers include the cost and complexity of IT implementation, which often necessitates significant work process and cultural changes. Given IT's potential, both the private and public sectors have engaged in numerous efforts to promote its use within and across health care settings. Delivering quality health care requires providers and patients to integrate complex information from many different sources. Thus, increasing the ability of physicians, nurses, <b>clinical</b> <b>technicians,</b> and others to readily access and use the right information about their patients should improve care. The purpose of this thesis is to assess the current state of healthcare in India and specifically look into the emerging technology trends in healthcare IT. During analysis secondary data has been used. Various articles and research papers published in national and international journals are used. India is hub of IT and its use is increasing in health sector. by Sanjay Kumar Gautam. Thesis: S.
