40|$|The {{neocognitron}} is {{an artificial}} neural network which applies {{certain aspects of the}} mammalian visual process to the task of 2 -D pattern recognition. The resulting network model is complex in both structure and pa- rameterization. We describe experiments which show that the performance of the neocognitron is sensitive to certain parameters whose values are seldom detailed in the relevant literature. We also present results which suggest that the selectivity parameters in the neocognitton can be adjusted in a straightforward manner so as to improve the classification performance of the neo- <b>cognitron...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of venous beading in retinal images provides an early sign of diabetic retinopathy and {{plays an important}} role as a preprocessing step in diagnosing ocular diseases. We present a computer-aided diagnostic system to automatically detect venous beading of blood vessels. It comprises of two modules, referred to as the blood vessel extraction module (BVEM) and the venus beading detection module (VBDM). The former uses a bell-shaped Gaussian kernel with 12 azimuths to extract blood vessels while the latter applies a neural network-based shape <b>cognitron</b> to detect venous beading among the extracted blood vessels for diagnosis. Both modules are fully computer-automated. To evaluate the proposed system, 61 retinal images (32 beaded and 29 normal images) are used for performance evaluation.

40|$|A new shape recognition-based {{neural network}} built with {{universal}} feature planes, called Shape <b>Cognitron</b> (S-Cognitron) is introduced to classify clustered microcalcifications. The architecture of S-Cognitron {{consists of two}} modules and an extra layer, called 3 D figure layer lies in between. The first module contains a shape orientation layer, built with 20 cell planes of low level universal shape features to convert first-order shape orientations into numeric values, and a complex layer, to extract second-order shape features. The 3 D figure layer is a feature extract-display layer that extracts the shape curvatures of an input pattern and displays them as a 3 D figure. It is then followed by a second module {{made up of a}} feature formation layer and a probabilistic neural network-based classification layer. The system is evaluated by using Nijmegen mammogram database and experimental results show that sensitivity and specificity can reach 86. 1 and 74. 1 %, respectively...|$|E
