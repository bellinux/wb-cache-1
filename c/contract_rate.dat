50|$|Secondly, the FPA {{also allows}} the FPC {{to set aside}} a {{contract}} upon a determination that the rate is unlawful. The parties during the FPC proceeding had stipulated that a reasonable or fair rate of return (ROR) for PG&E was 5.5%, and that the <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> provided a ROR of 2.6% while the new filed rate schedule provided a ROR of 4.75%, which was the lowest that PG&E stated it would accept. The FPC had in its order found that the 1948 <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> to be unreasonably low and unlawful because of its low ROR. The Supreme Court, however, noted that while a regulatory agency such as the FPC may not normally impose upon a public utility a ROR that {{is less than the}} fair ROR, it did not follow that the public utility may not itself agree by contract to a ROR that is less than the fair ROR, or that if it does so, that it is entitled to regulatory relief of its improvident bargain. Under the FPA, the proper standard for determining whether a <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> is unlawful is whether the rate is so low as to adversely affect the public interest, such as having been unduly discriminatory to third parties, excessively burdensome to consumers, or a threat to continued service to the utility company.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1953 after {{excess power}} from the Shasta Dam was no longer available, PG&E {{without the consent of}} Sierra Pacific filed a new rate {{schedule}} with the FPC purporting to increase the rate to Sierra Pacific by 28%. The FPC suspended the rate until September 6, 1953, and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the new rate. Sierra Pacific intervened but its motion to reject the new rate because the contract could not be changed without its consent was rejected by the FPC. In 1954 the FPC issued an order upholding its decision not to reject the new rate and finding it to be not [...] "unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential." [...] On appeal by Sierra Pacific, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, holding that the <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> could only be changed upon a finding that it was unreasonable, reversed the FPC order and remanded it without prejudice to the FPC initiating a new proceeding to determine the reasonableness of the <b>contract</b> <b>rate.</b> The Supreme Court granted certiorari because {{of the importance of the}} case to the administration of the FPA.|$|E

50|$|The {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Harlan noted two {{issues in the}} case.

50|$|In other words, {{a forward}} rate {{agreement}} (FRA) is a tailor-made, over-the-counter financial futures contract on short-term deposits. A FRA transaction is a contract between two parties to exchange payments on a deposit, called the Notional amount, {{to be determined}} {{on the basis of}} a short-term interest rate,referred to as the Reference rate, over a predetermined time period at a future date. FRA transactions are entered as a hedge against interest rate changes. The buyer of the contract locks in the interest rate in an effort to protect against an interest rate increase, while the seller protects against a possible interest rate decline. At maturity, no funds exchange hands; rather, thedifference between the <b>contracted</b> interest <b>rate</b> and the market rate is exchanged. The buyer of the contract is paid if the reference rate is above the <b>contracted</b> <b>rate,</b> and the buyer pays to the seller if the reference rate is below the <b>contracted</b> <b>rate.</b> A company that seeks to hedge against a possible increase in interest rates would purchase FRAs, whereas a company that seeks an interest hedge against a possible decline of the rates would sell FRAs.|$|R

50|$|Derivatives {{trading of}} this kind may serve the {{financial}} interests of certain particular businesses. For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate. The interest rate on the loan reprices every six months. The corporation is concerned {{that the rate of}} interest may be much higher in six months. The corporation could buy a forward rate agreement (FRA), which is a contract to pay a fixed rate of interest six months after purchases on a notional amount of money. If the interest rate after six months is above the <b>contract</b> <b>rate,</b> the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer. If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay the difference to the seller. The purchase of the FRA serves to reduce the uncertainty concerning the rate increase and stabilize earnings.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes {{the dealer}} has {{the option of}} marking up the {{interest}} rate of the contract and retaining a portion of that markup. For example, a bank may give a wholesale money rate of 6.75% and the dealer may give the consumer an interest rate of 7.75%. The bank would then pay the dealer the difference or a portion thereof. This is a regular practice because the dealership is selling the contract to a bank just like it sold a car to the customer. Most banks or states strictly limit the amount a <b>contract</b> <b>rate</b> may be marked up (by giving a range of rates at which they will buy the contract). In many cases this amounts to little difference in the customer's payment as the amount borrowed is small by comparison to a mortgage and the term shorter.|$|E

5000|$|The {{provision}} {{of natural gas}} to the Ideal Cement plant was also {{the subject of a}} prior Supreme Court case, United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp. (1956).

The Supreme Court in that case held that the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) did not authorize the abrogation of contracts, so the new rate schedule could not change the rate for the gas for the cement plant. This case, along with Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co.
