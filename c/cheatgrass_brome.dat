40|$|Natural {{ecosystems}} in the semiarid West face many stressors. Among {{the most}} challenging are those associated with invasive plant species. One invader that has had great impact over the last 100 years is the annual grass known as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). A few years ago, I made two observations that both confirmed and broadened my perception of this plant. In the first, I saw it growing on sodden roofs in an historic community near the Mississippi River. I was reminded that the scientific name roughly means “brome grass that grows on roofs ” and I gained insight into its long coexistence with humans. Later that day I observed a plant growing in the mud {{on the bank of}} the river. I pondered about what that place could possibly have in common with the vast shrublands of the semiarid West where cheatgrass has become so entrenched. Recently I found plants growing directly from the smallest of cracks in massive limestone slabs in the deserts of western Utah (Fig. 1). Reflexively I pondered, “Is there any place on earth cheatgrass cannot grow?” Bromus tectorum, <b>cheatgrass,</b> downy <b>brome,</b> downy chess, early chess, drooping brome, June grass, bronco grass, 100...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, the {{landscape}} homogeneity of extensive monocultures that characterizes con-ventional agriculture {{has resulted in}} the development of specialized and interacting multi-trophic pest complexes. While integrated pest management emphasizes the need to consider the ecological context where multiple species coexist, management recommenda-tions are often based on single-species tactics. This approach may not provide satisfactory solutions when confronted with the complex interactions occurring between organisms at the same or different trophic levels. Replacement of the single-species management model with more sophisticated, multi-species programs requires an understanding of the direct and indirect interactions occurring between the crop and all categories of pests. We evaluat-ed a modeling framework to make multi-pest management decisions taking into account di-rect and indirect interactions among species belonging to different trophic levels.

40|$|Native plant {{communities}} and ecosystems {{of the western}} United States are increasingly besieged by invasive weeds and grasses ofEurasian origins. Federal land managers over-see 40 millionhain the GreatBasinregion of the western United States. Its valleys are cold desert steppe vegetated by grassy shrub lands; these are interrupted by forested moun-tains. The Great Basin and Columbia Plateau ecoregions (figure 4. 1) together include about one-half of North America's remaining 43 million ha of sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) plant communities (Wisdom et al., 2005). The health and extent of these communities are fast diminishing, with dire consequences for many plant and animal inhabitants. The most charismatic {{of these is the}} sage grouse, but 206 other species warrant con-servation concern (Wisdom et al., 2005). <b>Cheatgrass</b> (smooth <b>brome,</b> Bromlls tectorwn), a flammable aunual grass from the Mediterranean, has invaded 11 million ha of the Great Basin northward into the Columbia Plateau, an area equivalent to that of Cuba, Hungary, or Virginia. Cheatgrass is quite literally fueling a dramatic incre. ase in the fre-quency and extent of wildfire across the region, degrading native plant {{communities and}} presumably their dependent native bee faunas. In Nevada alone, 1, 000 wildfires burned 200, 000 ha of rangeland from 2000 to 2002, half ofit sagebrush communities (Wisdom et al., 2005). Besides direct fire suppression efforts, land managers have also sought to break: this intensified fire cycle by rehabilitating native plant communities, primarily through direct seeding following wildfire (Monsen & Shaw, 2001). This reseeding strat-egy to restore native plant communities on western public rangelands, if successful, may be comparable to fire suppression in cost but will have more enduring habitat value...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{species of}} desert {{vegetation}} and associated soils {{were collected from}} the Nevada National Security Site (N 2 S 2) and analyzed for 238 Pu and 239 + 240 Pu concentrations. Amongst the plant species sampled were: atmospheric elemental accumulators (moss and lichen), the very slow growing, long-lived creosote bush and the rapidly growing, short-lived <b>cheatgrass</b> <b>brome.</b> The diversity of growth strategies provided insight into the geochemical behavior and bio-availability of Pu at the N 2 S 2. The highest concentrations of Pu were measured in the onion moss (24. 27 Bq kg- 1 238 Pu and 52. 78 Bq kg- 1 239 + 240 Pu) followed by the rimmed navel lichen (8. 18 Bq kg- 1 and 18. 4 Bq kg- 1 respectively), pointing {{to the importance of}} eolian transport of Pu. Brome and desert globemallow accumulated between 3 and 9 times higher concentrations of Pu than creosote and sage brush species. These results support the importance of species specific elemental accumulation strategies rather than exposure duration as the dominant variable influencing Pu concentrations in these plants. Total vegetation elemental concentrations of Ce, Fe, Al, Sm and others were also analyzed. Strong correlations were observed between Fe and Pu. This supports the conclusion that Pu was accumulated {{as a consequence of the}} active accumulation of Fe and other plant required nutrients. Cerium and Pu are considered to be chemical analogs. Strong correlations observed in plants support the conclusion that these elements displayed similar geochemical behavior in the environment as it related to the biochemical uptake process of vegetation. Soils were also sampled in association with vegetation samples. This allowed for the calculation of a concentration ratio (CR). The CR values for Pu in plants were highly influenced by the heterogeneity of Pu distribution among sites. Results from the naturally occurring elements of concern were more evenly distributed between sample sites. This allowed for the development of a pattern of plant species that accumulated Ce, Sm, Fe and Al. The highest accumulators of these elements were onion moss, lichen flowed by brome. The lowest accumulators were creosote bush and fourwing saltbush. This ranked order corresponds to plant accumulations of Pu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{prominent}} goal {{of invasive}} plant management {{is to prevent}} or reduce the spread of invasive species into uninvaded landscapes and regions. Monitoring and control efforts often rely on scientific knowledge of suitable habitat for the inva-sive species. However, rising temperatures and altered precipitation projected with climate change are likely to shift the geographic range of that suitable habitat. Here, we review experimental and modeling studies of climatic limits to exotic annual Bromus (Bromus hereafter) distribution in the Intermountain West {{in the context of}} projections of future climate change. We update empirical models of range shifts to test whether Bromus rubens L. (red brome) is likely to expand into ranges that become less suitable for Bromus tectorum L. (<b>cheatgrass</b> or downy <b>brome).</b> Warming temperatures are likely to create an advantage for Bromus species throughout much of the Intermountain West, potentially enhancing invasion into formerly resistant ecosystems if native species mortality increases with warming and drought. Bromus rubens is likely to expand into areas of the southern Great Basin and Colorado Plateau as warmer winters reduce range constraints caused by cold intolerance...|$|R
40|$|The loessal {{plains and}} hills regions of central Nebraska and Kansas are {{included}} in this region {{as well as the}} Red Hills region of south-central Kansas and northern Oklahoma. The semi-arid region is characterized by seasonal moisture and temperature extremes of a continental climate. Elevation ranges from 1300 - 4000 feet. Precipitation ranges from 12 - 32 inches with 2 / 3 occurring during the growing season. Regional droughts are common. Vegetation Description This community is dominated by a mixture of tall (1 - 2 m) and mid (0. 5 - 1 m) grasses with an understory of shortgrasses (< 0. 5 m). Tallgrasses, primarily big bluestem and Indiangrass, are more abundant on lower slopes and bottoms, mid (primarily little bluestem, western wheatgrass, sideoats grama, and Junegrass) and short grasses (primarily blue grama and buffalograss) dominate on upper slopes and ridge tops. Shortgrasses dominate heavily grazed sites. In presettlement times the shortgrasses and mid grasses were likely in presettlement times due to heavy bison grazing. Species diversity was moderate to high in the mixed grass prairie (Steinauer and Rolfsmeier 2003). Common forb species in the mixed grass prairie include western ragweed, fringed sage, prairie coneflower, scarlet globe mallow, scarlet gaura, and others. Shrubs and trees were a small component of the southern mixed grass prairie in presettlement times. Today exotic plants, such as smooth <b>brome,</b> <b>cheatgrass,</b> and Kentucky bluegrass and eastern red cedars are abundant in this prairie type. The exotics were not present in presettlement times and cedars were limited to fire-protected sites...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} in post-fire {{restoration}} of semi-arid shrublands dominated by annual bromes {{is the presence of}} carryover seed banks that cannot be controlled using conventional methods. These seeds can provide significant competition for seeded species in the years following treatment. We investigated the feasibility of using a naturally occurring seed pathogen, the ascomycete Pyrenophora semeniperda, as a biocontrol organism for eliminating this carryover seed bank. We carried out the necessary technology development to create and apply field inoculum to cheatgrass- or red brome-infested areas (both burned and unburned) at six sites located in three states across two years of field trials. We found that inoculum application significantly increased the proportion of pathogen-killed Bromus seeds in the seed bank, reduced the density of viable carryover Bromus seeds, and in many cases increased the density of pathogen-killed seeds relative to levels in uninoculated controls. In some treatments, the proportion of field-killed seeds reached 100 %, validating the promise of this approach. Even though this pathogen is physiologically capable of infecting the seeds of many grasses and some dicots, we determined that risks to nontarget host seeds can be mitigated. The inoculum usually has a relatively short persistence time in the absence of new host seeds, and the pathogen is readily controlled by fungicides that could potentially be used as seed treatments for desired restoration species. The potential for selection of more virulent P. semeniperda strains for increased biocontrol effectiveness is considerable. In addition, because more virulent strains grow more slowly, {{they are less likely to}} persist post-control in competition with faster-growing wild strains. In summary, our study provides proof of concept for use of this pathogen for biocontrol of <b>cheatgrass</b> and red <b>brome,</b> and opens the way for further studies on formulation and delivery technology to bring this promising biocontrol agent closer to market...|$|R

We assessed their joint responses to weed management tactics, seeding rates, and cultivar tolerance to insect stem boring or competition. Our results indicated that C. cinctus oviposition behavior varied as a function of B. tectorum pressure. Crop responses were more readily explained by the joint effects of management tactics on both categories of pests and their interactions than just by the direct impact of any particular management scheme on yield. In accordance, a C. cinctus tolerant variety should be planted at a low seeding rate under high insect pressure. However as B. tectorum levels increase, the C. cinctus tolerant variety should be replaced by a competitive and drought tolerant cultivar at high seeding rates despite C. cinctus infestation. This study exemplifies the necessity of accounting for direct and indirect biological interactions occurring within agroecosystems and propagating this information from the statistical analysis stage to the management stage...|$|R
