40|$|The corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is an {{occasional}} pest of maize, Zea mays L. Corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> damage in maize {{has been characterized}} in whorl-stage plants, but seedling damage has not been investigated. Resistance mechanisms in maize to corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> are not well understood. The objectives of these studies were to determine the role of DIMBOA (2, 4 -dihydroxy- 7 -methoxyl- 1, 4 -benzoxazin- 3 -one) in maize resistance to corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids,</b> to document corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding damage on seedling maize, and to characterize feeding behavior differences on seedling and whorl-stage maize;Inbred 41 : 2504 B (high DIMBOA) was colonized by corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> immediately upon seedling emergence. Inbreds B 73 and B 37 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the three- and six-leaf stages, respectively. Inbreds C 103 and Mo 17 (low DIMBOA) were colonized in the six- and seven-leaf stages, respectively. Regression and partial correlation analysis showed no relationship between corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> colonization and DIMBOA. These data indicate that DIMBOA is not a primary resistance factor in maize to corn <b>leaf</b> aphids;Corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> feeding on coleoptile and two-leaf stage maize plants reduced plant height and delayed pollen shedding and silking. Grain fill was reduced when aphids fed on coleoptile, two-leaf, and four-leaf stage maize. Grain fill reductions occurred on inbreds B 37, C 103, and 41 : 2504 B, but not on B 73 and Mo 17. Corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> damage on seedling maize resulted in yield reductions;Examination of late-whorl stage and seedling maize indicated that 57 % of the corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> stylet tracks penetrated late-whorl stage plants through stomata. Eighty-six percent of stylet penetrations in seedling maize occurred intercellularly between epidermal cells and 8 % through the stomata. Fifty-seven percent and 79 % of the stylet tracks terminated in phloem in whorl-stage and seedling maize, respectively. Aphid damaged stomata may be important in explaining yield reductions in heavily infested water stressed maize;These findings indicate that corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids</b> were capable of feeding on and damaging seedling maize, and that resistance mechanisms in maize to the corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> do not involve the secondary plant chemical DIMBOA...|$|R
40|$|NYS IPM Type: Project ReportThe corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid,</b> Rhopalosiphum maidis, is an {{important}} pest of fresh market sweet corn in New York. Heavy infestations can reduce yield and adversely affect ear quality by direct or indirect (sooty mold) contamination.

To improve the management of this pest we assessed corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> infestations and the associated natural enemy complex in early-, mid-, and late- season plantings of sweet corn. We recorded relatively large numbers of natural enemies, but it was insufficient to keep aphid numbers below action thresholds.

Corn <b>Leaf</b> <b>Aphids</b> Do Not Benefit from Greenbug Feeding and Plant Damage. 1 st Annual Undergraduate Research Experience in Entomology Symposium, November 16, 2016. Manhattam, KS. Greenbugs (Schizaphis graminum) {{are known}} for their devastating effects on crops {{including}} cereal grains. Their saliva contains toxins, which break down the plants defenses and allow the aphids to utilize nitrogen from the plant. This quality makes the greenbug more destructive than other species including the corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphid</b> (Rhopalosiphum maidis). To observe whether aphid feeding influences the success of other aphid species that later feed on the same plant, we designed an experiment which measured aphid virulence and plant damage. We found that the presence of aphids generally stunts plant growth, combined damage of two aphid species is greater than a single species, and damage done by greenbugs does not necessarily benefit corn <b>leaf</b> <b>aphids...</b>|$|R

Adults emerge from pupal cells in the soil in mid-June to early July, feed voraciously for about three weeks, and enter aestivation sites. For the remainder of the summer and early autumn only a few adults can be found feeding on late-maturing native grasses. The beetles overwinter and usually emerge in late March to early April and resume feeding. Mating and oviposition occur, and larval development is usually completed by late June in southern Michigan. Techniques for rearing the <b>cereal</b> <b>leaf</b> beetle on greenhouse-grown small grain seedlings have been developed by Connin, et al. (1968).
