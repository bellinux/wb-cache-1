5|$|Gaveston's lieutenancy was {{primarily}} {{of a military}} nature; by the early 14th century, Ireland had become a rebellious and unruly dominion for the English crown. In this capacity Gaveston had considerable success, killing or defeating several major insurgents. He fortified the town of Newcastle McKynegan and Castle Kevin, and rebuilt the road from Castle Kevin to Glendalough. This helped pacify the county {{at least as far}} as the Wicklow Mountains, west of Dublin. In the field of administration he made less of a mark. The most notable issue with which he was involved <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> dispute over murage – a toll on the town walls – between the citizens of Dublin. As during the regency, though, there is no evidence that Gaveston exploited his position for his own advantage and he did nothing to alienate the local elite.|$|E
5|$|His {{probable}} last {{occurrence in}} the sources <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> conflict with Kinloss Abbey regarding the prebendal parish church of Avoch. The parish of Avoch lay within Thomas' diocese, but the Abbot of Kinloss claimed the primary right to possess it. A papal mandate was issued on 5 January 1325 to William de Lindores, the Chancellor of Ross, commanding him {{to judge the}} dispute. Bishop Thomas was almost certainly alive on that date, but he was dead by 17 April, when Roger, canon of Abernethy, received papal provision to the bishopric of Ross, said to be vacant by Thomas' death.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the verb}} wish governs a finite clause, {{the past tense}} (simple past or past {{progressive}} as appropriate) is used when the desire expressed <b>concerns</b> <b>a</b> present state, the past perfect (or past perfect progressive) when it <b>concerns</b> <b>a</b> (usually counterfactual) past state or event, and the simple conditional with would when it <b>concerns</b> <b>a</b> desired present action or change of state.

25|$|In March 1894, R. H. Mitchell and C. W. Clow {{founded a}} new paper in Hillsboro, the Argus. On March 28, 1894, the first Hillsboro Argus was printed which {{included}} a front page advertisement for Hillsboro lawyer and later Congressman Thomas H. Tongue. Other {{news of the day}} <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> battle over the county seat of Lincoln County, Oregon. At that time it was a weekly paper of only six pages and was located on Second Street between Main and Washington streets.|$|E
25|$|United States v. Dawson (1854) <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> murder {{committed}} in the Indian Territory by a non-Indian defendant, a crime which by statute was triable in Arkansas. Between the murder and the trial, the District of Arkansas had been subdivided into the Eastern and Western Districts of Arkansas. The Court held that the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which requires a jury drawn {{from the state and}} district wherein the crime was committed, had no application to crimes committed outside of a U.S. state.|$|E

The program, a juvenile version of the ABC series Lost, <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> group of teenagers stranded on a tropical island after their plane crashes. Bleu played as Nathan McHugh, a Boy Scout whose leadership skills do not quite measure up to his self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|Rivette's {{difficulties}} in securing financial backing for his films {{during the late}} 1970s {{led him to a}} business partnership with Pierre Grise Productions and producer Martine Marignac. The company was the chief distributor and financier for all his subsequent films. Their first film, 1984's Love on the Ground, again <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> theatrical group and the blurring of fiction and reality. Geraldine Chaplin and Jane Birkin star as members of a theatrical troupe who are invited to appear in a new play resembling the real life of its director (Kalfon) and the mysterious disappearance of his wife.|$|E
25|$|A {{procedural}} hearing at the Appeal Court {{took place}} on 11 October 2007 when prosecution lawyers and Megrahi's defence counsel, Maggie Scott QC, discussed a number of legal issues with a panel of three judges. One of the issues <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> number of documents that were shown before the trial to the prosecution, but were not disclosed to the defence. The documents are understood {{to relate to the}} Mebo MST-13 timer that allegedly detonated the PA103 bomb. Maggie Scott also asked for documents relating to an alleged payment of $2million made to Maltese merchant, Tony Gauci, for his testimony at the trial, which led to the conviction of Megrahi.|$|E

What is required is a sound basic organization that meets League requirements and good leadership. In addition to support received from its Sponsor, an Air Cadet Squadron may receive assistance and support from other organizations, groups or individuals. Such organizations, groups, or individuals may be formally recognized as Supporters of the squadron or squadrons <b>concerned.</b> <b>A</b> Supporter usually provides assistance {{in the form of}} periodic financial donations to a squadron; awards to the cadets of the squadron; talks to the cadets; or in other ways.|$|E
25|$|A strike {{beginning}} on November 6, 2008 <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> variety of institutional grievances, including job security for contract professors, {{elimination of the}} Non-Academic Student Code of Conduct, creation of whistleblower protection, and fund indexation. On January 20, 2009, CUPE 3903 defeated a forced ratification vote that would have ended the strike. On January 24, Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty announced a rare Sunday recall of the provincial legislature in order to pass back-to-work legislation mandating an immediate end to the strike. On January 29, the York University Labour Disputes Resolution Act was passed in the provincial parliament on a count of 42–8 ending the long 85-day strike and setting a precedent for future university strikes in Ontario.|$|E
25|$|A {{great deal}} of testimony, some the most {{dramatic}} of the proceedings, <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> reputed diary that Giuliano kept, naming the powerful politicians with whom he collaborated. Pisciotta, Perenze, Luca, Marotta, and especially de Maria figured in its saga. De Maria was accused by a Mafioso, Stefano de Peri of telling {{him that he had}} destroyed the memoirs. None of the accused admitted to knowing what became of Giuliano's journal. Testimony concluded late in 1951, and in May 1952 twelve defendants, including Terranova and Pisciotta, were sentenced for life; four were given shorter sentences, and the remainder were acquitted. More trials followed: the last arrest of a Giuliano confederate on related charges was in 1964, and the last prisoner among them was released by 1980.|$|E

25|$|The second affair <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> {{peace treaty}} {{proposed}} by Krum of Bulgaria (r. 803–814), also in 812, {{according to which}} the Byzantine and Bulgarian states should exchange refugees. It is likely that Krum sought the return of certain Bulgarians who had betrayed him to the Byzantines. In this instance Theodore argued against the exchange, as it would require that Christians be cast to barbarians, while Nikephoros urged the emperor to accept the treaty. Once more Theodore's opinion prevailed, although this time with serious consequences; Krum attacked and took Mesembria in November of the same year. Michael led a military campaign against the Bulgarians in 813, which ended in defeat, {{and as a result}} he abdicated in July and Leo V was crowned emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{title of}} a city which is borne by certain boroughs is a purely titular distinction. It has no {{connexion}} with {{the status of the}} borough in respect of local government and confers no powers or privileges. At the present time and for several centuries past the title has been obtained only by an express grant from the Sovereign effected by letters patent; but a certain number of cities possess the title by very ancient prescriptive right. There is no necessary connexion between the {{title of a}} city and the seat of a bishopric, {{and the creation of a}} new see neither constitutes the town <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> city nor gives it any claim to the grant of letters patent creating it a city.|$|E
25|$|The IPCC {{convened in}} Bangkok on April 30 to start {{discussions on the}} draft Summary, with the {{participation}} of over 400 scientists and experts from about 120 countries. At the full IPCC meeting on May 4, agreement was reached by the larger gathering of some 2,000 delegates. One of the key debates <b>concerned</b> <b>a</b> proposal to limit concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to between 445 parts per million and 650 parts per million to avoid dangerous climate change, with pressure from developing countries to raise the lower limit. Despite this, the figures from the original proposal were incorporated into the Summary for Policymakers. The Summary concludes that stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations is possible at a reasonable cost, with stabilization between 445ppm and 535ppm costing less than 3% of global GDP.|$|E
