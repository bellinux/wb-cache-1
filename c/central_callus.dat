25|$|Leptotes vellozicola is {{the only}} easily {{recognizable}} species in this group as it has a thick <b>central</b> <b>callus</b> next to {{the apex of the}} lip petal. It {{is the only}} species of this group endemic to Bahia, the other species are from southeast and south Brazil. This species, among all Leptotes, takes the most sunlight in the wild because it is epiphytic on Vellozia, a species with very few leaves. The region where it lives is much dryer compared to the areas inhabited by the other species.|$|E
50|$|The species {{produce a}} pendent inflorescence, bearing racemes of many {{fragrant}} cup-shaped, pale yellow to reddish brown flowers. The sidelobes of the labellum (lip) {{come together in}} a <b>central</b> <b>callus.</b> The basal part of the lip (hypochile) is at least as long as the sidelobes. The column is pubescent.The column of these orchids bears two pollinia, except in Acineta dalessandroi, which has four (making its classification in this genus doubtful). These orchids are insect pollinated by male bees in the genus Eulaema or Eufriesia.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the shell varies between 15 mm and 22 mm. The solid shell is {{depressed}} and imperforate. The colour is yellowish or pinkish, radiately streaked with chestnut brown or red above, the base with a reddish or purple zone around the <b>central</b> <b>callus,</b> the outer part white, more or less striped radiately. The shining surface is smooth. The base of the shell shows under a lens very fine, close, regular spiral striae. Well-preserved specimens show red and emerald-green reflections through the thin layer overlying the nacre, like fiery opals.|$|E

40|$|The {{reproductive}} biology, reward {{production and}} pollination mechanism of Trichocentrum pumilum were studied in a gallery {{forest in the}} interior of the State of Sao Paulo, southeast Brazil. The floral visitors and pollination mechanism were recorded, and experimental pollinations were carried out {{in order to determine the}} breeding system of this species. Trichocentrum pumilum blooms in spring. Each paniculate inflorescence bears an average of 85 flowers that present a <b>central</b> yellow <b>callus</b> and finger-like trichomes on the lateral lobes of the lip. A lipoidal substance is produced and stored among these trichomes. In the studied population, T. pumilum is exclusively visited and pollinated by two bee species (Tetrapedia diversipes and Lophopedia nigrispinis). Pollinaria are deposited on mouthparts of bees during collection of the lipoidal substance from the lateral lobes of the labellum. Trichocentrum pumilum is self-incompatible and pollinator-limited. Natural fruit set was low (9 %, compared to 45 % in experimentally cross-pollinated flowers). Potentially viable seed exceed 97 % in fruits obtained through cross-pollination and in natural conditions (open pollination) ...|$|R

40|$|Although bone has {{a unique}} {{restorative}} capacity, i. e. {{it has the potential}} to heal scarlessly, the conditions for spontaneous bone healing are not always present, leading to a delayed union or a non-union. In this work we use an integrative in vivo - in silico approach to investigate the occurrence of non-unions as well as to design possible treatment strategies thereof. The gap size of the domain geometry of a previously published mathematical model was enlarged in order to study the complex interplay of blood vessel formation, oxygen supply, growth factors and cell proliferation on the final healing outcome in large bone defects. The multiscale oxygen model was not only able to capture the essential aspects of in vivo non-unions, it also assisted in understanding the underlying mechanisms of action, i. e. the delayed vascularization of the <b>central</b> <b>callus</b> region resulted in harsh hypoxic conditions, cell death and finally disrupted bone healing. Inspired by the importance of a timely vascularization as well as by the limited biological potential of the fracture hematoma, the influence of the host environment on the bone healing process in critical size defects was explored further. Moreover, dependent on the host environment, several treatment strategies were designed and tested for effectiveness. A qualitative correspondence between the predicted outcomes of certain treatment strategies and experimental observations was obtained, clearly illustrating the model's potential. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that due to the complex non-linear dynamics of blood vessel formation, oxygen supply, growth factor production and cell proliferation and the interactions thereof with the host environment, an integrative in silico-in vivo approach is a crucial tool to further unravel the occurrence and treatments of challenging critical sized bone defects. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|For decades, {{autologous}} tricortical {{bone graft}} harvested from the iliac crest was the favoured implant for ventral cervical spondylodesis. In {{addition to a}} significant morbidity associated with harvesting of the iliac crest graft, {{the use of this}} implant often bears biological and biomechanical problems. The application of metallic cages causes problems during imaging due to metal related artifacts. Alternative cage designs made of carbon or PEEK allow imaging procedures without disturbance. However, they are often inferior to metallic cages regarding their biomechanical properties. Biodegradable implant materials do not interfere with imaging procedures. In contrast to permanent implants, biodegradable materials do not remain in the intervertebral space. Only few long term results regarding the use of biodegradable implant materials for ventral cervical spondylodesis have been published so far. This long term in vivo animal study compares the osseointegration of a biodegradable Resorbon cage and an iliac crest bone graft by medical imaging techniques. Thus, ventral cervical spondylodesis on vertebrae C 3 / C 4 was performed on 46 female Merino sheep. After discectomy, Resorbon cages were implanted in 32 animals (group 2 a, 2 b, 2 c, 2 d: n = 8). Iliac crest bone grafts were implanted in the remaining 14 animals (group 1 a, 1 b: n = 4; group 1 c, 1 d: n = 3). In addition, vertebral segments were stabilized with a ventral plate and two cortical screws. Lateral and ventro – dorsal radiographs of the cevical spines were performed pre – and postoperative and after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. In the course of this study, radiographs were repeated in a four month interval until week 36 and later on in a eight months interval until week 100. Intervertebral disc heights, intervertebral and lordosis angles, implant migration and broken screws were established on these radiographs. Animals were euthanised group related after 12 weeks (group 1 a, 2 a), 36 weeks (group 1 b, 2 b), 52 weeks (group 1 c, 2 c) and a 100 weeks (group 1 d, 2 d) postoperative. Functional X-ray tests and computertomographic examinations were performed on the isolated cervical spines to detect interbody fusion. In addition, bone mineral density, callus volume and cage volume were calculated. The Resorbon cage showed significantly better distractive qualities than the iliac crest bone graft up to week 36. Subsequently, relevant differences concerning this parameter coul not be observed between the two groups of implants. The reduction of intervertebral disc height correlates to a subsidence of the Resorbon cage into the vertebral endplates as well as collaps of the iliac crest bone graft. Steady lordosis of the vertebral segment {{can be found in the}} group of Resorbon cage implanted animals thoughout the study period. In contrast, rekyphosis could be observed in the group of iliac crest implanted animals after a mean of two weeks postoperative. Ventral implant migration was found in 78 % of the Resorbon group after 12 weeks postoperative. After 36 weeks implant migration occured in 96 % and after 52 weeks in a 100 % of cases. Due to poor visualisation of the iliac crest bone graft on regular radiographs, implant migration could not be evaluated in the animals having received this implant. Broken screws were found in both groups in a high percentage of animals. In the group of animals with iliac crest implants, broken screws were found mostly in vertebra C 3. In the group of Resorbon cage implanted animals, broken screws were found predominantly in C 4. Functional radiographic measurements showed no significant differences between the groups at any given time. Both groups showed an increasing stiffness of the operated vertebral segment over time. Calculation of callus volumes showed higher volumes of <b>central</b> <b>callus</b> in the Resorbon group at any given time and higher ventral callus volumes in the group of iliac crest bone grafts. There is no significant difference of cage volume after 12 and 36 weeks postoperative in comparison to the initial cage volume. At 52 weeks, a distinctive increase of the cage volume can be observed. Due to progressive degradation activity, the cage volume after 100 weeks postoperative could not be evaluated. Interpretation of the computed tomographic results showed very good initial formation of new bone in the intervertebral disc space agreeing with the established fusion criterias. Fusion rates were 100 % after 52 weeks but only 50 % after 100 weeks. In the group of iliac crest bone grafts, solid fusion could be observed at 36, 52, and 100 weeks. After 100 weeks, massive osseous vertebrae defects and swollen prolapsed and fragmented implants causing myelon compression, could be found in 50 per cent of the animals of the Resorbon group. According to this study, the Resorbon cage, which appeared promising initally, is not suited for the use as intervertebral implant for spondylodesis of the cervical spine...|$|E
