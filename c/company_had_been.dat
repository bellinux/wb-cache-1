5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men come down from the top and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D <b>Company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E

In addition, two Chicago firms purchased the tax lien certificates on the property.|$|E

5|$|The Curry <b>Company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{started in}} 1899 by David and Jennie Curry to provide {{concessions}} in the park. They also founded Camp Curry, {{formerly known as}} Curry Village, now known as Half Dome Village.

5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, he convinced the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E
5|$|After Alliance Property's land sales, the London Necropolis <b>Company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{reduced to}} Brookwood Cemetery itself and Frederick W.

5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester never saw the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Indigenous art of {{the western}} desert began when Indigenous men at Papunya began {{painting}} in 1971, assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all {{of the founders of}} the Papunya Tula artists' <b>company,</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting.|$|E
5|$|During this period, 1st Airborne Division was {{composed}} of only two parachute battalions, of which only one (1st Parachute Battalion), was fully trained. Browning, wishing to keep 1st Parachute Battalion intact for any larger operation the division might be selected for, ordered 2nd Parachute Battalion to provide a company for the operation. 'C' Company commanded by Major John Frost was selected, but the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> so recently formed that Frost {{and many of his}} men had not yet completed their parachute jumping course.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} animal cruelty case {{surfaced}} in 2007, however, Vick's corporate status had deteriorated. Among the negative incidents was his middle finger gesture to Atlanta football fans in 2006. Vick's first endorsement after {{being released from}} prison was a two-year deal on January 27, 2011 with Unequal Technologies, a company that produces football pads. Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. The <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009; his re-signing {{marked the first time}} a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him.|$|E
5|$|Great Britain {{responded to}} the Boston Tea Party in 1774 with the Coercive Acts. The first of these acts was the Boston Port Act, which closed Boston's {{commerce}} until the East India <b>Company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> repaid for the destroyed tea. The Massachusetts Government Act rewrote the Massachusetts Charter, making many officials royally appointed rather than elected, and severely restricting the activities of town meetings. The Administration of Justice Act allowed colonists charged with crimes to be transported to another colony or to Great Britain for trial. A new royal governor was appointed to enforce the acts: General Thomas Gage, who was also commander of British military forces in North America.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Cosby's only {{contract}} was with Jell-O, {{but by the}} end of the year he had added two more endorsements. By August, Cosby began promoting E. F. Hutton & Co. with a series of print and television advertisements, and comedy concerts. The <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> accused of fraud and needed a spokesperson who was well-liked. Soon after Cosby's commercials aired, the company merged with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. In late December, he added J. Walter Thompson agency account Kodak Colorwatch System photographic processing system to his list. The estimated $10 million contract included commercials featuring Cosby to run in print, on television, as point of sale, and in promotional programs.|$|E

5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and his <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{considered}} {{a continuation of}} the cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is {{considered a}} step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|Seeing the {{continued}} success of Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering, {{the game and}} toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999, for about US$325million. Hasbro had expressed interest in purchasing Wizards of the Coast as early as 1994, and had been further impressed after the success of its Pokémon game. Avalon Hill was made a division of Wizards of the Coast, in late 1999; the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> purchased by Hasbro {{in the summer of}} 1998.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Fort Rosalie {{destroyed}} {{some of the}} Louisiana colony's most productive farms and endangered shipments of food and trade goods on the Mississippi River. As a result, the French state returned control of Louisiana from the French West India Company to the crown in 1731, as the <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> having trouble running the colony. Louisiana governor Étienne Périer was {{held responsible for the}} massacre and its aftermath, and he was recalled to France in 1732.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists {{to the project}} (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test results from a single instrument.|$|E
5|$|Toxicology testing became {{important}} in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating drugs were more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a <b>company</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, {{in response to the}} Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.|$|E
