25|$|The Baeyer–Villiger {{oxidation}} is {{an organic}} reaction that forms an ester from a ketone or a lactone from a <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone,</b> using peroxyacids or peroxides as the oxidant. The reaction {{is named after}} Adolf von Baeyer and Victor Villiger who first reported the reaction in 1899.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{oxidation}} {{yields the}} corresponding aldehyde, which can then undergo a Prins reaction with the neighboring alkene. After elimination and further oxidation, {{the product is}} a <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone.</b> If this product is undesired, powdered sodium acetate {{can be used as}} a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation. The robustness of PCC as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis (Scheme 3). This example illustrates that PCC is capable of performing a Dauben oxidative rearrangement with tertiary alcohols through a -sigmatropic rearrangement.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of this direct β-arylation of aldehydes led to related reactions for the β-functionalization of <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones.</b> In particular, β-arylation of <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> has been achieved under similar reaction conditions, but using azepane as the secondary amine cocatalyst. A photocatalytic [...] "homo-aldol" [...] reaction works for <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones,</b> allowing the coupling of the beta-position of the ketone to the ipso carbon of aryl ketones, such as benzophenone and acetophenone. In addition to the azepane cocatalyst, this reaction {{requires the use of}} the more strongly reducing photoredox catalyst Ir(ppy)3 and the addition of lithium hexafluoroarsenide (LiAsF6) to promote single-electron reduction of the aryl ketone.|$|R

40|$|We detail {{our efforts}} toward the {{selective}} detection of <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones,</b> e. g. cyclohexanone, {{a component of}} plasticized explosives. Thin films comprised of a conjugated polymer are used to amplify the emission of an emissive receptor via energy transfer. We propose that the energy transfer is dominated by an electron-exchange mechanism to an upper excited state of the fluorophore followed by relaxation and emission {{to account for the}} efficient energy transfer in the absence of appreciable spectral overlap. Exposure to <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> results in a ratiometric fluorescence response. The thin films show orthogonal responses when exposed to <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> versus acyclic ketones. We demonstrate that the exquisite selectivity {{is the result of a}} subtle balance between receptor design and the partition coefficient of molecules into the polymer matrix. United States.

50|$|Although a {{derivative}} of 12-aminododecanoic acid, {{it is made}} from cyclododecatriene. The triene is hydrogenated to the saturated alkane, cyclododecane. In the process adopted by Evonik Industries, the cycloalkane is oxidized to the ketone cyclododecanone using a boric acid catalyst. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> is converted to the oxime by condensation with hydroxylamine. Under strong acidic conditions and elevated temperatures (115 °C), the oxime converts via a Beckmann rearrangement to laurolactam.|$|E
50|$|Blanc's Rule {{says that}} heating a barium salt of a dicarboxylic acid, or {{dehydrating}} it with acetic anhydride will yield a cyclic acid anhydride if the carbon atoms bearing acid groups are in position 1 and (3,4 or 5). So succinic acid will yield succinic anhydride. For acids with carboxylic groups at position 1 and 6 this dehydration causes loss {{of carbon dioxide}} and water to form a <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone,</b> for example adipic acid will form cyclopentanone.|$|E
40|$|The first {{enantioselective}} organocatalytic α-allylation of <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> {{has been}} accomplished via singly occupied molecular orbital catalysis. Geometrically constrained radical cations, forged from the one-electron oxidation of transiently generated enamines, readily undergo allylic alkylation {{with a variety of}} commercially available allyl silanes. A reasonable latitude in both the ketone and allyl silane components is readily accommodated in this new transformation. Moreover, three new oxidatively stable imidazolidinone catalysts have been developed that allow <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> to successfully participate in this transformation. The new catalyst platform has also been exploited in the first catalytic enantioselective α-enolation and α-carbooxidation of ketones...|$|R

40|$|A {{novel and}} {{practical}} synthesis of heterocyclic enamines {{has been developed}} from the formal ring enlargement of <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones,</b> which comprised the retro-Reformatsky fragmentation reaction as a key step. Under alkaline bromination conditions, the Reformatsky adducts derived from five- to seven-membered <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones</b> underwent efficiently a direct retro-Reformatsky fragmentation, followed by spontaneous alpha,alpha-dibromination, to produce alpha,alpha,omega-tribromo-beta-ketoester compounds in a one-pot reaction. Highly regioselective reduction of alpha,alpha,omega-tribromo-beta-ketoesters with Cu-Zn alloy under mild conditions afforded omega-bromo-beta-ketoesters in good to excellent yields. Treatment of omega-bromo-beta-ketoesters with sodium azide followed by intramolecular aza-Wittig reaction or catalytic hydrogenation furnished heterocyclic secondary enamines, while a straightforward cyclocondensation of omega-bromo-beta-ketoesters with amines {{led to the formation}} of heterocyclic tertiary enamines...|$|R
50|$|Ring opening as a {{means of}} ring {{expansion}} can also be applied to larger systems to give access to even larger ring syscyclization. The Grob fragmentation can be applied as an example of such an expansion. Like the pinacol type migration the Grob fragmentation relies on an electron donating group to promote the bond migration and encourage the leaving group to be expelled. In this case the electron donating group can be a pseudo electron donating group which is capable of eliminating and donating an electron pair into the carbon with the breaking bond. Working with two smaller rings can allow for elaboration of two parts of the molecule separately before working with the expanded ring.The Dowd-Beckwith ring expansion is also capable of adding several carbons to a ring at a time,e of adding several carbons to a ring at a time, and is a useful tool for making large rings. While it proceeds through an intermediate bicycle the final cyclization and ring opening take place within the same radical reaction. This expansion is useful because it allows the expansion of a beta-ketoester to a large <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> which can easily be elaborated using either the <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone</b> or the exocyclic ester.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{migration}} {{introduction of}} carbon is a pinacol rearrangement. While this reaction refers specifically to a vicinal dihydroxide rearrangement, {{there are other}} pinacol type rearrangements that proceed through the same general mechanism such as the Tiffeneau-Demjanov rearrangement. These [...] "semipinacol rearrangements occur under milder conditions and are thus preferable in complex syntheses. These reactions are useful beyond simply expanding a ring because the exocyclic group attacked may also have other functionality appended to it besides the leaving group. The group to which the endocyclic bond migrates can also be selectively added to the ring based on the functionality already present, for example 1,2 addition into a <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone.</b>|$|E
50|$|A common {{case is the}} {{presence}} of two atoms that are not carbon in one of the rings, with those two rings both attached to the spiro atom; indeed, often the earliest exposure of a chemist in training to a spiro compound is to a heterocyclic form, the ketal (acetal) formed in the protection of ketones by diols and dithiols. An example of this is shown above, in the synthesis of the acetal 1,4-dioxaspiro4.5decane from cyclohexanone and ethanediol. In this case, because the four atoms attached to the spiro atom are not all carbons, the spiro atom is not a quaternary carbon. A further example of an acetal formed from a <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketone,</b> except with a dithiol, is the spiro compound spirapril, which has a five-membered ring formed from 1,2-ethanedithiol. Again, while the rings could be identical, in the heterocyclic case they are, again, almost always non-identical. Once again, the best-fit planes to each ring are generally non-coplanar to one another (i.e., the rings are not coplanar, despite appearing so in images).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to synthesize a novel compound, 2, 2, 6, 6 -dispirocyclobutylpiperidine- 4 -one (P), for use as an oxidation reactant to form the corresponding nitroxyl radical.

Sakai uses a variety of 6 -member <b>cyclic</b> <b>ketones,</b> which are quite stable.
