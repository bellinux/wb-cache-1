40|$|Oxygenic {{photosynthesis}} {{will have}} {{a key role in}} a sustainable future. It is therefore significant that this process can be engineered in organisms such as cyanobacteria to construct <b>cell</b> <b>factories</b> that catalyze the (sun) light-driven conversion of CO 2 and water into products like ethanol, butanol, or other biofuels or lactic acid, a bioplastic precursor, and oxygen as a byproduct. It is of key importance to optimize such <b>cell</b> <b>factories</b> to maximal efficiency. This holds for their light-harvesting capabilities under, for example, circadian illumination in large-scale photobioreactors. However, this also holds for the "dark" reactions of photosynthesis, that is, the conversion of CO 2, NADPH, and ATP into a product. Here, we present an analysis, based on metabolic control theory, to estimate the optimal capacity for product formation with which such cyanobacterial <b>cell</b> <b>factories</b> have to be equipped. Engineered l-lactic acid producing Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strains are used to identify the relation between production rate and enzymatic capacity. The analysis shows that the engineered <b>cell</b> <b>factories</b> for l-lactic acid are fully limited by the metabolic capacity of the product-forming pathway.

40|$|Cell {{factories}} {{are important and}} new tools to produce valuable products without depending on depleting fossil fuels. As there are successive <b>cell</b> <b>factory</b> constructions, there are emerging needs to develop better analysis tools for them. The conventional analysis methods such as 2 -dimentional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry are certainly eligible for <b>cell</b> <b>factory</b> analysis, {{but they are not}} necessarily the most reasonable methods because of the need for special equipment. Therefore, new tools for <b>cell</b> <b>factory</b> analysis are needed. Aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO) and bacterial luciferase (LuxAB) are interesting target proteins whose bacterial productions were analyzed here: ADO is an enzyme involved in fatty alkanes or alkenes generation in bacteria, and LuxAB is an enzyme catalyzing the bioluminescence production. Fatty alkanes and alkenes production by bacteria is drawing attention since it could replace the traditional chemical production of traffic fuels. Bioluminescence is also notable because it {{can be used as a}} real-time monitoring tool for certain bacterial production. Therefore, in this study, immunoassay was studied as a new method for <b>cell</b> <b>factory</b> analysis. Especially, the immunoassay systems for ADO and LuxAB were constructed. The best working scFvs for the immunoassays were successfully selected, and the standard curves were also drawn for both of them. Thus, enzyme immunoassay using alkaline phosphatase (phoA) for ADO and a new immunoassay for LuxAB were established in this study. In the immunoassay for LuxAB, LuxAB generates the signals to be measured using exogenously added long-chain aldehyde as substrate, thus no tracer scFv or labels are needed. The systems were confirmed to work with ADO and LuxAB produced by Escherichia coli but not by Acinetobacter baylyi ADP 1. The possible reason could be that A. baylyi ADP 1 strains did not produce enough amounts of the proteins for the immunoassays. Thus, further research is still needed, but this study offers a meaningful foundation for the development of the immunoassays...|$|E

To be of value for industrial biotechnology, mathematical models {{should be able to}} assist in the rational design of <b>cell</b> <b>factory</b> properties or in the production processes in which they are utilized.
