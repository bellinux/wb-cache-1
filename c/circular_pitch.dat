This thesis analyzes the nonlinear dynamics of two-body tethered satellite systems using numerical tools of analysis such as phase plane plots, power spectral densities (PSD's), Poincare sections and first Lyapunov exponents, as well as approximate analytical methods including the method of Melnikov. Motion in the stationkeeping phase wherein the tethered system is just a gravity gradient pendulum is studied, first considering pitch motion only, and then considering the coupled pitch and roll motions.

40|$|Results from an {{experimental}} investigation of flow field generated by pitched and yawed jets discharging from a flat plate into a cross-flow are presented. The <b>circular</b> jet was <b>pitched</b> at alpha = 20 deg and 45 deg and yawed between Beta = 0 deg and 90 deg in increments of 15 deg. The measurements were performed with two -wires providing all three components of velocity and turbulent stresses. These {{data were obtained}} at downstream locations of x = 3, 5, 10 and 20, where the distance x, normalized by the jet diameter, is measured {{from the center of}} the orifice. Data for all configurations were acquired at a momentum-flux ratio J = 8. Additionally, for selected angles and locations, surveys were conducted for J = 1. 5, 4, and 20. As expected, the jet penetration is found to be higher at larger alpha. With increasing beta the jet spreads more. The rate of reduction of peak streamwise vorticity, max, with the downstream distance is significantly less at higher Beta but is found to be practically independent of alpha. Thus, at the farthest measurement station x = 20, xmax is about five times larger for Beta = 75 deg compared to the levels at Beta = 0 deg. Streamwise velocity within the jet-vortex structure is found to depend on the parameter J. At J = 1. 5 and 4, 'wake-like' velocity profiles are observed. In comparison, a 'jet-like' overshoot is present at higher J. Distributions of turbulent stresses for various cases are documented. Peak normal stresses are found to occur within the core of the streamwise vortices. With yaw, at lower values of J, high turbulence is also observed in the boundary layer underneath the jet-vortex structur...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} seismic {{performance}} of {{components of a}} typical pre 1970 's New Zealand non-ductile reinforced concrete waffle slab frame structure constructed with plain round reinforcing steel. The experimental program tests {{the top and bottom}} sections of a typical concrete column, and a two-bay waffle floor slab sub-assemblage. The specimen of the scaled bottom section of the typical column is an octagonal section with a circular reinforcing steel arrangement on a pitch circle diameter of 41 Omm. The reinforcing steel is lapped at the base with a lap length of 45 db. The analysis and results indicate a lap-splice failure mechanism with pinching of the hysteresis loops after the nominal flexural capacity of the specimen is reached. The section has an effective moment of inertia of O. l 6 Ig and a yield drift, 8 y of 0. 62 %. It is possible from the new theory developed to predict whether a lap-splice failure mechanism will form and at what stage strength degradation begins. Hysteretic · modelling of the experimental results is possible with the proposed hysteresis rule. The specimen of the scaled top section of the typical column is an octagonal section with a 215 mm high column capital. The reinforcing steel arrangement is <b>circular</b> on a <b>pitch</b> circle diameter of 41 Omm with additional reinforcement at 45 degrees in the column capital. The analysis and results indicate a flexural failure mechanism with pinching of the hysteresis loops due to slip of the reinforcement. The section has an effective moment of inertia of 0. 19 Ig and a yield drift, 8 y of 0. 65 %. Hysteretic modelling of the experimental results is possible with currently available hysteresis rules. The scaled two-bay waffle floor slab sub-assemblage supported by three central columns is tested to determine the critical failure mechanism. Scaling symmetry and elongation allowances are incorporated into the design of the testing setup. The results match the structural assessment predictions of a unidirectional flexural yield line failure mechanism. The effective moment of inertia of the floor slab is 0. 43 Ig and the full flexural strength is reached at an interstorey drift of 1. 0 %. The bay elongation characteristics of the specimen are matched by the theory for elongation of unidirectional hinges. Elements of an assessment methodology for reinforced concrete structures are discussed and the outcomes of such an assessment related to damage state indices for both pre and post earthquake assessments.

These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid {{unnecessary}} wear and damage. An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case.
