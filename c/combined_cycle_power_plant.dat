Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, hydropower and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and maximum demand of 396.5 MW. While the East Coast Grid supplies electricity to the major towns of Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau with a capacity of 333.02 MW and maximum demand of 203.3 MW.|$|E

Being an agricultural town, Mannargudi's economy largely depends on the income from agriculture. The crops cultivated include paddy, cotton, sugarcane, and pulses like urad and mung bean. The agriculture around the town mainly depends on the rivers Koraiyaru, Mullaiyar and Pamaniyar, while the other sources of irrigation are bore-wells. There are no big industries around the town, while there are a few small scale industries like a sugarcane factory, a fertilizer industry, a beer factory and a chemical factory in and around the town.

500|$|The name of Bintulu {{was derived}} from the local native {{language}} [...] "Mentu Ulau" [...] (picking heads). Bintulu was a small fishing village when Rajah James Brooke acquired it in 1861. Brooke later built a fort there in 1862. In 1867, the first General Council meeting (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly) was convened in Bintulu. It is the earliest state legislature system in Malaysia. The construction of the earliest airstrip in Bintulu began in 1934 but was halted in 1938 due to financial difficulties. During World War II, the airstrip was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British later rebuilt the airstrip, and it became fully operational in 1955. The old airport was replaced by a new airport in 2002. Bintulu remained a fishing village until 1969 when oil and gas reserves were discovered off the coast. Since then, Bintulu has become the centre of energy intensive industries such as a Malaysia LNG plant, a Shell Middle Distillate Synthesis plant, and a Bintulu <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> The economy has also expanded into oil palm and forest plantations, palm oil processing, wood-waste processing, and cement manufacturing. The port of Bintulu is the busiest in Sarawak. The town is also a gateway to Samalajau Industrial Park.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of single shaft combined cycle power plants {{is that the}} number of steam turbines, condensers and condensate systems – and perhaps the number of cooling towers and circulating water systems – increases to match the number of gas turbines. For a multi-shaft <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> there is only one steam turbine, condenser {{and the rest of the}} heat sink for up to three gas turbines; only their size increases. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale. [...] A larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle. Thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> or a multiple shaft <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is more economical.|$|E
2500|$|One type {{of fossil}} fuel power plant uses a gas turbine in {{conjunction}} with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). It is referred to as a <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> because it combines the Brayton cycle of the gas turbine with the Rankine cycle of the HRSG. [...] The thermal efficiency of these plants has reached a record heat rate of 5690 Btu/(kW·h), or just under 60%, at a facility in Baglan Bay, Wales.|$|E
50|$|ICEs drive some of {{the large}} {{electric}} generators that power electrical grids. They {{are found in the}} form of combustion turbines in <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> with a typical electrical output in the range of 100 MW to 1 GW. The high temperature exhaust is used to boil and superheat water to run a steam turbine. Thus, the efficiency is higher because more energy is extracted from the fuel than what could be extracted by the combustion turbine alone. In <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> efficiencies in the range of 50% to 60% are typical. In a smaller scale Diesel generators are used for backup power and for providing electrical power to areas not connected to an electric grid.|$|R
40|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature in}} the design of <b>Combined</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Plants</b> (CCPP), as the gas turbines become larger and the exhaust temperatures rise, is the use of Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) with supercritical (SC) steam properties. The paper is orientated at assessing the potential of using supercritical steam <b>cycles</b> in <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> The interaction between gas turbine and HRSG thermodynamic is mainly focused. The analysis is based on minimizing total exergy losses in order to optimise the performance of the HRSG-steam turbine system. In the paper the alternative design of <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> in which a supercritical (SC) HRSG is present has been analyzed. The analysis includes a comparison of three different supercritical HRSG configurations with single (SC 1 RH) and double reheaters (SC 2 RH) with simple HRSG single pressure configurations and advanced double and triple pressure HRSG structures. The HRSG structures (steam pressure, maximum temperature and mass flow rate) are designed considering as objective function the minimization of the total exergy losses in the system composed by HRSG and steam turbine (ST). The optimization procedure is based on combination of random-search and simplex method. The evaluation shows that even if the use of supercritical HRSG is non particularly convenient in the perspective of efficiency increase it can be a valid technical solution aiming to the development of medium size (50 - 120 MW) <b>combined</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Four different commercially available gas turbine cycles have been tested for this specific purpose obtaining efficiency level approaching in particular cases {{the state of the art}} results with simpler technical solutions...|$|R
