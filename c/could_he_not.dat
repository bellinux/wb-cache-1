25|$|In June 1892, Ranjitsinhji {{left the}} Borrisow home and, with {{monetary}} assistance from relations, moved {{into his own}} rooms {{in the city of}} Cambridge. He lived in luxury and frequently entertained guests lavishly. According to writer Alan Ross, Ranjitsinhji may have been lonely in his first years at Cambridge and probably encountered racism and prejudice. Ross believes that his generosity may have partly arisen from trying to overcome these barriers. However, Ranjitsinhji increasingly lived beyond his means {{to the point where he}} experienced financial difficulty. He intended to pass the examinations to be called to the Bar and wrote to ask Vibhaji to provide more money to cover the costs; Vibhaji sent the money on the condition Ranjitsinhji returned to India once he passed the examination. Ranjitsinhji intended to keep to this arrangement, although he did not plan a career as a barrister, but his debts were larger than he had thought and not only <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> afford the cost of the Bar examination, he was forced to leave Cambridge University, without graduating, in spring 1894.|$|E
2500|$|Does Thomas Mann [...] {{really believe}} that in 'the Germany of Himmler' one should not be {{permitted}} to play Beethoven? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> realize that people never needed more, never yearned more to hear Beethoven and his message of freedom and human love, than precisely these Germans, who had to live under Himmlerâ€™s terror? I do not regret having stayed with them.|$|E
60|$|Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> leave her? Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> throw {{himself into}} the hidden water to live or die, as might be? He could not, he could not. But supposing he went away, right away, and found work, and had a lodging again. He could be again {{as he had been}} before.|$|E
60|$|Gerald stood transfixed, {{his soul}} echoing in horror. He would move, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> move his limbs. His brain seemed to re-echo, like a pulse.|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} give himself again to the organ. But <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get back. All the time a sort of string was tugging, tugging him elsewhere, miserably.|$|R
60|$|No, it was <b>not</b> /that/. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do it. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> shoot a {{sleeping}} woman, devil though she was; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> kill {{her in her}} sleep. His nature rose up against it.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she was not}} yet married. They were, {{according}} to these lines, to be soon united. It appeared they had travelled together; that thought gave him a pang. <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> see her? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> explain all? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> prove that his heart had ever been true and fond? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> tell her all that had happened, all that he had suffered, all the madness of his misery; and could she resist that voice whose accents had once been her joy, that glance which had once filled her heart with rapture? And when she found that Ferdinand, her own Ferdinand, had indeed never deceived her, was worthy of her choice affection, and suffering even at this moment for her sweet sake, what were all the cold-blooded ties {{in which she had}} since involved herself? She was his by an older and more ardent bond. Should he not claim his right? Could she deny it? ...|$|E
6000|$|Quest. <b>Could</b> <b>He</b> <b>not</b> have {{suffered}} without His so suffering? Would not His dying only {{of a natural}} death have served the turn? ...|$|E
6000|$|Now Theo and {{her mother}} were full of pity for Harry; but Hetty's heart was rather hard and {{seemingly}} savage towards him. She chafed that his position was not more glorious; she was angry {{that he was still}} dependent and idle. The whole world was in arms, and <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> carry a musket? It was harvest-time, {{and hundreds of thousands of}} reapers were out with their flashing sickles; <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> use his, and cut down his sheaf or two of glory? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{prevent her}} from taking his hands, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> look at her.|$|R
60|$|Lemuel was pleased, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> say a word. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> look at Statira.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{said all}} this to himself, but <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do it. <b>He</b> simply <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> knew himself.|$|R
6000|$|Mellowkent sat {{and watched}} the hard-featured, resolute, pitiless salesman, as he sat doggedly in the chair wherein he had {{installed}} himself, unflinchingly extolling the merits of his undesired wares. A spirit of wistful emulation took possession of the author; why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> {{live up to the}} cold stern name he had adopted? Why must he sit here weakly and listen to this weary, unconvincing tirade, why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> be Mark Mellowkent for a few brief moments, and meet this man on level terms? ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{was there}} any hope for her? <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> take her to some nunnery midway, and let her write to her uncle to fetch her from thence? ...|$|E
6000|$|Dor. Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> {{find more}} of us? Pray, sister, [...] Let you and I {{look up and}} down one day, [...] To find some little ones for us to play with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing only--I've got a {{situation}} for you," [...] replied Richard as coolly as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> although <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> suppress a hearty smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what did}} <b>he</b> say? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> say <b>he</b> wished {{me to take}} Fanny. I am sure in his heart <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> wish me to do it." ...|$|R
60|$|Fred moved pettishly, but as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refuse, <b>he</b> only told Henrietta that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> bear any one {{to look at}} {{him while}} his pulse was felt.|$|R
6000|$|Magadar {{said this}} with a grave countenance, for, however little he cared {{for the loss of}} the father, that of the {{daughter}} distressed him a little--not much, however; for <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> console himself with another wife? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fitzjocelyn! Then it is Fitzjocelyn, is it?' he exclaimed. 'Then, why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> {{set about}} it openly and honourably? Does his father object? I {{would not have}} thought it of you, Isabel, nor of the lad neither!' ...|$|E
60|$|There was a stillness with {{a little}} joy. He could not tell her any more. Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> tell her any more? She felt a pang of disconsolate sadness. But it was nothing. She went to him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh no, poor fellow, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> wants all we {{can send}} him, or we would have put the little boys to a better school.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> rest, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stay [...] Within {{his tent}} {{to wait for}} day; [...] But walked him forth along the sand, [...] Where {{thousand}} sleepers strewed the strand.|$|R
60|$|He got up {{and took}} his rod. What was the use? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> stay there with her, since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not--must <b>not</b> speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your servant had {{to assassinate}} two persons." [...] This I have {{mentioned}} before. Why had he to assassinate two persons,* when one was enough? If {{he had killed}} Peytel, <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> have seized and gagged his wife immediately? ...|$|E
6000|$|Outside, in the passage, her smile, like {{something}} actual on the air, preceded him--the smile {{that had just}} lasted out. But when {{he was back in}} the study, he suffered--suffered! Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> have that pain to bear instead? ...|$|E
60|$|DAVID. That's how I like to {{hear you}} speak. A young Scotsman of your ability let loose upon the world with L300, what <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> do? It's almost appalling to think of; {{especially}} if he went among the English.|$|E
60|$|What {{would happen}} {{at the end of}} the spell? <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tell. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> imagine. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> imagine the {{thoughts}} of these men. He was sensible only of their hostility and utter want of sympathy. Vague possibilities of shame and violence chased one another across his mind. <b>Could</b> <b>he</b> devise some weapon? He recalled his assault upon the hypnotist, but there were no detachable lamps here. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see nothing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> catch up in his defence.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was going}} to ask why she was drooping; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> <b>He</b> said, {{recurring}} to the letter of the overseers, [...] "So Patmos is a city." ...|$|R
6000|$|I shouted, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hear; [...] Made signs, {{but these}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see; And still, {{without a doubt}} or fear, [...] Broadcast he {{scattered}} anarchy.|$|R
60|$|Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> {{have left}} the matter to the future? But now, with Florimond to be murdered on the morrow at La Rochette, himself likely to be murdered within the hour at Condillac, Valerie was at their mercy utterly.|$|E
60|$|The {{thought had}} {{a quality of}} utter unreality. Who was he? Why was he holding so tightly with his hands? Why <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> leave go? In such a fall as this countless dreams have ended. But in a moment he would wake....|$|E
6000|$|Yet <b>could</b> <b>he</b> <b>not</b> {{his closing}} eyes withdraw, [...] Though {{less and less}} of Emily he saw; [...] So, {{speechless}} for a little space he lay, [...] Then grasp'd the hand he held, and sigh'd his soul away. [...] Palamon and Acite.|$|E
60|$|What else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? <b>Not</b> even to God's elect {{does the}} sky always send down manna.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The foolish fellow,' says Wendy, 'tried {{to stick}} it on with soap, and when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I shouted, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hear; [...] Made signs, {{but these}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> see; [...] And still, {{without a doubt}} or fear, [...] Broadcast he {{scattered}} anarchy.|$|R
