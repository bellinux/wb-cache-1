5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular, readily available materials. In contrast, many types of <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power is}} variable, and during low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power, is more frequent than those of <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, {{may be able to}} deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce water consumption by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E

First, the expressions of meshing forces on the line tooth of line gears are deduced; the deformations and stresses of existing structures of a line gear pair are analyzed by using ANSYS Workbench. Then, the reliable structure and the parameters standardization formulae of a line gear pair are deduced by stiffness and strength analyses. Finally, a design case shows that the proposed design methods provide a convenient and reasonable design tool for designing a skew line gear pair in <b>conventional</b> <b>powered</b> transmission field...|$|R

25|$|The {{excess power}} {{generation}} capacity available in India is nearly 500 billion units/year presently and another 75,000 MW <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> generating capacity is in pipeline excluding the targeted 175,000 MW renewable power by 2022. The hydrogen fuel generated by 500 billion units of electricity can replace all diesel and petrol consumed by heavy and medium duty vehicles in India completely obviating {{the need of}} crude oil imports for internal consumption. Converting petrol/diesel driven road vehicles in to fuel cell electric vehicles on priority would save the huge import cost of crude oil and transform the stranded electricity infrastructure in to productive assets with major boost to the overall economic growth.|$|E

25|$|In {{an effort}} to help {{alleviate}} the shortage, three steel manufacturers in the Kanto region contributed electricity produced by their in-house <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> stations to TEPCO for distribution to the general public. Sumitomo Metal Industries could produce up to 500 MW, JFE Steel 400 MW, and Nippon Steel 500 MW of electric power Auto and auto parts makers in Kanto and Tōhoku agreed in May 2011 to operate their factories on Saturdays and Sundays and close on Thursdays and Fridays to assist in alleviating the electricity shortage during the summer of 2011. Additionally, the public and other companies were also encouraged to conserve electricity in the 2011 summer months (Setsuden).|$|E
25|$|The Birmingham, Bristol & Thames Junction Railway was {{authorised}} in 1836 to {{run from}} the London and Birmingham Railway (L), near the present Willesden Junction station, across the proposed route of the Great Western (GWR) on the level, to the Kensington Canal Basin. Construction was delayed by engineering and financial problems. Renamed the West London Railway (WLR) the line officially opened on 27 May 1844, and regular services began on 10 June, but before that trials to demonstrate {{the potential of the}} atmospheric railway system had been held from 1840 to 1843 on a half-mile section of track adjacent to Wormwood Scrubs, leased to that system's promoters; The WLR used <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> but was not a commercial success.

25|$|According to the Japanese trade ministry, around 4.4million {{households}} {{served by}} Tōhoku Electric Power (TEP) in northeastern Japan were left without electricity. Several nuclear and <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> plants went offline after the earthquake, reducing TEPCO's total capacity by 21 GW. Rolling blackouts began on 14 March due to power shortages {{caused by the}} earthquake. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), which normally provides approximately 40 GW of electricity, announced that it could only provide about 30 GW. This was because 40% of the electricity used in the greater Tokyo area was supplied by reactors in the Niigata and Fukushima prefectures. The reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi and Fukushima Dai-ni plants were automatically taken offline when the first earthquake occurred and sustained major damage related to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. Rolling blackouts of approximately three hours were experienced throughout April and May while TEPCO scrambled to find a temporary power solution. The blackouts affected Tokyo, Kanagawa, Eastern Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Chiba, Ibaraki, Saitama, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures. Voluntary reduced electricity use by consumers in the Kanto area helped reduce the predicted frequency and duration of the blackouts. By 21 March 2011, the number of households in the north without electricity fell to 242,927.|$|E

500|$|Many energy markets, institutions, and {{policies}} {{have been developed to}} support the production and use of fossil fuels. Newer and cleaner technologies may offer social and environmental benefits, but utility operators often reject renewable resources because they are trained to think only in terms of big, <b>conventional</b> <b>power</b> plants. Consumers often ignore renewable power systems because they are not given accurate price signals about electricity consumption. Intentional market distortions (such as subsidies), and unintentional market distortions (such as split incentives) may work against renewables. Benjamin K. Sovacool has argued that [...] "some of the most surreptitious, yet powerful, impediments facing renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States are more about culture and institutions than engineering and science".|$|E
