One commonly used technique for determining a material's elastic modulus and hardness from indentation load-displacement data is the Oliver-Pharr method. In this method, radial displacements, pile-up and film-substrate interactions are not explicitly considered. Models {{to address the}} importance of these issues are developed and compared with the finite element analyses. Good agreement is achieved in many cases. An elastic solution for indentation of a monolithic material was developed by Sneddon in the 1950 s. Analytical and finite element results are presented which show that modifications to Sneddon's solution are needed to describe elastic indentation accurately. Since most indentation methods for measuring mechanical properties are based on Sneddon's solution, these modifications have important consequences for making accurate measurements. A general modified formula is developed for an indenter whose shape can be described as a body of revolution of a power function. During the indentation process, samples plastically deformed by the indenter tend to pile up around the edge of <b>contact.</b> <b>Pile-up</b> can be a significant factor affecting the accuracy of indentation measurement. A new elastic-plastic model for conical indentation is presented which can increase the accuracy of the Oliver-Pharr method by accounting for this pile-up. The model is in good agreement with an empirical model proposed by Hainsworth and Page. Film/substrate interactions pose a particularly formidable problem in making indentation property measurements. In order to properly interpret experimental indentation data, an elastic solution for the film/substrate problem is highly desirable. However, an exact elastic solution is not available. In lieu of an exact solution, numerical methods and approximate methods are useful. A first order perturbation solution for the indentation of an elastic film on an elastic substrate is presented, the results of which are in good agreement with physical limits as well as with finite element results. Finite element analysis is a useful tool for studying elastic plastic indentation. With it, details of the indentation process which may be difficult to observe experimentally can be examined to gain insight into the mechanisms of contact. The finite element method has been used to examine the elastic-plastic behavior of a hard NiP film on a soft Cu substrate. The finite element results provide physical insight into unusual experimental behavior reported for this system...|$|E

Our main result shows that both the minimisation problems and the related singular integral equations have the same unique solution, which provides new regularity results on the minimiser of the energy and new positivity results on the solutions to singular integral equations.

Nanoindentation is ideally suited to determining the elastic and plastic properties of such layers and here we report on a combined approach using experimental nanoindentation and finite element analysis to extract yield stress and strain hardening exponent for an Al-clad system. The approach used was calibrated against results for an Al 2024 -T 351 alloy, where conventional mechanical testing data was available. For the Al 2024 -T 351, a forward analysis was used for extraction of load–displacement curves at different indentation depths with the help of elastic–plastic properties obtained from tensile testing. For a 100 μm clad layer of pure aluminium on Al 2024 -T 351, reverse analysis was used for extraction of elastic–plastic properties from a single indentation test. A yield stress of 110 – 120 MPa and a value of 0. 075 – 0. 1 for the work hardening exponent was obtained for the Al cladding.
