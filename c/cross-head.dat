He was going to forge and shrink a wrought-iron collar on the neck of the piston-rod where it joined the <b>cross-head,</b> and from the collar he would bolt a Y-shaped piece of iron whose lower arms should be bolted into the <b>cross-head.</b> If anything more were needed, they could use up the last of the boiler-plate.|$|E
60|$|The {{floating}} light's bell rung {{this morning}} at half-past four o'clock, as a signal for the boats to be got ready, and the landing took place at half-past five. In passing the Smeaton at her moorings near the rock, her boat followed with eight additional artificers who had come from Arbroath with her at last trip, but there being no room {{for them in the}} floating light's boats, they had continued on board. The weather did not look very promising in the morning, the wind blowing pretty fresh from W.S.W.: and had it not been that the writer calculated upon having a vessel so much at command, in all probability he would not have ventured to land. The Smeaton rode at what sailors call a salvagee, with a <b>cross-head</b> made fast to the floating buoy. This kind of attachment was found to be more convenient than the mode of passing the hawser through the ring of the buoy when the vessel was to be made fast. She had then only to be steered very close to the buoy, when the salvagee was laid hold of with a boat-hook, and the bite of the hawser thrown over the <b>cross-head.</b> But the salvagee, by this method, was always left at the buoy, and was, of course, more liable to chafe and wear than a hawser passed through the ring, which could be wattled with canvas, and shifted at pleasure. The salvagee and cross method is, however, much practised; but the experience of this morning showed it to be very unsuitable for vessels riding in an exposed situation for any length of time.|$|E

In order to obtain actual deformations, GCPs or stable area is required in the study area, which, however, may be unavailable in the investigating of geohazards associated with underground activities (i. e., groundwater pumping, underground mining, and oil/gas exploitation).

40|$|Although {{the past}} few decades have {{witnessed}} the great development of Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technology in the monitoring of landslides, such applications are limited by geometric distortions and ambiguity of 1 D Line-Of-Sight (LOS) measurements, both of which are the fundamental weakness of InSAR. Integration of multi-sensor InSAR datasets has recently shown its great potential in breaking through the two limits. In this study, 16 ascending images from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) and 18 descending images from the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) have been integrated to characterize and to detect the slow-moving landslides in Zhouqu, China between 2008 and 2010. Geometric distortions are first mapped by using the imaging geometric parameters of the used SAR data and public Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data of Zhouqu, which allow the determination of the most appropriate data assembly for a particular slope. Subsequently, deformation rates along respective LOS directions of ALOS ascending and ENVISAT descending tracks are estimated by conducting InSAR time series analysis with a Temporarily Coherent Point (TCP) -InSAR algorithm. As indicated by the geometric distortion results, 3 D deformation rates of the Xieliupo slope at the east bank of the Pai-lung River are finally reconstructed by joint exploiting of the LOS deformation rates from <b>cross-heading</b> datasets based on the surface-parallel flow assumption.

40|$|The German TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X {{satellites}} {{are characterized}} by unique features such as providing images with high spatial resolution and an unprecedented geometric accuracy. The latter has been significantly improved {{in the recent years}} by quantifying and removing the most prominent error sources which affect radar range and azimuth time measurements, a method called imaging geodesy [1]. Moreover, if corrected time observations of a specific target are available from SAR acquisitions with different viewing geometries, it has been demonstrated that the stereo SAR method is capable of delivering 3 -D absolute coordinates of the target with accuracies in the decimeter to centimeter regime, depending on the target being a corner reflector or an opportunistic persistent scatterer (PS) [2]. As a first step towards the inclusion of such accurately localized point targets into phase-based stacking methods, in [3] the concepts of imaging geodesy and stereo SAR were used to transform the relative estimates of SAR tomography (TomoSAR) into absolute 3 -D point clouds by absolutely localizing the reference point. The improvement in the localization accuracy of the resulting point cloud has encouraged us to continue expanding the mentioned framework by automatic detection and absolute localization of useful PS candidates which are visible from SAR images acquired from different viewing geometries, either same-heading or <b>cross-heading</b> orbit tracks. This will generate multiple Ground Control Points (GCPs) which {{can be used as a}} reference network in multi-pass InSAR techniques for reliable estimation and removal of atmospheric phase screen and for support in phase-unwrapping. The availability of such points can also be relevant for non-InSAR applications such as detection of large magnitude motions which are invisible from InSAR time-series approaches or as tie points for improving the registration of remotely sensed optical images. This contribution is dedicated to introducing an automated processing chain for generating GCPs from SAR data. The procedures start with the identification of high quality PS candidates, in some strategies with the aid of external data, to precisely extract PS timings in a stack of non-corregistered SAR images. The subsequent steps are the correction of PS timings and the absolute localization with the Stereo SAR method. It will also be demonstrated how these GCPs can be used to improve the geocoding accuracy of InSAR, in particular PSI, point clouds leading to providing absolute positions.

40|$|For decades, {{spaceborne}} Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry {{has evolved}} into a widely used geodetic method for three-dimensional mapping and analysing the geophysical processes of the surface of the earth. Nevertheless, effects such as atmospheric disturbances, temporal and geometric decorrelation are considered as the main degrading factors for the quality of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) products. By overcoming the major deficiencies of the conventional InSAR, Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) proved the applicability of the interferometric methods also in monitoring of urban areas by restricting the analysis only on the time-coherent scatterers. In particular, the launch of modern SAR sensors, such as the German TerraSAR-X, characterized with very high spatial resolution and short revisit times has enhanced the capability of PSI in mapping and deformation monitoring of urban areas. However, PSI considers only a single dominant scatterer in each resolution cell which is not a valid assumption in urban areas due to the prevalent occurrences of layover phenomenon. This gives the motivation to exploit the most advanced SAR interferometric method, namely tomographic SAR inversion (TomoSAR) including SAR Tomography and differential SAR Tomography. TomoSAR coupled with very high resolution TerraSAR-X images produces the most detailed multi-dimensional maps of urban areas by distinguishing among multiple scatterers within a resolution cell. Nevertheless in TomoSAR, similar to conventional InSAR and PSI, elevation and deformation rates are estimated with respect to a previously chosen reference point which makes them relative 3 D estimates. One unique feature of TerraSAR-X is the precise orbit determination and high geometrical localization accuracy of the sensor. After compensating for the most prominent geodynamics and atmospheric error sources, the absolute two-dimensional (range and azimuth) positions of targets such as corner reflectors and persistent scatterers can be estimated to centimetre-level accuracy, a method called SAR Imaging Geodesy. Moreover, using two or more SAR observations acquired from different satellite orbits, their absolute 3 D positions can be retrieved by means of Stereo-SAR. In this thesis a framework is proposed that fuses the SAR imaging geodesy and TomoSAR approaches to obtain absolute 3 D positions of a large amount of natural scatterers. The method is further utilized in order to automatically fuse multi-track TomoSAR point clouds. The methodology is applied on four Very High Resolution (VHR) TerraSAR-X spotlight image stacks acquired from the city of Berlin. The horizontal and vertical localization accuracy of the obtained fused point cloud is analysed by comparing them with a highly accurate geo-localized Digital Surface Model (DSM) of Berlin obtained from aerial laser scanning. The fusion of absolute TomoSAR point clouds obtained from <b>cross-heading</b> tracks also allows for the decomposition of the Line of Sight (LOS) motion observations into the real 3 D motion vectors. As the final contribution of this study, the 3 D motion decomposition of seasonal deformation observations is carried out on two test sites located in the city of Berlin.
