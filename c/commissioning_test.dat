40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{validation of the}} surge modeling results as well as lessons learnt from the <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> of the Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme in the UAE. The Scheme is divided in two systems, The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The focus {{of this paper is}} on the model predictions and field data recorded by the SCADA system during full pump trip and valve closure events. The validation was performed during the <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> and showed a perfect match between the prediction and measurement of pressure and flow of the first wave. This paper also intends to highlight lessons learnt during the <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> and in particular the major risk that is caused by inaccurate manufacturer data. On {{the first day of the}} <b>commissioning</b> <b>test,</b> a near incident took place where the pressure during valve closure unexpectedly exceeded the pressure rating by 16 %. Damage to the pipeline was avoided by pressing the emergency trip push-button of the pumps thereby preventing the pipeline from being exposed to the full pressure rise. The post-incident investigation revealed that the control valve characteristics provided and certified by the manufacturer were inaccurate. A difference in Kv of up to 20 % was measured for valve positions below 40 % open and the valves were fully closed at 5 % opening. The control valve characteristics were recalibrated on site and the valve closure pattern was adapted. The <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> was resumed and completed flawlessly.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control scheme using a pulsating high-frequency (HF) signal {{to minimize the}} position detection error and the velocity estimation ripple due to the zero current clamping (ZCC) effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows avoiding multiple zero-crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At no-load, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the loaded condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control enforces a much better estimation performance during ZCC region without a pre-defined offline <b>commissioning</b> <b>test</b> than the standard pulsating injection scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experimental results.

Large volume, non-segmented, low-background detectors for rare event physics, such as the multi-purpose SNO+ experiment, need a calibration system that allow an accurate and regular measurement of the performance parameters of their photomultiplier arrays, while minimising the risk of radioactivity ingress.

By the static analysis, fatigue analysis and frequency analysis of spindle and bearing using the FEM, the simulation results indicate that the optimized structures can meet the demands for the strength and dynamics of the flywheel system, which leads to safe and stable work, improve design efficiency effectively, shorten design cycles, and reduce production costs. In order to reduce the eccentric force of inertia and intensity of the vibration source, the need for computing unbalance spindle, and a mechanism for balancing, allowed reaching equilibrium precision.
