5000|$|In power engineering, {{winding factor}} is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor Kd. Another factor that can reduce the winding factor is when the slot pitch is smaller than the pole pitch, called pitch factor Kp. The winding factor can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the winding factor, Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems.

The parameters which influence {{the nature of}} flow in a helical <b>coil</b> are <b>pitch</b> <b>coil</b> diameter, <b>pitch</b> and tube diameter in helical coils. CFD analysis was carried out and their variation on thermal and hydraulic characteristics were analyzed, with varying Reynolds number (hot fluid) and varying tube-to-coil diameter ratios for a given flow velocity of cold fluid.

Thus, Nusselt number and friction factor were also calculated. Graphs were plotted between Nusselt number, friction factor, pressure drop and power loss with Reynolds number. The point where the friction fraction intersects with the Nusselt number is {{the point where the}} heat transfer is optimum, corresponding to that Reynolds number. Beyond that Reynolds number, the friction factor decreases rapidly, hence the pressure drop increases and so the power loss also increases.

It thus minimizes the degradation of thermal energy and viscous dissipation of mechanical energy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{applications}} of heat exchangers are vast and {{the enhancement of}} heat transfer and compact size are the key factors for designing the heat exchangers {{in order to achieve}} energy savings. In the field of tubular heat exchangers one of the possible ways for reducing the space occupied by the exchanger is by bending tube axis in helical shape. This option is particularly suitable when construction simplicity is needed and the geometry of the place in which the exchanger has to be housed is the cylindrical one. In this paper, an attempt is made to enhance the heat transfer rate without application of any external power. This is achieved by providing the helical tube in tubes. The parameters influencing the nature of flow in a helical coil heat exchanger are the tube geometry namely <b>pitch</b> <b>coil</b> diameter, <b>pitch</b> and tube diameter. CFD analysis is carried out to study these geometry effects on heat transfer and hydraulic characteristics by varying Reynolds number (hot fluid). The CFD results of velocity and temperature distribution in the heat exchanger are used to estimate the Nusselt number and heat transfer coefficient. This helps to arrive at an optimum value of Reynolds number and Nusselt number for the corresponding tube-to-coil diameter ratios...|$|R
40|$|Variable speed drives {{employing}} induction motors {{have been}} widely used in industry for decades. Today there is a continually increasing demand for more precise and flexible speed control usually with close attention to energy efficiency. The inverter is used because of its reliability, flexibility and relatively low cost. However its output a. c. voltage is not sinusoidal so the core losses in the induction motors consequently increase. This research is centred on the design and testing of the stator winding configuration of three phase induction motors with various coil pitches and measure the dynamic performance under sinusoidal and PWM supplies. Measurements were carried out to determine the behavior of harmonic losses and the efficiency of four identical three-phase 746 W induction motors with stator coil pitches of 180, 160, 140 and 120. The motors were fed from either a three-phase inverter or a three-phase sinusoidal voltage supply. The switching frequency was varied from 4 kHz to 16 kHz and the modulation frequency was varied between 30 Hz to 60 Hz. Simulations were carried out using OPERA 2 D software under sinusoidal voltage supply. The phenomenon of chording by l/n* of pole pitch to suppress the n* harmonic was particularly followed by motors with 120 and 160 coil pitches under sinusoidal voltage supply. This phenomenon was also followed by 120, 140 and 160 <b>coil</b> <b>pitch</b> motors under PWM voltage supply at all the switching frequencies and modulation * frequencies. The motor with 120 <b>coil</b> <b>pitch</b> showed a drastical increase in the lower order voltage harmonic components with simulation under sinusoidal supply when compared to full pitch motor. The total voltage harmonic distortion due to the third, fifth and ninth harmonics was less for the motor with 120 <b>coil</b> <b>pitch</b> under PWM voltage at higher switching frequencies and under over modulation condition. The efficiency of the same motor was higher at full load and over loads under all the switching frequencies and modulation frequencies. The measurement results and discussion enable motor manufacturers to consider 120 <b>coil</b> <b>pitch</b> motor under PWM voltage supply and 160 <b>coil</b> <b>pitch</b> motor under sinusoidal voltage supply for the 746 W induction motors as the increase in the efficiencies were 12 % and 5 % respectively when compared to full pitch motor.

40|$|Thin {{metallic}} straight wires or thicker wire coils may {{be incorporated}} into composite materials to tune their overall electromagnetic (EM) properties, e. g., to render their index of refraction equal to 1, over a range of frequencies. These wire arrays act as scattering elements, providing controlled response to EM radiation such as RF communication signals, radar, or other signals in the infrared range. Integrated into composites, the arrays further contribute to their structural integrity. Braided composites function as ideal hosts for coiled wire arrays due to the helical nature of the braiding process and the periodicity of laminated composites. The <b>coil's</b> <b>pitch</b> and diameter, as primary EM tuning parameters, can be closely controlled in the braiding process to optimize EM properties. Structural fibers are braided with copper wire to form individual elements of the array. Additionally, thermoplastic matrix fibers are commingled into the core and outer portions of the braid to facilitate complete fiber wetting of the composite and ensure structural integrity. These elements are woven, or oriented otherwise, into layers to form arrays with periodic spacing in three dimensions. The composite is then laminated, together with additional thermoplastic matrix material, to yield a fully integrated system with tunable multifunctional properties. Chiral EM properties in the composite, resulting from the helical configuration and periodic arrangement of the wires, can be controlled or completely eliminated by design in the braiding and weaving processes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel elastomeric composite that exhibits a deformation-induced change in chirality. Previous efforts primarily {{dealt with a}} coil array in air without chiral tuning. Here, a composite is created that consists of an array of parallel, metallic helices of the same handedness embedded in a polymer matrix. The chiral response of the composite depends on <b>pitch,</b> <b>coil</b> diameter, wire thickness and <b>coil</b> spacing; however, <b>pitch</b> has the greatest effect on electromagnetic performance. The present study explores this effect by using helical elements to construct a chiral medium that can be mechanically stretched to adjust pitch. This adjustment directly affects the overall chirality of the composite. A prototype sample of the composite, fabricated for operation between 5. 5 – 12. 5 GHz, demonstrates repeatable elastic deformation. Using a transmit/receive measurement setup, the composite scattering response is measured over the frequency interval. The results indicate substantial tuning of chirality through deformation. An increase in axial strain of up to 30 % yields a ∼ 18 % change in axial chirality. (Some figures may appear in colour only in the online journal) 1...|$|R
