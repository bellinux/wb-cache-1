5|$|In 1960, Wanzlick and {{co-workers}} conjectured that carbenes derived from dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene were produced by vacuum pyrolysis of the corresponding 2-trichloromethyl dihydroimidazole compounds {{with the loss}} of <b>chloroform.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>chloroform</b> extract of {{the aerial}} part of Tephrosia apollinea also {{revealed}} seven new 8-prenylated flavonoids, including tephroapollin A-G (1-7).|$|E
5|$|Betances {{introduced}} new surgical and aseptic {{procedures to}} Puerto Rico. With {{the assistance of}} Venezuelan anesthesiologist Pedro Arroyo, Betances performed the first ever surgical procedure under <b>chloroform</b> in Puerto Rico, in November 1862.|$|E
50|$|Jillian Jackson, a {{traveling}} comedian, {{is tied up}} and <b>chloroformed</b> by the doctor before being injected with the same substance.|$|R
50|$|In 1951 {{the group}} raided two police {{stations}} {{in order to}} get weapons and ammunition. In both cases one policeman was killed (one of them previously <b>chloroformed</b> and handcuffed).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} Joe indulgently, [...] "they 'as {{their own}} kind of intoxication, too--that's true; and the fumes is permanent; they're gassed all the time, and <b>chloroformed</b> the rest.|$|R
5|$|Historically {{the removal}} of <b>chloroform</b> by vacuum {{pyrolysis}} of d adducts was used by Wanzlick in his early attempts to prepare dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes but this method is not widely used. The Enders laboratory has used vacuum pyrolysis of a c adduct to generate a triazolium-5-ylidene c.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like <b>chloroform</b> and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general it exists as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed structural formula of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated ether {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma. It is miscible with ethanol, acetone, <b>chloroform,</b> diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E
2500|$|In 1834, French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas {{determined}} <b>chloroform's</b> {{empirical formula}} and named it.H2Cl6." [...] (Thus {{it seems to}} me to show that the substance [...] analyzed by me … has as [...] formula: [...] C2H2Cl6.) ...|$|R
50|$|Rome is <b>chloroformed</b> {{and beaten}} {{by a pair}} of thugs, and Turpin is found murdered in Rome's office. Lt. Dave Santini (Richard Conte) of the Miami police investigates the crime scene and demands {{information}} from Rome, who's an old friend.|$|R
60|$|Little Purr {{was caught}} in a trap, set for a woodchuck, and so hurt she had to be gently <b>chloroformed</b> out of life. Mother Bunch still remained, and often used to go and sit sadly under the tree where her infants were buried,--an afflicted, yet {{resigned}} parent.|$|R
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, <b>chloroform</b> and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, <b>chloroform</b> and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few years of her life—including <b>chloroform</b> addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E
50|$|Holmes and Watson {{go back to}} Three Gables to {{investigate}} a burglary that has happened there. The burglars <b>chloroformed</b> Mrs. Maberley and stole a manuscript from her son's belongings. She retained part of one sheet of paper from it when, coming round, she lunged {{after one of the}} thieves.|$|R
50|$|Like many American {{films of}} the time, The Kaiser's Shadow was subject to cuts by city and state film {{censorship}} boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors cut, in Reel 2, three scenes of <b>chloroforming</b> a young woman and, in Reel 5, the shooting of a police officer.|$|R
30|$|In {{the tubes}} {{containing}} the leaf extracts, {{there was a}} risk {{of the existence of}} chlorophylls; we tried to eliminate it by adding in 3  ml of extract 0.5  ml of <b>chloroforms</b> the tubes are vortexed and centrifuged 5  min at 5 × 1, 000 mtp; two phases were separated, a phase supernatant and pellet.|$|R
5|$|In 1854, a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis in a living human. In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with <b>chloroform.</b> In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with <b>chloroform</b> or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, The Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. Both men {{tried to use}} their size and power to control the match. Gonzalez used a reverse chinlock to wear The Undertaker down and {{attacked}} him outside the ring. The Undertaker regained control of the match and knocked Gonzalez onto his knees. Harvey Wippleman threw Gonzalez a rag soaked with <b>chloroform,</b> which Gonzalez used to knock The Undertaker unconscious. The referee disqualified Gonzalez for using a foreign object and awarded the match to The Undertaker. After the match, The Undertaker recovered and attacked Giant Gonzalez.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1915, {{thrown off}} course by heavy fog, Madon flew into Swiss air space while {{qualifying}} upon a new [...] Farman, and was interned for several months. It took him two tries to escape, but he freed himself in December by <b>chloroforming</b> and kidnapping his guard. His reward was a court-martial and 60 days confinement.|$|R

5|$|Lipids are {{the most}} diverse group of biochemicals. Their main {{structural}} uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external, such as the cell membrane, or {{as a source of}} energy. Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or <b>chloroform.</b> The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride. Several variations on this basic structure exist, including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids, and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids. Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{acetic acid}} is a {{hydrophilic}} (polar) protic solvent, similar to ethanol and water. With a moderate relative static permittivity (dielectric constant) of 6.2, it dissolves not only polar compounds such as inorganic salts and sugars, but also non-polar compounds such as oils {{as well as}} polar solutes. It is miscible with polar and non-polar solvents such as water, <b>chloroform,</b> and hexane. With higher alkanes (starting with octane), acetic acid is not completely miscible, and its miscibility declines with longer n-alkanes. The solvent and miscibility properties of acetic acid make it a useful industrial chemical, for example, as a solvent {{in the production of}} dimethyl terephthalate.|$|E
5|$|Many {{organochlorine}} compounds {{have been}} isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds {{are found in}} nearly every class of biomolecules including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Organochlorides, including dioxins, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires, and dioxins {{have been found in}} the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, <b>chloroform,</b> and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.|$|E

60|$|When {{the boat}} {{finally came to}} a {{standstill}} I was nearly suffocated for the want of fresh air, and I wondered if I had not been <b>chloroformed</b> when first assaulted. I was hoisted up by several men and placed upon my feet, and then the cords which bound me were cut and the bag was removed.|$|R
25|$|A committee, {{including}} Langley, {{was made}} up to investigate. Both the dog and the monkey were <b>chloroformed.</b> The right hemisphere of the dog was delivered to Cambridge for examination. Sherrington performed a histological examination of the hemisphere, acting as a junior colleague to Langley. In 1884, Langley and Sherrington reported on their findings in a paper. The paper was the first for Sherrington.|$|R
5|$|The Undertaker's {{feud with}} Harvey Wippleman {{continued}} {{for several months}} after Survivor Series. At Royal Rumble 1993, Wippleman introduced a new wrestler named Giant Gonzalez. Despite not being scheduled in the match, Gonzalez attacked The Undertaker and eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match. The two men faced each other at WrestleMania IX, where Gonzalez was disqualified for attacking The Undertaker with a rag soaked in <b>chloroform.</b> Wippleman led Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes in another attack on The Undertaker, in which Hughes stole The Undertaker's urn. The feud was resolved at SummerSlam 1993, when The Undertaker defeated Gonzalez in a Rest in Peace match.|$|E
5|$|Then, in 1924, Buck fell pregnant. The couple {{agreed that}} she should return to England for better {{healthcare}} during the birth, and she went there {{to set up a}} home with her mother's help. In early November 1924 she gave birth prematurely to a son, Anthony, and a few days later died of poisoning from <b>chloroform</b> administered against the pain of delivery. The grief-stricken Keable's own health worsened and he was advised to return to Tahiti; the baby, too weak to travel, was left in England with Jack and Rita Elliott, friends of the couple's since the Ralston Street salon days. The Elliotts were eventually to adopt him.|$|E
5|$|Twins were {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements of their physical attributes by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants. Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a <b>chloroform</b> injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.|$|E
50|$|After {{struggling}} with infertility, Anne (Daryl Hannah) finally succeeds in getting pregnant through invitro fertilization {{with her husband}} Jack (Bruce Greenwood). However, one night, Anne awakens to discover a masked intruder in her room. Terrified, Anne tries to escape, but the intruder <b>chloroforms</b> her into unconsciousness, rendering her helpless as he kidnaps her and takes her to an isolated house.|$|R

500|$|To pass certification, the General Electric CJ610 {{turbojet}} engine underwent bird strike testing, during which <b>chloroformed</b> [...] birds are {{passed through a}} test engine. However, the damage to both engines was, according to the NTSB, [...] "considerably heavier" [...] {{than it had been}} in the test engine. Because of the failure of the left engine, and the severe damage to the right engine, the aircraft was unable to remain airborne.|$|R
