50|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{printed in}} collections of statutes, {{including in the}} official publication The Statutes of the Realm, the Statute of Ireland concerning <b>Coparceners</b> {{is not in the}} form of a statute, but rather of a letter from the King to the Justice of Ireland confirming existing English practices on inheritance.|$|R
50|$|The Statute of Ireland {{concerning}} <b>Coparceners</b> (Latin: Statutum Hibernie de Coheredibus, or Stat. Hib. de Coher.), was an English statute made by Henry III. It was traditionally dated from 1229, in the 14th {{year of his}} reign, {{but since}} the publication of The Statutes of the Realm it has been treated as dating from 1235 (in the 20th year of Henry III's reign).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} about regarding {{the permanence of}} initial Landscapes in the historic center of Regente Feijó, a city {{in the region of}} Presidente Prudente, identify and map the historical/cultural set of significant architectural and urban elements that characterize the center of this city. For this, technical visits were done interviewing the residents and seeking information material such as maps, photos and historical documents. It was found that the “Boiadeira Road” and the railway line determined the foundation of Regente Feijó, similar to other regions in which the arrival of the railroad also boosted the development. There was the preservation of a landscape, even with mischaracterization, which refers the ambience of the initial center, that <b>coparceners</b> in the current city. Thus, the survey of these data allowed subsidies for further referrals of their safeguard actions, as we move towards a homogenization of Landscapes...|$|R
5000|$|Park is a 300-400 acre holding {{lying on}} the {{north-east}} boundary of the parish and partly in St. Helens, which came in the 16th century to be termed a manor. It was held with Ruttleston {{at the close of}} the 13th century by William de Nevill and his wife Muriel as half a fee of William Russell, lord of Yaverland, and was perhaps the same holding which Amice de Insula (Lisle) granted to William and Muriel in 1271-2. At the beginning of the 14th century Thomas Gatcombe is given as owner of Park. This name should perhaps be Daccombe, as in 1346 John Daccombe and his <b>coparceners</b> were holding half a knight's fee at Park, which had formerly belonged to Thomas 'Lacombe.' In 1428 Elizabeth Lisle was in possession of this estate, which three years later had passed to Henry Lisle. The manor has since followed the same descent as Nettlestone in St. Helens. The courts from the time of Edward VI were held for Park and Nettlestone together.|$|R
30|$|Relevant {{to these}} discussions are {{the schools of}} Hinduism (the {{majority}} religion in India): Mitakshara and Dayabhaga (Goyal et al. 2010). Women found less favour in the laws of inheritance and succession, especially in the Mitakshara school of thought, up until the Amendment of 2005 (hereinafter Amendment) to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 allowing {{them to be more}} than members by elevating them to <b>coparceners,</b> followed by a Delhi High Court judgment 1 enabling women to become a karta (head of the family). These developments are recent and had previously hindered {{the role of women in}} a multitude of ways. Women were seen as secondary to men in inheritance and rights, as is in all patriarchal societies, including India. The Amendment however comes at the most opportune moment and can result in more women entering businesses because of more financial security. There is however, no proof of the effective acceptance of the Amendment resulting in families giving equal rights to women. Time will tell the realization of the Amendment. Motivation and resources are the two cornerstones required for venturing into business. The relevance of the intention of women to be successors and to succeed otherwise is to be taken into consideration.|$|R
50|$|The {{description}} of Astret Canon, a trev or township (villata) of the honour of Denbigh, surveyed in 1334 {{was the time}} of the native Welsh princes. It was occupied entirely by a kindred (progenies) of free tribesmen descended from a certain Canon, the son of Lawaurgh. The kindred was subdivided into four gavells or bodies of joint-tenants. On the haif-gavell of Monryk ap Canon, e.g. there are no less than sixteen <b>coparceners,</b> of whom eight possess houses. The peculiarity of this system of land tenure consists in the fact that all the tenants of these gavells derive their position on the land from the occupation of the township by their kindred, and have to trace their rights to shares in the original unit. Although the village of Astret Canon was, occupied under the Survey by something like fifty-four male tenants, the majority of whom were settled in houses of their own, it continued to form a unit as well in regard to the payment of tungpound, that is, of the direct land tax and other services and payments, but also in respect of the possession and usage of the soil. On the other hand, movable property is owned in severalty. Services have to be apportioned among the members of the kindreds according to the number of heads of cattle owned by them.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the death}} of John’s half-brother, Hugh Devereux of Chanston, in 1307, the {{settlement}} of the ownership of Chanston manor was brought into court during the Easter Term 1308. Nicholas III Devereux of Chanston, John’s nephew, and his <b>coparceners</b> (David le Seriaunt, John and Sarah Ragun with their son John, and Maud widow of Richard le Bret) claimed portions of the manor, and contested Hugh Devereux’s grant to John and Eva Devereux. [...] Nicholas III Devereux of Chanston claimed a third part of Chanston that he held {{at the time of}} Hugh’s death. He showed evidence that Hugh had granted all his rights in this land that comprised the dower of Isabel, widow of Nicholas II Devereux of Chanston and mother of Hugh, in the village of Aynaldestone, and that this occurred prior to any grant to John Devereux. David le Serriaunt made claim to 5 acres that similarly Hugh had granted him. John and Eva Devereux countered that their grant came first. John and Sarah Ragun with their under-age son, John, put forward their claim of 6 marks of rent in the manor that they were to hold for 5 years. These issues were held over until the octave of Michaelmas (6 October 1308) Maud le Bret contested 12 acres of meadow that was granted by Hugh to the Raguns for life, which Hugh afterwards granted the reversion to Richard and Maud le Bret and their heirs (Richard le Bret Junior). These issues were further held over until the quindene of Easter (14 April 1309). Due to John, son of John and Sarah Ragun, being under-age, it was judged he could not attorn until he came of age.|$|R
5000|$|Nunwell {{was one of}} Earl Tostig's manors {{before the}} Conquest, held in 1086 by the king. In 1199 Stephen son of Odo {{conveyed}} 20 acres of land in Nunwell to Ralph son of Nigel, and in 1286 John de Tracy and his wife Benedicta exchanged land in Nunwell for land in Holton with William de Houton. The statement of Sir Richard Worsley that the Oglander family had been seated at Nunwell ever since the Conquest is difficult to substantiate, but Roger Oglander was possibly holding the manor {{at the beginning of}} the 13th century when land at Nunwell was given by his servant Geoffrey Escoutard to Carisbrooke Priory, and his grandson Roger recovered 2 acres in Nunwell from Gilbert Abbot of Lire in 1256. It is not, however, till the end of the century that we are on firm ground; Henry Oglander then held Nunwell of the honour of Carisbrooke Castle. He died about 1310, and his son and successor Robert died in 1344, leaving as his heir his son Reginald, who had married Roberta the daughter of Robert Urry. Reginald held in 1346 with his <b>coparceners</b> three parts of a fee in Nunwell, representing what in later years came to be termed West Nunwell. [...] He died in 1349, leaving a son Robert, and livery of the manor was made to his widow Roberta in that year. Robert died without issue and his brother John succeeded to the manor. Reginald Oglander, who held the manor in 1428, is given as John's brother in a pedigree printed by Berry, but the pedigree is clearly wrong at this date.|$|R
5000|$|The manor {{consists}} of a narrow strip of land stretching south from {{the foot of the}} down by Yarbridge to the north end of Sandown Manor (q.v.), once known as Appley, and comprises Morton Villa, the farm under the down and the farm on the Brading road. The identification of Morton with any Domesday holding can only be conjectural. The manor evidently formed part of the estate of the family of Aula, being held of Thomas de Aula's manor of Tothill in 1267-8, and subsequently of his descendants the Russells of Yaverland. Richard Malet of Hardingshute and Sandown appears to have been the tenant under these overlords, and he subinfeudated a messuage and a third of a carucate of land to Richard de Witvil or Wyvill. In 1267-8 difficulties arose between them as to which was liable for the service due to de Aula as chief lord. At the close of the century John Morin, Thomas Westbrook and John Wyvill were holding the estate in Morton of William Russell lord of Yaverland, and part afterwards seems to have passed to Thomas Aliners, who with others was in possession {{at the beginning of the}} 14th century. The Wyvills still retained their share, Thomas Wyvill and his <b>coparceners</b> holding the estate in 1346. In 1384-5 Richard Couper, one of the heirs of John Wyvill, released to Annora Wyvill, widow of John, all his right in land at Morton and elsewhere. Part seems to have lapsed to the overlords before 1428 when Henry Veer and Joan Russell held the half fee. [...] This Joan Russell was probably the widow of Sir Maurice Russell, and on her death it probably reverted to the owners of Yaverland, and is evidently to be identified with the manor of Brading mentioned in conveyances of Yaverland in 1488. The manor, which is sometimes called the manor of Brading and sometimes land in Brading, then descended with the manor of Yaverland until 1846, when it was sold to Sir William Oglander. As of 1912 it was owned by Mr. J. H. Oglander.|$|R
