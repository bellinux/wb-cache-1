5|$|Basil cultivars vary {{in several}} ways. Visually, {{the size and}} shape of the leaves varies greatly, from the large lettuce-like leaves of the Mammoth basil and Lettuce leaf basil to the tiny leaves of the Dwarf bush basil. More practically, the {{fragrance}} of the basil varies due to the varying types and quantities of essential oils contained in the plants. The most important are 1,8 cineol, linalool, <b>citral,</b> methyl chavicol (estragole), eugenol and methyl cinnamate, although hardly any basil contains all of these in any significant amount.|$|E
25|$|Lemon basil has {{a strong}} lemony smell and flavor very {{different}} from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called <b>citral.</b> It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called kemangi and served raw, together with raw cabbage, green beans, and cucumber as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, when broken up, are a zesty salad condiment.|$|E
25|$|Of all aldehydes, {{formaldehyde}} {{is produced}} on the largest scale, about 6,000,000 tons per year. It is mainly {{used in the}} production of resins when combined with urea, melamine, and phenol (e.g., Bakelite). It is a precursor to methylene diphenyl diisocyanate ("MDI"), a precursor to polyurethanes. The second main aldehyde is butyraldehyde, of which about 2,500,000 tons per year are prepared by hydroformylation. It is the principal precursor to 2-ethylhexanol, which is used as a plasticizer. Acetaldehyde once was a dominating product, but production levels have declined to less than 1,000,000 tons per year because it mainly served as a precursor to acetic acid, which is now prepared by carbonylation of methanol. Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called oxo alcohols, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are famously used as ingredients in flavours and perfumes such as N°5 from CHANEL. These include cinnamaldehyde and its derivatives, <b>citral,</b> and lilial.|$|E
2500|$|The various basils {{have such}} {{different}} scents because the herb {{has a number}} of different essential oils that come together in different proportions for various breeds. The strong clove scent of sweet basil is derived from eugenol, the same chemical as actual cloves. The citrus scent of lemon basil and lime basil reflects their higher portion of <b>citral,</b> which causes this effect in several plants including lemon mint, and of limonene, which gives actual lemon peel its scent. African blue basil has a strong camphor smell because it contains camphor and camphene in higher proportions. Licorice basil contains anethole, the same chemical that makes anise smell like licorice, and in fact is sometimes called [...] "anise basil." ...|$|E
2500|$|A circumboreal species {{widespread}} across Europe and Asia, {{including the}} Indian subcontinent, Japan, the Maghreb and North America. It {{is found in}} meadows, hedgerows and woodland glades but not as often in gardens and parks like its close relatives the large and small whites, {{for which it is}} often mistaken. Like other [...] "white" [...] butterflies, the sexes differ. The female has two spots on each forewing, the male only one. The veins on the wings of the female are usually more heavily marked. The underside hindwings are pale yellow with the veins highlighted by black scales giving a greenish tint, hence green-veined white. Unlike the large and small whites, it rarely chooses garden cabbages to lay its eggs on, preferring wild crucifers. Males emit a sex pheromone that is perceptible to humans, <b>citral,</b> the basic flavor-imparting component of lemon peel oil.|$|E
50|$|Two {{studies have}} shown 1-1.7% of people to be {{allergic}} to <b>citral,</b> and allergies are frequently reported. <b>Citral</b> on its own is strongly sensitizing to allergies; the International Fragrance Association recommends that <b>citral</b> only be used in association with substances that prevent a sensitizing effect. <b>Citral</b> has been extensively tested and has no known genotoxicity, and no known carcinogenic effect, but animal tests show dose-dependent effects on the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citral,</b> or 3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienal or lemonal, {{is either}} a pair, or a mixture of terpenoids with the {{molecular}} formula C10H16O. The two compounds are double bond isomers. The E-isomer is known as geranial or <b>citral</b> A. The Z-isomer is known as neral or <b>citral</b> B.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>citral</b> chemotype is more {{prevalent}} and is cultivated in Australia for flavouring and essential oil. <b>Citral</b> as an [...] in steam distilled lemon myrtle oil is typically 90-98%, and oil yield 1-3% from fresh leaf. It {{is the highest}} natural source of <b>citral.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>citral</b> chemotype {{is used as}} a bushfood spice to flavour teas {{and food}} products. This <b>citral</b> chemotype is {{sometimes}} called [...] "lemon teatree" [...] when the dried leaves are used in tea, and as food flavouring. Small-scale production is from wild-harvesting.|$|E
50|$|Geranial has {{a strong}} lemon (citrus) odor. Neral's lemon odor is less intense, but sweeter. <b>Citral</b> is {{therefore}} an aroma compound used in perfumery for its citrus effect. <b>Citral</b> is also used as a flavor and for fortifying lemon oil. It also has strong antimicrobial qualities, and pheromonal effects in insects.|$|E
5000|$|Decanal is an {{important}} component in citrus, along with octanal, <b>citral,</b> and sinensal.|$|E
50|$|The Pieris napi {{butterfly}} {{uses the}} release of <b>citral</b> as a male sex pheromone signal produced by males directed to females during courtship. Most of the chemical cues produced by males are associated to a female response involving courtship, mate-choice, species-specific identification and sex-specific signals. The scents are also said to influence male-male competition and forcing males to guard their mating territories. The <b>citral</b> pheromone is also released during male-male competition as pheromones are released during most male flight activity however; there is a less of a response to males as when compared to females. Females have higher antennae sensitivity to the <b>citral</b> pheromones rather than males, triggering a reduced reaction by males.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citral</b> {{is used in}} the {{synthesis}} of vitamin A, ionone, and methylionone, to mask the smell of smoke.|$|E
50|$|The major {{isolates}} {{in lemon}} verbena oil are <b>citral</b> (30-35%), nerol and geraniol. Extracts of lemon verbena also contain verbascoside.|$|E
5000|$|... 1888 - Bertram {{isolates}} <b>citral</b> from B.citriodora oil, and Messrs. , Dresden, {{write about}} the essential oil as having “...probably a future.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Lemon balm {{contains}} eugenol, tannins, and terpenes. [...] It {{also contains}} (+)-citronellal, 1-octen-3-ol, 10-&alpha;-cadinol, 3-octanol, 3-octanone, &alpha;-cubebene, &alpha;-humulene, &beta;-bourbonene, caffeic acid, caryophyllene, caryophyllene oxide, catechin, chlorogenic acid, cis-3-hexenol, cis-ocimene, <b>citral</b> A, <b>citral</b> B, copaene, &delta;-cadinene, eugenyl acetate, &gamma;-cadinene, geranial, geraniol, geranyl acetate, germacrene D, isogeranial, linalool, luteolin-7-glucoside, methylheptenone, neral, nerol, octyl benzoate, oleanolic acid, pomolic acid ((1R)-hydroxyursolic acid), protocatechuic acid, rhamnazin, rosmarinic acid, stachyose, succinic acid, thymol, trans-ocimene and ursolic acid. Lemon balm may contain traces of harmine.|$|E
50|$|A 2009 {{study has}} {{suggested}} that drying lemon myrtle leaves at higher temperatures improves the <b>citral</b> content of the dried leaves, but discolours the leaves more.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} {{distilled}} commercially for the essential oil which contains citronellal, <b>citral,</b> and pinene. It is grown in plantations in Kenya, Zaire, South Africa, Guatemala and Australia.|$|E
5000|$|Ionone can be {{synthesised}} from <b>citral</b> and acetone with {{calcium oxide}} {{as a basic}} [...] heterogeneous catalyst and serves {{as an example of}} an aldol condensation followed by a rearrangement reaction.|$|E
50|$|A {{synthetically}} produced Nasonov pheromone {{can be used}} {{to attract}} a honey bee swarm to an unoccupied hive or a swarm-catching box. Synthetically produced Nasonov consists of <b>citral</b> and geraniol in a 2:1 ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleophilic}} {{addition of}} the carbanion 3 of acetone 1 to the carbonyl group on <b>citral</b> 4 is base catalysed. The aldol condensation product 5 eliminates water through the enolate ion 6 to form pseudoionone 7.|$|E
50|$|Nasonov {{includes}} {{a number of}} different terpenoids including geraniol, nerolic acid, <b>citral</b> and geranic acid. Bees use these to find the entrance to their colony or hive, and they release them on flowers so other bees know which flowers have nectar.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the known}} chemotypes of perilla, PA (main component: perillaldehyde) {{is the only}} one used for culinary purposes. Other chemotypes are PK (perilla ketone), EK (eschscholzia ketone), PL (perillene), PP (phenylpropanoids: myristicin, dillapiole, elemicin), C (<b>citral)</b> and a type rich in rosefuran.|$|E
50|$|In Japanese pharmaceuticals, {{the mature}} husks with seeds removed are {{considered}} the crude medicine form of sanshō. It is an ingredient in , and the toso wine served ceremonially. The pungent taste derives from sanshool and sanshoamide. It also contains aromatic oils geraniol, dipentene, <b>citral,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|Examples of such {{procedures}} are described for benzaldehyde, 2-tetralone, <b>citral,</b> the ethyl ester of pyruvic acid and glyoxal. In the ring-expansion reaction of cyclohexanone with diazald, the bisulfite reaction {{is reported to}} be able to differentiate between the primary reaction product cycloheptanone and the main contaminant cyclooctanone.|$|E
5000|$|Indigenous Australians {{have long}} used lemon myrtle, both in cuisine {{and as a}} healing plant. The oil has the highest <b>citral</b> purity; {{typically}} higher than lemongrass. It is also considered to have a [...] "cleaner and sweeter" [...] aroma than comparable sources of citral-lemongrass and Litsea cubeba.|$|E
50|$|<b>Citral</b> {{is present}} in the oils of several plants, {{including}} lemon myrtle (90-98%), Litsea citrata (90%), Litsea cubeba (70-85%), lemongrass (65-85%), lemon tea-tree (70-80%), Ocimum gratissimum (66.5%), Lindera citriodora (about 65%), Calypranthes parriculata (about 62%), petitgrain (36%), lemon verbena (30-35%), lemon ironbark (26%), lemon balm (11%), lime (6-9%), lemon (2-5%), and orange.|$|E
50|$|The oil {{extracted}} from the leaves of Melaleuca stipitata is lemon scented. It consists mainly of monoterpenoids which in turn contain about 43% the isomers of <b>citral</b> (neral and geranial), and 10% terpinen-4-ol. It is possible that this plant may be suitable for commercial development because of the antimicrobial properties of these compounds.|$|E
50|$|Lestrimelitta limao scouts {{leave to}} gather {{information}} about potential victims at nearby meliponine nests. These workers have large cephalic gland reservoirs of <b>citral</b> and chemical isomers. These chemicals are liberated when they are killed at the host's nest entrance, recruiting the scout's nest mates. The release of these chemicals is what attracts more L. limao workers, initiating the raid.|$|E
5000|$|Elimination of the {{pyrophosphate}} group {{leads to}} the formation of acyclic monoterpenes such as ocimene and the myrcenes. Hydrolysis of the phosphate groups {{leads to the}} prototypical acyclic monoterpenoid geraniol. Additional rearrangements and oxidations provide compounds such as <b>citral,</b> citronellal, citronellol, linalool, and many others. Many monoterpenes found in marine organisms are halogenated, such as halomon.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, a T. pannonicus population, {{which is located}} over the {{southern}} slopes of Vršac Mountains in southern Banat (Vojvodina province, Serbia) was characterised by exceptionally high percentage of oxygenated monoterpenes (91.75%). The most abundant components of its essential oil were identified as geranial (41.42%, w/w) and neral (29.61%, w/w), the mixture of which is frequently referred to as <b>citral.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lemon basil has {{a strong}} lemony smell and flavor very {{different}} from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called <b>citral.</b> It is widely used in Indonesia, where it is called kemangi and served raw, together with raw cabbage, green beans, and cucumber as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck. Its flowers, when broken up, are a zesty salad condiment.|$|E
50|$|Plant terpenoids {{are used}} {{extensively}} for their aromatic qualities {{and play a}} role in traditional herbal remedies. Terpenoids contribute to the scent of eucalyptus, the flavors of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, the yellow color in sunflowers, and the red color in tomatoes. Well-known terpenoids include <b>citral,</b> menthol, camphor, salvinorin A in the plant Salvia divinorum, the cannabinoids found in cannabis, ginkgolide and bilobalide found in Ginkgo biloba, and the curcuminoids found in turmeric and mustard seed.|$|E
50|$|Louis Bouveault {{was born}} on 11 February 1864 in Nevers.He {{obtained}} doctorates in Paris in medicine and physical sciences.Bouveault defended his thesis on B-ketone nitriles and their derivatives in Paris in 1890.He taught {{for a short period}} at the Medical Faculty in Lyon, then became a lecturer in general chemistry in Lyon.He influenced Victor Grignard to take up chemistry in 1894.In Lyon he investigated syntheses with camphor and terpenes.He worked with Philippe Barbier on terpene derivatives used in the manufacture of perfumes like <b>citral,</b> rhodinal and geraniol.|$|E
50|$|At {{their own}} nests, guards are not aggressive, {{but at the}} {{entrance}} of host nests, they form a circle in order to defend it from the hosts and from other insects. Lestrimelitta limao guards surround the outside of hosts nest, aligned side-by-side, before and during a raid. These guard ring robbers occasionally raise their abdomens, exposing their whitish intersegmental region and fan their wings. They release <b>citral</b> from their mandibular glands, an act that must be well timed relative to the progression and initiation of the raid.|$|E
5000|$|Essential oil yields {{from the}} fruit are 3-5%. The oil's main {{component}} is <b>citral,</b> at 70-85% of the oil. It is mainly produced in China from plantations and is marketed as [...] "Litsea cubeba", with production estimates between 500 - 1,500 tonnes of oil per annum. The oil {{is used as}} a fragrance (especially in bar soap) and for flavouring in its own right. It is also used as a raw material by the chemical industry for the synthesis of vitamin A and violet-like fragrances.|$|E
