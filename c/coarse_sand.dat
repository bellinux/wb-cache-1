5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E
5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and <b>coarse</b> <b>sand,</b> which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E

25|$|Bonsai soil {{is usually}} a loose, fast-draining mix of components, often a base mixture of <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> or gravel, fired clay pellets, or {{expanded}} shale combined with an organic component such as peat or bark. The inorganic components provide mechanical support for bonsai roots, and—in the case of fired clay materials—also serve to retain moisture. The organic components retain moisture and may release small amounts of nutrients as they decay.|$|E
25|$|Archaeologists found 16 Aboriginal sites, {{ranging in}} age from the Maritime Archaic Indian era (7000 BC – modern) through the Palaeo-Eskimo period, down to the Recent Indian (which {{includes}} the Beothuk) occupation. Two of the sites {{have been found to be}} associated with the historial Beothuk. Boyd's Cove, the larger of the two, is 3000 sq. m. and is located on top of a 6-m glacial moraine.

25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (clayey) Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with gravel ballast so as to form kerbs. <b>Coarse</b> <b>sand</b> was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather friable Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E

25|$|With 80–90% of {{oil spill}} costs {{invested}} in shoreline cleanup, {{there is a}} search for more efficient and cost-effective methods to extract oil spills from the shorelines. Biodiesel has displayed its capacity to significantly dissolve crude oil, depending on {{the source of the}} fatty acids. In a laboratory setting, oiled sediments that simulated polluted shorelines were sprayed with a single coat of biodiesel and exposed to simulated tides. Biodiesel is an effective solvent to oil due to its methyl ester component, which considerably lowers the viscosity of the crude oil. Additionally, it has a higher buoyancy than crude oil, which later aids in its removal. As a result, 80% of oil was removed from cobble and fine sand, 50% in <b>coarse</b> <b>sand,</b> and 30% in gravel. Once the oil is liberated from the shoreline, the oil-biodiesel mixture is manually removed from the water surface with skimmers. Any remaining mixture is easily broken down due to the high biodegradability of biodiesel, and the increased surface area exposure of the mixture.|$|E

500|$|In the 12th century, {{the castle}} {{would have been}} defended on its south side by a steep slope and the marshy ground running along the river. It was {{designed}} as an oval ringwork, which today is around [...] by [...] across and [...] high, protected by a ditch [...] wide and [...] deep. The Roman fort in this corner was only visible as earthworks in the 12th century, and the builders used part of these {{in the construction of}} the ringwork. The ringwork was made up of a core of river gravel and <b>coarse</b> <b>sand,</b> with finer sand and clay forming the surface layer. The ringwork had a protective wicker fence around the top of the earthworks and possibly some form of early stone or wooden tower, with a gateway just to the north side of it. It is unclear what kind of buildings were constructed inside the ringwork, although a kitchen was certainly built on the east side of the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|The {{foreshore}} is {{the area}} on land {{between high and low}} tide. Like the upper shoreface, it is constantly affected by wave action. Cross bedding and lamination are present and <b>coarser</b> <b>sands</b> are present because of the high energy present by the crashing of the waves. The sand is also very well sorted.|$|R
50|$|The south coast, {{dubbed the}} riviera, is {{somewhat}} more sheltered {{and there are}} several broad estuaries formed by drowned valleys or rias that offer safe anchorages to seafarers, such as at Falmouth and Fowey.

500|$|The {{purpose of}} the growing medium is [...] to provide support and to store water, oxygen and {{dissolved}} minerals to feed the plant. In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium, [...] "ten growers would give 20 different answers". Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless growing medium, one part hydroponic clay and one part coarse pumice or perlite, {{with the addition of}} soil from earthworm castings. The general recommendation of 25–75% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources. However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) [...] "want soil that is low in or free of humus", and recommends <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> as the basis of a growing medium.|$|E

A piece of {{the left side of the}} mandible broke off in the process and was never found. A thick cemented crust of <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> stuck on and around the canines and molars—a characteristic of many of the Mauer fossils. The cementing had been caused by carbonation of calcium. A chunk of limestone, probably Muschelkalk, [...] long and about [...] wide was firmly stuck to the sand crust on top of the bicuspids and the two frontal molars on the left side of the mandible.|$|E
2500|$|Sands and gravels that {{possess a}} wide range of {{particle}} sizes with a smooth distribution of particle sizes are called well graded soils. If the soil particles in a sample are predominantly in a relatively narrow range of sizes, the sample is uniformly graded. If a soil sample has distinct gaps in the gradation curve, e.g., a mixture of gravel and fine sand, with no <b>coarse</b> <b>sand,</b> the sample may be gap graded. [...] Uniformly graded and gap graded soils are both considered to be poorly graded. There are many methods for measuring particle-size distribution. The two traditional methods are sieve analysis and hydrometer analysis.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of ephemeral {{drainage}} systems on the extensive, low-relief Northern Plains in the Alice Springs region of central Australia. Comparison of the Sandover, Bundey and Woodforde Rivers (catchment areas of approximately 10 600, 11 000 and 550 km 2 ̆ 7, respectively) reveals variations in channel morphology, estimated flow conditions and sedimentary characteristics. In the middle reaches of the Sandover catchment, bedloads consist of medium to <b>coarse</b> <b>sands</b> and channels are mainly singlethread. By contrast, in the Bundey and Woodforde catchments, bedloads consist of <b>coarse</b> <b>sands</b> and granules and many reaches are anabranched, with channels separated by narrow, linear, vegetated ridges or broad islands. Anabranching is related to tributary drainage, for ridges and islands form in association with tributary junctions {{as a result of}} various processes, including accretion in the lee of in-channel vegetation, by floodplain scour and by the formation of defeiTed-junction tributaries...|$|R
2500|$|Shell-tempered pottery {{has long}} been known to exist in the middle and lower Mississippi Valley by both amateur {{collectors}} as well as professional archeologists. [...] "Grave diggers" [...] and amateur collectors have plundered many Mississippian mounds for the fine funerary effigies and other vessels placed as grave goods within mounds and surrounding village areas. Early professional surveys in the valley noted the preponderance of shell-tempered wares in large village sites throughout the valley alluvial plains. Mississippian pottery is easily distinguished from earlier Woodland period pottery. Woodland vessels tend to have thicker walls, flat or conical bases and a large amount of either <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> or grog used as temper. Mississippian vessels generally have thinner vessel walls, obvious white flecks of shell temper and round-bottomed pottery forms. For decades archeologists have examined, sorted, described and stored Woodland sherds from those of Mississippian vessels with relative ease.|$|E
2500|$|Next, {{the foam}} cluster is coated with ceramic investment, {{also known as}} the {{refractory}} coating, via dipping, brushing, spraying or flow coating. This coating creates a barrier between the smooth foam surface and the <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> surface. Secondly it controls permeability, which allows the gas created by the vaporized foam pattern to escape through the coating and into the sand. Controlling permeability is a crucial step to avoid sand erosion. Finally, it forms a barrier so that molten metal does not penetrate or cause sand erosion during pouring. After the coating dries, the cluster is placed into a flask and backed up with un-bonded sand. [...] The sand is then compacted using a vibration table. Once compacted, the mold is ready to be poured. Automatic pouring is commonly used in LFC, as the pouring process is significantly more critical than in conventional foundry practice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{study of}} fluvial {{terraces}} has revealed <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel alternating with terraces of silt, clay and fine sand. This alternation highlights repeated {{changes in the}} dominant fluvial or wind patterns in the valleys of Tibesti during the Quaternary Period. The phases of erosion and sendimentation are indicative of the climate alternating between dry and wet conditions, the latter of which fostered dense vegetation in the Tibesti that was likely far more diverse than that which exists today (with the exception of grasses). Furthermore, the discovery of calcified charophyta (particularly of the family Characeae) and gastropod fossils in Trou au Natron indicates {{the presence of a}} lake at least [...] deep during the Late Pleistocene. These phenomena are associated with various changes in climate, most notably during the last glacial maximum, which increased precipitation and reduced evaporation due to lower temperatures. In fact, the Tibesti supplied a considerable amount of water to the Paleolake Chad until the 5th millennium BC.|$|E

2500|$|Tsunami {{deposits}} {{linked to}} the 1693 tsunami have been found both onshore and offshore. At Ognina, just south of Syracuse, {{at the head of}} a ria, a sequence containing several coarse clastic layers has been found, inconsistent with its lagoonal setting. The uppermost coarse layer, which has a strongly erosive base, consists of <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> with up to granule size clasts. The layer has been dated as 17th to 18th century based on pottery shards and one well-preserved clay pipe, consistent with the 1693 tsunami. Offshore from Augusta, a sequence identified using chirp sonar data was sampled with a [...] gravity core in [...] of water. Following detailed analysis of both grain size and foraminifera assemblages, eleven possible high-energy events were found based on the presence of large numbers of shallow water forams combined with a greater proportion of fine sand in the same interval. The uppermost two events correlate well with the tsunamis from the 1908 Messina earthquake and the 1693 earthquake.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to surface}} tension, water will rise up {{in a small}} {{capillary}} tube above a free surface of water. [...] Likewise, water will rise up above the water table into the small pore spaces around the soil particles. In fact the soil may be completely saturated for some distance above the water table. [...] Above the height of capillary saturation, the soil may be wet but the water content will decrease with elevation. If the water in the capillary zone is not moving, the water pressure obeys the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, , but note that , is negative above the water table. Hence, hydrostatic water pressures are negative above the water table. The thickness of the zone of capillary saturation depends on the pore size, but typically, the heights vary between a centimeter or so for <b>coarse</b> <b>sand</b> to tens of meters for a silt or clay. In fact the pore space of soil is a uniform fractal e.g. a set of uniformly distributed D-dimensional fractals of average linear size L.
