5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling <b>catgut.</b> Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E
5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a <b>catgut</b> cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
25|$|His use of <b>catgut</b> for {{internal}} stitching is still practised in modern surgery. The <b>catgut</b> {{appears to be}} the only natural substance capable of dissolving and is acceptable by the body. Al-Zahrawi also invented the forceps for extracting a dead fetus, as illustrated in the Al-Tasrif.|$|E
25|$|The neck (Sap) is a mince (only 4-4.5cm in diameter) 100–110cm long D-section {{fingerboard}} made {{of light}} wood and carries <b>catgut</b> frets adjusted to give 36 intervals in an octave. <b>Catgut</b> frets are {{fixed on the}} neck by means of minute nails. The main bridge is trapezoidal and mobile, and since the shell lacks braces to support the soundboard, the latter slightly yields in under the bridge. The smaller upper bridge between the pegbox and the neck is traditionally made of bone.|$|E
25|$|Around 2007, a {{new type}} of strings were {{produced}} made of mostly a nylon core coiled with nylon like the metal-nylon strings, possibly in imitation of Western <b>catgut</b> strings. The sound is similar to the metal-nylon strings but without the metallic tone to them (one of the main reasons why traditionalists do not like the metal-nylon strings). The nylon strings are able to be turned to standard pitch without breaking and can sustain their tuning whatever the climate unlike silk. The strings have various names in China but they are advertised as sounding like silk strings prior to the 1950s when silk string production stopped.|$|E
25|$|Historically, cello strings had cores {{made out}} of <b>catgut,</b> which, despite its name is made from sheep or goat {{intestines}} which are dried out. Most modern strings used in the 2010s are wound with metallic materials like aluminum, titanium and chromium. Cellists may mix different types of strings on their instruments. The pitches of the open strings are C, G, D, and A (black note heads in the playing range figure above), unless alternative tuning (scordatura) is specified by the composer. Some composers ask that the low C be tuned down to a Bb or B so that the performer can play a different low note on the lowest open string.|$|E
2500|$|Galen's On the Natural Faculties, Books I, II, and III, is an {{excellent}} paradigm of a very accomplished Greek surgeon and physician of the 2nd century Roman era, who carried out very complex surgical operations and added significantly to the corpus of animal and human physiology {{and the art of}} surgery.

2500|$|Camarine {{was a dark}} {{chestnut}} mare with a white blaze {{and four}} white socks bred near Brandon in Suffolk by Robert Wilson, 9th Baron Berners. She was sired by Wilson's horse Juniper, a [...] "useful" [...] stallion, {{best known as the}} damsire of Velocipede although he may have been the sire of the 1000 Guineas winner <b>Catgut.</b> Camarine came from Juniper's last crop of foals and was said to bear a striking resemblance to her sire. In early 1831, Camarine entered the ownership of Sir Mark Wood, 2nd Baronet, whose other good horses included Lucetta (Ascot Gold Cup) and Galantine (1000 Guineas).|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, George F. Merson {{opened a}} {{facility}} in Edinburgh for the manufacturing, packaging and sterilizing of <b>catgut,</b> silk and nylon sutures. Johnson & Johnson acquired Mr. Merson’s company in 1947, {{and this was}} renamed Ethicon Suture Laboratories. In 1953 this became Ethicon Inc. In 1992, Ethicon was restructured, and Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. became a separate corporation. During the 1990s, Ethicon diversified into new and advanced products and technologies and formed four different companies under the Ethicon umbrella, each of which specialize in different products. In 2008 J announced it would acquire Mentor Corporation for $1 billion and merge its operations into Ethicon. In March 2016, J Ethicon business unit announced it would acquire NeuWave Medical, Inc. In January 2017, J subsidiary Ethicon announced it would acquire Megadyne Medical Products, Inc., a medical device company that develops, manufactures and markets electrosurgical tools. [...] In February 2017, Ethicon acquired medical device manufacturer, Torax Medical for an undisclosed sum.|$|E
2500|$|Strings {{were first}} made of sheep gut (commonly known as <b>catgut,</b> which despite the name {{did not come}} from cats), or simply gut, which was stretched, dried, and twisted. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century, strings were made of either gut, silk, aluminum, or steel. Modern strings may be gut, solid steel, {{stranded}} steel, or various synthetic materials such as perlon, wound with various metals, and sometimes plated with silver. Most E strings are unwound, either plain or gold-plated steel. Currently, violin strings are not made with gut as much, but many performers use them to achieve a specific sound especially in historically informed performance of Baroque music. Strings have a limited lifetime. When a violinist plays a string, oil from their hands and sweat can slowly damage the strings. As well, rosin from the bow can accumulate on the part that is bowed. Eventually, when oil, dirt, sweat and rosin accumulate, the string can become old and dirty. Apart from obvious things, such as the winding of a string coming undone from wear, players generally change a string when it no longer plays [...] "true" [...] (with good intonation on the harmonics), losing the desired tone, brilliance and intonation. String longevity depends on string quality and playing intensity. In the 2010s, a huge variety of strings are available.|$|E
2500|$|Owing to {{its long}} past, the tambur has let {{flourish}} several schools of interpretation. The oldest description of [...] tanburîs is {{reported by the}} French traveller Charles Fonton who describes the use of <b>catgut</b> frets. A Turkish musical theory written {{in the beginning of}} the 18th century by the famous Kantemir Pasha -first an Ottoman citizen of Polish-Moldovian origin, then voivode of Moldovia- elucidates for the first time the proper intervals to use. Yet there is little mention of playing styles and the first tambur master recorded by chronicles and of whom we have solid information is Tanburi İzak Effendi, who is said to have brought the playing technique to maturity. Today, he is considered as the reference of the [...] "old style" [...] in tambur playing, partially recovered in the 20th century by Mesut Cemil. Sheikh of the Rifai Tekkesi in Kozyatağı (Istanbul) Abdülhalim Efendi was his pupil and carried on the same tradition. Among notable 18th-century players were Numan Agha, Zeki Mehmed Agha, Tanburî Küçük Osman Bey, all of whom remained representatives of this allegedly old style. The first virtuoso to claim renovation was Tanburi Büyük Osman Bey who broke with his father Zeki Mehmed Agha's technique to present his own. Later on, this later style became so prevalent that the older technique came to suffer oblivion. The musical heritage transmitted to Suphi Ezgi by Abdülhalim Efendi, and from the former to Mesut Cemil, an eminent figure in 19th Turkish Classical Music, has helped retrieve the essentials of this old technique. One last important tanburi successfully performing according to principles of the old school was Cemil Özbal (1908–1980) from Gaziantep.|$|E

6000|$|On {{the very}} evening which {{followed}} this {{there was a}} great ringing of bells in Casterbridge, and the combined brass, wood, <b>catgut,</b> and leather bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussion-notes than ever.

She twanged the <b>catgut</b> under her fingers.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this point}} of the revelry the fiddler's first string, which had endured with a dogged {{tenacity}} that was wonderful even for <b>catgut,</b> gave way with a loud bang, causing an abrupt termination to the uproar, and producing a dead silence.
