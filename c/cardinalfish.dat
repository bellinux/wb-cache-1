Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe <b>cardinalfish</b> (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the ocean floor. Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E
5|$|A few {{different}} animals establish commensal {{interactions with}} L.gigas, {{which means that}} both organisms maintain a relationship that benefits (the commensal) species but not the other (in this case, the queen conch). Commensals of this species include certain mollusks, mainly slipper shells (Crepidula spp.) The porcelain crab Porcellana sayana is also {{known to be a}} commensal and a small <b>cardinalfish,</b> known as the conch fish (Astrapogon stellatus), sometimes shelters in the conch's mantle for protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell and}} soft parts of living L.gigas {{serve as a}} home to several {{different}} kinds of commensal animals, including slipper snails, porcelain crabs and <b>cardinalfish.</b> Its parasites include coccidians. The queen conch is hunted and eaten by several species of large predatory sea snails, and also by starfish, crustaceans and vertebrates (fish, sea turtles and humans). Its shell is sold as a souvenir and used as a decorative object. Historically, Native Americans and indigenous Caribbean peoples used parts of the shell to create various tools.|$|E

25|$|The Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> (Pterapogon kauderni) {{is a small}} {{tropical}} <b>cardinalfish</b> in {{the family}} Apogonidae. It is {{the only member of}} its genus. This attractive fish is popular in the aquarium trade. It is among the relatively few marine fish to have been bred regularly in captivity, but significant numbers are still captured in the wild and it is now an endangered species.|$|E
25|$|Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> live {{in shallow}} lagoons in groups that include up to 500 individuals. They are often found near sea urchins, where the fish hide when threatened. They {{are capable of}} hiding among the spines of sea urchins without being stung. In {{addition}} to sea urchins, other living benthic substrates such as soft corals, anemones, hydrozoans and mangrove roots also serve as microhabitats where the Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> group around. These groups of fish are rather sedentary, and movements between groups are observed to be very limited especially because they feed on plankton that pass through water currents. Such limited dispersal of Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> prevents them from spreading over large geographic ranges, and thus serves as a major risk of extinction along with heavy exploitation by aquarium fish collectors as well as low fecundity.|$|E

25|$|The Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> is a {{paternal}} mouthbrooder. The female {{plays an}} active role in courtship and pair formation, which occurs a few hours to a few days before spawning. Mating pairs establish spawning territories several meters away from the main group and vigorously defend them. The eggs are about 2.5 millimeters in diameter. The young remain in the male's mouth cavity for an undetermined period after hatching. Unlike many other species of marine fish, the Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> lacks a planktonic stage in its life history. The species has a short life span, reaching around four years in optimal conditions in captivity, and perhaps 1 to 2 years in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The same hideouts in a reef may be {{regularly}} {{inhabited by}} different species {{at different times}} of day.

25|$|Bigeye {{trevally}} also form schools. They are swift predators who {{patrol the}} reef in hunting packs. When {{they find a}} school of forage fish, such as <b>cardinalfish,</b> they surround them and herd them close to the reef. This panics the prey fish, and their schooling becomes chaotic, leaving them open to attack by the trevally.|$|E
25|$|The Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> is {{the only}} member of its family that is diurnal. It is a {{demersal}} tropical marine fish that forms stable groups of about 9 individuals in shallow water, being most common at 1.5 to 2.5 meters in depth. It inhabits a variety of shallow habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and open areas of sand and rubble. It is most common in calm habitats on the protected side of larger islands. It is often found associated with the seagrass Enhalus acoroides and the long spined sea urchin Diadema setosum. It occurs among various living benthic substrates such as sea urchins, sea anemones, and branching corals; young fish are most commonly associated with sea anemones, while juveniles and adults occur most frequently among long-spined sea urchins and branching corals, as well as sea stars, hydrozoans, and mangrove prop roots. Individuals of 2 to 60 hover above the urchins, with the younger ones about 2 to 3 centimeters SL staying closest to them. The fish retreat among the spines when threatened. Individual fish exhibit well-defined homing behaviour and return to the original location of their group when disturbed. The Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> often coexists with various anemonefish and anemone shrimp when sheltering in anemones and corals; when found among sea urchin spines, it associates with several other genera of <b>cardinalfish.</b> Following removal of the fish by aquarium collectors, the abundance of associated invertebrates has been shown to decline.|$|E

50|$|The initial name {{proposed}} for this lineage was Gulliveria, but some authors {{do not consider}} it validly published. In any case, this name was already established for a supposed genus of <b>cardinalfishes</b> earlier and thus cannot {{be used for the}} butterflies.|$|R
25|$|The Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> {{are sexually}} monomorphic. The pairs form {{up to two}} weeks prior to spawning. The female courts the male from pair {{formation}} until spawning. The female's size determines the fecundity and egg size, but the male's size determines the reproductive output, or {{the amount of the}} eggs that the pair produces. Therefore, pairing tends to occur among individuals of similar sizes, so the male is able to care for all the eggs that female produces.|$|E
25|$|This species {{grows up}} to 8centimetres (3in) total length. It is easily {{differentiated}} {{from all other}} <b>cardinalfish</b> by its tasseled first dorsal fin, elongate anal and second dorsal fin rays, deeply forked caudal fin, and color pattern consisting of three black bars across the head and body and prominent black anterior edges on the anal and second dorsal fin. The male can be differentiated from the female by a conspicuous enlarged oral cavity, which is apparent only when they are brooding.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the females}} {{initiate}} courtship, {{female and male}} <b>cardinalfish</b> are mutually selective. Females have been observed courting larger males more intensively. Even when they {{are already in the}} process of courting one male, they often moved on to an intruder male if it is larger than the original. Females have also been observed producing larger eggs for larger, hence more ‘attractive,’ males. Females are also able to increase egg size even after the onset of egg maturation if they encounter a new, larger male to brood its eggs.|$|E
40|$|Despite their {{importance}} in coral reef ecosystem function and trophodynamics, the trophic ecology of nocturnal fishes (e. g. Apogonidae, Holocentridae, Pempheridae) {{is by far}} less studied than diurnal ones. The Apogonidae (<b>cardinalfishes)</b> include mostly carnivorous species and evidence of trophic niche partitioning among sympatric <b>cardinalfishes</b> is still limited. The present study combines stomach contents and stable isotope analyses to investigate the feeding ecology of an assemblage of eight <b>cardinalfishes</b> from the Great Reef of Toliara (SW Madagascar). δ 13 C and δ 15 N of fishes ranged between - 17. 49 ‰ and - 10. 03 ‰ and between 6. 28 ‰ and 10. 74 ‰, respectively. Both stomach contents and stable isotopes showed that they feed on planktonic and benthic animal prey in various proportions. Previous studies were able to group apogonids in different trophic categories but such a discrimination is not obvious here. Large intra-specific variation in the stomach contents and temporal variation in the relative contribution of prey to diet support that all apogonids {{should be considered as}} generalist, carnivorous fishes. However the exploration of the isotopic space revealed a clear segregation of isotopic niches among species, suggesting a high level of resource partitioning within the assemblage. According to low inter-specific variation in stomach content compositions, we argue that the differences in isotopic niches could be driven by variation in foraging locations (i. e. microhabitat segregation) and physiology among species. Our temporal datasets demonstrate that the trophic niche partitioning among <b>cardinalfishes</b> and the breadth of their isotopic niches are dynamic and change across time. Factors driving this temporal variation need to be investigated in further studies. Peer reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Juvenile Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> do not {{go through}} any pelagic larval phase. Instead, they {{experience}} a high growth rate. Although the free embryos maintain their size difference after hatching, they grow several folds while being brooded inside their father’s mouth. Therefore, at release, juveniles are many times heavier than they were at hatching. Juveniles settle directly within the parents’ habitat upon release from their father’s mouth. They form a tight school around different structures such as sea urchins, corals and anemones and swim around together while the father does not exhibit much caring behavior.|$|E
25|$|Large {{schools of}} forage fish, such as {{surgeonfish}} and <b>cardinalfish,</b> {{move around the}} reef feeding on tiny zooplankton. The forage fish are, in turn, eaten by larger fish, such as the bigeye trevally. Fish receive many benefits from schooling behaviour, including defence against predators through better predator detection, since each fish is on the lookout. Schooling fish have developed remarkable displays of precise choreography which confuse and evade predators. For this they have evolved special pressure sensors along their sides, called lateral lines, that let them feel each other's movements and stay synchronized.|$|E
25|$|When {{the male}} accepts female courting, the female expels eggs from the urogenitial papilla. Female Banggai <b>cardinalfish</b> produce a {{relatively}} small clutch, consisting {{of no more than}} ninety eggs that are two to three millimeters in diameter. Once approximately three-fourths of the egg mass protrudes from the female, the male takes the eggs from her. This process is immediate, taking no more than two seconds. Eggs may be lost in the process if the male drops them, as it is usually immediately consumed by other fish in the area. Males also have the ability to detect dead eggs and expel them from his mouth. The male broods the eggs in his mouth for up to 30 days, during which it does not feed. After spawning, the female stays with the brooding male for at least few days. Females aggressively defend its territory by immediately chasing any intruders that approach the brooding male. They also exhibit relaxed form of ‘side by side trembling’, and confine the male to a small space.|$|E
