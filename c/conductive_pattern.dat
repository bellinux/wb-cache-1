Originally, the code pattern was electrically conductive, supported (in a rotary encoder) by an insulating disk. Each track had its own stationary metal spring contact; one more contact made the connection to the pattern. That common contact was connected by the pattern to whichever of the track contacts were resting on the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern.</b> However, sliding contacts wear out and need maintenance, so non-contact detectors, such as optical or magnetic sensors, are often used instead.|$|E

This 'electric textbook' was placed above the teaching aid and the responder marked the answers by penetrating the page with a stylus (signalling probe) which contacted the backing member to complete an electrical circuit indicating the correctness of the answer selected; a light immediately showed the result - green for right, and red for the wrong answer. The backing member underlying the textbook page had an electronically <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> which permitted wide latitude in {{the format of the}} page or sheet containing the questions without allowing the student to guess which answers were correct by virtue of their position on the page. It was the first corrector of its kind to combine questions on the overlaying paper with immediate responses and feedback, obviating the requirement for referral to corresponding separate reference sheets, and the construction of the circuit board was such that it permitted the format of the multiple question sheet to be randomised within large limits so as to avoid visual the repetition and monotony associated with previous correctors, not only from page to page or sheet to sheet, but within any individual sheet itself, thus allowing for a plurality of possible answers.

30|$|Near-field electrospinning {{is a novel}} {{technology}} that is able to realize three-dimensional micro/nanostructures from the controlled fiber stacking. However, due to the developed tension during the electrospinning, it was difficult in patterning the sharp-edged structure. In this study, the sharp-edged 3 D microstructure was successfully electrospun by using the enhanced electric field from the printed <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> on paper, and the good stacking condition for electrospun fibers was analyzed through the electric field modeling. The electrospun fiber was stacked well under high electric field conditions as follows: (1) In the linear <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern,</b> when the angle between the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> and the needle tip is small. That is, when the needle height is low under the same offset condition. (2) At {{the edge of the}} <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern.</b> (3) In the curved <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern,</b> the acute angle pattern is higher than the obtuse angle pattern.|$|E
30|$|Compared to {{conductive}} {{straight line}} patterns, curves pattern with acute angle {{was known to}} have a higher electric field singularity [13]. In the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> with the acute angle, the electric field singularity increases gradually from the peripheral to the intersection of the angled pattern. On the other hand, as the angle increases to an obtuse angle, the electric field becomes higher at the edge of peripheral than the intersection point. Therefore, {{in the case of an}} acute-angle <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern,</b> the electric field at the corner pattern is high, but the obtuse angle shows the low electric field at the corner. The effect of electric field on curved patterns was verified by observing the stacks of electrospun fibers on the patterns that were acute, right and obtuse angle-edge. Figure  3 b, c, and d show the images of the electrospun fibers stacked on the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> with acute, right and obtuse angles. As expected, the fibers in the acute angle pattern could be perfectly stacked along the pattern due to the high field intensity by the field singularity (Fig.  3 b). The fibers on the right angle pattern could be stacked along the pattern, but they did not perfectly follow the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> like on the acute pattern. They stacked toward the slightly inner side of the pattern edge due to the smaller electric field compared to the acute angle pattern (Fig.  3 c). The fibers formed on the obtuse pattern did not follow up the pattern due to the weaker electric field than the surrounding area (Fig.  3 d).|$|E

Reminiscent of the photographic process of `salt printing', a desktop office printer was used to deposit desired patterns of silver bromide on paper, which were subsequently exposed to light and then immersed in a photographic developer. Percolating silver nanowire networks that conformally coated the paper fibres were formed after 10 min of exposure to light from a commercial halogen lamp.

30|$|In this study, {{in order}} to realize {{nanoscale}} 3 D structures by the controlled stacking using NFES, we characterize the stacking quality of electrospun fibers according to the established electric field between the inkjet printed conducive pattern and the spinneret (needle tip) and confirm their stacking status by experimental study. Inkjet printed electrodes composed of Ag nanoparticles have a role as a collector to induce the electrospun fibers to the printed electrodes: the electric field singularity on the planar <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> concentrates the electric field {{at the edge of}} the pattern [11]. The electrospun fiber behavior is characterized by analyzing the fiber stacking condition according to the position of the needle and location of the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern.</b> The sharp-edged 3 D structures are demonstrated by inducing the electrospun fibers to the sharp-edged conductive pre-patterns on the commercial printing paper, which has been impossible in the conventional NFES.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of handling uncooperative objects, i. e. objects not equipped with any features that can aid their manipulation, {{is of particular}} interest for both terrestrial and space robotic applications. In this framework, this paper deals with the development and testing of a smart material substrate, which can be integrated into an end-effector device, where morphing and electro-adhesive capabilities are combined to allow the manipulation of uncooperative objects of different shapes and materials. Compliance and adhesion properties are obtained by creating a <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> of electrodes embodied on the surface of a polymeric substrate. On one hand, the polymeric material, activated by a change in temperature, can adapt to any shape when it is heated, and maintain the deformed shape after being cooled, even when the load is removed, becoming compliant with the objects surface. On the other hand, the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> is responsible for the adhesive effect: when a high voltage is applied, the electric field generated induces an opposite charge on the objects surface establishing reversible attraction forces. Furthermore, the <b>conductive</b> <b>pattern</b> could be used to activate the morphing behaviour when the manipulator and the target object come into contact. A resistive-electroadhesive pad is realized and some tests are performed to verify the heating behavior of the electrodes and the electroadhesion forces achievable.

Products developed using this method, or related prior methods, are instances of a technology known as 'e-textiles,' in which electrically <b>conductive</b> <b>patterns</b> ar formed in, and on, textiles. For many applications, including high-speed digital circuits, antennas, and radio frequency (RF) circuits, an e-textile method should {{be capable of}} providing high surface conductivity, tight tolerances for control of characteristic impedances, and geometrically complex <b>conductive</b> <b>patterns.</b> Unlike prior methods, the present method satisfies {{all three of these}} criteria.
