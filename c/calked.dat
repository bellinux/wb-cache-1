40|$|AbstractCilia and flagella {{play key}} roles in {{development}} and sensory transduction, and several human disorders, including polycystic kidney disease, {{are associated with}} the failure to assemble cilia. Here, we show that the aurora protein kinase <b>CALK</b> in the biflagellated alga Chlamydomonas has a central role in two pathways for eliminating flagella. Cells rendered deficient in <b>CALK</b> were defective in regulated flagellar excision and regulated flagellar disassembly. Exposure of cells to altered ionic conditions, the absence of a centriole/basal body for nucleating flagellar assembly, cessation of delivery of flagellar components to their tip assembly site, and formation of zygotes all led to activation of the regulated disassembly pathway as indicated by phosphorylation of <b>CALK</b> and the absence of flagella. We propose that cells have a sensory pathway that detects conditions that are inappropriate for possession of a flagellum, and that <b>CALK</b> is a key effector of flagellar disassembly in that pathway...|$|R

40|$|SummaryFlagella and cilia are {{structurally}} polarized organelles whose lengths {{are precisely}} defined, and alterations in length {{are related to}} several human disorders [1, 2]. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) and protein signaling molecules are implicated in specifying flagellar and ciliary length [3 – 6], but evidence has been lacking for a flagellum and cilium length sensor that could participate in active length control or establishment of structural polarity. Previously, we showed that the phosphorylation state of the aurora-like protein kinase <b>CALK</b> in Chlamydomonas is a marker {{of the absence of}} flagella. Here we show that <b>CALK</b> phosphorylation state is also a marker for flagellar length. <b>CALK</b> is phosphorylated in cells without flagella, and during flagellar assembly it becomes dephosphorylated. Dephosphorylation is not simply a consequence of initiation of flagellar assembly or of time after experimentally induced flagellar loss, but instead requires flagella to be assembled to a threshold length. Analysis of cells with flagella of varying lengths shows that the threshold length for <b>CALK</b> dephosphorylation is ∼ 6 μm (half length). Studies with short and long flagellar mutants indicate that cells detect absolute rather than relative flagellar length. Our results demonstrate that cells possess a mechanism for translating flagellar length into a posttranslational modification of a known flagellar regulatory protein...|$|R

60|$|When he had {{finished}} his breakfast, Captain Horn went to work. There was {{to be no more}} thinking, no more plans, no more fanciful anxieties, no more hopes of doing something better than he had done. Work he would, and when one thing was done, he would find another. The first thing he set about was the improvement of the pier which had been built for the landing of the guano. There was a good deal of timber left unused, and he drove down new piles, nailed on new planking, and extended the little pier considerably farther into the waters of the cove. When this was done, he went to work on the lighter, which was leaky, and bailed it out, and <b>calked</b> the seams, taking plenty of time, and doing his work in the most thorough manner. He determined that after this was done, and he could find nothing better to do, he would split up the little vessel which the Rackbirds had left rudderless, mastless, and useless, and make kindling-wood of it.|$|E

60|$|The houses {{built by}} our {{ancestors}} were better ventilated in certain respects than modern ones, {{with all their}} improvements. The great central chimney, with its open fireplaces in the different rooms, created a constant current which carried off foul and vitiated air. In these days, how common is it to provide rooms with only a flue for a stove! This flue is kept shut in summer, and in winter opened only to admit a close stove, which burns away the vital portion of the air quite {{as fast as the}} occupants breathe it away. The sealing up of fireplaces and introduction of air-tight stoves may, doubtless, be a saving of fuel; it saves, too, more than that,--in thousands and thousands of cases it has saved people from all further human wants, and put an end forever to any needs short of the six feet of narrow earth which are man's only inalienable property. In other words, since the invention of air-tight stoves, thousands have died of slow poison. It is a terrible thing to reflect upon, that our Northern winters last from November to May, six long months, in which many families confine themselves to one room, of which every window-crack has been carefully <b>calked</b> to make it air-tight, where an air-tight stove keeps the atmosphere at a temperature between eighty and ninety, and the inmates sitting there, with all their winter clothes on, become enervated both by the heat and by the poisoned air, {{for which there is no}} escape but the occasional opening of a door.|$|E

[Dictated December 2, 1906.] In 1847 we {{were living}} in a large white house on the corner of Hill and Main Streets--a house that still stands, but isn't large now, {{although}} it hasn't lost a plank; I saw it a year ago and noticed that shrinkage. My father died in it in March of the year mentioned, but our family did not move out of it until some months afterward. Ours was not the only family in the house, there was another--Dr. Grant's. One day Dr. Grant and Dr. Reyburn argued a matter on the street with sword-canes, and Grant was brought home multifariously punctured. Old Dr. Peake <b>calked</b> the leaks, and came every day for a while, to look after him. The Grants were Virginians, like Peake, and one day when Grant was getting well enough to be on his feet and sit around in the parlor and talk, the conversation fell upon Virginia and old times. I was present, but the group were probably quite unconscious of me, I being only a lad and a negligible quantity. Two of the group--Dr. Peake and Mrs. Crawford, Mrs. Grant's mother--had been of the audience when the Richmond theatre burned down, thirty-six years before, and they talked over the frightful details of that memorable tragedy. These were eye-witnesses, and with their eyes I saw it all with an intolerable vividness: I saw the black smoke rolling and tumbling toward the sky, I saw the flames burst through it and turn red, I heard the shrieks of the despairing, I glimpsed their faces at the windows, caught fitfully through the veiling smoke, I saw them jump to their death, or to mutilation worse than death.
