5|$|From the 18th century, the Sovereign {{made his}} or her <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> {{the advice of the}} Government. In 1946, with the {{agreement}} of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill, membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again. Thus, the Sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit the advice of His or Her Government.|$|E
5|$|Since the 2002 {{publication}} of The Rise of the Creative Class, Florida has enjoyed academic and commercial success {{in his study}} and promotion {{of the concept of}} a creative class, or a cohort of highly innovative, highly creative individuals who are sought after by businesses. Who's Your City?, Florida's fourth book on the subject, combines scholarly research with a lighthearted self-help tone. Some critics questioned the assumption that the target audience, those easily able to move, would consult the book for advice on moving, but also found the book provides a valuable insight into the impacts of locational <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the urbanized world.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E

Portland, Maine in 2011 used its usual voting machines to tally first choice at the polls, then a central scan with different equipment if an IRV tally was necessary.|$|E
25|$|Principled: Individuals who bargain {{this way}} seek {{integrative}} solutions, {{and do so}} by sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem rather than the intentions, motives, {{and needs of the}} people involved. They separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines, and reach results based on standards independent of personal will. They base their <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> objective criteria rather than power, pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional standards, and tradition.|$|E
25|$|Despite not {{participating}} {{on the campaign}} trail, Jacqueline became subject of intense media attention with her fashion <b>choices.</b> <b>On</b> one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named {{as one of the}} 12 best-dressed women of the world. On the other hand, her preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.|$|E

25|$|In the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, and Macedonia a {{relatively}} new type of two-lane roundabout designs is emerging, called turbo roundabouts. These designs require motorists to choose their direction before entering the roundabout, thereby eliminating many conflicting paths and <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the roundabout itself, such that traffic safety is increased, as well as speed and capacity. These designs, seen from above, typically result in a spiralling flow of traffic, giving them the collective name of turbo roundabouts. As a minor drawback turbo roundabouts are often marked out such that a U-turn {{by means of the}} roundabout is not possible for drivers approaching on certain arms.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the {{essential}} duty of loyalty and duty of care, the primary task occupying trustees {{will be to}} follow {{the terms of a}} trust document. Beyond the rules set out to be followed in the trust document, trustees will ordinarily have some measure of discretionary power, such as in making investment <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the beneficiaries' behalf, or in managing and distributing trust funds. The courts have sought to control the exercise of discretion so it is used only for purposes consistent with the object of the trust settlement. In general it is said that decisions will be overturned if they are irrational, or perverse to the settlor's expectations, but also in two further particular ways.|$|E
25|$|McCain then {{announced}} plans to reveal his running mate the day following {{the conclusion of the}} Democratic National Convention, and just {{a few days before the}} start of the Republican National Convention. During the running mate deliberations, McCain had favored Joe Lieberman, who shared his romantic sense of righteousness and honor. But the opposition from social conservatives, who objected to Lieberman's pro-choice views, was too strong, and a Lieberman pick might have caused a floor fight at the convention. McCain wanted someone who would shake up the race and reinforce his image as a maverick, so he decided against more conventional <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> his short list including Romney and Governor Tim Pawlenty.|$|E

25|$|P. dominula wasps have a lek-based mating system. Males compete {{intensely}} for dominant {{positions on}} the lek, while females are scrupulous when choosing their mates. Males form aggregations on the uppermost portions of structures such as fences, walls, roof peaks, and trees. Males often fight with other males in mid-air or on the structure. Males that lose will fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before making <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> mates. Females use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males that have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto, Grey and Bruce and the Toronto and Nipissing Railways were promoted, at {{the same}} time, and with similar objectives, by an {{interlocking}} group of Ontario businessmen and politicians. It {{is not surprising that}} the group should economise by employing one Chief Engineer who would apply the same design principles and <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> both lines. The first consulting Engineer in Canada was John Edward Boyd of New Brunswick, who conducted the preliminary surveys over the ground to Orangeville and Uxbridge. Douglas Fox came to Canada several times in 1868 and 1869 to support the parliamentary campaign and verify the surveys. On his return to England in the summer of 1869 he made arrangements for an associate, Edmund Wragge, to come to Canada at once to take up the engineering of both lines. In August Wragge visited Pihl in Norway to see his narrow-gauge lines, and arrived in Toronto in September 1869. The tenders for the first sections of line were immediately put out.|$|E

25|$|That said, {{the score}} does allow the {{interpreter}} to make <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> {{how to perform}} a historical work. For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), {{it is not known}} exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part (only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during fermatas (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).|$|E
25|$|The first {{critical}} step... was {{the registration}} of voters according to guidelines established by Congress and interpreted by Generals Sheridan and Charles Griffin. The Reconstruction Acts called for registering all adult males, white and black, except {{those who had}} ever sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and then engaged in rebellion... Sheridan interpreted these restrictions stringently, barring from registration not only all pre-1861 officials {{of state and local}} governments who had supported the Confederacy but also all city officeholders and even minor functionaries such as sextons of cemeteries. In May Griffin... appointed a three-man board of registrars for each county, making his <b>choices</b> <b>on</b> the advice of known scalawags and local Freedmen's Bureau agents. In every county where practicable a freedman served as one of the three registrars... Final registration amounted to approximately 59,633 whites and 49,479 blacks. It is impossible to say how many whites were rejected or refused to register (estimates vary from 7,500 to 12,000), but blacks, who constituted only about 30 percent of the state's population, were significantly overrepresented at 45 percent of all voters.|$|E
