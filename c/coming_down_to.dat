5|$|During {{location}} scouting in December 2010, Nolan {{began searching}} for locations such as India, Romania, and Michigan. According to the Romania Insider, Nolan {{was interested in}} Bucharest's historical centers, Edgar Quinet Street, the Palace of the Parliament, and the Turda salt mine. The film had an estimated budget of $250–300 million, <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> about $230 million after tax credits. Nolan elected not to film in 3-D, but instead stated {{that he intended to}} focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. The Dark Knight Rises featured over an hour of footage shot in IMAX (by comparison, The Dark Knight contained 28 minutes). Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. Wally Pfister had expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX, but because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35mm and 70mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes, as dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX planned to run the film in its theatres for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks. Nolan also bypassed the use of a digital intermediate for the film, resulting in less manipulation of the filmed image and higher film resolution.|$|E

First, he proposed relocating the fleet to the more secure base at Sestos. Second, he claimed that several Thracian kings had offered to provide him with an army. If the generals would offer him a share of the command, he claimed, he would use this army to assist the Athenians. The generals, however, declined this offer and rejected his advice, and Alcibiades returned home.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Tilda Swinton, {{who was the first}} choice to play Jadis, the White Witch, casting was a long process.

Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting, whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late. Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in a 1998 dramatization of Cider with Rosie. He quit school to learn all his lines and beat 3000 boys to the role of Peter.|$|E

25|$|Portal {{had been}} under {{development}} for about a year, at a state where there were only test chambers that the player moved between. Valve found from playtesting that while players had fun with the game's concept, they were left asking of where these puzzles were leading towards. The team worked {{to come up with}} some type of narrative, <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> creating an antagonist that would guide the player in early part of the game but become the goal that the player would strive for by the end. The creation of GLaDOS to serve this purpose began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found that they did not have enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved.|$|E

The defeat led to the A.P.A challenging the Dudley Boyz into a Bar Room Brawl, which ended in a no contest. After the match, The Dudley Boyz and the A.P.A united as they drank beer and attacked Kai En Tai. The Dudley Boyz then began a feud with the Right to Censor on the September 18 edition of Raw is War, where after losing a match to the Dudley Boyz, all four members of Right to Censor attacked them. The attack led to the A.P.A <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ring to help the Dudley Boyz.

500|$|For DmC: Devil May Cry, a reboot of the series, Dante was {{completely}} redesigned {{as a result}} of comments by the Capcom staff. Dante's original design was originally meant to be similar to the ones from previous games, but Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff it had to be completely different in order to appeal to a younger demographic. Motohide Eshiro stated this Dante {{was completely}} set apart from the previous Dantes which they expected would generate major criticism. While the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective. After several drafts of Dante's new character, the designers settled on a look as inspired by Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight. Dante's coat is not long, only <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> his lower-back, his hair is shorter and is black; he has a Devil Trigger form which makes him look close to the classic Dante.

[...] "He hates <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Clearwater. He doesn't like the ride and he's not well," [...] Harrison said. On October 18, 2011, Harrison filed a motion against the execution {{on the grounds that}} the way Florida imposes the death penalty is unconstitutional. A jury makes a recommendation on a life sentence or a death sentence, but under Florida law the judge makes the final decision. A hearing on Chandler's motion was set for October 21 at 1:00pm; Chandler did not attend. On October 24, Chandler's appeal was rejected because he had already filed an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court prior to the decision. This appeal was heard in a court in Tallahassee at 9:00am on November 9, 2011. The Florida Supreme Court had already upheld Chandler's death sentence twice; once in 1997 and again in 2003.|$|E
