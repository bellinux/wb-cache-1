25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by <b>creaming</b> butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work with than shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E
25|$|Ricky Ponting, {{the next}} man in, {{had a great}} start to his innings, <b>creaming</b> a {{boundary}} off only the second ball he faced. When Ponting had added just six to his tally, Virender Sehwag dropped a chance at third slip off Pathan, and when he reached 12, a close lbw decision against him off Ajit Agarkar's bowling was turned down. Overcoming these hiccups, Ponting strove on further with his innings, reaching his fifty off 64 balls, with a four off Ashish Nehra's bowling, in the 23rd over of Australia's innings. One over later, Langer joined the party, too, amassing 20 runs off Anil Kumble's sixth over with two boundaries and two sixes apiece. However, Kumble {{was to have the}} last laugh, as he trapped Langer, who nevertheless, made a dominating and attacking 58 from a mere 72 deliveries in the fifth ball of the 26th over, when Australia were cruising along at a run-rate of above five per over. The dismissal occurred shortly before lunch, providing the Indians with a vital breakthrough, but the relief was a short one, as Langer was replaced by Martyn, who proved to be a thorn in the Indian team's flesh. Martyn seemed to be in a graceful touch from his first ball, stroking some good shots to the fence against the pace duo of Agarkar and Pathan, the latter being unable to replicate his good start with the new ball. Just when he seemed set for a big score, Martyn threw away his wicket when he chased a wide ball from Nehra to VVS Laxman. Steve Waugh the next batsman also played a few through the off-side for his 30 before he was bowled by a clever piece of bowling from Nehra. Simon Katich came in at the fall of the fourth wicket at 252, and then he proceeded to add 138 runs for the fifth wicket with Ponting. Katich started slowly, but gained momentum and proceeded to pepper shots all over the wicket once he settled down, the most memorable shot being a six of Nehra. The partnership ended in the 88th over of the Australian over of the day, when he top-edged a pull from Agarkar, only to be caught by a spectacular catch by Sehwag, who came in diving full-length and held on to the cherry with both hands.|$|E

In 1937 he overtook Jack Hobbs' aggregate of 5,410 Test runs, and his final total of 7,249 runs (58.45) remained a record for 33 years until surpassed by Colin Cowdrey in the 1970s. On the tour he notched up his 167th and last first class century, his 36th first class double century (breaking Bradman's record) and became the seventh man to make 50,000 first class runs after W.G. Grace, Jack Hobbs, Phil Mead, Frank Woolley, Patsy Hendren and Herbert Sutcliffe. As a slip fielder [...] "he had no superior in the world", he was the first fielder to take 100 catches in Tests and his final tally of 110 was a record until Cowdrey beat it in 1968. Hammond was also a Test class fast-medium swing bowler who batsmen compared to Maurice Tate, but he limited this bowling so he could concentrate on his batting.|$|E
