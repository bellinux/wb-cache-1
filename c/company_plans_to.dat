In {{an effort}} to present realism and emotion in the character, Crystal Dynamics captured face and voice performances to accompany the body performances.

Crystal Dynamics aims to make the [...] "combat fresh to the franchise, competitive amongst , and relevant to the story." [...] Among the changes is {{the implementation of a}} free aiming system. The studio reasoned that such a system would cause players to be more invested in the action by fostering a [...] "raw, brutal, and desperate" [...] style. Global brand director Karl Stewart stated that such desperation relates to the updated character's inexperience with violence.

500|$|Steam's {{customer}} {{service has been}} highly criticized, with users citing poor response times or lack of response in regards to issues such as being locked out of one's library or having a non-working game redemption key. In March 2015, Valve {{had been given a}} failing [...] "F" [...] grade from the Better Business Bureau due to a large number of complaints in Valve's handling of Steam, leading Valve's Erik Johnson to state that [...] "we don't feel like our {{customer service}} support is where it needs to be right now". Johnson stated the <b>company</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> better integrate customer support features into the Steam client and be more responsive to such issues. In May 2017, in addition to hiring more staff for customer service, Valve publicized pages that show the number and type of customer service requests it was handling over the last 90 days, with an average of 75,000 entered each day. Of those, requests for refunds were the largest segment, and which Valve could resolve within hours, followed by account security and recovery requests.

500|$|Valve still recognizes it has {{a problem}} with what it calls [...] "fake games", those that are built around reused assets and little other innovation, {{designed}} only to generate profit from unsuspecting users. To help assist finding and removing these games from the service, the <b>company</b> <b>plans</b> <b>to</b> add Steam Explorers atop its existing Steam Curator program, according to various YouTube personalities that have spoken out about such games in the past and with Valve directly, including Jim Sterling and TotalBiscuit. Any Steam user is able to sign up to be an Explorer, and are asked to look at under-performing games on the service as to either vouch that the game is truly original and simply lost among other releases, or if it {{is an example of a}} [...] "fake game", at which point Valve can take action to remove the game. Valve also made changes to the trading card system in May 2017 to prevent abuse by [...] "fake games". Valve found that some of the [...] "bad actors" [...] that released these games with trading card support then distributed game codes to thousands of bot-operated accounts that would run the game to earn trading cards that they could then sell for profit; these games would also create false positives that make these titles appear more popular than they really were and would impact games suggested to legitimate players through their store algorithms. Subsequent to this patch, games must reach some type of confidence factor based on actual playtime before they can generate trading cards, with players credited for their time played towards receiving trading cards before this metric is met.|$|E
