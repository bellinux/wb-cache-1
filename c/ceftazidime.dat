25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, <b>ceftazidime,</b> or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, amikacin).|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2011, Covis Pharma, a {{specialty}} pharmaceutical company owned by affiliates of Cerberus, {{announced that it}} had agreed to acquire full commercial rights for Fortaz (<b>ceftazidime),</b> Zinacef (cefuroxime), Lanoxin (digoxin), Parnate (tranylcypromine sulfate), and Zantac Injection (ranitidine hydrochloride) in the United States and Puerto Rico from GlaxoSmithKline.|$|E
25|$|Without {{access to}} {{appropriate}} antibiotics (principally <b>ceftazidime</b> or meropenem), the septicemic form of melioidosis exceeds 90% in mortality rate. With appropriate antibiotics, {{the mortality rate}} is about 10% for uncomplicated cases but up to 80% for cases with bacteraemia or severe sepsis. It seems certain that access to intensive care facilities is also important, and probably at least partially explains why total mortality is 20% in Northern Australia but 40% in Northeast Thailand. Response to appropriate antibiotic treatment is slow, with the average duration of fever following treatment being 5 to 9 days.|$|E
25|$|Severe or fulminant colitis. Patients need to {{be hospitalized}} {{immediately}} with subsequent bowel rest, nutrition, and IV steroids. Typical starting choices are hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8h, prednisolone 30mg IV q12h, or methylprednisolone 16–20mg IV q8h. The last two are preferred due to less sodium retention and potassium wasting. 24-hour continuous infusion is preferred than the stated dosing. If the patient has not had any corticosteroids within the last 30 days, IV ACTH 120 units/day as continuous infusion is superior than the IV steroids mentioned above. In either case, if symptoms persist after 2–3 days, Mesalazine or hydrocortisone enemas daily or bid can be given. The use of antibiotics in those with severe colitis is not clear. However, there are those patients who have sub-optimal response to corticosteroids and continue to run a low grade fever with bandemia. Typically they can be treated with IV ciprofloxacin and metronidazole. However, in those with fulminant colitis or megacolon, with high fever, leukocytosis with high bandemia, and peritoneal signs, broad spectrum antibiotics should be given (i.e., <b>ceftazidime,</b> cefepime, imipeneum, meropenem, etc.). Abdominal x-ray should also be ordered. If intestinal dilation is seen, patients should be decompressed with NG tube and or rectal tube.|$|E

2500|$|Theoretical {{reasons are}} given for believing {{mortality}} might be lower in patients treated with imipenem: first, less endotoxin is released by dying bacteria during imipenem treatment, and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) for imipenem is lower than for <b>ceftazidime.</b> However, no clinically relevant difference was found in mortality between imipenem and <b>ceftazidime</b> treatments. [...] The MIC of meropenem is higher for B.pseudomallei than for many other organisms, and patients being haemofiltered will need more frequent or higher doses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} is <b>ceftazidime.</b> While various antibiotics are active in vitro (e.g., chloramphenicol, doxycycline, co-trimoxazole), they have been proven to be inferior in vivo {{for the treatment of}} acute melioidosis. Disc diffusion tests are unreliable when looking for co-trimoxazole resistance in B.pseudomallei (they greatly overestimate resistance) and Etests or agar dilution tests should be used in preference. The actions of co-trimoxazole and doxycycline are antagonistic, which suggests [...] these two drugs ought not to be used together.|$|E
2500|$|These enzymes {{were named}} for their greater {{activity}} against cefotaxime than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (e.g., <b>ceftazidime,</b> ceftriaxone, or cefepime). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally {{found on the}} chromosome of Kluyvera species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. More than 80 CTX-M enzymes are currently known. Despite their name, a few are more active on <b>ceftazidime</b> than cefotaxime. They have mainly been found in strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli, but have also been described in other species of Enterobacteriaceae and are the predominant ESBL type in parts of South America. (They are also seen in eastern Europe) CTX-M-14, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-2 are the most widespread. [...] CTX-M-15 is currently (2006) the most widespread type in E. coli the UK and is widely prevalent in the community. An example of beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, along with ISEcp1, {{has been found to}} have recently transposed onto the chromosome of Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146.|$|E
2500|$|OXA beta-lactamases {{were long}} {{recognized}} as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze oxacillin and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d [...] The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to ampicillin and cephalothin and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin and cloxacillin {{and the fact that}} they are poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and other Enterobacteriaceae, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in P. aeruginosa. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to <b>ceftazidime,</b> but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to <b>ceftazidime.</b>|$|E
2500|$|For infections {{caused by}} ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species, {{treatment}} with imipenem or meropenem {{has been associated}} with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. Cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam have been less successful. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and <b>ceftazidime</b> have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic in vitro. Several reports have documented failure of cephamycin therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to aminoglycoside or quinolone therapy, but, in a recent comparison of ciprofloxacin and imipenem for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, imipenem produced the better outcome ...|$|E
2500|$|For Burkholderia pseudomallei, some {{clinical}} antibiotic {{agents that}} are used to treat its infection, mellioidosis, can induce morphological changes such as filamentation and physiological changes in this bacteria. These antibiotics are the β-lactam antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, and antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of thymidine. The ability of some β-lactam antibiotics to induce filamentation in gram negative bacteria is to inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). This inhibition stops the assembly of peptidoglycan network in bacterial cell wall. PBP-1 inhibition leads to rapid cell death. While PBP-2 and PBP-3 inhibition lead to morphological change, turn normal cells to spheroplasts and filamentous cells (elongated rods), respectively. PBP-3 forms the septum in dividing bacteria by involving transpeptidase so inhibition of this PBP-3 protein leads to the incomplete formation of septa in dividing bacteria resulting in the formation of long strands of bacteria (filaments). [...] Kang Chen et al. mentioned that the filament was induced by sublethal concentrations of <b>ceftazidime,</b> ofloxacin, or trimethoprim. At or below the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), filamentation occurred mainly at these concentration and bacteria remained as viable within the vacuoles of immortalized human macrophages, not rapidly killed. [...] However, the B.pseudomallei filaments revert to normal forms when the antibiotics are removed. Moreover, bacillary daughter cells maintained cell-division capacity and viability despite re-exposure to antibiotics such as <b>ceftazidime.</b> Thus, this developmental alteration may provide additionally survival advantages to bacteria. [...] Furthermore, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, filamentation induced by antibiotics appears to trigger bacteria to change from a normal growth phase to a stationary growth phase. [...] Filamentous bacteria are also associated with an increase in endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) release and the immune system of patients needs to cope with this characteristic. Chloramphenicol antibiotic can induce the formation of filamentous cells, which contain multiple copies of unsegregated chromosomes. These chromosomes lead to the unsuccessful division of elongated cells, and the formation of bacterial filament. Moreover, the filamentation also depends on the expression levels of an efflux pump (MexAB-OprM) and the minimum inhibitory concentration of chloramphenicol.|$|E
2500|$|Intravenous <b>ceftazidime</b> is {{the current}} drug of choice for {{treatment}} of acute melioidosis and should be administered 10 to 14 days after getting the infection. Meropenem, imipenem and the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination (Sulperazone) are also active. [...] Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav) may be used if {{none of the above}} four drugs is available, but it produces inferior outcomes. Intravenous antibiotics are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, and are not usually stopped until the patient's temperature has returned to normal for more than 48 hours. Even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, fevers often persist for weeks or months, and patients may continue to develop new lesions even while on appropriate treatment. The median fever clearance time in melioidosis is 10 days: and failure of the fever to clear is not a reason to alter treatment. It is not uncommon for patients to require [...] treatment continuously for a month or more.|$|E
2500|$|Among Gram-negative bacteria, the {{emergence}} of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins {{has been a major}} concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (C. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and <b>ceftazidime,</b> as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins [...] (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam, and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} quoted {{figure of}} 10% {{of patients with}} allergic hypersensitivity to penicillins and/or carbapenems also having cross-reactivity with cephalosporins originated from a 1975 study looking at the original cephalosporins, and subsequent [...] "safety first" [...] policy meant this was widely quoted and assumed to apply to {{all members of the}} group. Hence, it was commonly stated that they are contraindicated in patients with a history of severe, immediate allergic reactions (urticaria, anaphylaxis, interstitial nephritis, etc.) to penicillins, carbapenems, or cephalosporins. [...] This, however, should be viewed in the light of recent epidemiological work suggesting, for many second-generation (or later) cephalosporins, the cross-reactivity rate with penicillin is much lower, having no significantly increased risk of reactivity over the first generation based on the studies examined. The British National Formulary previously issued blanket warnings of 10% cross-reactivity, but, since the September 2008 edition, suggests, in the absence of suitable alternatives, oral cefixime or cefuroxime and injectable cefotaxime, <b>ceftazidime,</b> and ceftriaxone can be used with caution, but the use of cefaclor, cefadrocil, cefalexin, and cefradine should be avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the family}} {{commonly}} express plasmid-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, {{a new group of}} enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979). The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals. ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and <b>ceftazidime,</b> as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam. Thus ESBLs confer multi-resistance to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. [...] A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. [...] The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily ertapenem resistant) isolates have recently been reported. [...] ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum cephalosporins. [...] However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the syn-configuration of the imino side chain, compared to other third-generation cephalosporins, the more complex moiety (containing two methyl and a carboxylic acid group) confers extra stability to β-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria.
