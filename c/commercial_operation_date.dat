Early in 1896, Vacuum Oil of New York established a marketing office on Featherston Street in Wellington selling lamp oil and harness grease. It brought with it extensive collective production, marketing and management skills that presented a major advancement in business organisation. The company's unrivaled mineral lubricant products and associated services quickly dominated the market.|$|R
40|$|Many {{frequently}} encountered start-up {{and operational}} problems in current design combined cycle power plants {{can be traced}} to pipe strain and nozzle loads placed upon pumps. This is most dramatic when the boiler feed pump is affected. Many of the symptoms are significant and can include misalignment, dynamic (changing) alignment, pump or motor vibration, bearing problems, mechanical seal failures and seizure of equipment on start-up and shutdown. While these are all nuisance items that can plague plant shake-down and commissioning, some can generate huge costs and plant unscheduled outages. More profoundly, these symptoms are often all present, making accurate diagnosis of the true cause very difficult. The real cost of these problems can be seen in plants missing <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> <b>dates...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} model RFP for new generation. The 'base' RFP {{is for a}} single-source offshore wind RFP. Required modifications are noted should a state or utility seek multi-source bids (e. g., all renewables or all sources). The model is premised on proposals meeting threshold requirements (e. g., a MW range of generating capacity and a range in terms of years), RFP issuer preferences (e. g., likelihood of <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> by a <b>date</b> certain, price certainty, and reduction in congestion), and evaluation criteria, along {{with a series of}} plans (e. g., site, environmental effects, construction, community outreach, interconnection, etc.). The Model RFP places the most weight on project risk (45 %), followed by project economics (35 %), and environmental and social considerations (20 %). However, if a multi-source RFP is put forward, the sponsor would need to either add per-MWh technology-specific, life-cycle climate (CO 2), environmental and health impact costs to bid prices under the 'Project Economics' category or it should increase the weight given to the 'Environmental and Social Considerations' category...|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1980s, {{independent}} power producer projects {{became popular}} in British Columbia due to growing demands for energy that {{could no longer be}} supported by BC Hydro alone. New provincial regulations addressed the issue of how to manage the energy budget and recommended the creation of new programs to help supply the domestic demand. The success of these programs lead to a revamped energy strategy in 2002, outlined under the new BC Energy Plan, which legislated that BC Hydro would no longer make its own energy-generating capacity, and instead purchase power directly from IPPs. This led to a boom in the distribution of IPP licenses and rapid growth of new energy-harvesting projects, along with expansion of existing projects to rural regions. In 2006, BC Hydro entered a long-term electricity purchase agreement with large-scale and small-scale IPP projects, which requires that the project developers sell all energy generated from the project to BC Hydro for a term of 20 to 40 years starting on the <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> <b>date.</b> In 2009 there were 46 projects in operation and an additional 38 proposed or under construction projects that have agreements with BC Hydro.|$|E
40|$|The Kemper County IGCC Project is an {{advanced}} coal technology project {{that is being}} developed by Mississippi Power Company (MPC). The project is a lignite-fueled 2 -on- 1 Integrated Gasification Combined-Cycle (IGCC) facility incorporating the air-blown Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG™) technology jointly developed by Southern Company; Kellogg, Brown, and Root (KBR); and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) in Wilsonville, Alabama. The estimated nameplate capacity of the plant will be 830 MW with a peak net output capability of 582 MW. As a result of advanced emissions control equipment, the facility will produce marketable byproducts of ammonia, sulfuric acid, and carbon dioxide. 65 percent of the carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) will be captured and used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), making the Kemper County facility’s carbon emissions {{comparable to those of}} a natural-gas-fired combined cycle power plant. The <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> <b>date</b> (COD) of the Kemper County IGCC plant will be May 2014.

40|$|I {{have written}} this {{report for the}} {{requirement}} of M. ENG. of second year and the research problem being analyzed is Effect of IPP Electrical Energy Tariff to the Economy of Sri Lanka. I have being involved {{more than ten years}} in the filed of thermal power generation activities including operation, maintenance, design, construction, testing and commissioning activities in foreign country as well. Further, I carried out Power Purchase Agreement administration on behalf of the power purchaser of four major IPP projects established in Sri Lanka to the value of 225 Million Dollars, since the effective date right up to the <b>commercial</b> <b>operation</b> <b>date.</b> Therefore, I believe that the topic is well in line with my career and look forward to carry out a comprehensive analysis of the topic. I emphasize the fact that this topic generated in my mind because of carrier involvement of the subject for a long time. The title describes the meaning and understanding of the dilemma if exists and shall try to elaborate repercussion of it and how it would be affected or not affected to the economy of Sri Lanka. For the special study of the 3 r d term of the project, I have touched the problem in a different style and I hope to augment and analyze the topic in more details by identifying the factors that are contributed. In Chapter 1, I elaborated the background of economy of Sri Lanka and highlighting up and downs of various key economic performance indicators in certain occasions since the independence. I believe that the understanding of the economic status of the country is required before touching the subject matter. At the end of Chapter 1 a brief introduction has been done to the power generation situation in the country and immerges of thermal power generation to the system. -The Chapter 2 begins the story Electricity Industry of the country outlining the components contributing to the demand of electricity. It further illustrates the history of capacity augmentation and the exact time line of the introduction of IPP generation to the system and visualizes the future trend in mathematical formula for determination of the values at any potential year. § 00 University of Moratuwa 87890 87890 I tried to cover the whole Independent Power concept in Chapter 3 and believe that it will be useful to the understanding of various stages of the IPP and elaborated the each stage and agreements in detail. Chapter 4 is completely devoted to the analysis of all IPP plants established up to date and each plant is considered separately highlighting their own features. Even though this chapter looks like short and much time has been spent to mold out the final effect as a result of involvement of thousands and thousand of data and many months at the computer table. All the data being used here are factual and I have faced great obstacle while establishing the diesel fuel price for power generation due to the very volatile market price and involvement of many tax components of the final product. The relevant data always presented in Chart format for better visualization and which was more enthusiasms and for instant understanding. By dividing the Chapters in the above manner, it may be seen that the work has been organized to form a continuous logical manner. Finally, I anticipate that the result of this comprehensive analysis would be useful to the accurate decision makers of the country...|$|E
