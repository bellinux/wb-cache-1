There are no simple general relation between the collision cross section and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. It depend on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the Lennard-Jones potential or Morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. The radius for zero [...] Lennard-Jones potential is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study two related {{iterative}} randomized algorithms for distributed computation of averages. The first algorithm is the Broadcast Gossip Algorithm, in which at each iteration one randomly selected node broadcasts its own state to its neighbors. The second algorithm {{is a novel}} variation of the former, in which at each iteration every node is allowed to broadcast: hence this algorithm, which we <b>call</b> <b>Collision</b> Broadcast Gossip Algorithm (CBGA), is affected by interference among messages. The performance of both algorithms is evaluated in terms of rate of convergence and asymptotical error: focusing on large Abelian Cayley networks, we highlight the role of topology and of design parameters. We show that on fully-connected graphs the rate of convergence is bounded away from one, whereas the asymptotical error is bounded away from zero. On the contrary, on sparse graphs the rate of convergence goes to one and the asymptotical error goes to zero, as {{the size of the}} network grows larger. Our results also show that the performance of the CBGA is close to the performance of the BGA: this indicates the robustness of broadcast gossip algorithms to interferences...|$|E
40|$|AFLP is a {{frequently}} used DNA fingerprinting technique that is {{popular in the}} plant sciences. A problem encountered in the interpretation and comparison of individual plant profiles, consisting of band presence-absence patterns, is that multiple DNA fragments of the same length can be generated that eventually show up as single bands on a gel. The phenomenon {{of two or more}} fragments coinciding in a band within an individual profile is a type of homoplasy, that we <b>call</b> <b>collision.</b> Homoplasy biases estimates of genetic similarity. In this study, we show how to calculate collision probabilities for bands as a function of band length, given the fragment count, the band count, or band lengths. We also determine probabilities of higher order collisions, and estimate the total number of collisions for a profile. Since short fragments occur more often, short bands are more likely to contain collisions. For a typical plant genome and AFLP procedure, the collision probability for the shortest band is 25 times larger than for the longest. In a profile with 100 bands a quarter of the bands may contain collisions, concentrated at the shorter band lengths. All calculations require a careful estimate of the monotonically decreasing fragment length distribution. Modifications of Dice and Jaccard coefficients are proposed. The principles are illustrated on data from a phylogenetic study in lettuc...|$|E
40|$|AFLP is a DNA {{fingerprinting}} technique, {{resulting in}} binary band presence–absence patterns, called profiles, with known or unknown band positions. We model AFLP as a sampling procedure of fragments, with lengths sampled from a distribution. Bands represent fragments of specific lengths. We focus on estimation of pairwise genetic similarity, defined as average fraction of common fragments, by AFLP. Usual estimators are Dice (D) or Jaccard coefficients. D overestimates genetic similarity, since identical bands in profile pairs may correspond to different fragments (homoplasy). Another complicating {{factor is the}} occurrence of different fragments of equal length within a profile, appearing as a single band, which we <b>call</b> <b>collision.</b> The bias of D increases with larger numbers of bands, and lower genetic similarity. We propose two homoplasy- and collision-corrected estimators of genetic similarity. The first is a modification of D, replacing band counts by estimated fragment counts. The second is a maximum likelihood estimator, only applicable if band positions are available. Properties of the estimators are studied by simulation. Standard errors and confidence intervals for the first are obtained by bootstrapping, and for the second by likelihood theory. The estimators are nearly unbiased, and have for most practical cases smaller standard error than D. The likelihood-based estimator generally gives the highest precision. The relationship between fragment counts and precision is studied using simulation. The usual range of band counts (50 – 100) appears nearly optimal. The methodology is illustrated using data from a phylogenetic study on lettuc...|$|E

In so <b>called</b> <b>collision</b> runaways many stars can merge and may form a very massive star that eventually forms an intermediate mass blackhole. We have performed detailed evolution calculations of merger remnants from collisions between main sequence stars, both for lower mass stars and higher mass stars.

In the algorithm, Manchester code is used and collision location is detected when a collision occurs. Then collision location is used to update quickly and accurately the query prefix in Query Tree (QT) algorithm and Hybrid Query Tree (HQT) Algorithm.

Then for the Euclidean space, we apply cross-polytope LSH to get an index of the nearest standard basis vector from point p, denoted as H 2 [*]=[*]i, i[*]∈[*] 1,[*] 2,[*]…,[*] 2 d. Finally, we combine H 1, H 2  and get the hybrid hash H[*]=[*][H 1,[*]H 2], then we use md 5 to hash H again to get last hash value of p and store p in corresponding hash bucket. To increase the probability of collision for similar object, we need to repeat above steps L times. After all points have been processed, we will get L hash tables.

The first scheme, <b>called</b> <b>collision</b> biasing, already exists in the French code TRIPOLI. This method samples several post-collision coordinates and randomly selects one in proportion to an input importance function. The second scheme, called track biasing, is original and differs from collision biasing in that several particle tracks (trajectories) are sampled from one distance-to-collision calculation to the next distance-to-collision calculation, and one is chosen randomly in proportion to an input importance function. The effect of track biasing was found to be problem dependent. For transport along a long narrow cylinder the Monte Carlo efficiency increased, however for a deep penetration problem it decreased...|$|R
40|$|As {{the worlds}} demand for energy is {{increasing}} mostly {{due to the}} increase in population, and coal, oil and gas deposits are limited, it is desirable to gather energy from renewable energy sources. Wind energy is a form of renewable energy. Wind turbines have been common on land and near shores for some time, but now one wants {{to take advantage of the}} wind resources further away from the coast. As the length from the coast increases, so does the water depth making it necessary to use other foundations than the well-known monopile. In this thesis the &# 147;Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency&# 148; in Germany, also known as Bundesamt f&# 252;r Schifffarth und Hydrographie requires in the standard &# 147;Design of Offshore Wind Turbines&# 148; that an offshore wind turbine needs to be risk evaluated against a ship tanker of more than 500 MJ in collision energy in order to be classified as collision energy. This is to prevent environmental pollution in form of oil spill. Whether the offshore wind turbine models used in this thesis are collision friendly or not relies on different factors. When the given soil properties are used the analyses show in all cases except one that the offshore wind turbine models can be <b>called</b> <b>collision</b> friendly. The case were it could not be <b>called</b> <b>collision</b> friendly was a case with the small jacket at a water depth of 27 m getting hit by a loaded ship at a column of the jacket, but installing a horizontal brace on this jacket would make it also collision friendly. The effects of soil, water depth and a horizontal x-brace are looked further into in this thesis. If the soil had been stronger it is not certain that the outcome would be the same. When the jackets were fixed to the sea bed, several of the models could collapse in the dangerous direction over the ship. A horizontal brace was seen to have a positive effect when installed on the different jacket models. It seems also that it is more favorable to use jackets at deeper water. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose high {{throughput}} collision free, mobility adaptive and energy efficient medium access protocol (MAC) <b>called</b> <b>Collision</b> Free Mobility Adaptive (CFMA) for wireless sensor networks. CFMA ensures that transmissions incur no collisions, and allows nodes to undergo sleep mode whenever they are not transmitting or receiving. It uses delay allocation scheme based on traffic priority at each node and avoids allocating same backoff delay {{for more than one}} node unless they are in separate clusters. It also allows nodes to determine when they can switch to sleep mode during operation. CFMA for mobile nodes provides fast association between the mobile node and the cluster coordinator. The proposed MAC performs well in both static and mobile scenarios, which shows its significance over existing MAC protocols proposed for mobile applications. The performance of CFMA is evaluated through extensive simulation, analysis and comparison with other mobility aware MAC protocols. The results show that CFMA outperforms significantly the existing CSMA/CA, Sensor Mac (S-MAC), Mobile MAC (MOB-MAC), Adaptive Mobility MAC (AM-MAC), Mobility Sensor MAC (MS-MAC), Mobility aware Delay sensitive MAC (MD-MAC) and Dynamic Sensor MAC (DS-MAC) protocols including throughput, latency and energy consumption...|$|R

This model accommodates several characteristics that are common in sensor networks. Examples of these characteristics are unavoidable local broadcast, probabilistic message transmission, asymmetric communication, message collision, and timeout actions and randomization steps. We also propose three methods for analyzing a sensor network protocol specified in the model. In the first method. called nondeterministic analysis, a specified sensor network protocol is shown to be "nondeterministically correct" under the assumption that message delivery is assured and message collision is guaranteed not to occur. In the second method, called probabilistic analysis, the protocol is shown to be "probabilistically correct" under the assumption that message delivery is probabilistic but message collision is guaranteed not to occur. In the third method, <b>called</b> <b>collision</b> analysis, the effect of message collision and probabilistic message delivery on the correctness of the protocol is analyzed. To demonstrate the utility of our model, we discuss an example protocol {{that can be used}} by a sensor to identify its strong neighbors in the network, and apply the analysis methods to the protocol.

In this paper, we propose to use a base of m single LSH functions to construct "dynamic" compound hash functions, and define a new LSH scheme <b>called</b> <b>Collision</b> Counting LSH (C 2 LSH). If the number of LSH functions under which a data object o collides with a query object q is greater than a pre-specified collision threhold l, then o {{can be regarded as}} a good candidate of c-approximate NN of q. This is the basic idea of C 2 LSH. Our theoretical studies show that, by appropriately choosing the size of LSH function base m and the collision threshold l, C 2 LSH can have a guarantee on query quality. Notably, the parameter m is not affected by dimensionality of data objects, which makes C 2 LSH especially good for high dimensional NN search.
