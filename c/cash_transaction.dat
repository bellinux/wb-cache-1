25|$|In a {{traditional}} <b>cash</b> <b>transaction,</b> fractional pricing imposes tangible costs on the vendor (printing fractional prices), the cashier (producing awkward change) and the customer (stowing the change). These factors have become less relevant {{with the increased}} use of checks, credit and debit cards and other forms of currency-free exchange; also, the addition of sales tax makes the pre-tax price less relevant to the amount of change (although in Europe the sales tax is generally included in the shelf price).|$|E

Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a <b>cash</b> <b>transaction</b> with the distributors of HFS – the motorcycle gang from the park – and a chase ensues on the freeway.

2500|$|Tanka is {{an ancient}} Sanskrit word for money. As the value of rupee rapidly eroded over the years, minting of the {{fractions}} of decimalized rupee has been completely abandoned. Presently, bank notes and some coins of 5 and 10 rupees are rarely in use and the paper currency is the sole method of any <b>cash</b> <b>transaction.</b> All fractions of the rupee are of only historical significance and no fractions are in use at all. A taka in West Pakistan was worth two paises while this word was used alternatively for rupee in East Pakistan. After its independence, Bangladesh started to officially call its currency [...] "taka" [...] (BDT) in 1971.|$|E

[...] The last 1¢ (penny) to be minted in Canada was struck on Friday May 4, 2012, and ceased its distribution on February 4, 2013. Ever since, the price for a <b>cash</b> <b>transaction</b> may be rounded to the nearest five cents.

2500|$|On 16 June Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) {{submitted}} a competing proposal in which Siemens would acquire Alstom's gas turbine activities for €3.9 billion and MHI would form {{joint ventures with}} Alstom, acquiring 40, 20 and 20% stakes in Alstom's steam and nuclear, electrical grid, and hydroelectric businesses respectively, for €3.1billion. The proposal included an additional offer to acquire a further 10% stake from shareholder Bouygues and the option to form a joint venture in rail transport. On 19 June, GE revised its bid, valuing the assets at the same price, but with a lower <b>cash</b> <b>transaction</b> value. [...] The revised bid proposed to form a 50:50 joint venture combining GE's and Alstom's renewable and electric grid business, and a 50:50 joint venture in Alstom's steam turbine and nuclear power business. GE also announced a memorandum of understanding between the two firms in the rail transport sector, where GE would sell its rail signalling business to Alstom. On 20 June, Siemens and MHI modified their offer, with MHI increasing its stake in Alstom's steam, hydro, and grid businesses to 40% in all three (total €3.9billion), and with Siemens increasing its offer by €400million to €4.3billion. Subsequently, Economy minister Arnaud Montebourg stated he would block both bids, but stated the French government was now backing the GE offer, and had given GE additional specifications regarding commitments and guarantees. It also announced it intended to take two thirds of Bouygues' shareholding (20%). [...] The Alstom board met {{the next day and}} backed GE's revised bid. On 22 June, the French state agreed terms with Bouygues, enabling the purchase of part of their shareholding in Alstom, taking a 20% stake in [...] Alstom from Bouygues before payment, with an agreement to buy the shares at a 2–5% discount on a value of a minimum of ≈€35 per share. Analysts commented Bouygues would be under pressure to make a deal with the state in order to gain positive political capital due to regulation issues the company was facing in the French telecoms sector.|$|E

25|$|Others have {{suggested}} that fractional pricing was first adopted as a control on employee theft. For <b>cash</b> <b>transactions</b> with a round price, {{there is a chance}} that a dishonest cashier will pocket the bill rather than record the sale. For <b>cash</b> <b>transactions</b> with an odd price, the cashier must make change for the customer. This generally means opening the cash register which creates a record of the sale in the register and reduces the risk of the cashier stealing from the store owner.|$|R

The whole question resolves itself into a matter of [...] "business is business," [...] and the predatory interests which have banded themselves together to finance and organise the tariff campaign cannot be expected to put up with the conscientious scruples and reasonable hesitations of Members of Parliament. It will be a <b>cash</b> <b>transaction</b> throughout, with large profits and quick delivery. Every little would-be monopolist in the country is going to have his own association to run his own particular trade. Every constituency will be forced to join in the scramble, and to secure special favours at the expense of the commonwealth for its special branches of industry. All the elections of the future will turn on tariffs. Why, you can see the thing beginning already. That egregious Tariff Commission have been dividing all the loot among themselves before the battle has been won--dividing the lion's skin while the beast lives--and I was reading only the other day that the Conservatives of Norwood have decided that they could not support their Member any longer, because, forsooth, he would not pledge himself to vote for a special tax on foreign imported chairs and window panes. It is the same in every country.|$|E

5000|$|Rounding {{hurts the}} poor Millions of {{transactions}} are conducted {{each day in}} the US economy, and with 26% of Americans either not having savings or checking accounts or relying on payday lending services, there are many <b>cash</b> <b>transactions</b> taking place involving American citizens each day. Federal Reserve {{studies have shown that}} people with relatively low incomes use cash more frequently than individuals with higher incomes. Since only <b>cash</b> <b>transactions</b> will be subject to rounding, a 2001 study indicates that any move to eliminate the penny may disproportionately hurt [...] "unbanked" [...] Americans who have no other option and lack the means to make non-cash transactions. The study, authored by Raymond Lombra, concluded that eliminating the penny would impose a [...] "rounding tax" [...] of at least $600 million per year on American consumers.
