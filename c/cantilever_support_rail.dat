The advantages of cantilever bus seat structure is light weight, the luggage {{can be put}} under the seat and {{it is easy for}} floor cleanup. The total design technique was used to develop the <b>cantilever</b> <b>support.</b> Market survey was conducted to study on current available <b>cantilever</b> <b>supported</b> vehicle seat. After that, product requirement of cantilever design is defined. Next, brainstorming technique was used to generate the preliminary concept of cantilever design. Six conceptual designs were generated for selection. The matrix evaluation method was used to determine the final design of cantilever design. The weight of the concept was obtained through weighted analysis. Lastly, the final concept will be fabricated as prototype for further validation purpose...|$|R

These vehicles each seat four people inline and are suspended from a central, <b>cantilevered</b> <b>support</b> structure.

Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore statically determinate with no members carrying mixed loads.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study and prepare basic time for piling works by synthetic equations. The time data of 7 work elements of piling works were collected from 10 different construction sites in Phuket Province of Thailand. The synthetic equations were derived with multiple regressions analysis method using statistic software package. These work elements consisted of pile driving work, moving piling rig left or right on <b>supporting</b> <b>rails,</b> moving <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> left or right, moving piling rig and <b>supporting</b> <b>rails</b> back or forth, joining of two-piece pile by welding, joining of two-piece pile by steel coupling, and pile driving with pushing post. These synthetic equations were used to determine the basic time, standard time, and productivity values for various types and sizes of square precast concrete pile. The researchers found that these productivity values were reliable compared to general practice, and could be applied in construction planning and scheduling in Phuket province or other area with similar geological conditions...|$|R

25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called anchor arms. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced <b>cantilever's</b> <b>supports,</b> the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|R
