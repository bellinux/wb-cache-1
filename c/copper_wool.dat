40|$|Many gold-bearing ores in the Western United States {{also contain}} {{small amounts of}} mercury. The {{presence}} of mercury creates potential pollution and health hazards during several steps in gold processing. An investigation was undertaken by the Bureau of Mines to develop techniques for removing mercury from cyanide mill solutions by selective electrowinning to reduce the potential hazards. Sixty-five percent of the mercury was selectively electrowon from synthetic carbon strip solution at applied potentials of 1. 00 to 1. 50 V when using a mercury-coated platinum or copper plate cathode. Increasing the active surface area by using mercury-coated <b>copper</b> <b>wool</b> resulted in up to % pct of the mercury being electrowon from mill carbon strip solutions that contained 1. 9 to 20 ppm Hg, 20 to 345 ppm Au, and 0. 35 to 39. 5 ppm Ag. About 98 pct of the silver was electrowon with the mercury onto the mercury cathode. Gold extraction ranged between 0 and 20 pet. Results of the investigation showed that choice of cathode material was {{critical to the success}} of the process. Selectivity was not achieved using uncoated steel wool cathodes...|$|E

40|$|The {{spinning}} mesh disc reactor (SMDR) {{is a novel}} {{process intensification}} technology which uses centrifugal force to drive reaction fluid over a mesh supported catalyst on a rotating disc. The potential of the SMDR for organic synthesis has been demonstrated {{for the first time}} for Henry reaction using copper immobilised on woollen cloth mesh. A new protocol for copper immobilisation on wool has been developed producing a superior catalyst to the homogeneous copper triflate system: copper heterogenised on wool afforded a higher batch conversion (85 %) (cf. 57 % for the homogeneous case) in the same timeframe. In the SMDR, the reaction was more efficient than either homogeneous or heterogeneous batch reaction: with further optimisation the conversion increased from 77 % to 93 % as the spinning speed of the disc increased from 250 to 450 RPM at a flowrate of 3 ml s- 1. There was only a 3 % reduction in conversion on re-use of <b>copper</b> <b>wool</b> over 3 cycles under similar experimental conditions indicating that this catalyst is robust. Pure wool was also found to have some catalytic activity for the Henry reaction, giving a maximum conversion of 85 % at 450 RPM in the SMDR. However, it deactivated significantly with reuse and therefore cannot be considered a stable, robust catalyst. Overall, the results show that the copper immobilised wool in the SMDR can be used to improve the conversions for the Henry reaction and that there is therefore promise for the SMDR to be extended to other traditional solvent based reactions...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{effect of}} expiratory endotracheal tube (ETT) {{resistance}} on dynamic lung inflation is unknown. We hypothesized that ETT resistance causes dynamic lung hyperinflation by impeding lung emptying. We further hypothesized that compensation for expiratory ETT resistance by automatic tube compensation (ATC) attenuates dynamic lung hyperinflation. METHODS: A ventilator {{equipped with the}} original ATC mode and operating in a pressure-targeted mode was connected to a physical lung model that consists of four equally sized glass bottles filled with <b>copper</b> <b>wool.</b> Inspiratory pressure, peak expiratory flow, trapped lung volume and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were assessed at combinations of four inner ETT diameters (7. 0, 7. 5, 8. 0 and 8. 5 mm), four respiratory rates (15, 20, 25 and 30 /minute), three inspiratory pressures (3. 0, 4. 5 and 6. 0 cmH 2 O) and four lung compliances (113, 86, 58 and 28 ml/cmH 2 O). Intrinsic PEEP was measured {{at the end of}} an expiratory hold manoeuvre. RESULTS: At a given test lung compliance, inspiratory pressure and ETT size, increasing respiratory rates from 15 to 30 /minutes had the following effects: inspiratory tidal volume and peak expiratory flow were decreased by means of 25 % (range 0 % to 51 %) and 11 % (8 % to 12 %), respectively; and trapped lung volume and intrinsic PEEP were increased by means of 25 % (0 % to 51 %) and 26 % (5 % to 45 %), respectively (all P < 0. 025). At otherwise identical baseline conditions, introduction of expiratory ATC significantly attenuated (P < 0. 025), by approximately 50 %, the respiratory rate-dependent decreases in inspiratory tidal volume and the increases in trapped lung volume and intrinsic PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: In a lung model of pressure-targeted ventilation, expiratory ETT resistance caused dynamic lung hyperinflation during increases in respiratory rates, thereby reducing inspiratory tidal volume. Expiratory ATC attenuated these adverse effects...|$|E

Copper and selenium were administered to 494 four-tooth Romney ewes grazing at two different stocking rates. A significant (p< 0.

A depression in clean fleece yield (P< 0. 05) and a small improvement in fleece crimp clarity (P< 0. 05) were associated with copper and selenium supplementation respectively. Although both these effects reach significance at the P 0. 05 level, they {{are considered to be}} due to chance.

Period and stocking rate were both shown to significantly (p< 0. 05) affect mean plasma copper. No effect of lambing rank or age of ewe could be shown. A small stocking rate by age interaction was recorded (P< 0. 05 but this is considered to have arisen by chance. Of eighty one correlation coefficients determined between plasma copper level and various fleece and body variables, only six were statistically significant (P< 0. 05).

5000|$|A {{contemporary}} {{empire of}} Ghana, but less extensive, {{the kingdom of}} Tekrur was its vassal. Ghana and Tekrur were the only organized populations before Islamization. The territory of Tekrur approximates that of the current Fouta Toro. Its existence in the 9th century is attested by Arabic manuscripts. The formation of the state may have taken place as an influx of Fulani from the east settled in the Senegal valley. John Donnelly Fage suggests that Takrur was formed through the interaction of Berbers from the Sahara and [...] "Negro agricultural peoples" [...] who were [...] "essentially Serer" [...] although its kings after 1000 CE might have been Soninke (northern Mande).

60|$|An {{examination}} of the import list shows that 63.6 per cent are raw materials and food. The chief items of the former class, namely, cotton, <b>wool,</b> <b>copper,</b> hides, iron-ore, furs, silk, rubber, and tin, could not be much reduced without reacting on the export trade, and {{might have to be}} increased if the export trade was to be increased. Imports of food, namely, wheat, barley, coffee, eggs, rice, maize, and the like, present a different problem. It is unlikely that, apart from certain comforts, the consumption of food by the German laboring classes before the war was in excess of what was required for maximum efficiency; indeed, it probably fell short of that amount. Any substantial decrease in the imports of food would therefore react on the efficiency of the industrial population, and consequently on the volume of surplus exports which they could be forced to produce. It is hardly possible to insist on a greatly increased productivity of German industry if the workmen are to be underfed. But this may not be equally true of barley, coffee, eggs, and tobacco. If it were possible to enforce a régime in which for the future no German drank beer or coffee, or smoked any tobacco, a substantial saving could be effected. Otherwise there seems little room for any significant reduction.|$|R
40|$|A {{regular and}} {{precisely}} defined staple crimp {{is an important}} contributor to {{the appearance of the}} fleece (Henderson, 1968). It is also well recognised that young sheep have a fleece that is better than older sheep. In some instances the deterioration of the fleece starts at an early age and proceeds rapidly. This wool has been referred to as “doggy” wool. The main characteristic of “doggy” wool is a lowering of crimp frequency, through several stages according to severity, so that the wool has an irregular crimp, an unnatural lustre and a harsh handle (Ryder and Stephenson, 1968). The fault has been widely reported in the Australian Merino. In one survey of the Eastern States of Australia no flock was found without some form of abnormal crimping. The fault was more prevalent in order sheep (Chapman and Short, 1964 a). “Doggy” wool is classified as rough fleece in Australia. Rough fleece in the Australian clip has increased in recent years to ¾ per cent of the total wool clip, the price gained being appreciably less than that of wools with more crimp. True “Doggy” wool is thought to make up at least ⅔ of the total rough fleece, the remainder being steely (<b>copper</b> deficient) <b>wool</b> (Chapman, 1964). There is no doubt that some wools, affected only slightly by crimp abnormality, are present in normal wool grades but have been devalued by the slight crimp upset. An association was found between “doggy” wool production and the presence of capsules attached to an enlarged outer-root sheath of a varying proportion of follicles in the population (Chapman, Short and Hyland, 19860; Chapman and Short, 1965 b). The incidence of follicles with capsules was found to increase with age (Chapman, Short and Hyland, 1960) and was associated with the production of short, straight, coarse fibres by affected follicles (Chapman and Short, 1965 b). The presence of a number of these fibres in a staple of wool was found to upset the crimp form of the staple of wool was found to upset the crimp form of the staple (Aiken and Ryder, 1962; Chapman and Short, 1964 a). Burns and Clarkson (1950) had noted the presence of capsules attached to Romney wool follicles. These had also been noted in the New Zealand Romney by Henderson (1967). The present experiment was designed to establish whether or not these capsules were present in any great numbers in the Romney, and with the Australian experience in mind, to try and establish a relationship between their presence and deterioration of crimp with age. If sheep with capsulated follicles were present in any great number and crimp deterioration was significantly associated with the presence of aberrant follicles, there would be justification for further work in this field. A large number of sheep with this fault could cause quite a serious devaluation in the New Zealand Wool clip. Although only one flock was involved in the experiment reported, it is in the nature of a survey of the incidence of a possibly serious wool fault...|$|R
40|$|Several {{authors have}} {{suggested}} {{a role for}} different predisposing factors in cases of copper toxicity, but any association between these factors and biochemical changes in the sheep have not been studied. Therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to look for the changes that occurred in sheep treated regularly with a parenteral form of copper. After identifying some of these parameters, further sheep were subjected to stressors that may be encountered in normal farming practice and the changes in response to copper treatment were compared to those of sheep not subjected to that stessor but treated with the same dose of copper. Eleven Romney rams were regularly monitored to measure any changes that occurred in certain biochemical parameters when the sheep received a weekly subcutaneous injection of 50 mg of copper calcium edetate. The biochemical parameters included serum levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), blood <b>copper</b> concentration, and <b>wool</b> <b>copper</b> content. At fortnightly intervals, liver biopsy samples were collected for an estimation of the copper content and for a histopathological examination. It was found that the activity of SDH and SGOT in the serum became elevated as the liver accumulation of copper increased. SDH levels were the first to change and became elevated up to six weeks earlier than SGOT. Although the pathological changes in the hepatocytes developed progressively, their severity and extent did not have a direct relationship to liver copper content. There way no significant change in the copper content of either blood or of wool during the period that the liver copper content increased. The determination of indicators of early changes in cases of toxicity allowed stressors to be superimposed on copper therapy to assess whether such stressors might influence copper toxicity. The sheep involved received 3 mg Cu/kg bodyweight as copper calcium edetate on the premise that sheep of low bodyweight might receive a double injection of the currently recommended dose of 50 mg per sheep. The same biochemical parameters of SDH and SGOT activity, blood copper concentration and liver copper content were used to assess the potentiating effects on copper toxicity of sheep first treated with copper calcium edetate parenterally and then subjected to various stressors. For this purpose 56 sheep, with additional control animals where appropriate, were divided into their respective groups. The stressors included dehydration by removing 25 % of blood volume, starvation by fasting for 48 hours, exposure to cold (5 °C) for 5 days, and exposure to heat (40 °C) for 5 days. Other sheep were either immersed in an organophosphate insecticide, or treated with thiabendazole anthelmintic at a dose rate of 100 mg/kg bodyweight. Pregnant sheep, and others heavily parasitised (e. p. g. > 1570) were similarly created. The stressors of dehydration and cold, pregnancy, the application of insecticide or the administration of anthelmintic showed no evidence of enhancing the toxic effects of copper. However the stressors of starvation, heat, and parasitism did potentiate toxicity and resulted in approximately half of the sheop in each group dying from copper toxicity. A further series of experiments used 60 sheep, divided into 14 groups; each group being given a different schedule of copper administration which consisted of one of the stressors and/or one of a series of formulations of copper consisting of salts made up in various bases. Blood samples were collected hourly for 16 hours and the rate of change of blood copper concentration was measured. In the sheep that were starved, the rate of change of blood copper concentration increased to 0. 141 Mg Cu/l/hr for animals starved for 72 hours in comparison with a rate of 0. 056 mg Cu/l/hr for animals given access to food and water. Those sheep that received 50 mg of copper calcium edetate in either of two proprietary formulations; one containing polyvinyl pyrrolidine (PVP) and the other without PVP but the same dose contained in half the volume, showed a mean blood copper concentration rate of increase of 0. 017 mg Cu/l/hr. An increase in the dose to 100 mg Cu increased the rate of uptake of copper to 0. 022 mg Cu/l/hr, whereas a 50 mg dose diluted in an equivalent amount of water showed an increase in the rate of translocation of copper to 0. 036 mg Cu/l/hr. The four sheep subjected to heat stress or given copper by mouth as copper edetate at a dose rate of 0. 33 mg/kg showed a blood copper concentration increase to 0. 025 mg Cu/l/hr, whereas 7 gm of oral copper oxide needles administered to three 50 kg sheep did not produce any increase in blood copper concentration during the period of study. Starved sheep also showed changes in their blood concentrations of glucose and albumin. Blood glucose reduced from a mean of 4. 7 gm/ 100 ml to a mean of 2. 4 gm/ 100 ml in the nine sheep starved over 72 hours, plasma albumin increased from 1. 30 gm/ 100 ml to 2. 26 gm/ 100 ml, and total protein rose by 10. 2 %. Deaths following the administration of copper therapeutically have been reported on many occasions. Therefore it was decided to measure the effects of copper therapy on the liver copper storage of sheep which initially had a range of liver copper concentrations. A "copper deficient" farm which regularly reports lambs with enzootic ataxia, and a "copper sufficient" farm with no reported signs of copper deficiency in sheep, were selected. Two hundred sheep on the copper deficient farm and fifty sheep on the copper sufficient farm were treated once annually with 50 mg of copper calcium edetate given subcutaneously. This dose was adequate to maintain the liver copper content of all treated sheep on the copper deficient farm above 70 ppm Cu D. M. However in the sheep grazing the copper sufficient farm, liver biopsy samples indicated that copper, apparently surplus to requirements, was stored in the liver resulting in copper concentrations in all sheep in excess of 510 ppm Cu D. M. Another study measured the uptake of copper by the liver in groups of four sheep of four different breeds common in New Zealand. These breeds were the Border Leicester, N. Z. Romney, Suffolk and Merino. There was no significant difference between the former three breeds, but the Merinos retained less copper in their livers after grazing pasture for 3 months (88 ppm vs l 64 ppm), and also following administration of copper by subcutaneous injection (215 ppm vs 330 ppm). The results of this work indicate that certain common stressors met with in everyday sheep management, may enhance copper toxicity. Copper should never be administered to sheep unless the requirement has been confirmed, and at the time of administration particular attention should be paid to avoiding those circumstances that might lead to starvation of the sheep...|$|R
