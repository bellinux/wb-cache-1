The efficacy of stretching for preventing and treating HS remains uncertain despite extensive research and wide-spread use. The effects of cervical spine mobilisation on peripheral nervous system function, neurodynamics and muscle force in the upper limb have been reported.

This study aimed to determine immediate effects of either a unilateral zygopophyseal joint posteroanterior mobilisation or a static posterior <b>chain</b> <b>muscle</b> stretch on the range of passive straight leg raise (SLR) in comparison to a non-treatment control. Using a single-blinded, randomised controlled study design, 36 healthy participants were allocated into one of three groups (control; mobilisation; static posterior <b>chain</b> <b>muscle</b> stretch). Measures of SLR were taken before and after intervention for each group on the day of testing. A General Linear Model (GLM) and a paired sample t-test showed a significant difference between base line and post-intervention for the mobilisation group only (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), and suggests that unilateral lumbar spine zygopophyseal joint mobilisation can immediately restore posterior chain neurodynamics...|$|E

In this study, we; 1) characterized {{the development of}} muscle hypertrophy with respect to fiber type, age, and sex; 2) determined the primary anabolic process responsible for development of hypertrophy; and 3) identified secondary effects of muscle hypertrophy on body composition. Transgene expression increased with age and was present only in fibers expressing type IIB fast myosin heavy <b>chain.</b> <b>Muscle</b> masses were greater by 5 wk of age, and by 10 wk of age the differences were maximal despite continued transgene expression.

The accelerated protein deposition ceased when the protein/DNA ratio attained the same value as in nontransgenic controls. Despite localization of IGF-I expression to muscle without changes in plasma IGF-I concentrations, genotype also modified the normal age and sex effects on fat deposition and organ growth. Thus, enhanced DNA accretion by IGF-I was primarily responsible for stimulating muscle growth. In turn, secondary effects on body composition wer...|$|E

Objective To determine whether the application of diaphragm stretching resulted in changes in posterior <b>chain</b> <b>muscle</b> kinematics and ribcage and abdominal excursion in healthy subjects. Method Eighty healthy adults were included in this randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized into two groups: the experimental group, which received a diaphragmatic stretching technique, or the placebo group, which received a sham-ultrasound procedure. The duration of the technique, the position of participants, and the therapist who applied the technique were the same for both treatments. Participant assessment (cervical range of movement, lumbar flexibility, flexibility of the posterior chain, and rib cage and abdominal excursion) was performed at baseline and immediately after the intervention by a blinded assessor. Results The mean between-group difference [95 % CI] for the ribcage excursion after technique at xiphoid level was 2. 48 [0. 97 to 3. 99], which shows significant differences in this outcome. The remaining between-group analysis showed significant differences in cervical extension, right and left flexion, flexibility of the posterior chain, and ribcage excursion at xiphoid level (p< 0. 05) {{in favor of the}} experimental group.

Discrete myofibrils with abundant interfibrillar sarcoplasm and organelles characterize the nuclear <b>chain</b> <b>muscle</b> fiber, while a continuous myofibril-like bundle with sparse interfibrillar sarcoplasm distinguishes the nuclear bag muscle fiber. Nuclear chain fibers possess well-defined and typical M bands {{in the center of each}} sarcomere, while nuclear bag fibers contain ill-defined M bands composed of two parallel thin densities in the center of the pseudo-H zone of each sarcomere. Mitochondria of nuclear chain fibers are larger and more numerous than they are in nuclear bag fibers. Mitochondria of chain fibers, in addition, often contain conspicuous dense granules, and they are frequently intimately related to elements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Striking differences are noted in the organization and degree of development of the sarcotubular system. Nuclear bag fibers contain a poorly developed SR and T system with only occasional functional couplings (dyads and triads). Nuclear chain fibers, in contrast, possess an unusually well-developed SR and T system and a variety of multiple junctional couplings (dyads, triads, quatrads, pentads, septads). Greatly dilated SR cisternae are common features of nuclear chain fibers, often forming intimate associations with T tubules, mitochondria, and the sarcolemma.

40|$|Intrauterine fetal growth {{restriction}} (IUGR) {{is often}} associated with compromised umbilical arterial flow, indicating increased placental vascular resistance. Oxidative stress is causatively implicated. Hydrogen sulfide maintains differentiated smooth muscle in vascular beds, and its synthetic enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) is down-regulated in growth-restricted placentas. We hypothesized that remodeling of resistance arteries in stem villi contributes to IUGR by compromising umbilical blood flow via oxidative stress, reducing hydrogen sulfide signaling. Stem villus arteries in human IUGR placentas displaying absent or reversed end-diastolic flow contained reduced myosin heavy <b>chain,</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> actin, and desmin, and increased markers of dedifferentiation, CRBP 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 2, compared to term and preterm controls. Wall thickness/lumen ratio was increased, lumen diameter decreased, but wall thickness remained unchanged in IUGR placentas. CSE correlated positively with myosin heavy <b>chain,</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> actin, and desmin. Birth weight correlated positively with CSE, myosin heavy <b>chain,</b> smooth <b>muscle</b> actin, and desmin, and negatively with CRBP and matrix metalloproteinase 2. These findings could be recapitulated in vitro by subjecting stem villus artery explants to hypoxia-reoxygenation, or inhibiting CSE. Treatment with a hydrogen sulfide donor, diallyl trisulfide, prevented these changes. IUGR is associated with vascular remodeling of the stem villus arteries. Oxidative stress results in reduction of placental CSE activity, decreased hydrogen sulfide production, and smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation in vitro. This vascular remodeling is reversible, and hydrogen sulfide donors are likely to improve pregnancy outcomes. Supported by the Wellcome Trust grant 084804 / 2 / 08 /Z (G. J. B.) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 791 spindle poles was {{analysed}} {{with regard to}} intrafusal fibre composition {{in the first and}} second superficial lumbrical muscles from the right and left hindfeet of 9 male and 5 female adult cats. Bag and <b>chain</b> <b>muscle</b> fibres were identified by their myofibrillar ATPase staining profile in the B region, after either acid or alkaline preincubation. A high proportion of the spindle pole population (43. 2 %) was observed to contain three or more (up to 5) bag fibres; those poles were classified as multiple-bag spindle poles. In the 334 muscle spindles in which both poles were studied, 42 bag fibres (12. 6 %) were found to be of the 'mixed' type, that is a fibre in which the two poles differ in their ATPase staining profile (either bag 1 /bag 2 or bag/chain). The variability of the intrafusal fibre content observed in spindles of these muscles has been studied in relation to individual characteristics such as sex, weight and side of the animal. In general, multiple-bag spindles are more frequent in male than in female cats and in right as compared to left side muscles. Nearly all 'mixed' bag intrafusal fibres (38 out of 42) were observed in spindles containing 3 or more bag fibres. In 3 -bag spindles the proportion of 'mixed' bag spindles is approximately the same in male and female cats. The ratio of 'dynamic' (mean polar bag 1 content) to 'static' (mean polar bag 2 plus chain fibre content) intrafusal effectors per muscle tends to increase in spindles of right side muscles and to decrease in the heaviest animals. The quantitative and qualitative differences in fibre content of spindles observed in first lumbrical muscles of different animals suggest that the spindle fibre composition, especially that of the 'dynamic' bag 1 fibre, may be related to individual predetermined and/or acquired factors...|$|E

Both groups also underwent manual therapy. Patients were evaluated before and after treatment and at a six-week follow-up appointment and tested for pain intensity (by means of visual analog scale), range of motion (by goniometry), and health-related quality of life (by the SF- 36 questionnaire). The treatment program consisted of two 1 -hour individual sessions per week for six weeks. Data were statistically analyzed at a significance level of p< 0. 05. RESULTS: Significant pain relief and range of motion improvement were observed after treatment in both groups, with a slight reduction at follow-up time.
