25|$|Despite police {{knowledge}} that Haarmann {{was both a}} known criminal and a known homosexual (then illegal and punishable by imprisonment in Germany), Haarmann gradually began to establish a relationship with Hanover police as an informer, largely {{as a means of}} redirecting the attention of the police from himself in his own criminal activities, and to facilitate his access to young males. By 1919, he is known to have regularly patrolled Hanover station, and to have provided police with information relating to Hanover's extensive <b>criminal</b> <b>network.</b> With the cooperation of several police officials, Haarmann devised a ruse whereby he would offer to fence or store stolen property at his premises, then pass this information to police, who would then raid his property at agreed times and arrest these contacts. To remove any suspicion as to his treachery reaching the criminal fraternity, Haarmann himself would be arrested in these raids. Moreover, on numerous occasions, he is known to have performed citizen's arrests upon commuters for offenses such as travelling on forged documents. As a result of these activities, police began to rely on Haarmann as a reliable source of information regarding various criminal activities in the city, and he was allowed to patrol Hanover station largely at will.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{entering}} Baldur's Gate, {{to assist}} them in earning some money, Randalla hires them to investigate a series of murders in the city. At Bloodmire Manor, they learn that Luvia Bloodmire has been combining the body parts of various creatures in an attempt to make a new species, and has been giving her creations to Lady Aragozia Firewind. Her first creation, Argesh, has set up the Hands of Glory, a thieves' guild faction of the Marauders. The heroes kill Argesh, crippling the Hands of Glory, and infiltrate the main base of the Marauders. There, they defeat but do not kill the Red Queen, leader of the Marauders. They follow her to Lady Arogazia's manor, and learn that Arogazia is actually a member of the Zhentarim, a <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> intent on ruling Faerûn. She has been using the Marauders in an effort to bring back the Onyx Tower. Along with her associate Kharne (a former member of Xantham's Guild, who was presumed killed in the first game), Arogazia escapes from the heroes, transforming into a Fire Dragon, Aizagora. Impressed with their efforts, Jherek, a member of the Harpers, approaches the heroes and requests they retrieve four elemental objects. At the same time, the Zhentarim are also trying to attain the objects in an effort to reactivate the Onyx Tower. During their journey, the heroes encounter Sleyvas, the humanoid lizard who betrayed the protagonists at the end of Dark Alliance. He too is working for the Zhentarim, although the heroes kill him. Having successfully found the four objects for Jherek, each of the heroes then pursues their own personal quest.|$|E

Bond becomes involved in the US through Mr Big's smuggling of 17th-century gold coins from British territories in the Caribbean.

40|$|Why is an African {{federation}} {{the home}} to one of the more dominating <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> operating globally? Nigeria is not well known for its high level of Internet-infrastructure. Still, it is in a class of its own when it comes to e-fraud or 419 spam mails. It is also prominent within the drug trade and the African-European trafficking network. By comparatively analysing other forms of Organized Crime against the Nigerian Brand, the thesis has tried to find the particulars of Nigerian <b>Criminal</b> <b>Networks.</b> The thesis found two particular indicators that stood out in the analysis: Social Networking and the 419 industry. Also, by looking at the level of integration between Nigerian politics and <b>Criminal</b> <b>Networks</b> and the argumentation used by agents within the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Networks</b> and the dynamics of the Nigerian E-fraud, this thesis argues that the same socio-cultural dynamics stemming from before the colonial period of the "great scramble" to present time, is the very same driving force behind Nigerian <b>Criminal</b> <b>Networks</b> today, forming an "Internet Economy of Affection". A general trend points in the direction that individuals growing up in the Nigerian federation seem to have a higher potential for social networking since their weak state gives them little protection in economic, welfare, security and educational spheres. They have to rely on the informal sector instead: the sphere of social networking. This may be one facet and first step toward the complex explanation how the dynamics of e-fraud, trafficking and drug-trade in Nigerian <b>Criminal</b> <b>Networks,</b> works at present...|$|R

Madlax {{is one of the most}} efficient special ops agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret Burton is a sleepy, clumsy amnesiac living in Nafrece, a country styled after France. When a [...] "picture book", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> Enfant, she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time. Meanwhile, Vanessa Rene, Margaret's former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war, discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is hired as her bodyguard, and together, they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective maid Elenore Baker and Carrossea Doon.|$|E

40|$|This {{official}} {{statement of the}} U.

From narcotics trafficking to money laundering to human smuggling and cybercrime, increasingly sophisticated criminal organizations transcend national frontiers effortlessly, destabilize business and state infrastructures, and leave countless victims in their wake. If nation–states are {{to keep pace with}} <b>criminal</b> <b>networks,</b> they must transcend their own frontiers. The more individual nations—particularly smaller countries in the immediate path of these criminal networks—are boxed in by fixed notions of sovereignty, the more they stand to lose. Sophisticated criminals do not hesitate to cross boundaries, build transborder alliances, or nimbly change their patterns in response to law enforcement efforts. If nations cannot keep up, the <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> will (and do) run circles around them...|$|R
2500|$|El Narco: Inside Mexico's Criminal Insurgency is a non-fiction {{book of the}} Mexican Drug War {{written by}} Ioan Grillo.

The book covers the frontline of the Mexican Drug War. It seeks to trace the origins of the illegal drug trade in Mexico, the recent escalation of violence, the human cost of the drug trade and organized crime in the country. The book takes a critical stance on the unsuccessful efforts made by the Mexican government and the United States to confront the violence and its causes.|$|E

According to Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, the new name of the group could be understood as referring both to Hussein Tawfiq al-Assad himself as well as Imam Husayn ibn Ali. The Lions of Hussein consequently fought for the government in various war zones, participating in the Palmyra offensive (July–August 2015) against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the Al-Ghab offensive (July–August 2015), the offensive to recapture Marj al-Sultan airbase in late 2015, and the 2015–16 Latakia offensive.

2500|$|In the 1990s, {{the drug}} cartels in Mexico did not {{cut off the}} heads of the victims. Instead, they used {{different}} [...] "codes of murder" [...] established between the mafias. A bullet through the back of the head, for example, signified that the victim was a traitor; a bullet through the temple, however, signified that the victim was member of a rival drug gang. Now, decapitation is a tactic often used by the criminal organizations in Mexico—primarily by Los Zetas and its two main rivals, the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. The first public decapitation was carried out by La Familia Michoacana in September 2006, when several gunmen opened the doors of a bar in the Mexican state of Michoacán and threw five severed heads on the dance floor. The practices of beheading victims in Mexico is believed to have come from Guatemala in the year 2000, when Los Zetas extended their <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> into Central America and eventually incorporated with the elite jungle military squad known as the Kaibiles. The Kaibiles had been trained to intimidate the local population with beheadings during the Guatemalan Civil War (1960–1996). Others see the link with the religious cult of the Santa Muerte ("Holy Death"). Wherever it stems from, decapitations is [...] "now a staple in the lexicon of violence" [...] in the Mexican Drug War.|$|E
