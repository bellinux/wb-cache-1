40|$|Background: Caspases {{belong to}} a class of {{cysteine}} proteases which function as critical effectors in apoptosis and inflammation by cleaving substrates immediately after unique sites. Prediction of such <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> will complement structural and functional studies on substrates cleavage as well as discovery of new substrates. Recently, different computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> of caspase substrates with varying degrees of success. As the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm {{has been shown to be}} useful in several biological classification problems, we have implemented an SVM-based method to investigate its applicability to this domain. Results: A set of unique caspase substrates <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> were obtained from literature and used for evaluating the SVM method. Datasets containing (i) the tetrapeptide <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites,</b> (ii) the tetrapeptide <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites,</b> augmented by two adjacent residues, P₁' and P₂' amino acids and (iii) the tetrapeptide <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> with ten additional upstream and downstream flanking sequences (where available) were tested. The SVM method achieved an accuracy ranging from 81. 25 % to 97. 92 % on independent test sets. The SVM method successfully predicted the cleavage of a novel caspase substrate and its mutants. Conclusion: This study presents an SVM approach for predicting caspase substrate <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> based on the <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> and the downstream and upstream flanking sequences. The method shows an improvement over existing methods and may be useful for predicting hitherto undiscovered <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites.</b> 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractArabis mosaic {{virus is}} a {{subgroup}} A nepovirus. The RNA 1 -encoded polyprotein (P 1) contains the domains for the NTP-binding protein (NTB), VPg, proteinase (Pro) and polymerase at its C-terminus. Putative <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> delineating these domains have been proposed. However, {{the number and}} location of <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> upstream of the NTB domain are not known. Using in vitro processing assays, we have confirmed proteolytic cleavage at the NTB-VPg and VPg-Pro sites. In addition, we have identified two <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> in the N-terminal region of P 1. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation experiments using inserted peptide tags confirmed that the position of these <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> corresponds to that of <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> delineating the X 1 and X 2 domains in Tomato ringspot virus (subgroup C nepovirus).

25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that {{presence}} of a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CA/SP1 <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> have resulted in resistance to bevirimat. However, mutations at these sites were not found in phase I and II clinical trials. Instead, mutations in the glutamine-valine-threonine (QVT) motif of the SP1 peptide are also known to cause bevirimat resistance. In addition, V362I mutations have been shown to confer strong resistance to bevirimat, where the S373P and I376V mutations may confer low resistance to bevirimat. A further complication of the use of bevirimat is that, since bevirimat targets the CA/SP1 <b>cleavage</b> <b>site,</b> it could also be used in the treatment of protease inhibitor resistant patients. Except for A364V, mutations in the CA/SP1 <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> have showed to result in fitness deficits when combined with protease inhibitor resistance. This proposes that these mutations may develop slowly. It has been shown that protease inhibitor resistance can result in an increase in the occurrence of mutations within the downstream QVT motif.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} if limited proteolysis of / 3 -crystallins {{is associated with}} insolubilization of proteins in rat lens during maturation and to test if the protease, calpain II, is involved. Methods. Soluble and insoluble lens proteins from 4 -day-old to 4 -month-old rat lens cortexes and nuclei were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The insoluble proteins from 4 -month-old nuclei were electroblotted and the NH 2 termini of proteins sequenced. <b>Cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> appearing at 4 months of age were compared to <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> produced by purified calpain II and to <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> appearing in cataracts induced by selenite in vivo or in lenses cultured with calcium ionophore A 23187 or diamide. Results. Insolubilization of more than 50 % of proteins occurred in {{the nucleus of the}} transparent rat lens by 4 months of age. The insoluble protein that formed contained an abundance of partially degraded /?-crystallin polypeptides missing portions of their NH 2 terminal extensions. In contrast, these truncated / 3 -crystallins were largely absent from both the cortex and soluble fraction of the nucleus.

25|$|Owing to the {{increasing}} complexity of regulation of cellular processes and the roles proteases play in them, bioinformatics {{continues to be an}} invaluable tool for degradomics. Software, databases, and projects developed for this purpose have accompanied the advancement in technology. Software developed in the Overall Lab (CLIPPER) statistically evaluates <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> candidates determined by degradomic approaches. One web-based data site, WebPICS, incorporates and integrates <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> analysis from PICS experiments into MEROPS, the protease database. Another database, Termini oriented protein Function Inferred Database (TopFIND), serves as a knowledge base to integrate protein termini formed by protease processing with functional interpretations. By combining research literature and other biological databases including UniProt, MEROPS, Ensembl, and TisDB, the database comprehensively renders protein termini modifications accessible to a broad scientific community. Using TopFIND, terminal modifications can be identified and visualized across proteins thanks to all available in silico, in vitro, and in vivo findings. Using TopFINDer and Path FINDer software, research findings can be mathematically modelled into a network of pathways regulated by proteases, further contributing to the “protease web”.|$|E

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{essential}} post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins, proteolysis, especially calpain-mediated cleavage, {{plays an important role in}} many biological processes, including cell death/apoptosis, cytoskeletal remodeling, and the cell cycle.

As a model we used the serine protease of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). We engineered the gene coding for this enzyme and two specific <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> in the Sindbis virus structural gene and constructed libraries of viral genomes with a random sequence at either of the <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites.</b> The system was designed so that only viral genomes coding for sequences cleaved by the protease would produce viable viruses.

25|$|The Extended Signal Peptide Region (ESPR) {{is found}} in the N-terminus of the signal {{peptides}} of proteins belonging to the Type V secretion systems.

25|$|Each {{isometric}} monomer is structurally {{organized into}} 8 distinct domains consists of; a leucine-rich repeat domain (L1, residues 1-157), a cysteine-rich region (CR, residues 158-310), an additional leucine rich repeat domain (L2, residues 311-470), three fibronectin type III domains; FnIII-1 (residues 471-595), FnIII-2 (residues 596-808) and FnIII-3 (residues 809-906). Additionally, an insert domain (ID, residues 638-756) resides within FnIII-2, containing the α/β furin <b>cleavage</b> <b>site,</b> from which proteolysis results in both IDα and IDβ domains.

40|$|In this study, we further {{examined}} the sequence selectivity of camptothecin in mammalian topoisomerase I cDNA from human and Chinese hamster. In {{the absence of}} camptothecin, almost all the bases at the 3 '-terminus of <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> are T for calf thymus and wheat germ topoisomerase I. In addition, wheat germ topoisomerase I exhibits preference for C (or not T) at - 3 and for T at - 2 position. As for camptothecin-stimulated cleavage with topoisomerase I, G (or not T) at + 1 is an additional strong preference. This sequence selectivity of camptothecin {{is similar to that}} previously found in SV 40 DNA, suggesting that camptothecin preferentially interacts with topoisomerase I-mediated <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> where G is the base at the 5 '-terminus. These results support the stacking model of camptothecin (Jaxel et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20418 - 20423). Comparison of calf thymus and wheat germ topoisomerase I-mediated <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> in the presence of camptothecin shows that many major <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> are similar. However, the relative intensities are often different. One of the differences was attributable to a bias at position - 3 where calf thymus topoisomerase I prefers G and wheat germ topoisomerase I prefers C. This difference may explain the unique patterns of <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> induced by the two enzymes. Sequencing analysis of camptothecin-stimulated <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> in the surrounding regions of point mutations in topoisomerase I cDNA, which were found in camptothecin-resistant cell lines, reveals no direct relationship between DNA <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> in vitro and mutation sites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNative or {{denatured}} protein substrates which are hardly digested by thrombin can {{become much more}} efficiently cleaved by the enzyme after chemical modification of their carboxyl groups. Five antibody κ-chains were used to demonstrate this effect. The selective <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> were determined by quantitative N-terminal analysis and N-terminal sequencing. All five κ-chains share the same <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> at Arg-Thr (residues 108 – 109), Arg-Glu (residues 142 – 143, Glu side chain modified with glycine amide), Lys-Ser (residues 207 – 208) and Arg-Gly (residues 211 – 212). One of the major <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> (Arg-Thr) {{is located at the}} joint of the variable/constant region. The amino acids adjacent to these <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> underline the proposed structural requirements for a potential thrombin substrate [(1985) Eur. J. Biochem. 151, 217 – 224].

After digestion, primary amines and sulfhydryl are chemically blocked before digesting the sample {{again with the}} desired protease. Now, protease generated primary amines that constitute the prime site of cleavage can be biotinylated and isolated due to their reactivity and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Non-prime sides sequences left behind must be determined using bioinformatics analysis of the extracted N-termini and full length protein sequences. These prime and non-prime sites give a full picture of protease <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> specificity.|$|E
25|$|The {{human form}} of OSM was {{originally}} isolated in 1986 from the growth media of PMA treated U-937 histiocytic lymphoma cells by {{its ability to}} inhibit the growth of cell lines established from melanomas and other solid tumours. A robust protein, OSM is stable between pH2 and 11 and resistant to heating for one hour at 56°C. A partial amino acid sequence allowed the isolation of human OSM cDNA and subsequently genomic clones. The full cDNA clone of hOSM encodes a 252 amino acid precursor, the first 25 amino acids of which functions as a secretory signal peptide, which on removal yields the soluble 227 amino acid pro-OSM. Cleavage of the C-terminal most 31 residues at a trypsin like <b>cleavage</b> <b>site</b> yields the fully active 196 residue form.

25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, bevirimat {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature virus particle. Bevirimat prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, bevirimat enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 <b>cleavage</b> <b>site.</b> This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E

In this study, we focused on the sequences and structural determinants of Drosha and Dicer <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites,</b> which may explain the generation of homogeneous miRNAs (in which a single isomiR strongly predominates) as well as the generation of heterogeneous miRNAs. Using deep-sequencing data for small RNAs, we demonstrate that the generation of homogeneous miRNAs requires more sequence constraints at the <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> than the formation of heterogeneous miRNAs. Additionally, our results indicate that specific Drosha <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> have more sequence determinants in miRNA precursors than specific <b>cleavage</b> <b>sites</b> for Dicer and that secondary structural motifs in the miRNA precursors influence the precision of Dicer cleavage.
