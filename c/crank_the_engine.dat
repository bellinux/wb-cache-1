His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> while a pilot sat at the controls.

60|$|After some minutes {{spent in}} wiping greasy pieces of steel which the chauffeur extracted, and {{subsequent}} ceaseless grinding on the <b>crank,</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> started again, {{not without a}} series of protesting cracks like pistol shots. The chauffeur and Brent leaped in, the bystanders parted with derisive cheers, and away {{they went through the}} village, only to announce by another series of explosions a second disaster {{at the other end of}} the street. A crowd collected there, too.|$|E
5000|$|The 2.3 litre M20B23 {{used the}} same head (known as [...] "731") and block as the {{carbureted}} 2.0 litre but used a longer 76.8 mm stroke <b>crank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was first used in E21 323i {{and was replaced by}} the M20B25 in 1985.|$|E
60|$|Wampus {{had to get}} out and <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> {{which he}} calmly {{proceeded}} to do. The man who had called himself Algernon Tobey perceived his intention and urged his pony {{to the front of the}} car.|$|R
50|$|The term also {{referred}} to a (now obsolete) automobile engine component that lowered the supply voltage to the ignition system after <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> had been started. Because <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> causes a very heavy load on the battery, the system voltage can drop quite low during <b>cranking.</b> To allow <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to start, <b>the</b> ignition system was designed to operate on this lower voltage. But once <b>cranking</b> is finished, <b>the</b> normal operating voltage would overload the ignition system. To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the ignition system.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> {{is started}} by {{reducing}} the compression and setting the spray bar mixture rich with the adjustable needle valve, gradually increasing <b>the</b> compression while <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> compression is increased until <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> starts running. <b>The</b> mixture can then be leaned out and the compression increased. Compared to glow plug engines, model diesel engines exhibit much higher fuel economy, thus increasing endurance {{for the amount of}} fuel carried. They also exhibit higher torque, enabling the turning of a larger or higher pitched propeller at lower speed. Since the combustion occurs well before the exhaust port is uncovered, these engines are also considerably quieter (when unmuffled) than glow-plug engines of similar displacement.|$|R
50|$|An early {{version of}} a car alarm {{for use as a}} theft {{deterrent}} was invented by an unknown prisoner from Denver in 1913. This version was manually armed, and triggered when someone tried to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> A later alarm inspired by an {{early version of}} a remote starter was published in 1916. This version had the car owner carry a receiver, which would buzz if the car ignition system was tampered with.|$|E
50|$|A {{storage area}} {{was in the}} nose, where equipment, {{including}} anchors, could be kept. Behind it, the open cockpit had two side-by-side seats, with optional dual controls. In the cabin, there were two more seats and a storage area, which could also be fitted with bunks for sleeping. Between the cockpit and cabin were nacelles which accommodated the retracted undercarriage wheels, a first for Dornier, which were lowered or raised manually by a <b>crank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> sat on a stand high above the wing, alongside two fuel tanks, in pusher configuration.|$|E
50|$|A jump start, {{also called}} a boost, {{is a method}} of {{starting}} a vehicle with a discharged starting battery. A temporary connection is made to the battery of another vehicle, or to some other external power source. The external supply of electricity recharges the disabled vehicle's battery and {{provides some of the}} power needed to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Once the vehicle has been started, its normal charging system will recharge, so the auxiliary source can be removed. If the vehicle charging system is functional, normal operation of the vehicle will restore the charge of the battery.|$|E
5000|$|A deep-cycle {{battery is}} a {{lead-acid}} battery {{designed to be}} regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity. In contrast, starter batteries (e.g. most automotive batteries) are designed to deliver short, high-current bursts for <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> thus frequently discharging {{only a small part}} of their capacity. While a deep-cycle battery can be used as a starting battery, the lower [...] "cranking current" [...] implies that an oversized battery may be required.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{starting}} a Model T with <b>the</b> hand <b>crank,</b> <b>the</b> spark {{had to be}} manually retarded or <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> might [...] "kick back". <b>The</b> <b>crank</b> handle was cupped in the palm, with the thumb tucked under the handle (not clasped over top of it), so that if <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> did kick back, the rapid reverse motion of <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> would throw <b>the</b> hand away from the handle, rather than violently twisting the wrist or breaking the thumb. Most Model T Fords had the choke operated by a wire emerging {{from the bottom of}} the radiator where it could be operated with the left hand. This was used to prime <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> while <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> slowly; then <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was started with a rapid pull of <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> handle. In good tune, an already-primed T engine only has to be cranked half a turn for it to successfully start.|$|R
50|$|Known as the Zhiguli {{within the}} Soviet Union, the main {{differences}} between the VAZ-2103 and the Fiat 124 Special are the use of thicker-gauge steel for the bodyshell (so the 2103 weighed 1030 kg, the Fiat 105 kg less), an overhead camshaft engine (in place of the original Fiat OHV unit), {{and the use of}} aluminium drum brakes on the rear wheels in place of disc brakes. The car featured a starting handle for <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> manually should <b>the</b> battery go flat in Siberian winter conditions and an auxiliary fuel pump. It also included a clock and improved soundproofing.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 August 2011 Lotus {{developed}} an all new in-house designed V8 {{destined for the}} new era range of cars. At 170 kg and just 612 mm long, the unit is dry sump lubricated to save depth and will feature an 180Â° flat plane <b>crank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is being utilised as a stressed component, a technique pioneered by Colin Chapman in F1, specifically with the 1967 Type 49.

50|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{invention}} lay in the realization that a relatively small motor, driven with higher voltage and current than would be feasible for continuous operation, could deliver enough power to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for starting. At the voltage and current levels required, such a motor would burn out {{in a few minutes}} of continuous operation, but not during the few seconds needed to start the engine. The starters were first installed by Cadillac on production models in 1912, with the same system being adopted by Lanchester later that year. These starters also worked as generators once the engine was running, a concept that is now being revived in hybrid vehicles.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, other {{mechanical}} injection {{systems such as}} Hilborn were occasionally used on modified American V8 engines in various racing applications such as drag racing, oval racing, and road racing. These racing-derived systems were not suitable for everyday street use, having no provisions for low speed metering, or often none even for starting (starting required that fuel be squirted into the injector tubes while <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine).</b> However, they were a favorite in the aforementioned competition trials in which essentially wide-open throttle operation was prevalent. Constant-flow injection systems continue to be used {{at the highest levels}} of drag racing, where full-throttle, high-RPM performance is key.|$|R
50|$|The {{sprag clutch}} {{arrangement}} would preclude {{the use of}} the starter as a generator if employed in hybrid scheme mentioned above, unless modifications were made. The standard starter motor is typically designed for intermittent use, which would preclude its use as a generator. The starter's electrical components are designed only to operate for typically under 30 seconds before overheating (by too-slow dissipation of heat from ohmic losses), to save weight and cost. Most automobile owner's manuals instruct the operator to pause for at least ten seconds after each ten or fifteen seconds of <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> when trying to start an engine that does not start immediately.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Chrysler {{introduced}} a starter incorporating a geartrain between the motor and the drive shaft. The motor shaft included integrally cut gear teeth forming a pinion that meshes {{with a larger}} adjacent driven gear to provide a gear reduction ratio of 3.75:1. This permitted {{the use of a}} higher-speed, lower-current, lighter and more compact motor assembly while increasing cranking torque. Variants of this starter design were used on most rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation from 1962 through 1987. It makes a unique, distinct sound when <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> which led to it being nicknamed the [...] "Highland Park Hummingbird"âa reference to Chrysler's headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the common}} early {{problems}} was with the clutch basket which was eventually replaced under warranty. The intermediate gear was strengthened and concentricity improved. However, the problem then moved to the next weakest part, the alternator drive shaft/Z25 gear, which, in extreme cases could break at a lubrication hole. It commonly manifested itself in the 1130 variant of the engine, as a difficulty to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> when hot. The root cause of the clutch / alternator drive problem was thermal expansion, which reduced the Z25 / intermediate gear clearances to negative. The solution was to improve the concentricity of both the clutch intermediate and alternator drive shaft gears, and increase their clearance. At the same time, the alternator drive hub fastening method was changed from a lock washer to a belleville washer to stop the bolt from working loose due to heat cycling.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} {{remedy for}} a flooded carbureted engine is to steadily hold the throttle full open (full power position) {{while continuing to}} <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This permits the maximum flow of air through the engine, flushing the overly rich fuel mixture out of the exhaust. If the exhaust system is hot enough to autoignite, an after-fire may result; {{this can be seen}} as a flame discharging through the exhaust system. On a fuel-injected engine, ignoring the throttle (no fuel) while starting permits electronic logic systems to produce the correct fuel mixture, often based on exhaust gases. Some fuel injection computers interpret 'pumping' the throttle to indicate a flooded engine, and alter the fuel-air mixture accordingly. In a carbureted engine equipped with an accelerator pump (which advances fuel flow to match air ingestion under rapid throttle acceleration), 'pumping' the throttle will force excess fuel into the engine, further flooding it.|$|E
5000|$|The FZ {{came as a}} 4-stroke, four-cylinder, four-carburetor, {{naturally}} aspirated, {{air-cooled engine}} package mated with a six-gear constant mesh transmission, dropped into a rectangular tube frame that seemed pieced together from a modern standpoint, balanced upon a large rear mono shock hidden between the swingarm and subframe under the battery complementary to two smooth front forks. It has two large circular headlights iconic of Yamaha FZR's large and small displacement. The fuel tank has a triangular side profile that matches the frame well, with a flat top and a fuel petcock at the bottom left with an overflow hose fitting {{at the bottom of}} the front. The four Mikuni BS-30 carburetors utilize the [...] "Round-Slide" [...] design with the diaphragm assembly actuating the main needle jets, with plastic floats and brass slides. It uses two ignition coils (two cylinders each) controlled by a CDI (Capacitor Discharge Ignition) printed circuit board unit, and timed by a two brush [...] "Pick-Up Coil" [...] mounted to the <b>crank.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> oil doubles as the transmission's lubricant, wetting the manual clutch. The FZ-600 was air-cooled however, with a radiator-looking oil cooler mounted on the front of the frame between the engine and front wheel. It also had a thundering four-into-one exhaust. It has a 4-fuse, fuse block providing for the headlights, turn signals, rectifier/regulator, etc.|$|E
50|$|The {{first car}} {{to use an}} {{alternator}} was an unusual system fitted to early Model T Fords. This entirely AC system was first used solely to power the trembler coil ignition system when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was running. When starting, a battery was used instead - <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was entirely manual. This system was sometimes used to also provide electric lighting. Being an AC system, there was no battery in this circuit. The starting battery {{was removed from the}} car for charging, a rare event as it was only needed when starting. The generator was usually described as a magneto, although this was not an ignition magneto (even though it was used to power the ignition) as it did not provide sparks itself.|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} to jumper cables is a cable used to interconnect the 12 volt power outlets (cigarette lighter outlets) of two vehicles.

This method works by slowly recharging the battery, not by providing the current needed for <b>cranking.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>cranking</b> motor current draw will exceed the fuse rating in a cigarette lighter outlet. Many vehicles turn off the cigarette lighter outlets when the key is turned off, making the technique unusable unless the ignition key is turned to the accessory or on position to connect the cigarette lighter outlet to the battery.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{automobile}} sector requires continuous {{progress in}} the development of âStarter Motor â by innovative approaches, although significant progresses were made in the past. Development of Starter Motor has made it possible to start the engine by electrical means instead of doing it manually. The outstanding features of this motor are they can produce the maximum starting torque to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> In this case, we use electrical energy and convert it to mechanical energy in order to start the engine in motor vehicles. As the starter motor is mounted near the engine; vibrational disturbances produced due to either uneven road conditions or engine vibrations or both hampering the performance of starter motor which may result in breaking of component of motors. Vehicle will experience vibrations whose values are un-predictable at certain point of time, causing random excitation and random vibrations. Aim of the paper is to perform analytical formulation for the Power Spectral Density function of Starter Motor by treating it as a cantilever beam and to find its response to random vibrations by using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) ...|$|E

50|$|The hand-crank {{method was}} {{commonly}} used to start engines, but it was inconvenient, difficult, and dangerous. The behavior of an engine during starting is not always predictable. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> can kick back, causing sudden reverse rotation. Many manual starters included a one-directional slip or release provision so that once <b>engine</b> rotation began, <b>the</b> starter would disengage from <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> In <b>the</b> event of a kickback, the reverse rotation of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could suddenly engage the starter, causing <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> to unexpectedly and violently jerk, possibly injuring the operator. For cord-wound starters, a kickback could pull the operator towards <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> or machine, or swing the starter cord and handle at high speed around the starter pulley. Even though cranks had an overrun mechanism, when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> started, <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> could begin to spin along with the crankshaft and potentially strike <b>the</b> person <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> Additionally, care {{had to be taken}} to retard the spark in order to prevent backfiring; with an advanced spark setting, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could kick back (run in reverse), pulling <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> with it, because the overrun safety mechanism works in one direction only.|$|R
50|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person <b>cranking</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could be forced backward while still holding <b>the</b> <b>crank</b> as <b>the</b> car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.

40|$|Engine {{stop-start}} {{control is}} considered {{as the key}} technology for micro/mild hybridisation of vehicles and machines. To utilize this concept, especially for construction machines, the engine is desired to be started {{in such a way}} that the operator discomfort can be minimized. To address this issue, this paper aims to develop a simple powertrain modelling approach for engine stop-start dynamic analysis and an advanced engine start control scheme newly applicable for micro/mild hybrid construction machines. First, a powertrain model of a generic construction machine is mathematically developed in a general form which allows to investigate the transient responses of the system during the engine cranking process. Second, a simple parameterisation procedure with a minimum set of data required to characterise the dynamic model is presented. Third, a model- based adaptive controller is designed for the starter to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> quickly and smoothly without the need of fuel injection while the critical problems of machine noise, vibration and harshness can be eliminated. Finally, the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed modelling and control approaches have been validated through numerical simulations. The results imply that with the limited data set for training, the developed model works better than a high fidelity model built in AMESim while the adaptive controller can guarantee the desired cranking performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the use of ethanol as a future fuel for spark ignition engines. The finite availability of oil coupled with concerns about global warming and CO 2 emissions has led to an increase in the use of ethanol which is produced from biomass. Generally ethanol is blended with gasoline to make an automotive fuel with the most common blend being E 85 (85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline by volume), which is used in Sweden and in the USA. Unlike gasoline, ethanol is a single component fuel which has a low volatility especially at low temperatures which means that cold-starting a spark ignition engine with ethanol-gasoline fuel blends is more difficult. In Europe cold-starting emission testing must be completed at ambient temperature and - 7 Â°C. During cold-starting tests with ethanol-gasoline blends high fuelling levels are required to form a combustible mixture and start the engine which results in high hydrocarbon emissions. This study investigates the start performance of a range of ethanol-gasoline blends in a port fuel injected spark ignition engine. Tests are completed at both ambient temperature at -rc and the start performance is characterised by the fuelling levels required to start the engine, the emissions of hydrocarbons and the fuel unaccounted for during the test. The optimum first start fuelling level is highly dependent on the proportion of ethanol in the fuel. The lower volatility of the ethanol fuel blends meant that it is harder to form a combustible mixture without injecting high levels of fuel. The high fuel injection rates result in high levels of liquid fuel being inducted into the cylinder which causes high HC emissions and fuel unaccounted for during the start. Under ambient temperature starts E 10 and E 25 offer start performance benefits over gasoline, whilst E 50 and in some aspects E 75 are comparable to gasoline. E 85 fuel results in considerably higher emissions of HCs and fuel unaccounted for than gasoline during ambient temperature starts. At -rc the start performance with ethanol suffers compared to gasoline. When using E 10 and E 25 the start performance is comparable to gasoline, but with E 50 and the higher proportion ethanol fuel blends the start performance becomes far poorer. With E 85 the mass of fuel emitted from the engine as un-burnt HCs during a -rc start is seven times the quantity with gasoline. Hardware modifications were made to the engine {{in order to try to}} improve the start performance of -rc E 85 starts. Of the modifications tested heating the fuel within the fuel rail produced the biggest start improvement followed by heating the intake air. An extended cranking period prior to the start of the test only produced a small improvement in start performance and is not worthwhile compared to the energy needed to <b>crank</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> With both fuel rail and intake air heating the start fuelling level can be 40. 5 % below the baseline E 85 level and peak HC emissions are reduced by 30. 5 %. The low volatility of E 85 meant that even when incorporating the hardware modifications, the start performance of the engine is still not comparable to the standard engine running on gasoline due to high emissions of HCs. When cold-starting, especially at low temperatures, the use of high proportion ethanol-gasoline fuel blends is not suitable if low emissions of HCs are a priority. Longer duration tests were also completed with different ethanol-gasoline fuel blends in order to investigate their influence on engine warm-up characteristics. Larger proportions of ethanol within the fuel resulted in higher engine work output and lower heat rejection to the coolant and oil. With E 100 it takes 7. 2 % longer for the thermostat to open compared to gasoline. The warm-up tests also showed that the exhaust gas temperature is lower with ethanol in the fuel, which will result in a longer period before the catalyst lights-off. A higher proportion of ethanol in the fuel results in lower NOx emissions due to reduced peak temperatures within the engine. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Nachumi had managed to down two MiG-17s using AIM-9 Sidewinders and hit two more with his cannon, when one of his engines suffered a compressor stall. He relit it and continued chasing the MiGs, eventually shooting down two more, both with the AIM-9D.
