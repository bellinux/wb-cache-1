5|$|Modern hare {{coursing}} is practiced using {{a number of}} sighthounds: mainly greyhounds but also Borzois, Salukis, Whippets, and Deerhounds that are registered with a governing body such as the National Coursing <b>Club</b> <b>or</b> Kennel Club in Great Britain, the Irish Coursing <b>Club,</b> <b>or</b> the National Open Field Coursing Association (NOFCA) in the US. Events are conducted through local coursing clubs which are regulated by their governing body. The objective of legal formal coursing is to test and judge the athletic ability of the dogs rather than to kill the hare.|$|E
5|$|One-day {{track and}} field {{meetings}} form {{the most common and}} seasonal aspect of the sport – they are the most basic level of {{track and field}} competition. Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage of an educational institution or sports <b>club,</b> <b>or</b> by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their <b>club</b> <b>or</b> institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

5|$|Chan Yong Kim, 9th dan, was {{the first}} tang soo do {{instructor}} in Australia. He arrived in the early 1960s, sponsored by the Silvertop Taxi Karate <b>Club</b> <b>or</b> the Judo Federation of Australia, and stayed {{for one or two}} years before moving overseas. Kim might be considered the first taekwondo instructor in Australia if tang soo do were recognised as taekwondo retrospectively, and so might lay claim to the title. Kim did not establish a taekwondo school in Australia.|$|E

The Noncommissioned Officers <b>Club,</b> <b>or</b> Club 42 {{as it was}} known, allowed in all military members and civilians up the GS-7. Many varieties of food were also offered there, {{and it could be}} used for live entertainment, in addition to the booking of parties. As the Visiting Officers Quarters and the Unaccompanied Officers Quarters were nearby, the club was also a convenient stopover for transient officers as well.|$|E

5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his <b>club,</b> <b>or</b> any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the torrent duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed <b>club</b> <b>or</b> flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
5|$|As {{an amateur}} rugby union player John was not paid to play rugby at <b>club</b> <b>or</b> {{international}} level. To receive money for playing {{would have been}} recognised {{as an act of}} professionalism and would have resulted in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given 'boot money' by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players' boots. In his 2011 book Addy, Meirion Appleton claimed that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. Appleton claims that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from sportswear manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged with taking illegal payments during his career.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, when The Beatles had to {{pose for}} the {{photograph}} for the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band cover, Lennon asked Mona if he could borrow the war medals {{her father had been}} given in India to wear for the photo session. Although still upset at the way her son was dismissed from The Beatles, Mona agreed, and the medals were then returned, along with a Cash Box trophy that is in the letter 'L' of THE BEATLES flower-sign on the cover. Mona never opened another <b>club,</b> <b>or</b> engaged in another business venture, although she did have paying guests at her house, which she shared with her bed-ridden mother and her sons after she and Best parted. Mona {{died of a heart attack}} on 9 October 1988, after a long illness.|$|E

Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food better at Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton <b>Club</b> <b>or</b> Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Cadet Movement is {{sponsored}} by the CF/DND and the civilian Air Cadet League, along with the Navy League and Army Cadet League. Each cadet unit is supported by a local Squadron Sponsoring Committee responsible to the National League through each of the Provincial Committees. The basic Air Cadet program is provided at no cost, including uniforms and activities. Most Air Cadet squadrons are sponsored by a local service organization or club such as a Royal Canadian Legion Branch, Royal Canadian Air Force Association Wing, Rotary Club, Lions <b>Club,</b> <b>or</b> a locally established committee. The local civilian sponsors must raise money to provide for accommodation, utilities, liability insurance, local awards, and additional training resources or special activities, such as mess dinners, band instruments or squadron excursions and trips, not funded by the CF/DND. Cadets and their parents are encouraged to participate in fund-raising activities.|$|E
