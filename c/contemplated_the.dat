5|$|From France, Bogdan-Pitești had <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> idea of revolutionizing Romanian art, and, {{upon his}} arrival to Bucharest, began {{organizing}} artists' reunions at the Kübler and Fialkowski coffeehouses. In 1896, with Post-Impressionist artists Constantin Artachino, Ștefan Luchian and Nicolae Vermont, he founded Salonul Independenților, the Romanian {{replica of the}} French Société des Artistes Indépendants. They were soon joined by painter Nicolae Grant and caricaturist Nicolae Petrescu-Găină.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a rumoured sequel for the PlayStation 2 was reported. The rumours later proved false however. While Sony <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> {{notion of}} a G-Police game for the PlayStation 2 (who had bought Psygnosis, {{renaming}} it Studio Liverpool), they decided that, because G-Police was not as successful as other games, Studio Liverpool would instead concentrate on the Formula 1 and Wipeout franchises. Furthermore, the development team responsible for G-Police and Weapons of Justice had {{moved on to other}} ventures. In 2007, G-Police was made available for download on PlayStation 3. Computer and Video Games noted that the graphics looked poor by current standards but deemed it still enjoyable to play.|$|E

5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen {{who had heard}} the news were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of the}} march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea was}} taken up again {{in the search for}} solar neutrinos. Theoretically, the Sun {{produced}} neutrinos in the course of nuclear fusion reactions. Pontecorvo credited Maurice Pryce for this idea. The most common, the proton–proton chain reaction in which hydrogen is fused to form helium produces neutrinos that are not energetic enough to interact with chlorine. However, the much less common CNO cycle that produces carbon, nitrogen and oxygen does. In the late 1960s, Ray Davis and John N. Bahcall detected solar neutrinos in the Homestake Experiment, for which Davis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002. The experiment was the first to successfully detect and count solar neutrinos, but the number of neutrinos detected was between one third and one half of the predicted number. This became the solar neutrino problem. For a time scientists <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> awful possibility that the Sun might have burned out.|$|E

25|$|U.S. leaders <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> {{first use}} of nuclear weapons, {{including}} those based in Japan following the intervention by the Peoples Republic of China during the Korean War.

25|$|Although {{nalbuphine}} possesses {{opioid antagonist}} activity, {{there is evidence}} that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an opioid analgesic administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection. Therefore, patients receiving an opioid analgesic, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, or other tranquilizers, sedatives, hypnotics, or other CNS depressants (including alcohol) concomitantly with Nalbuphine may exhibit an additive effect. When such combined therapy is <b>contemplated,</b> <b>the</b> dose of one or both agents should be reduced.|$|E

25|$|The {{events that}} {{followed}} are less clear. Later that day, {{the decision to}} bring troops of the Transcaucasian Military District, then commanded by Col. Gen. Ivan Fedyuninsky, into the matter was made in Moscow. The predominantly Georgian units stationed in the area were not deployed because of suspected unreliability, however. The Soviet Interior Ministry officials reported that Tbilisi {{had gone out of}} control. They claimed that the demonstrators, many of whom were allegedly drunk and armed, were pillaging the city, <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> pogroms of ethnic Russians and Armenians, and planned to seize the government buildings.|$|E
25|$|Deuterium oxide {{is often}} used {{as the source of}} {{deuterium}} for preparing specifically labelled isotopologues of organic compounds. For example, C-H bonds adjacent to ketonic carbonyl groups can be replaced by C-D bonds, using acid or base catalysis. Trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, made from dimethyl sulfoxide and methyl iodide can be recrystallized from deuterium oxide, and then dissociated to regenerate methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, both deuterium labelled. In cases where specific double labelling by deuterium and tritium is <b>contemplated,</b> <b>the</b> researcher must be aware that deuterium oxide, depending upon age and origin, can contain some tritium.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, roughly {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} construction of Washington D.C.'s Metro system and San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit, the newly formed Metropolitan Council <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> creation of a similar mass transit for the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, but the idea was eventually abandoned due to opposition from the Minnesota Legislature. For the next few decades, there were repeated proposals to build light rail along several corridors, particularly the University Avenue corridor between downtown Minneapolis and St. Paul (the present Green Line), but the idea of light rail only gained steam in the late 90s.|$|E

25|$|Har Karkom ("Mountain of Saffron", {{also called}} Jabal Ideid) is a {{mountain}} in the southwest Negev desert in Israel, half way between Petra and Kadesh Barnea. On the basis that the Israelites travelled across the Sinai peninsula towards Petra in a fairly straight line, a number of scholars have <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> possibility of Har Karkom being the Biblical Mount Sinai. Following this theory, Emmanuel Anati excavated at the mountain, and discovered {{that it was a}} major paleolithic cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings.|$|E
25|$|The {{legend of}} the {{founding}} of the city of Puebla attributes the act to a vision had by friar Julián Garcés, who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when he dreamed of a festival in honor the Archangel Michael happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs. As the <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> scenery, angels descended from heaven and traced the outlines of the city to be built. When he awake he drew what he had seen, deciding he had had a divine vision. He communicated the dream to other Franciscans and found the place he saw five days later.|$|E
25|$|There were {{occasions}} when de Valera seriously <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> religious life like his half-brother, Fr Thomas Wheelwright, but ultimately {{he did not}} pursue this vocation. As late as 1906, when he was 24 years old, he approached the President of Clonliffe Seminary in Dublin for advice on his vocation. De Valera was throughout his life portrayed as a deeply religious man, who in death asked {{to be buried in}} a religious habit. His biographer, Tim Pat Coogan, speculated that questions surrounding de Valera's legitimacy may have been a deciding factor in his not entering religious life. Being illegitimate would have been a bar to receiving priestly orders, but not to becoming a lay member of a religious order.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completing}} his education, he <b>contemplated</b> <b>the</b> usual professional career, but his bent was evidently {{in the direction}} of anatomical research. He was induced by Abernethy to accept the position of assistant to William Clift, conservator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons. This congenial occupation soon led him to abandon his intention of medical practice and his life thenceforth was devoted to purely scientific labours. He prepared an important series of catalogues of the Hunterian Collection, in the Royal College of Surgeons and, {{in the course of this}} work, he acquired the unrivalled knowledge of comparative anatomy that enabled him to enrich all departments of the science and especially facilitated his researches on the remains of extinct animals.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, the Mon sought {{self-determination}} {{from the}} yet unformed Union of Burma. Burmese Prime Minister U Nu refused, saying that no separate national {{rights for the}} Mon should be <b>contemplated.</b> <b>The</b> Burmese army moved into areas claimed by the Mon nationalists and imposed rule by force {{which resulted in a}} civil war. Mon separatists formed the Mon Peoples Front, which was later superseded by the New Mon State Party (NMSP) in 1962. Since 1949, the eastern hills of the state (as well as portions of Thaninthaya Division) have been under control of the NMSP and its military arm, the Mon National Liberation Front (MNLF). In addition to fighting the central government, the MNLF has fought the Karen people over control of lucrative border crossings into Thailand.|$|E
