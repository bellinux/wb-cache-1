In this {{paper we propose a}} DCA scheme that smoothly changes the channel allocation by solving the following problem. Given a cell structure, a collection of channels, the frequency reuse distance, an allocation of channels to cells, and the number of active connections per cell, accommodate a new call or a new handover by minimally reconfiguring the established allocation of channels to cells. First, this problem is formulated as 0 - 1 quadratic programming problem. Next, we present a distributed, heuristic solution to the problem, which is based on the observed behaviour of the optimal algorithm. Finally, we present some simulation results on the performance and the feasibility of the distributed algorithm. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approximate}} {{technique is}} {{proposed for the}} estimation of call blocking probabilities in <b>cellular</b> mobile <b>telephony</b> networks where call blocking triggers customer retrials. The approximate analysis technique is based on Markovian models with state spaces whose cardinalities are proportional to {{the maximum number of}} calls that can be simultaneously in progress within cells. The accuracy of the approximate technique is assessed by comparison against results of detailed simulation experiments, results of a previously proposed Markovian analysis approach, and upper and lower bounds to the call blocking probability. Numerical results show that the proposed approximate technique is very accurate, in spite of the remarkably small state spaces of the Markovian models.
