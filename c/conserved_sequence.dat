5|$|The {{relationship}} between genes {{can be measured}} by comparing the sequence alignment of their DNA. The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence.</b> Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes {{can be used for}} phylogenetic analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related.|$|E
5|$|The {{ubiquitin}} protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a highly <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated, resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin {{have a role in}} proteasome targeting, while other types of chains may be involved in other processes.|$|E

To determine the regions responsible for serum inducible and basal level expression, the human B-actin promoter was subjected to mutational analysis. Two dist inct elements, the CCAAT homology and the B-actin specific <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences,</b> were found by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression assay and sequence comparisons, and then analyzed for possible functions. Using a DNA bend assay, it was shown that the <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> included {{the core of a}} sequence-directed bend of DNA. Gel mobility shift and DNase I protection assays revealed that the <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> and the CCAAT homology were recognized by binding factors in HeLa cell extracts...|$|R
50|$|The {{research}} of <b>conserved</b> genetic <b>sequences</b> is extremely {{beneficial to the}} scientific community. The detection of similar sequences across diverse species’ genomes can provide useful information regarding the evolutionary history of these species. Additionally, the examination of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> can aid medical research. By identifying rare alleles within <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences,</b> information can be compiled and used to assess risk of disease among humans. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) compare various alleles across the human genome and their association with risk for a particular diseases or ailments.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Multi-genome {{comparative}} analysis has yielded important {{insights into the}} molecular details of gene regulation. We have developed EvoPrinter, a web-accessed genomics tool that provides a single uninterrupted view of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> as they appear in a species of interest. An EvoPrint reveals with near base-pair resolution those sequences that are essential for gene function. Results We describe here EvoPrinterHD, a 2 nd -generation comparative genomics tool that automatically generates from a single input sequence an enhanced view of sequence conservation between evolutionarily distant species. Currently available for 5 nematode, 3 mosquito, 12 Drosophila, 20 vertebrate, 17 Staphylococcus and 20 enteric bacteria genomes, EvoPrinterHD employs a modified BLAT algorithm [enhanced -BLAT (e BLAT) ], which detects up to 75 % more conserved bases than identified by the BLAT alignments used in the earlier EvoPrinter program. The new program also identifies <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> within rearranged DNA, highlights repetitive DNA, and detects sequencing gaps. EvoPrinterHD currently holds over 112 billion bp of indexed genomes in memory and has the flexibility of selecting a subset of genomes for analysis. An EvoDifferences profile is also generated to portray <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> that are uniquely lost {{in any one of}} the orthologs. Finally, EvoPrinterHD incorporates options that allow for (1) re-initiation of the analysis using a different genome's aligning region as the reference DNA to detect species-specific changes in less-conserved regions, (2) rapid extraction and curation of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences,</b> and (3) for bacteria, identifies unique or uniquely shared sequences present in subsets of genomes. Conclusion EvoPrinterHD is a fast, high-resolution comparative genomics tool that automatically generates an uninterrupted species-centric view of sequence conservation and enables the discovery of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> within rearranged DNA. When combined with cis -Decoder, a program that discovers sequence elements shared among tissue specific enhancers, EvoPrinterHD facilitates the analysis of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> that are essential for coordinate gene regulation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cross-species DNA {{sequence}} {{comparison is}} a fundamental method for identifying biologically important elements, because functional <b>sequences</b> are evolutionarily <b>conserved,</b> wheres nonfunctional <b>sequences</b> drift. A recent genome-wide comparison of human and mouse DNA discovered over 200, 000 <b>conserved</b> noncoding <b>sequences</b> with unknown function. Multispecies DNA comparison has been proposed as a method to prioritize these <b>conserved</b> noncoding <b>sequences</b> for functional analysis based on the hypothesis that elements present in many species {{are more likely to}} be functional than elements present in limited numbers of species. Here, we perform a comparative analysis of the single-minded 2 (SIM 2) gene interval on human chromosome 21 with horse, cow, pig, dog, cat, and mouse DNA. We classify <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> based on the number of mammals in which they are present, and experimentally test sequences in each class for function. As hypothesized, <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> present in many mammals are frequently functional. Additionally, we demonstrate that <b>sequences</b> <b>conserved</b> in a limited number of mammals are also frequently functional. Examination of genomic deletions in chimpanzee and rhesus macaque DNA showed that several putatively functional <b>conserved</b> noncoding human <b>sequences</b> were absent in these primates. These findings suggest that functional <b>conserved</b> noncoding human <b>sequences</b> can be missing in other mammals, even closely related primate species...|$|R

25|$|The two {{different}} types of rRNA modification (methylation and pseudouridylation) are directed by {{two different}} families of snoRNAs. These families of snoRNAs are referred to as antisense C/D box and H/ACA box snoRNAs based on the presence of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> motifs in the snoRNA. There are exceptions, but as a general rule C/D box members guide methylation and H/ACA members guide pseudouridylation. The members of each family may vary in biogenesis, structure, and function, but each family is classified by the following generalised characteristics. For more detail, see review.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{mediated}} cleavage and ligation {{is found}} in group 1 and group 2 self-splicing RNAs. VS RNA contains many <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> characteristics to group 1 introns. However VS ribozyme splice site is different from group 1 intron splice site and VR ribozyme self-cleaving site is outside of {{the core of the}} group 1 intron. In the cleavage reaction VS ribozyme produce 2’,3’ -cyclic phosphate and the group 1 introns produce 3’-hydroxyl. Functional similarity with group 1 introns and then mechanistically being different from the introns support this hypothesis that VS ribozyme is a chimera formed by insertion of a novel catalytic RNA into group 1 introns.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{similarity}} of different amino acid sequences {{has been the most}} common method of inferring homology. Sequence similarity is considered a good predictor of relatedness, since similar sequences are more likely the result of gene duplication and divergent evolution, rather than the result of convergent evolution. Amino acid sequence is typically more conserved than DNA sequence (due to the degenerate genetic code), so is a more sensitive detection method. Since some of the amino acids have similar properties (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, size), conservative mutations that interchange them are often neutral to function. The most <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> regions of a protein often correspond to functionally important regions like catalytic sites and binding sites, since these regions are less tolerant to sequence changes.|$|E

50|$|Phylogenetic footprinting is a {{technique}} that utilizes multiple sequence alignments to determine locations of <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> such as regulatory elements.

40|$|Mammalian genomes contain highly <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> {{that are}} not {{functionally}} transcribed. These sequences are single copy and comprise approximately 1 - 2 % of the human genome. Evolutionary analysis strongly supports their functional conservation, although their potentially diverse, functional attributes remain unknown. It is likely that genomic variation in <b>conserved</b> non-genic <b>sequences</b> is associated with phenotypic variability and human disorders. So how might their function and contribution to human disorders be examined...|$|R
25|$|RTA has rRNA N-glycosylase {{activity}} {{that is responsible for}} the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rRNA of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. RTA specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the N-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the 28S rRNA, but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA intact. The ricin targets A4324 that is contained in a highly <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes. The sequence, 5’-AGUACGAGAGGA-3’, termed the sarcin-ricin loop, is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis. The depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis. A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.|$|E
25|$|Nucleotide binding is {{required}} to ensure the electrostatic and/or structural integrity of the active site {{and contribute to the}} formation of an active NBD dimer. Binding of ATP is stabilized by the following interactions: (1) ring-stacking interaction of a conserved aromatic residue preceding the Walker A motif and the adenosine ring of ATP, (2) hydrogen-bonds between a conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motif and the oxygen atoms of the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP and coordination of these phosphates and some residues in the Walker A motif with Mg2+ ion, and (3) γ-phosphate coordination with side chain of serine and backbone amide groups of glycine residues in the LSGGQ motif. In addition, a residue that suggests the tight coupling of ATP binding and dimerization, is the conserved histidine in the H-loop. This histidine contacts residues across the dimer interface in the Walker A motif and the D loop, a <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> following the Walker B motif.|$|E
25|$|The common {{feature of}} all ABC {{transporters}} {{is that they}} consist of two distinct domains, the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The TMD, also known as membrane-spanning domain (MSD) or integral membrane (IM) domain, consists of alpha helices, embedded in the membrane bilayer. It recognizes a variety of substrates and undergoes conformational changes to transport the substrate across the membrane. The sequence and architecture of TMDs is variable, reflecting the chemical diversity of substrates that can be translocated. The NBD or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain, on the other hand, {{is located in the}} cytoplasm and has a highly <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence.</b> The NBD is the site for ATP binding. In most exporters, the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal ABC domains are fused as a single polypeptide chain, arranged as TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD. An example is the E. coli hemolysin exporter HlyB. Importers have an inverted organization, that is, NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD, where the ABC domain is N-terminal whereas the TMD is C-terminal, such as in the E. coli MacB protein responsible for macrolide resistance.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Conserved</b> non-coding <b>sequences</b> in {{the human}} genome are {{approximately}} tenfold more abundant than known genes, and have been hypothesized to mark the locations of cis-regulatory elements. However, the global contribution of <b>conserved</b> non-coding <b>sequences</b> to the transcriptional regulation of human genes is currently unknown. Deeply conserved elements shared between humans and teleost fish predominantly flank genes active during morphogenesis and are enriched for positive transcriptional regulatory elements. However, such deeply conserved elements account for < 1 % of the <b>conserved</b> non-coding <b>sequences</b> {{in the human}} genome, which are predominantly mammalian. Results We explored the regulatory potential of a large sample of these 'common' <b>conserved</b> non-coding <b>sequences</b> {{using a variety of}} classic assays, including chromatin remodeling, and enhancer/repressor and promoter activity. When tested across diverse human model cell types, we find that the fraction of experimentally active <b>conserved</b> non-coding <b>sequences</b> within any given cell type is low (approximately 5 %), and that this proportion increases only modestly when considered collectively across cell types. Conclusions The results suggest that classic assays of cis-regulatory potential are unlikely to expose the functional potential of the substantial majority of mammalian <b>conserved</b> non-coding <b>sequences</b> in the human genome...|$|R

2500|$|Most {{members of}} the MMP family are {{organized}} into three basic, distinctive, and well-conserved domains based on structural considerations: an amino-terminal propeptide; a catalytic domain; and a hemopexin-like domain at the carboxy-terminal. The propeptide consists of approximately 80–90 amino acids containing a cysteine residue, which interacts with the catalytic zinc atom via its side chain thiol group. A highly <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> ([...] [...]PRCGXPD[...] [...]) {{is present in the}} propeptide. Removal of the propeptide by proteolysis results in zymogen activation, as all {{members of the}} MMP family are produced in a latent form.|$|E
2500|$|The snRNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, and {{the less}} {{abundant}} U11, U12 and U4atac) quickly interact with the SMN (survival of motor neuron protein); encoded by SMN1 gene) and Gemins 2-8 (Gem-associated proteins: GEMIN2, GEMIN3, GEMIN4, GEMIN5, GEMIN6, GEMIN7, GEMIN8) forming the SMN complex. [...] It is here that the snRNA binds to the SmD1-SmD2-SmF-SmE-SmG pentamer, followed by addition of the SmD3-SmB dimer to complete the Sm ring around the so-called Sm site of the snRNA. [...] This Sm site is a <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> of nucleotides in these snRNAs, typically AUUUGUGG (where A, U and G represent the nucleosides adenosine, uridine and guanosine, respectively). [...] After assembly of the Sm ring around the snRNA, the 5' terminal nucleoside (already modified to a 7-methylguanosine cap) is hyper-methylated to 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine and the other (3') end of the snRNA is trimmed.

40|$|Babesia bovis {{merozoite}} apical membrane polypeptide Bv 60 {{was found}} to be rhoptry associated by immuno-electron microscopy and was redesignated rhoptry-associated protein 1 (RAP- 1). The N-terminal 300 amino acids of RAP- 1 have a high level of sequence similarity to the same N-terminal region of p 58, its homolog from Babesia bigemina. However, the interspecies <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> did not include RAP- 1 surface-exposed B-cell epitopes as defined by monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, neither heterologous B. bigemina immune nor monospecific anti-p 58 bovine serum binds to whole RAP- 1, indicating that the major B-cell epitopes recognized by these sera are also not encoded by the <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences.</b> Truncated RAP- 1, expressed by a subclone encoding the N-terminal 235 amino acids, is weakly bound by antibodies in heterologous sera. A peptide representing the longest <b>conserved</b> amino acid <b>sequence</b> (amino acids 121 to 134) in this region is also weakly bound by antibodies in immune bovine sera, and rabbit antibodies induced by and strongly reactive with the peptide alone fail to bind native or denatured RAP- 1. Thus, although the conserved region may contain one or more poorly immunogenic B-cell epitopes, these epitopes are inaccessible to antibody in whole RAP- 1. The results indicate that the major immunogenic B-cell epitopes of RAP- 1, including surface-accessible epitopes bound by monoclonal antibodies, are distinct from the <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> representing putative functional domains...|$|R
