5000|$|... "Small pores” contain <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> {{which is}} {{different}} from CBW {{in that it is}} physically (not electrochemically) bound to the rock (by capillary forces). <b>Capillary</b> <b>water</b> generally forms part of the effective pore space for both log and core analysis.However, microporous pore space associated with shales (where water is held by capillary forces and hence is not true CBW) is usually estimated as part of the Vsh by logs and therefore not included as part of the effective porosity. The total water associated with shales is more properly termed “shale water” which is larger in value than CBW (ref. 8). If we humidity dried core samples, (some of) the electrochemically bound CBW would be retained, but none of the capillary-bound microporous water (notwithstanding comments in ref. 7). Therefore, although the figure infers that a humidity-dried core could produce an effective porosity similar to a log analysis effective porosity, the effective porosity from the core will usually be higher (see “Examples” section)—notwithstanding comments in (6) below. Traditionally, true CBW has been directly measured neither on cores nor by logs, although NMR measurement holds promise (ref. 9).|$|E

Plants that draw water upwards through the soil into the roots and out through the plant decreases the movement of soluble contaminants downwards, deeper into the site and into the groundwater. Poplars, for example, take up large quantities of water, transpiring between 200 and 1100 liters daily. With the functional water table depression created, pollutants are drawn and then taken up for an additional treatment process.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{unit weight}} {{is lower than}} those of {{comparable}} building materials. Its shrinkage and expansion rates are low, and are comparable to those of concrete. As such, it can be poured continuously without necessitating a contraction joint. It is characterized by resistance to water and moisture. The ratio of lime in the mixture can be modified in order to completely eliminate water-related erosion. Experiments on <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption have shown that increased amounts of lime in the mixture results in an increase in quantity and in reduced width of capillary canals, proving the material’s erosion resistance. Compressive and shear strength and modules of elasticity and rigidity present advantages in terms of earthquake resistance. Once the mixture is poured into a mould, the production process is completed, and a significant degree of rigidity is reached. It does not require curing and drying, providing economy of time, labor, and energy. Resistance to pressure is 3,5 - 4 MPa. The lime in the mixture reduces resistance to pressure to a minimal degree, while increasing elasticity and resistance to impact. During pressure tests cube-shaped blocks fracture in pyramidal forms, comparable to concrete blocks, and do not disintegrate in the way unstabilized earthen blocks do.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> and vapor transport in shallow subsurface of Hrubá Skála sandstone in the Bohemian Paradise. I have quantified permeability of Hrubá Skála sandstone for water vapor using "wet cup" method and also <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption of sandstone drill cores. I have found out general rules of evaporation and rate of evaporation from several sandstone outcrops in real microclimate. Important part of my work was to determine whether surface crust plays some role in studied parameters. Based on my results, permeability of different types of sandstones for water vapor does not vary significantly and surface crust has no effect on rate of water vapor diffusion. Rate of <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption is reduced by surface crust. Hrubá Skála sandstone is classified as medium or highly absorbing material.

50|$|Fluid {{rich with}} oxygen, {{vitamins}} {{and other nutrients}} passes all the time from the capillaries (the smallest blood vessels) into the surrounding tissues, where it is known as tissue fluid or interstitial fluid. This fluid nourishes the cells and eventually should return to the <b>capillaries.</b> <b>Water</b> retention is said to occur {{as a result of}} changes in the pressure inside the capillaries, or changes that make the capillary walls too leaky (see edema and vascular permeability). If the pressure is wrong, or the capillaries are too leaky, then too much fluid will be released into the tissue spaces between the cells. Sometimes so much fluid is released that it cannot all return to the capillaries and remains in the tissues, where it causes the swelling and waterlogging which is experienced as water retention.|$|R

40|$|Three phase {{induction}} motors {{are widely}} used in industries due to their various technical {{as well as economical}} advantages. About 60 % of industrial electricity is consumed by these motors, but the heat generation inside the motor due to various losses is a critical factor which degrades the dielectric properties of insulation and shortening the lifespan of motor. This paper presents the <b>capillary</b> based <b>water</b> cooling method of three phase squirrel cage induction motor.

40|$|Disposal {{of sewage}} sludge from waste water {{treatment}} plants is a serious environmental problem of increasing magnitude. Waste water treatment generates as much as 70 g of dry solids per capita per day. Although one of the disposal solutions for this waste is through incineration, still almost 30 % of sludge solids remain as ash. This paper presents results related to reuse {{of sewage sludge}} ash in concrete. The sludge was characterised for chemical composition (X-ray flourescence analysis), crystalline phases (X-ray diffraction analysis) and pozzolanic activity. The effects of incineration on crystal phases of the dry sludge were investigated. Two water/cement (W/C) ratios (0. 55 and 0. 45) and three sludge ash percentages (5 %, 10 % and 20 %) per cement mass were used as filler. The mechanical performance of sewage sludge ash concrete (SSAC) at different curing ages (3, 7, 28 and 90 days) was assessed by means of mechanical tests and <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption. Results show that sewage sludge ash leads {{to a reduction in}} density and mechanical strength and to an increase in <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> absorption. Results also show that SSAC with 20 % of sewage sludge ash and W/C= 0. 45 has a 28 day compressive strength of almost 30 MPa.

The current water content in the root zone depends mainly on groundwater levels in some areas with shallow water levels. The study aimed to measure the <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> dynamics in peat soils at various soil densities and groundwater levels which were observed from the changes in peat color, moisture distribution, water content and hydrophobicity of peat soil. The study was conducted in the greenhouse of Indonesian Swampland Agricultural Research Institute, Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with two factors and three replications. The first factor was the bulk density (BD) of peat, namely BD- 1 (on actual condition, 0. 1 g cm- 3) and BD- 2 (compressed into 0. 2 g cm- 3). The second factor was simulated groundwater levels (GWL) consisting of GWL- 1 (- 100 cm), GWL- 2 (- 70 cm) and GWL- 3 (- 40 cm) from soil surfaces. The results showed that the rise of <b>capillary</b> <b>water</b> in peat soil reached a maximum height of 50 cm which was characterized by the increase in water content at the top layer in the range of 105 – 127 % for BD- 1 and 141 – 181 % for BD- 2. The highest value of water content (308 %) was achieved in the treatment of GWL- 3 with BD- 2 and the lowest (37 %) was in the treatment of GWL- 1 with BD- 1.
