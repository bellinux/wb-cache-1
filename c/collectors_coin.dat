5000|$|In modern-day United States numismatics, <b>collectors,</b> <b>coin</b> dealers, and {{third-party}} grading services grade mint state coins using {{a number}} from 60 to 70 inclusive, with 70 representing a perfect coin with no visible blemishes. Coins {{in the lower}} grade range (60-63), although unworn, may suffer from weak striking, bag marks and other defects that make them less attractive to the collector. Some early coins appear quite worn-looking in mint state, due to striking problems or problems with the coins planchet or metal quality--in other words, they look worn, but they are actually uncirculated coins. There are a few United States coins for which no mint state specimens exist, e.g., the 1792 silver disme, and the 1802 Draped Bust (Heraldic Eagle reverse) silver half dime.|$|E
