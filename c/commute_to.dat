A total of 2, 265 workers completed a questionnaire on the forms of <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> and from work (walking/biking, bus or car/motorcycle). Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the outcome and sociodemographic, occupational and behavioral variables.

40|$|Background: The {{current study}} {{examined}} the associations between active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school, cognitive performance, and academic achievement in Dutch adolescents. In addition, it was explored whether these associations were moderated by sex and mediated by depressive symptoms. Methods: Students in grades 7 and 9 (N = 270; mean age 13. 4 years; 53 % boys) were included. Active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school was measured objectively by an ActivPAL 3 ™ accelerometer. Cognitive performance {{was measured by the}} d 2 Test of attention (key components of executive functioning) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (information-processing speed). Academic achievement was determined by the mean of the school grades obtained in Dutch, mathematics and English. Depressive symptoms were self-reported. Results: Active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school constituted 28 % of the total amount of time spent moving per week. Active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school was not significantly associated with cognitive performance and academic achievement, overall. However, active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school was positively associated with performance on the d 2 Test of attention in girls (β =. 17, p =. 037), but not in boys (β = −. 03, p =. 660). The associations were not mediated by depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The associations between active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school and cognitive performance and academic achievement are weak and might be moderated by sex, while the greatest benefits on cognition due <b>to</b> active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school might be with regard to executive functioning. Future studies might make use of experimental designs, because causal relations between active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school and cognitive performance or academic achievement would provide important implications for both education and public health.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:To {{examine the}} {{associations}} between active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school and cognitive performance in adolescents. DESIGN:Cross-sectional study.

Main Exposures Mode {{and duration of}} transportation to school and participation in extracurricular physical activity were self-reported. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive performance (verbal, numeric, and reasoning abilities and an overall score) {{was measured by the}} Spanish version of the SRA Test of Educational Ability. RESULTS: Active <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> school was associated with better cognitive performance (all P <. 05) in girls but not in boys, independent of potential confounders including participation in extracurricular physical activity.
