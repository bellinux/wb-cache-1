40|$|The {{incidence}} and risks of <b>conjunctival</b> <b>contamination</b> with patients' blood during {{a range of}} otolaryngological surgical procedures was assessed. Risks {{were found to be}} highest in three groups of procedures; tracheostomy, operations preceded by local anaesthetic injections and procedures involving the use of the air drill. A simple and effective method of protection using spectacles with large plain lenses is presented...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Conjunctival</b> <b>contamination</b> from splashed debris during {{orthopaedic}} {{surgical procedures}} places surgeons {{at risk for}} communicable diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effectiveness of various types of protective eyewear in preventing <b>conjunctival</b> <b>contamination.</b> Methods: A simulation model was constructed with use of a mannequin head in a typical position of a surgeon’s head during an operation. The head was placed at an appropriate distance from the surgical field, and a femoral osteotomy was performed on a cadaver thigh. Six experimental groups were tested to determine the ability of various types of eye protection to prevent contamination of the conjunctiva: (1) modern prescription glasses, (2) standard surgical telescopic loupes, (3) hard plastic contoured glasses, (4) disposable plastic glasses, (5) a combination facemask and eye shield, and (6) no protection (control). Thirty femoral osteotomies were performed, and contamination of both the protective devices and the simulated conjunctival surfaces were recorded. Results: None of the tested devices were completely effective. The modern prescription glasses and the controls both were associated with <b>conjunctival</b> <b>contamination</b> rates of 83 %. The other eye protective devices were associated with significantly lower rates of overall contamination, with a rate of 50 % for the loupes, 30 % for the facemask and eye shield, 17 % for the hard plastic glasses, and 3 % for the disposable plastic glasses. Conclusions: Modern prescription glasses provided no benefit over the control in our experimental model; therefore...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess the risk of <b>conjunctival</b> <b>contamination</b> with blood during the {{treatment}} of epistaxis and to identify if certain patients and treatments may pose a higher risk. Protective eye-wear worn by ENT trainees during the ward management of epistaxis was examined for contamination with blood splashes. This occurred in 18 % of cases. The incidence of contamination was higher when two treatment modalities were required and when treating elderly female patients...|$|E
5000|$|It occurs 1-2 {{weeks after}} infection. It {{is due to}} <b>conjunctival</b> {{swelling}} after <b>contamination</b> with the vector's feces, which contains the parasitic Trypanosoma cruzi. Although very characteristic of Chagas' disease, not all patients with the acute form develop Romaña's sign.|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that can}} initiate mucosal infection after conjunctival exposure. The anatomical route of T. cruzi invasion and spread after <b>conjunctival</b> parasite <b>contamination</b> remains poorly characterized. In the present work {{we have identified}} the sites of initial invasion and replication after contaminative conjunctival challenges with T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes {{using a combination of}} immunohistochemical and real-time PCR confirmatory techniques in 56 mice between 3 and 14 days after challenge. Our results demonstrate that the predominant route of infection involves drainage of parasites through the nasolacrimal duct into the nasal cavity. Initial parasite invasion occurs within the ductal and respiratory epithelia. After successive waves of intracellular replication and cell-to-cell spread, parasites drain via local lymphatic channels to lymph nodes and then disseminate through the blood to distant tissues. This model of conjunctival challenge was used to identify immune responses associated with protection against mucosal infection. Preceding mucosal infection induces mucosal immunity, resulting in at least 50 -fold reductions in recoverable tissue parasite DNA in immune mice compared to controls 10 days after conjunctival challenge (P < 0. 05). Antigen-specific gamma interferon production by T cells was increased at least 100 -fold in cells harvested from immune mice (P < 0. 05). Mucosal secretions containing T. cruzi-specific secretory immunoglobulin A harvested from immune mice were shown to protect against mucosal parasite infection (P < 0. 05), demonstrating that mucosal antibodies can play a role in T. cruzi immunity. This model provides an important tool for detailed studies of mucosal immunity necessary for the development of mucosal vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The surgeon {{today is}} obliged to operate on an {{increasing}} number of patients who are classified at high risk. The hazards of blood splashes at operation have also been reported suggesting that Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) can be transmitted by <b>conjunctival</b> <b>contamination</b> (1, 2). The eye splash injuries due to peritoneal echinococcal fluid have not been determined in the literature. We reviewed our experiences relevant to two surgeons exposed to the eye splash injuries due to peritoneal echinococcal fluid in order to emphasize the risks of transmission of infections via the eye. This study includes two different surgeons exposed to iatrogenic splashing of echinococcal fluid into their eye...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite {{documented}} {{cases of}} infectious disease trans-mission to medical staff via <b>conjunctival</b> <b>contamination</b> and wide-spread recommendation of protective eyewear use during surgical procedures, {{a large number}} of surgeons rely on their prescription spectacles as sole eye protection. Modern fashion spectacles, being of increasingly slim design, may no longer be adequate in this role. Methods: A survey was conducted among the surgeons at Waikato Hospital from December 7, 2004 to February 1, 2005, to assess current operating theater eyewear practices and attitudes. Those who wore prescription spectacles were asked to assume a standardized “operating position ” from which anatomic measurements were ob-tained. These data were mathematically analyzed to determine the degree of palebral fissure protection conferred by their spectacles. Results: Of 71 surgical practitioners surveyed, 45. 1 % required prescription lenses for operating, the mean spectacle age being 2. 4...|$|E
