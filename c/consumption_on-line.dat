40|$|As {{the dynamic}} voltage scaling (DVS) {{technique}} provides system engineers {{the flexibility to}} trade-off the performance and the energy consumption, DVS has been adopted in many computing systems. However, the longer a job executes, the more energy in the leakage current the device/processor consumes for the job. To reduce the energy consumption resulting from the leakage current, a system might enter the dormant mode. This paper targets energy-efficient rate-monotonic scheduling for periodic real-time tasks on a uniprocessor DVS system with non-negligible leakage power <b>consumption.</b> <b>On-line</b> simulated scheduling strategy and virtually blocking time strategy are developed for procrastination scheduling to reduce energy consumption. The proposed algorithms derive a feasible schedule for real-time tasks with worst-case guarantees for any input instance.

During the past 15 years NIZO food research has {{put a lot of}} effort into developing predictive computer models for the food industry. Nowadays the main challenges in the production of powders are the development of specialities (having a high added value) and the reduction of processing costs. For this, the production capacity of available installations is maximised and the process conditions are directed towards minimal fouling of equipment, minimal product losses and reduction of energy <b>consumption.</b> <b>On-line</b> product quality control is implemented as far as possible. For these purposes predictive computer models have proven to be very helpful. These models also reduce the number of costly and time-consuming production trials needed for the development of new products or processes. In this article an overview is given of various industrial applications of predictive computer models for spray drying of dairy products. New applications in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and developments in model predictive control are also discussed. It is expected that these new applications will make it possible to adjust drying equipment more quickly to new products and will reduce variations in product properties to a large extent...|$|E

Among the most popular applications falling in this category are the various mobile devices. However, in-field testing of processors integrated in mobile devices has the extra requirement of minimum energy consumption, since these devices are operating on battery. In this paper initially we present the parameters contributing to energy consumption in order to set {{the scope of the}} problem and make a qualitative analysis about the efficiency of the SBST routines from a low energy perspective. Then we propose a power evaluation framework based on a combination of tools from the testing and computer architecture technical areas. Utilizing this framework we evaluate {{for the first time the}} most effective structural SBST strategies in terms of energy consumption for three representative processor configurations, showing the validity of our analysis. Finally, the SBST strategies are combined and an appropriate strategy for each processor component is selected, in order to minimize overall energy <b>consumption</b> during <b>on-line</b> testing up to an order of magnitude between the best and worst case combination of test routines. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRegarding to {{greenhouse}} gases emission or supplying cost, energy consumption in buildings is nowadays a problem. So, an appropriate energy management in buildings is mandatory for enhancing energy savings and promoting renewable energy resources. Thus, {{the present paper}} focuses on presenting a lab-scale prototype for (i) <b>on-line</b> monitoring energy <b>consumption,</b> (ii) <b>on-line</b> computing a global energy indicator and (iii) estimating the renewable energy potential of a location. These three points define an energy diagnosis based on energy consumption segmentation. The main goal of developing a labscale prototype is testing some usable tools for achieving an energy management in buildings {{by means of the}} above-mentioned energy diagnosis. The lab-scale prototype is composed of a building mock-up, a monitoring system and a data posttreatment software. The monitoring system is being developed, in collaboration with industrial partners, APEX-BP SOLAR, Pyrescom and the "Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment" (CSTB), for measuring and recording both mock-up temperatures and energy consumption. In addition, this monitoring system records also outdoor parameters, such as solar radiation and wind speed, for estimating the real renewable energy potential of the location. This paper presents, first, the energetic situation in France and the related documentation, and, secondly, a detailed presentation of the lab-scale prototype. A conclusion ends the paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{notion of}} demand {{response}} in electric power systems {{is to use}} time varying electricity price structures to encourage consumers to track generation availability. Specifically, when available generation is low, either due to high demand {{or a lack of}} renewable sources, an increase in electricity rates is intended to encourage smart grid participants to reduce <b>consumption.</b> Similarly, when <b>on-line</b> generation is higher than demand, smart grid participants may benefit from low electricity rates. While many think of smart grid participants as residential consumers, the commercial building and industrial sectors will likely result in a higher grid impact to implementation cost ratio. In this work we investigate potential demand response mechanisms from the chemical manufacturing industry. It will be shown that {{depending on the type of}} upgrade hardware selected the smart grid operating policy will either be an application of Real-Time Optimization (RTO) or Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC). In the case of EMPC the impact of prediction horizon size will be highlighted. I...|$|R

First, an off-line energy analysis, including both {{the effects of the}} refrigeration cycle and the fan used to control the cooling air temperature and speed, is carried-out. This first approach puts on display an optimal running point of the process for a specific cooling air temperature value, which leads to an optimization of the overall energy <b>consumption.</b> Second, an <b>on-line</b> energy optimization approach, based on a nonlinear model-based predictive control strategy, is developed.

40|$|Customer {{value is}} {{understood}} {{as one of the}} constructs that best explains consumer decision making. Its proposal is to understand how consumers translate product or service characteristics and consequences of use into personal self-relevant values. The means-end theory is a way of systematically thinking in this hierarchical representation. The most commonly used method to achieve means-end chains is laddering. This theory and method were used to understand customer values of an important on-line Brazilian newspaper, which is an innovative approach, since on-line laddering is uncommon. The findings indicate that values related to goals of a personal nature are the most important ones. However, other values indicate the increase of the public man pointing to an alternative vision of what is commonly thought of as the contemporary isolated and selfish human. Academic research could benefit from a broader understanding and use of the means-end theory and laddering on the Web. Future research for managerial practices is warranted in areas such as segmentation, satisfaction measuring and customer value reevaluation, in addition to copy tests.

40|$|Binary-Discrete State Manipulators (b-DSMs) are force {{regulated}} manipulators that undergo continuous motions {{despite being}} commanded through {{a finite number}} of states only. Designing a real-time control of such systems requires fast and efficient methods for solving their inverse static analysis (ISA), which is a challenging problem of this paper. In particular, an artificial intelligence method based on neuro-fuzzy method is proposed to investigate the on-line computation and the generalization error of ISA problem of a class of b-DSMs featuring two-state force actuators and six degree of freedom. The main advantages of a neuro-fuzzy system for b-DSMs are: it interprets IF-THEN rules from input-output relations (orientation, moment and binary state) and focuses on accuracy of the output network and offers efficient time <b>consumption</b> for <b>on-line</b> computation. The paper proposed two architectures which are based on the Neuro-Fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno (NFTS) inference scheme with Gaussian membership functions. They are NFTS and the Look-Up Table version of NFTS, which is called as NFLUT. Both structures are with multivariate input and multi-state outputs, such as orientations and moments as input networks and binary state of the b-DSMs as output networks. The learning procedure uses an accelerated LMA with optimal training parameters with at least half-million iterations with different 10 membership functions, employ 12 of the input-output correspondences from the known input-output dataset. For experimental database,the NF structure is tested using 1024 dataset. The optimized membership function (N) after two weeks searching time using Hill Climbing (HC) procedure is N = 17 for the 10 -binary Massive Parallel Robots (MPRs).

The accelerated LMA is efficient {{in the sense that it}} can bring the performance index of the network, such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), down to the desired error goal, more efficiently than the standard Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The MIMO neuro-fuzzy method is a hybrid intelligent system which combines the human-like reasoning style of fuzzy systems with the learning ability of neural nets. The main advantages of a MIMO neuro-fuzzy system are: it interprets IF-THEN rules from input-output relations and focuses on accuracy of the output network and offers efficient time <b>consumption</b> for <b>on-line</b> computation. The proposed architectures of this paper are a MIMO-neuro-fuzzy structure with multivariate input such as fundamental quantities as inputs network (High, Low, Open and Close) and a MIMO-neuro-fuzzy structure with other multivariate inputs, which is a combination inputs between two fundamental quantities (High and Low) and two inputs from technical indicator Exponential Moving Average (EMA High and EMA Low). Both proposed learning procedures, which are using accelerated LMA with optimal training parameters with at least one million iterations with different 16 membership functions, employ 12 of the input-output correspondences from the known input-output dataset.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that pupils—the {{apertures}} that allow light into the eyes—dilate and constrict not only in response to changes in ambient light but also in response to emotional changes and arousing stimuli (e. g., Fontana, 1765). Charles Darwin (1872) related changes in pupil diameter to fear and other “emotions ” in animals. For decades, pupillometry has been used to study cognitive processing across many domains, including perception, language, visual search, and short-term memory. Historically, such studies have examined the pupillary reflex as a correlate of attentional demands imposed by different tasks or stimuli—pupils typically dilate as cognitive demand increases. Because the neural mechanisms responsible for such taskevoked pupillary reflexes (TEPRs) implicate a role for memory processes, recent studies have examined pupillometry as a tool for investigating the cognitive processes underlying the creation of new episodic memories and their later retrieval. Here, we review the historical antecedents of current pupillometric research and discuss several recent studies linking pupillary dilation to the <b>on-line</b> <b>consumption</b> of cognitive resources in long-term-memory tasks. We conclude by discussing the future role of pupillometry in memory research and several methodological considerations that are important when designing pupillometric studies.
