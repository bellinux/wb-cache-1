50|$|The {{linear density}} of a fiber is {{commonly}} measured in units of denier or tex. Traditional units include worsted count, <b>cotton</b> <b>count</b> and yield. Tex {{is more likely}} to be used in Canada and Continental Europe, while denier remains more common in the United States and United Kingdom. The International System of Units uses kilogram per metre for linear densities; in some contexts, the tex unit is used instead.|$|E

The Whitelands mill was a four storey building built by George Harry Mellor, and leased to the Waterside Mill Company, who were registered with a capital of £20,000. It was equipped with 34,256 mule spindles. By 1896 both buildings were being operated by Thomas Mellor and Sons, and before the First World War the mills were physically joined.

40|$|Abstract: Threads {{per inch}} and yarn count {{are some of}} the most {{important}} parameters that affect both weaving performance and fabric property. Experimental studies were conducted by weaving fabrics with three different picks per inch (PPI) and weft counts. The study shows that weaving performance is affected by the too high cover factor. Cover factor was calculated by dividing the threads/inch by the square root of the English <b>cotton</b> <b>count</b> and end breakage was taken as an indication of weaving performance. It was observed that when the count as well as threads/inch of one series of yarn changes the crimp % i. e. the consumption of both series of yarns are affected. It was also observed that, as expected, when the threads/inch increases the fabric strength also increases but at higher threads/inch the gain in strength is relatively more...|$|E

When the cloth is sewn once and the seam thus formed is back-stitched, the most effective method is either to fill the interstitch spaces of the seam with each back-stitch (Fig. 1) or to make each back-stitch and the stitch of the seam lie one above the other by half a stitch-length (Fig. 1). 2. Two-threaded stitching differs little in its effectiveness from back-stitching. 3. There is not much to choose between 'hongaeshi nui' or putting in at each stitch a back-stitch of the same length (Fig. 2) and 'hangaeshi nui' or putting in at each stitch a back-stitch of half its length (Fig. 2). 4.

60|$|Mavering {{could not}} worship enough this nobility of soul in her, and he celebrated it to Boardman with the passionate need of imparting his rapture which a lover feel. Boardman acquiesced in silence, {{with a glance}} of {{reserved}} sarcasm, or contented himself with laconic satire of his friend's general condition, and avoided any comment that might specifically apply to the points Dan made. Alice allowed him to have this confidant, and did not demand of him a report of all he said to Boardman. A main fact of their love, she said, must be their utter faith in each other. She had her own confidante, and the disparity of years between her and Miss <b>Cotton</b> <b>counted</b> for nothing in the friendship which their exchange of trust and sympathy cemented. Miss Cotton, in the freshness of her sympathy and the ideality of her inexperience, was in fact younger than Alice, at whose feet, in the things of soul and character, she loved to sit. She never said to her what she believed: that a girl of her exemplary principles, a nature conscious of such noble ideals, so superior to other girls, who in her place would be given up to the happiness of the moment, and indifferent {{to the sense of}} duty to herself and to others, was sacrificed to a person of Mavering's gay, bright nature and trivial conception of life. She did not deny his sweetness; that was perhaps the one saving thing about him; and she confessed that he simply adored Alice; that counted for everything, and it was everything in his favour that he could appreciate such a girl. She hoped, she prayed, that Alice might never realise how little depth he had; that she might go through life and never suspect it. If she did so, then they might be happy together to the end, or at least Alice might never know she was unhappy.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Plantation conjures {{an image that}} {{identifies}} the North Florida / South Georgia region of the U. S. Leon County attracted many cotton planters from Georgia, Virginia, Maryland, North and South Carolina in the 1820 ’s to the 1850 ’s. Up {{to the beginning of}} the Civil War, Leon County was the 5 th largest producer of <b>cotton</b> <b>counting</b> all counties from Florida and Georgia. The Civil War brought the plantation culture to a standstill. The plantations transformed the environment based on their need for open fields in which to cultivate different crops, or raise a variety of animals with the help of slaves. From the 1900 ’s many plantations abandoned their land to nature producing a deep change in the local landscape. Today plantations are not used as much for planting crops but more for hunting or as tree farms. The hunting plantations do not grow crops but provide good conditions for the hunting of animals and birds. Other plantations were torn apart, sold and now are part of the Tallahassee urban fabric. In other words, they disappeared. The transformation of the plantations has been slow and steady, and has become the image of the area, even the region. The paper shows five plantations that represent five different evolutions of these traditional landscapes. The landscapes have evolved to accommodate the very local but fluid definition of place. It is this transformation, this evolving identity which helped preserve some of the traditional landscapes and the traditional architecture on them. The most prominent feature of the plantation is the “Big House” or plantation house. The house embodies all aspects of the plantation life style. The construction materials and methods reflected the times, the technologies and the available resources. The research has been done mainly in the archives of the Tallahassee Trust for Historic Preservation. The results, still pending, explain the land typology as it evolved from the golden decades of the plantation culture to the present day land use...|$|R

In addition, an actual yarn diameter in the fabric measuring method is carried out and the fabric thickness is estimated consequently. The obtained results proved that the plain single jersey thickness is proportional to three times of the actual measured yarn diameter...|$|R

50|$|The Swindells and to {{a lesser}} extent the Gregs {{dominated}} the mid century textile industry in Bollington. Martins Swindells father, Francis (1763-1823) ran away from his Disley Home in 1779, and became successful in London. He returned to Stockport where he and his brother became cotton manufacturers. Martin (1763-1823) ran many of the Bollington Mills, and moved to Pott Hall, Pott Shrigley to be closer to the business in 1830. He was a proprietor of the Macclesfield Canal which opened in 1831 and built Clarence Mill alongside it in 1834. He was totally dependent on the canal to move in his raw cotton and coal, and to take away his finished cloth. From the start, Clarence Mill was a combined mill doing the spinning, weaving and finishing. His daughter, Annie married Joseph Brookes. On his death his son Martin (1814-1880) succeeded him and formed a partnership with Joseph Brookes and they just ran Clarence Mill- though later Martin and his brother George built the Adelphi Mill. These mills were privately financed. The Swindells did not build tied cottages for their workers- but were generous benefactors of the local Methodist church. Joint stock companies that limited the capital at risk appeared in East Cheshire around 1866, when Samuel Greg and Company was formed. Brookes Swindells and Company Ltd was formed in 1876 and this enabled the financing of the 1877 expansion. 12000 ₤10 shares were floated- but the company was not successful- and this was blamed on the fact the managers did not have the same incentive to succeed. While the Lancashire Cotton industry prospered until 1926, 1877 was the turning point in Bollington. The mill was now taken over by George Swindells and Co, and became part of the Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association Ltd that had been pioneered by Horrocks of Preston in 1887. Swindells specialised to survive and like Thomas Oliver and Son concentrated on spinning extremely fine <b>cotton</b> <b>counts</b> for lace and muslins, and in 1940 was spinning 'Sylex' a cotton yarn so fine it was comparable to silk. The Cotton Spinning Industry Act (1936) encouraged the Fine Cotton Spinners and Doublers Association to diversify and Clarence Mill started to spin silk, and the Adelphi went over to silk completely having 25000 silk twisting spindles. At Quarry Bank Mill, the Gregs abandoned spinning in 1894, and installed 465 looms and 109 Northrops, Quarry Bank Mill continues today as a Textile Museum. The textile industry finished in Cheshire in the mid 1970s, Clarence Mill and Adelphi Mill have survived: today they are offices and Clarence Mill houses the Bollington Civic Trust Heritage Centre.|$|R

So far, no downside has been with the Pegasus and the following benefits have been documented: (1) Energy savings of 65. 0 kilowatt hours per hectare over conventional tillage. This is when the Pegasus plow is used to bury whole stalks, and represents a 70 % savings over conventional tillage (92. 5 kilowatt hours per hectare). (2) Four to seven fewer passes of tillage, depending on the particular situation. This represents a substantial time savings to farmers. (3) So far, no differences in cotton yields. Recent <b>cotton</b> boll <b>counts</b> in one study indicate a higher yield potential with the Pegasus. (4) No disease problems. (5) Significantly higher levels of organic matter in the soil. A hypothesis of the study is that whole stalk burial may reduce plant disease problems. This hypothesis has not yet been proven. (6) Significantly higher levels of nitrate nitrogen. Total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen trended higher but were not significantly different.

Tank mixing increasing rates of norflurazon with both pendimethalin and prometryn caused a similar decline in plant populations in both the wet and the dry plant experiments. The symptoms of dying cotton seedlings and the stand count data indicated that notflurazon was the component of the tank mixtures that caused seedling mortality. The effect of the herbicide treatments on seed cotton yields was much less than on stand counts, but the same trends discussed above were evident. However, at the label rate for norflurazon in coarse textured soils, 0. 5 lb a. i. /A, seed cotton yields were not significantly reduced.
