5|$|The Boeing E-3 Sentry, {{commonly}} known as AWACS, is an American airborne early warning and control (AEW) aircraft developed by Boeing. Derived from the Boeing 707, it provides all-weather surveillance, <b>command,</b> <b>control,</b> and communications, and {{is used by the}} United States Air Force, NATO, Royal Air Force, French Air Force, and Royal Saudi Air Force. The E-3 is distinguished by the distinctive rotating radar dome above the fuselage. Production ended in 1992 after 68 aircraft had been built.|$|E

5|$|Operation Storm {{started at}} 5a.m. on 4 August 1995 when coordinated attacks were {{executed}} by reconnaissance and sabotage detachments {{in concert with}} Croatian Air Force (CAF) air strikes aimed at disrupting ARSK <b>command,</b> <b>control,</b> and communications. UN peacekeepers, known as United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation (UNCRO), were notified three hours {{in advance of the}} attack when Tuđman's chief of staff, Hrvoje Šarinić, telephoned UNCRO commander, French Army General Bernard Janvier. In addition, each HV corps notified the UNCRO sector in its path of the attack, requesting written confirmations of receipt of the information. The UNCRO relayed the information to the RSK, confirming the warnings RSK received from the Yugoslav Army General Staff the previous day.|$|E
5|$|The Russian <b>Command,</b> <b>Control,</b> Communications and Intelligence (C³I) {{performed}} poorly {{during the}} conflict. The Russian communication systems were outdated, with a 58th Army commander allegedly making {{contact with his}} combat troops via a journalist-owned satellite phone. Without the modern GLONASS, precision-guided munitions could not be used; the US-controlled GPS was unavailable, since the war zone was blacked out. Due to the negligence of Russian defence minister, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles was not authorised; an RIA Novosti editorial said that Russian forces lacked reliable aerial-reconnaissance systems, once using a Tupolev Tu-22M3 bomber instead. However, Russian reconnaissance battalions and regiments were also deployed during the war. General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, deputy chief of the General staff, said that during the war, new weapons were not tried out.|$|E

5|$|<b>Command,</b> <b>control,</b> and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not bode well for the success of the operation.|$|E

25|$|A 16 channel <b>command</b> <b>control</b> system named Zero 1 was {{introduced}} in late 1979. Zero 1 was based on digital, not analog, technology, and as such was a forerunner to the NMRA Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Control</b> (DCC) system, {{which appeared in the}} 1990s. Advertisements claimed that 16 locomotives could be operated independently at the same time. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; the controller units and decoder modules required for the locomotives were expensive, but with clean track and well serviced locos the system worked well. Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. Locomotives equipped with a Zero 1 decoder could not be used on conventional direct current systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. This was a common issue with <b>command</b> <b>control</b> systems in that time period. Locomotives with no decoder could not be used on a Zero 1 layout either.|$|E
