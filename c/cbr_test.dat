40|$|AbstractThis paper reports an {{investigation}} on the beneficial effects of reinforcing a fine soil with a geosynthetic (reinforcement geocomposite) and their behaviour under loading. The {{effectiveness of the}} reinforcement was investigated through triaxial and California Bearing Ratio, <b>CBR,</b> <b>tests.</b> The triaxial tests showed that including the reinforcement provided additional confinement to the reinforced soil samples, causing {{an increase in the}} corresponding strength parameters. However, the reinforcement decreased the secant stiffness modulus of the composite material, particularly for low strains. The <b>CBR</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on soaked samples, compacted for different initial water content values. The influence of increasing the number of reinforcement layers was also analysed. The results showed that the reinforced samples had a maximum bearing capacity larger than the unreinforced material. The reinforcing mechanisms observed in the <b>CBR</b> <b>tests</b> were membrane tension support and bearing capacity increase. Increasing the number of reinforcement layers induced an improved response of the soil-geosynthetic composite material, particularly for a water content lower than the optimum. An increase in the initial water content induced reductions of the bearing capacity of the soil, with different values, depending on position of the initial value relative to the optimum water content...|$|R

40|$|Lime and/or cement stabilised {{fine-grained}} soils {{have been}} successfully used {{in the construction industry}} throughout the UK since the early 1970 ’s. Soil stabilisation has several economic, technical and environmental advantages. Although the vast majority of roads built upon stabilised soil foundations have resulted in durable pavements, a few case studies exist where expansive reactions have locally occurred, resulting in the requirement for extensive remedial works. Two high profile failures attributed to the expansion of stabilised capping layers were the M 40 Banbury IV contract and the more recently constructed A 10 Wadesmill Bypass. Both were Department for Transport (DfT) contracts in which the California Bearing Ratio (<b>CBR)</b> swell <b>test</b> was used as part of the quality control and/or investigation procedure. The Highways Agency (HA) and the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) are still recommending the use of the <b>CBR</b> swell <b>test</b> as a means of determining a soils suitability for use within the stabilised process. This thesis was undertaken at Nottingham University as part of an MPhil study programme conducted by Craig Notman. The main aspect of the research was to review the <b>CBR</b> swell <b>test</b> (B. S. 1924 - 2 : 1990) to determine its suitability as an appropriate laboratory test for assessing a soils volumetric change (as it is, and has been, previously recommended by the HA and the TRL). The research focuses on the volumetric stability of stabilised soils, which require assessment under laboratory conditions. Various laboratory standards for determining the volumetric stability of stabilised soils were selected for comparative purposes. They included the <b>CBR</b> swell <b>test</b> (BS 1924 - 2 : 1990), the European accelerated swelling test (BS EN 13286 - 49 : 2004) and the loss of strength upon immersion test Manual of Contract Documents for Highways Works, Volume 1 (MCHW 1) Series 800 Clause 880. 4. When comparing the pass/fail criteria from the three test methods, all three resulted in differing recommendations. The research findings indicate that the pass/fail criterion of the <b>CBR</b> swell <b>test</b> (recommended by the HA 74 / 00) is less stringent than the European accelerated swell test for the same material. That is, when assessing a material’s suitability for stabilisation as a Capping material (foundation class 1 : IAN 73), the <b>CBR</b> swell <b>test</b> is more likely to deem a material suitable than if the European accelerated swell test was used. The loss of strength on immersion test is the most difficult pass/fail criterion to satisfy. The author concludes that the BS 1924 - 1990 <b>CBR</b> swell <b>test</b> is an inappropriate test to be used as the sole determinant for the volumetric stability of stabilised soils (as recommended by TRL 505), and that further research is required to develop appropriate guidance before this test is used again for assessing the volumetric stability of stabilised soils...|$|R
