50|$|Youth {{unemployment}} in Italy is quantified by many measures. According to EU statistics, 10.6% of all Italian 15-24 year-olds were unemployed in 2015. Comparatively, in the European Union 28 the rate that year was 8.4%. These levels are deceptively low because they include both active and inactive youth, which counts students and those {{not looking for}} work. Leaving out the inactive population, 40.3% of 15-24 year-olds who were actively part {{of the labor force}} were unemployed in 2015. 22% of the same population had been unemployed for 12 or more months, meaning {{more than half of the}} unemployed active Italian youth had been so long-term. Yet another subset of the youth population is neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET), which in 2015 represented 21.4% of Italy's 15-24 year-olds. In addition to <b>complete</b> <b>unemployment,</b> Italian youth also have high levels of underemployment. The number of 15-24 year-olds who worked full-time (30 hours per week) dropped from 1,597,000 in 2000 to 676,000 in 2015, while the number of part-time workers increased from 172,000 to 237,000 people. Furthermore, 83.7% of the young part-time workers in 2015 did so involuntarily because they could not find full-time employment.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{the sharp}} {{increase}} in Uruguayan unemployment rates {{has been accompanied by}} the perception that the risk of unemployment is unevenly distributed so that some groups are more prone to undergo long periods of unemployment. This research aims to complement the information reflected in the unemployment rate with the one referred to its duration, for the period 1986 - 1999. First, it studies the so-called “incomplete duration” of unemployment, as reported by the National Statistics Institute. This indicator informs about the job-search time until the information is collected. However, {{it is important to have}} an effective indicator to describe the whole unemployment period. For that reason, an estimator to give account of the time the unemployed people should expect before returning to employment is calculated. It is based on the calculation of conditional probability of remaining unemployed proposed by Sider (1985), Baker (1992), Corak and Heisz (1996). The study shows that the average <b>complete</b> <b>unemployment</b> spell reached four months for the whole population, which is a long one, considering the dynamics of economic growth between 1986 and 1999. It also finds differences among demographic groups in terms of their entry to unemployment and their total unemployment spell. Finally, it is established that the increase in the unemployment spell in aggregate terms has not been led by an increase in the incidence of groups typically associated to longer durations (compositional effect), but to an increase in duration for all groups. In short, most of the variation in the total unemployment spell duration has been caused by variations in the aggregate unemployment rate rather than by changes in the individual characteristics of the unemployed people. unemployment, unemployment duration spell...|$|E

40|$|Following the {{unemployment}} hysteresis of the 1980 s, discussions of methods {{for reducing the}} natural rate of unemployment {{tend to focus on}} long-term unemployment (LTU).

Because house lock will extend job search in the local labor market for homeowners whose home value has declined, I focus on differences in unemployment duration between homeowners and renters across geographic areas differentiated by the severity of the decline in home prices. The empirical analyses rely on microdata from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) files and an econometric method that enables the estimation of individual and aggregate covariate effects on <b>completed</b> <b>unemployment</b> durations in synthetic cohort (pseudo-panel) data.

The results provide support for both explanations, although the link to changing labor force attachment for women is less clear than the link to permanent job loss.

We have found evidence that past unemployment experience and unobserved individual components affect the experience of longer future unemployment spells under benefits. However, we appreciate in workers with <b>completed</b> past <b>unemployment</b> spells that the correlation between the duration of succesive unemployment spells is only due to the unobserved components across individuals.

40|$|Falaris, Evangelos M. Economists have {{analyzed}} {{various aspects}} of unemployment, such as factors that may affect individuals' choices while unemployed. In particular, economists have examined personal characteristics that may influence an individual's unemployment duration. I investigate the impacts of individual characteristics {{on the length of}} unemployment duration in Japan by using the 2002 Employment Status Survey. I use a household income equation for those who did not <b>complete</b> their <b>unemployment</b> spells before the date of the survey and a multiple imputation technique introduced by Rubin (1996) to generate household income for those who were employed {{at the time of the}} survey but whose unemployment spells ended before the time of the survey. I take account of the added-worker effect and assume that the longer spell of unemployment an individual has, the stronger the added-worker effect she faces. I use a Weibull parametric duration model. Furthermore, I use Heckman and Singer's method (1984) to include unobserved heterogeneity. The results indicate that in a model that does not control for unobserved heterogeneity, unemployment duration and the level of household income are negatively associated, which is inconsistent with search theories. However, when including unobserved heterogeneity, unemployment duration and the level of household income are positively associated on the margin for some ranges of household income. The findings of this study have implications for Japanese labor market policies. University of Delaware, Department of EconomicsPh. D...|$|R
40|$|Unemployment {{is still}} disappointingly high in most Central and East European countries, {{which may be}} a {{reflection}} of the ongoing adjustment to institutional shocks resulting from systemic transition, or may be caused by high labour market rigidity or aggregate demand that is too weak. This article investigates the dynamics of unemployment and output in those eight post-communist countries which entered the EU in 2004. We use a model related to Okun's Law; i. e. the first differences in unemployment rates are regressed on GDP growth rates. We estimate country and panel regressions with instrument variables (TSLS) and apply some tests to the data and regression results. We assume transition of labour markets to be accomplished when a robust relationship exists between unemployment rate changes and GDP growth. Moreover, the estimated coefficients contain information about labour market rigidity and unemployment thresholds of output growth. Our results suggest that the transition of labour markets can be regarded as <b>completed</b> since <b>unemployment</b> responds to output changes and not to a changing institutional environment that destroys jobs in the state sector. The regression coefficients demonstrate that a high trend rate of productivity and a high unemployment intensity of output growth have been observable since 1998. Therefore, we conclude that labour market rigidities do not {{play an important role in}} explaining high unemployment rates. However, GDP growth is dominated by productivity progress and the employment-relevant component of aggregate demand is too low to reduce the high level of unemployment substantially. ...|$|R

The empirical distributions of durations showed pronounced spikes which suggests the presence of a considerable telescopic effect. This effect was modelled by an exponential heaping function. Heterogeneity was controlled by adding a suitable set of covariates and unobserved heterogeneity was introduced on the scale parameter of the baseline hazard function. The results were compared with those obtained by a neural network model, but the performance of the latter did not show strong improvement over the former because presumably strong non-linearities and interactions did not underlie the relationships between the spell lengths and the covariates...|$|R

40|$|Essay I: Employment Security Agreements, {{which are}} {{elements}} of Swedish collective agreements, offer {{a unique opportunity}} to study very early job search counselling of displaced workers. These agreements provide individual job search assistance to workers who are dismissed due to redundancy, often as early as during the period of notice. Compared to traditional labor market policies, the assistance provided is earlier and more responsive {{to the needs of the}} individual worker. In this study, I investigate the effects of the individual counseling and job search assistance provided through the Employment Security Agreement for Swedish blue-collar workers on job finding and subsequent job quality. The empirical strategy is based on the rules of eligibility in a regression discontinuity framework. I estimate the effect for workers with short tenure, who are dismissed through mass-layoffs. My results do not suggest that the program has an effect on the probability of becoming unemployed, the duration of unemployment, or income. However, the results indicate that the program has a positive effect on the duration of the next job. Essay II: The well-known positive relationship between the unemployment benefit level and unemployment duration can be separated into two potential sources; a moral hazard effect, and a liquidity effect pertaining to the increased ability to smooth consumption. The latter is a socially optimal response due to credit and insurance market failures. These two effects are difficult to separate empirically, but the social optimality of an unemployment insurance policy can be evaluated by studying the effect of a non-distortionary lump-sum severance grant on unemployment durations. In this study, I evaluate the effects on unemployment duration and subsequent job quality of a lump-sum severance grant provided to displaced workers, by means of a Swedish collective agreement. I use a regression discontinuity design, based on the strict age requirement to be eligible for the grant. I find that the lump-sum grant has a positive effect on the probability of becoming unemployed and the length of the <b>completed</b> <b>unemployment</b> duration, but no effect on subsequent job quality. My analysis also indicates that spousal income is important for the consumption smoothing abilities of displaced workers, and that the grant may have a greater effect in times of more favorable labor market conditions. Essay III: Evidence from around the world suggest that individuals who are awarded disability benefits in some cases still have residual working capacity, while disability insurance systems typically involve strong disincentives for benefit recipients to work. Some countries have introduced policies to incentivize disability insurance recipients to use their residual working capacities on the labor market. One such policy is the continuous deduction program in Sweden, introduced in 2009. In this study, I investigate whether the financial incentives provided by this program induce disability insurance recipients to increase their labor supply or education level. Retroactively determined eligibility to the program with respect to time of benefit award provides a setting resembling a natural experiment, which could be used to estimate the effects of the program using a regression discontinuity design. However, a simultaneous regime change of disability insurance eligibility causes covariate differences between treated and controls, which I adjust for using a matching strategy. My results suggest that the financial incentives provided by the program have not had any effect on labor supply or educational attainment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study {{compared}} {{access to}} 5 livelihood assets among disabled and non-disabled youth, to inform health professionals on inequities related to disability and {{to monitor the}} transformation agenda aimed at creating an inclusive society. Methods. Fieldworkers interviewed 989 youth (18 - 35 years; 523 (52. 9 %) disabled youth (DY), 466 (47. 1 %) non-disabled youth (NDY)) at 9 sites in 5 South African provinces. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic characteristics and livelihood assets. Chi-squared and t-tests were used for comparisons. Results. Doctors at hospitals and nurses at clinics are health professionals most frequently seen. Far fewer DY than NDY attended and <b>completed</b> school. <b>Unemployment</b> was markedly more common among DY than among NDY. Barriers to accessing employment for DY were poor health and lack of skills development, {{and a lack of}} job opportunities for NDY. Both groups received the same amount of support from immediate household members, but significantly more NDY received support from extended family, friends, partners, and neighbours. They spent significantly more time engaging in all free-time activities. NDY reported more access to bathrooms, phone, and newspapers, as well as public services and the business sector. Participation and access were limited for both groups because of inaccessible public transport. Conclusion.

40|$|The term 'at risk' is used broadly {{within the}} {{education}} sector {{to describe a}} range of situations and behaviours {{that may lead to}} negative educational and social outcomes for students. We need, however, to be clear in our own thinking about the type of risk that various situations present in order to give effective assistance to students. In general, there are two distinct discourses of being at risk applied to school students: firstly, at risk of academic failure includes passive disengagement from schooling and dropping out; secondly, at risk of harm, includes abuse, self-harm and suicide. While the discourses may be discrete, however, there is also considerable overlap at times and resolution may require both environmental and behavioural considerations. Indeed, the consequences of academic failure, such as early school drop-out, may be to place the individual at further risk, jeopardising development as a mentally and physically healthy adult. Failure to <b>complete</b> compulsory schooling, <b>unemployment,</b> unsafe health practices and low self-worth are among the risk factors that may lead to inability to fully develop as an adult (Kelly, 2001). In this chapter, we will examine both discourses independently, considering the related behaviours, the attribution of responsibility, and ways in which the situations may be addressed. We will also note systemic similarities in addressing the needs of all at risk students and conclude by examining the characteristics of teachers and classrooms that minimise both academic risk and risk of harm...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: During {{the last}} few years, many {{countries}} in Europe suffered from a severe economic crisis which resulted in high unemployment rates. In this frame, the possible relationship between unemployment rate and suicidal rates {{at the level of}} the general population has been debated recently. Material and methods: The official data concerning <b>completed</b> suicides and <b>unemployment</b> rates from the Hungarian Central Statistical Office for the years 2000 – 2011 were used. The percentage of changes from the previous year in the unemployment rate and the suicidal rates concerning both the general and the unemployed populations was calculated. Pearson correlation coefficient between the change in suicidal rates and change in unemployment rates was calculated both for the same year as well as after 1 – 6 years. Results: The correlations between the unemployment rate and suicide rates were strongly negative both for the general and for the unemployed populations (− 0. 65 and − 0. 55, respectively). The correlation of unemployment change with suicidality change after 1 – 6 years gave a peak strong positive correlation at 5 years for the general population (0. 78). At 4 years after the index year, there is a peak correlation with a moderate value for the unemployed population (0. 47) and a similar moderate value for the general population (0. 46). Discussion: The current findings from Hungary suggest that unemployment might be associated with suicidality in the general population only after 3 – 5 years. It is possible that the distressing environment of the economic crisis increases suicidality in the general population rather than specifically in unemployed people...|$|R
40|$|The {{conflicting}} evidence over class size effects drawn from observational (or correlational) studies on academic achievement or labor market outcomes has provoked great debate in both academic {{and public policy}} arenas. The recent experimental evidence from the United States due to the Project STAR demonstration run in Tennessee in the 1980 s has added strong evidence in favor of one type of an effect, whereby initial test score gains were maintained only through sustained smaller class sizes. But this has not resolved the debate by any means. In this paper we utilize the unique feature of the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) in that children are sampled for extremely long individual histories of their class size experiences {{as well as their}} test score and early adult outcomes. We argue that one implication of Project STAR is that only persistent class size reduction policies may have detectable effects, and so the long histories of the type recorded by the CHDS are necessary to detect class size effects. We account for the observational nature of the CHDS (in that children were not randomly assigned to different class sizes) by examining the long-run trends in test score growth, rather than levels. Consistent with the experimental evidence, we found statistically and economically significant effects of children being assigned to persistently smaller classes on both childhood test score growth as well as on early adult outcomes such as <b>completed</b> education and <b>unemployment</b> experiences. Our analysis points the way towards the unification of experimental and observational evidence on class size effects, as well as highlighting several possible pitfalls in the analysis of observational data on this topic. It also serves as a platform by which further experimental studies on class size might be designed to verify or falsify some of the hypotheses raised in this report, and so further unify the entire literature on this topic. class-size; reading achievement; longitudinal analysis; employment; tertiary education participation...|$|R
