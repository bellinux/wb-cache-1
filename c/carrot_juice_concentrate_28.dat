40|$|Bacterial {{cellulose}} and cellulose-pectin composites {{were used}} as well-defined model plant cell wall (PCW) systems to study the interaction between phenolic acids (PA) derived from purple <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate</b> (PCJC) and PCW components. Significant PA depletion from solution occurred, with pure cellulose initially (30 s- 1 h) absorbing more than cellulose-pectin composites in the first hour (ca 20 % cf 10 - 15 %), but with all composites absorbing similar levels (ca 30 %) after several days. Individual PAs bound to different relative extents with caffeic acid > chlorogenic acid > ferulic acid. Extrapolation of data for these model systems to carrot puree suggests that nutritionally-significant amounts of PAs could bind to cell walls, potentially restricting bioavailability in the small intestine and, as a consequence, delivering PAs to the large intestine for fermentation and metabolism by gut bacteria.

40|$|The carrot {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{consumed}} root vegetables, both in raw and processed forms and offers various nutritional benefits with the firesh product being low in energy and a good source of fibre, potassium and other minerals. Of all the vegetables, it {{is one of the}} richest sources of carotenes especially B-carotene which has a crucial role in vision and is also thought to have benefits due to its anti carcinogenic properties and in protection against heart disease. [...] . For this strategic investigation on processing suitability, four commercially available Australian carrot varieties (two traditional and two more recently developed) were selected. Nutrient contents have been measured including moisture, protein, crude fibre, pectin, vitamins (Bi, B 2,, C and Carotenes) and minerals (Ca, Fe, K, Mg and Na). Small variations in macronutrients and mineral composition were observed between the varieties. Parameters used industrially to indicate juicing potential were also assessed. Considerable variation in yield and colour characteristics of juices prepared from the different varieties was observed. As a result of this strategic study, suitable processing carrot varieties, blanching indicator enzyme, blanching regime, concentration technique and storage conditions have been established. A recommended processing protocol has also been developed for the commercial processing of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> This approach is suitable for the production of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate</b> having optimal quality characteristics...|$|R

Pear, red grape, mango, tangerine, <b>carrot</b> and lemon <b>juice</b> <b>concentrates</b> (50 - 69. 4 °Brix, pH 1. 7 - 4. 3) were inoculated with A. acidoterrestris spores (10 (3) spore/mL) and stored at 4 °C and 20 °C, after which the spores were counted at 0, 2, 5, 9, 17, 21, 28, 36, 43, and 50 days. No significant differences in the number of Alicyclobacillus spores were observed at storage temperatures of 4 °C and 20 °C (p> 0. 05). The results also indicated that the number of spores of A. acidoterrestris remained stable in all types of <b>juice</b> <b>concentrates</b> during the storage period, except in lemon <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate.</b> In lemon <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate,</b> a decline in A. acidoterrestris spore populations of 0. 3 - 0. 8 log CFU/mL was observed within 5 - 10 days of storage. The decline in A. acidoterrestris spore populations was more pronounced in cloudy lemon <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate,</b> which contained higher concentrations of flavonoids (mainly eriocitrin and hesperidin) than clarified lemon <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate.</b> It was also found that dilution of lemon <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate</b> samples in the proportion of 1 : 19 allowed the germination of A. acidoterrestris spores and the growth of populations of up to 10 (7) CFU/mL.

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are well known sources of vitamins, minerals and fibre as well as polyphenolic compounds and other phytonutrients. Extensive research into the chemoprotective benefits of plant-based foods has found that such compounds and their metabolites have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and/or anti-carcinogenic properties. Whilst the health benefits associated with high dietary intake of fruit and vegetable polyphenols is a well researched field, {{the role of the}} plant cell wall on the bioaccessibility of these compounds is not. Polyphenolic and other nutrient compounds are located within the vacuole of plant cells surrounded by a lipid membrane and thereby separated from the plant cell wall which encapsulates the cell. In order for polyphenols and other nutrients to be bioavailable (i. e. absorbed during digestion through the gastrointestinal tract), they must first become bioaccessible (i. e. released from the plant cell ready to be absorbed by the body). In order for nutrients to be bioaccessible, the plant cell wall needs to be breached with the consequent possibility of binding between nutrients and plant cell walls. This thesis explores the nature of interactions between plant cell walls and two important classes of polyphenolic phytonutrients, anthocyanins and phenolic acids. The main structural constituent of the fruit and vegetable cell wall is cellulose, which is surrounded by a matrix of pectin and hemicelluloses, and at times lignin. Lignin directly affects the textural and palatability qualities of plant foods, and is generally not present in large amounts in fruits {{and vegetables}}. Cellulose fibres are tough and insoluble, and hence able to resist substantial force and provide support to the plant cells, whilst pectin increases the flexibility through formation of a co-extensive network with the rigid cellulose fibre network. The degree of methyl esterification (DE) of carboxyl groups is commonly used to differentiate pectins and to control network formation. The role of cell walls in polyphenol bioaccessibility has not been researched extensively. Rupture of the cell wall during mastication or processing (e. g. pureeing or juicing) results in polyphenols being released from the cell vacuole with consequent contact with cell walls for the first time, with the potential for binding interactions to occur. The human upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach and small intestine (S. I.) is unable to digest plant cell walls. Therefore if polyphenols bound to plant cell walls at the point of ingestion are not released from the cell wall material during transit through the gastric and small intestinal digestive phases, they will be carried by the cell walls to the large intestine where they may be released by bacterial fermentation of cell wall polymers and potentially further metabolised by bacteria before being either absorbed or excreted. This research fills several major gaps in current knowledge by: 1) identifying potential mechanisms for polyphenol-plant cell wall interactions; 2) assessing the bioaccessibility of polyphenols in a real vegetable system; and 3) examining the release of plant cell wall-bound polyphenols during gastric and S. I. digestion and the potential delivery of polyphenols to the colon. The extent of anthocyanin and phenolic acid interaction with cell wall components was investigated by monitoring the rate of polyphenol depletion from diluted purple <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate</b> in the presence of pure cellulose or cellulose-pectin composites containing either low DE or high DE pectins, produced by the bacterium Gluconacetobacter xylinus. Binding of anthocyanins to plant cell wall components seems to be a 2 -stage process with initially (1 hour) a limited amount (13 - 18 %) of anthocyanins bound {{to the surface of the}} cellulose or cellulose-pectin composite. Whilst anthocyanins bound to both cellulose and pectin, more were bound to pectin. With prolonged exposure (7 days) to cell wall material, a gradual increase in anthocyanin binding occurred with approximately 35 % binding to cellulose and the high DE composite and up to 80 % binding to the low DE composite. This may be due to anthocyanins stacking on top of a base layer. Support for localised deposition of anthocyanins was found from confocal microscopy which showed apparent local high concentrations of anthocyanins alongside regions with much less, if any, bound anthocyanins. There does not seem to be molecular selectivity as depletion from solution of individual anthocyanin molecules is similar throughout the binding process. Phenolic acid depletion from solution in the presence of model cell walls also occurred. However unlike anthocyanins, more phenolic acids were bound to the pure cellulose initially than to the cellulose-pectin composites. Phenolic acid depletion was rapid, with approximately 20 % phenolic acids binding to cell wall components within the first hour. This gradually increased to approximately 35 % (low DE composite) and 50 % (high DE composite and pure cellulose) over 14 days contact time. Additionally phenolic acid depletion from different concentrations of diluted purple <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> <b>concentrate</b> was similar indicating that cell walls may have a limited saturation level for binding phenolic acids. Conversely, doubling the concentration of free anthocyanins available led to at least twice as much binding with cell wall components. This indicates that whilst anthocyanin binding is slow, it may not be limited by available binding sites. Extrapolation of data from these model systems to carrot puree suggests that significant amounts of anthocyanins and phenolic acids could bind to the plant cell wall, potentially restricting their bioavailability in the S. I. In order to ascertain the potential extent of polyphenol delivery to the large intestine via plant fibre in a real food system, polyphenols bound to cell wall material in a black carrot puree were subjected to simulated gastric and small intestinal digestion. It was found that the majority of available hydrophilic polyphenols derived from black carrots bound to the PCW matter with only ~ 36 % of the total phenolic acids (~ 1. 2 mg/g puree) and 30 % of anthocyanins (1. 3 mg/g puree) in the black carrot puree being released into the liquid phase. Approximately 30 % of the bound phenolic acids and anthocyanins could be extracted with acidified methanol. However, onl...|$|R

40|$|Carrots are a cold-weather crop {{well suited}} for {{cultivation}} {{in the south of}} Sweden. Carrots are generally rather inexpensive, with a market price below € 1 /kg (Sweden, 2003), whereas fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> has a price of around € 5 /kg. The fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> produced today has a short shelf-life of approximately three days, which makes centralised industrial production and distribution difficult, and there is also a high degree of spoilage in the retail outlet. It is therefore of interest to produce a <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> with a sustainable high quality and thus a longer shelf-life. The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of different unit operations on the quality and shelf-life of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> High-quality <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> was defined as a cloud-stable juice with fresh taste, appealing intense colour, high carotene content and a healthy dietary fibre balance. The effects on the pomace were also considered in order to gain knowledge on by-product applications of the waste material and thus decrease the environmental load. Three different two-stage expression lines were investigated. It was concluded that the composition of the juice and pomace, as well as the physical properties of the pomace, were affected by both juice yield and the type of equipment used. The primary juice expressed was found to have higher quality than secondary juice in terms of higher values for colour, optical density, carotene and dietary fibre content. During juice expression the density of the press-cake seemed to influence primarily the amount of carotene expressed, but also that of dietary fibre. The water-holding capacity of the pomace decreased after hard pressing, although the total amount of dietary fibre per gram dry matter increased. Cloud formation was investigated and a combined effect of temperature and acidification was found. Cloud formation occurred at lower temperatures for lower pH. <b>Carrot</b> <b>juice</b> has a pH of 6. 3, and at a pH of 4. 4 cloud formation was found to occur immediately at room temperature. The shelf-life of fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> is primarily determined by microbial growth in the juice.

The results showed that isothermal calorimetry could be used to determine the shelf-life of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> When stored at 17 °C the shelf-life was less than 20 % of that under refrigerated storage at 8 °C, and the shelf-life was found to be limited by the mesophilic flora in both cases. The shelf-life of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> was prolonged by mixing with other juices and acidification. The effect on shelf-life varied according to the acid used, and was related to the undissociated acid concentration. Using combinations of acids had greater effects at the same pH and thus a positive effect on shelf-life could be achieved without cloud formation. However, storage of the <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> under a modified anaerobic atmosphere had no effect on shelf-life...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasound is a {{relatively}} new method that has been used in the food industry for enhancing unit operations such as drying, extraction and freezing. Sonication, despite a small invasiveness, has an effect on various physical, chemical and biochemical changes in the treated materials. Freezing is a widely used process in the food industry for extending the shelf-life of the products due to decreasing the food temperature. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a 30 -minute ultrasound treatment on the freezing process of <b>carrot</b> <b>juices</b> (9, 12 and 21 °Bx) from two producers. Freezing was conducted by immersion and air chilling method at- 30 °C medium temperature. The study examined how ultrasound effects the ex-tract, density of juices, the specific freezing time, freezing point, Moreover, the freezing curves were evaluated. It was observed that 30 -minute ultrasonic treatment did not affect physical properties of tested juices, only in the case of higher <b>concentrated</b> <b>juices,</b> the in-crease of tested parameters was seen. There was no difference in the shape of freezing curves, regardless of the freezing method, concentration of the juice and its producer and the applica-tion of sonication either. Regardless the concentration or the US pre-treatment, it has been observed that the specific time required to freeze the product in the immersion method was shorter than in the shock freezing. Along with the increase of concentrations of <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> the freezing point decreased, regardless of the producer. The freezing point of <b>carrot</b> <b>juices,</b> after the application of the US, slightly decreased. Research in this study confirms the reports of the reduced freezing time after the application of ultrasound in case of <b>carrot</b> <b>juices...</b>|$|R

40|$|High {{consumption}} {{of fruits and}} vegetables has been suggested to provide some protection to smokers who are exposed to an increased risk of numerous cancers and other degenerative diseases. Carrot is the most important source of dietary β-carotene. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> supplementation to smokers can protect against lymphocyte DNA damage and to compare the effect of supplementation of capsules containing purified β-carotene or a placebo (simple lactose). The study was conducted in a randomized and placebo-controlled design. After a depletion period of 14 days, 48 smokers were supplemented with either <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> (n = 18), purified β-carotene (n = 16) or placebo (n = 14). Each group was supplemented for 8 weeks with approximately 20. 49 mg of β-carotene/day and 1. 2 mg of vitamin C/day, as <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> (300 ml/day) or purified β-carotene (20. 49 mg of β-carotene, 1 capsule/day). Lymphocyte DNA damage was determined using the COMET assay under alkaline conditions and damage was quantified by measuring tail moment (TM), tail length (TL), and% DNA in the tail. Lymphocyte DNA damage was significantly decreased in the <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> group in all three measurements. The group that received purified β-carotene also showed a significant decrease in lymphocyte DNA damage in all three measurements. However, no significant changes in DNA damage was observed for the placebo group except TM (P = 0. 016). Erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme was not significantly changed after supplementation. Similarly plasma lipid profiles were not different after <b>carrot</b> <b>juice,</b> β-carotene and placebo supplementation. These results suggest that while the placebo group failed to show any protective effect, <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> containing beta-carotene or purified β-carotene itself had great antioxidative potential in preventing damage to lymphocyte DNA in smokers...|$|R
40|$|The {{inactivation}} of Escherichia coli MG 1655 was {{studied at}} 256 different pressure (150 - 600 MPa) -temperature (5 - 45 degreesC) combinations under isobaric and isothermal conditions in Hepes-KOH buffer (10 mM, pH 7. 0) and in fresh <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> A linear relationship {{was found between}} the log(10) of inactivation and holding time for all pressure-temperature combinations in <b>carrot</b> <b>juice,</b> with R- 2 -values {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 91. Decimal reduction times (D-valuds), calculated for each pressure-temperature combination, decreased with pressure at constant temperature and with temperature at constant pressure. Further, a linear relationship was found between loglo D and pressure and temperature. A first order kinetic model, describing loglo D in <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> as a function of pressure and temperature was formulated that allows to identify process conditions (pressure, temperature, holding time) resulting in a desired level of inactivation of E. coli. For Hepes-KOH buffer, the Weibull model more accurately described the entire set of inactivation curves of E. coli MG 1655 compared to the log-linear or the biphasic model. Several secondary models (first and second order polynomial and Weibull) were evaluated, but all had poor fitting capacities. When the Hepes-KOH dataset was limited to 22 of the 34 pressure-temperature combinations, a first order model was appropriate and enabled us to use the same model structure as for <b>carrot</b> <b>juice,</b> for comparative purposes. The major difference in kinetic behaviour of E. coli in buffer and in <b>carrot</b> <b>juice</b> was that inactivation rate as a function of temperature showed a minimum around 20 - 30 degreesC in buffer, whereas it increased with temperature over the entire studied temperature range in <b>carrot</b> <b>juice.</b> (C) 2004 Elsevier B.
