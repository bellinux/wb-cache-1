50|$|The {{major problem}} with this method is that {{in one of the}} four switch <b>combinations</b> the <b>socket</b> around the bulb is {{electrified}} at both of its terminals even though the bulb itself is not lit. As the shell may be energized, even with the light switched off, this poses a risk of electrical shock when changing the bulb. This method is therefore prohibited in modern building wiring.|$|R
30|$|HAProxy {{includes}} powerful logging capabilities {{using the}} Syslog standard. It also supports session affinity, {{the ability to}} direct requests belonging to a single session to the same server, and Access Control Lists (ACLs), even in <b>combination</b> with Secure <b>Socket</b> Layer (SSL) since version 1.5.|$|R
2500|$|SANS 164-4 defines three {{variants}} of the 16A {{plug and socket}} intended for specialist (known as [...] "dedicated") applications. [...] The variants use a flattened earth pin, each at a different specified rotational position. [...] This arrangement ensures that the dedicated plugs can all plug into an ordinary ("non-dedicated") socket, but that the various dedicated plug and <b>socket</b> <b>combinations</b> are not interchangeable (nor can a non-dedicated plug be inserted into a dedicated socket).|$|R
5000|$|The Intel i810 chipset was {{released}} by Intel in early 1999 with the code-name [...] "Whitney" [...] as a platform for the P6-based Socket 370 CPU series, including the Pentium III and Celeron processors. Some motherboard designs include Slot 1 for older Intel CPUs or a <b>combination</b> of both <b>Socket</b> 370 and Slot 1. It targeted the low-cost segment of the market, offering a robust platform for uniprocessor budget systems with integrated graphics. The 810 was Intel's first chipset design to incorporate a hub architecture which was claimed to have better I/O throughput.|$|R
5000|$|The type {{specimen}} of Coloborhynchus is known {{only from a}} partial upper jaw. Therefore, according to Rodrigues and Kellner's 2008 re-evaluation on Coloborhynchus clavirostris, {{it can only be}} differentiated from its relatives based on its unique <b>combination</b> of tooth <b>socket</b> positions. In Coloborhynchus, the two front teeth pointed forward and were higher on the jaw than the other teeth, while the next three pairs of teeth pointed to the sides. The final two (preserved) pairs of teeth pointed downward. Finally, a unique oval depression was located below the first pair of teeth.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of protocols, such as TCP/IP, and their {{integration into the}} operating system environment is very decisive for protocol performance. Putting TCP on high-speed networks, e. g. ATM, with large maximum transmission units causes the TCP maximum segment size to be relatively large. What Nagle's algorithm consider a "small" segment is not small any more which affects the TCP performance. We report on TCP/IP throughput and RPC response time performance measurements for various sizes of send and receive socket buffers, using the Sparc 10 architecture machines Axil 311 / 5. 1 running SunOS 4. 1. 3 connected to FORE System's ATM network. For some common <b>combinations</b> of <b>socket</b> buffer sizes we observe a dramatic performance degradation to less than 1 % of expected throughput and to one order-ofmagnitude longer response time than expected. The performance degradation {{is caused by a}} deadlock situation in the TCP connection which is resolved by the 200 ms spaced timer generated TCP delayed [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Plugs and sockets are {{designed}} as a system to meet standards for safety and reliability. Some types of socket may accept more than one type of plug; where this is an official, approved intention of the socket design, all the approved combinations will be tested to the applicable safety standards. Occasionally, plug and <b>socket</b> <b>combinations</b> may allow power to flow but may not meet product standards for mating force, earthing, current capacity, life expectancy, or safety. Improvised or user-modified connectors will not meet the product safety standards. Adaptors between different standards can overcome mechanical incompatibility. Physical compatibility does not ensure that the appliance and socket match in frequency or voltage.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to volumetrically assess {{alterations}} of the ridge contour after socket preservation and buccal overbuilding. Material and Methods: In five beagle dogs, four extraction sites were subjected to one of the following treatments: Tx 1 : The socket was filled with BioOss CollagenÂ® and covered with a free gingival autograft from the palate (SP). Tx 2 : The buccal bone plate was forced into a buccal direction using a manual bone spreader and SP was performed. Tx 3 : The buccal bone plate was forced into a buccal direction using a manual bone spreader; SP was performed. Tx 4 : The socket was filled with BioOss Collagen and a combined free gingival/connective tissue graft was used to cover the socket and for buccal tissue augmentation. Impressions were obtained at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 months post-operatively. Casts were optically scanned and superimposed in one common coordinate system. Using digital image analysis, the volumetric differences per area among the different treatment time points and among the treatment groups were calculated. Results: Four months after tooth extraction, no statistically significant differences with regard to the buccal volume per area could be assessed among the treatment groups. Conclusion: Overbuilding the buccal aspect in <b>combination</b> with <b>socket</b> preservation is not a suitable technique to compensate for the alterations after tooth extraction...|$|R
40|$|A {{specification}} {{utilized for}} the nondestructive evaluation of socket type pipe joints at Langley Research Center (LaRC) is discussed. The scope of hardware shall include, {{but is not}} limited to, all common pipe fittings: tees, elbows, couplings, caps, and so forth, socket type flanges, unions, and valves. In addition, the exterior weld of slip on flanges shall be inspected using this specification. At {{the discretion of the}} design engineer, standard practice engineer, Fracture Mechanics Engineering Section, Pressure Systems Committee, or other authority, four nondestructive evaluation techniques may be utilized exclusively, or in <b>combination,</b> to inspect <b>socket</b> type welds. These techniques are visual, radiographic, magnetic particle, and dye penetrant. Under special circumstances, other techniques (such as eddy current or ultrasonics) may be required and their application shall be guided by the appropriate sections of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (B&PVC) ...|$|R
5000|$|Various {{earthing}} {{systems are}} used {{to ensure that the}} ground and neutral wires have zero voltage with respect to earth, to prevent shocks when touching grounded electrical equipment. In some installations, there may be two line conductors which carry alternating currents in a single-phase three-wire. Small portable electrical equipment is connected to the power supply through flexible cables (these exist with either two or three insulated conductors) terminated in a plug, which is inserted into a fixed receptacle (socket). Larger household electrical equipment and industrial equipment may be permanently wired to the fixed wiring of the building. For example, in North American homes a window-mounted self-contained air conditioner unit would be connected to a wall plug, whereas the central air conditioning for a whole home would be permanently wired. Larger plug and <b>socket</b> <b>combinations</b> are used for industrial equipment carrying larger currents, higher voltages, or three phase electric power. These are often constructed with tougher plastics and possess inherent weather-resistant properties needed in some applications.|$|R
