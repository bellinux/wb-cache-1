5|$|After {{entering}} the open {{waters of the}} South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10‑minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and 1-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph). After weakening slightly, the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> bore north, reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme where {{measurements}} of charge <b>current</b> <b>and</b> its noise {{can be used}} to determine spin-dependent transport properties.

To illustrate the scheme we use it to determine the spin Hall conductance in a four-terminal setup, and also the spin polarization of a current injected from a ferromagnet into a semiconductor. Starting from the scattering formalism we express the spin <b>current,</b> <b>and</b> the relevant spin-dependent transport quantities, in terms of spin-dependent transmission coefficients. We derive expressions relating these coefficients to the charge <b>current</b> <b>and</b> noise.

5|$|Cape Fear {{experienced}} minor beach erosion. The erosion, {{combined with}} high waves, washed out {{a portion of}} a roadway. The heavy rainfall in the Outer Banks disabled over 200cars and flooded nearly 500. Strong wind gusts left around 10,000buildings without power. Many places were not restored for two to three days after the storm. Wind and storm surge damaged over 100houses and buildings. Damage amounted to about $7.5million (2004USD). Two days after the storm passed, a man drowned off of Nags Head from strong rip <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> waves. This was the only direct casualty from the storm.|$|E
5|$|Even though Vrbanac {{ordered a}} halt to the {{operation}} shortly after midnight on 18/19 September, the Bjelovar Corps failed to cancel new crossing attempts it had ordered for 6:00 the following morning.

5|$|For the new attack, Nelson was to {{take three}} ships of the line, three frigates, {{including}} Emerald, and 200 marines, for an amphibious landing outside the Spanish stronghold. The frigates would then engage the batteries to the north-east of Santa Cruz while the marines stormed the town. However, a combination of strong <b>currents</b> <b>and</b> heavy Spanish fire forced the British to abandon the attack. Several further attempts were made between 22 and 25 July; although the British were able to land troops, Spanish resistance was too strong and the British had to ask for an honourable withdrawal.|$|E
