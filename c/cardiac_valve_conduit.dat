40|$|Since {{the first}} <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> {{replacement}} {{in the early}} sixth decade of the last century, the search continued for ideal <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> substitute with proven structural durability {{over a period of}} 10 to 20 years, central flow orifice without transvalvular gradient, absence of host reactivity deleterious to valve function, non-thrombogenecity without the use of anti-coagulant, resistance to infective endo-carditis, availability with cost effectiveness and ease of surgical implantation 1. The experience with prosthetic tissue valves commenced almost simultaneously with the silastic ball valve and the aortic homograft valve. Homograft aortic valves have been used either as fresh, antibiotic sterilized or cryo-preserved, as a replacement for mitral valve, aortic valve, aortic root replacement, or a conduit between the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk. Homograft <b>cardiac</b> <b>valve</b> or <b>valve</b> <b>conduit</b> is used in correcting some congenital malformation in child-hood, in old age because of higher rate of compli-cation of either bleeding or thromboembolism from anticoagulant used along with mechanical valves, in women wanting a child because of the risk of embryopathy or CNS defect from warfarin anticoa-gulant, patients with risk of hemorrhage from chronic liver disease, active peptic ulcer, bleeding diathesis, in refractory cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis or native valve endocarditis. Fresh sterile homograft is difficult to procure so a method of sterilizing contaminated heart valve from autopsy specimen using low concentration of antibiotic cocktail is needed before its storage by cryo-preservation method...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesClinical {{translation}} of tissue-engineered heart valves requires valve competency {{and lack of}} stenosis in the short and long term. Early studies of engineered valves showed promise, although lacked complete definition of valve function. Building on prior experiments, we sought to define the in vivo changes in structure and function of autologous engineered pulmonary <b>valved</b> <b>conduits.</b> MethodsMesenchymal stem cells were isolated from neonatal sheep bone marrow and seeded onto a bioresorbable scaffold. After 4 weeks of culture, <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were implanted. <b>Valve</b> function, cusp, and conduit dimensions were evaluated at implantation (echocardiography), at the experimental midpoint (magnetic resonance imaging), and at explant, at 1 day, and 1, 6, 12, or 20 weeks postoperatively (direct measurement, echocardiography). Histologic evaluation was performed. ResultsNineteen animals underwent autologous tissue-engineered <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> replacement. At implantation, <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> function was excellent; maximum transvalvular pressure gradient by Doppler echocardiography was 17 mm Hg; most <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> showed trivial pulmonary regurgitation. At 6 postoperative weeks, valve cusps appeared less mobile; pulmonary regurgitation was mild to moderate. At 12 weeks or more, <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> cusps were increasingly attenuated and regurgitant. <b>Valved</b> <b>conduit</b> diameter remained unchanged over 20 weeks. Dimensional measurements by magnetic resonance imaging correlated with direct measurement at explant. ConclusionsWe demonstrate autologous engineered tissue <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> that function well at implantation, with subsequent monitoring of dimensions and function in real time by magnetic resonance imaging. In vivo valves undergo structural and functional remodeling without stenosis, but with worsening pulmonary regurgitation after 6 weeks. Insights into mechanisms of in vivo remodeling are valuable for future iterations of engineered heart valves...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> {{have been}} used {{successfully}} in severe forms of right ventricular-pulmonary artery discontinuity, progressive <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> stenosis is an important clinical problem. To determine the feasibility of reducing right heart <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> stenosis with a balloon expandable stent, a baboon model was used, in which the pulmonary artery was ligated and a right ventricular to pulmonary artery 14 mm bioprosthetic Dacron <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> implanted. In five baboons, {{at an average of}} 40 months after <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> implantation, fibrointimal stenosis at the valve site resulted in narrowing and a mean transconduit pressure gradient of 49 mm Hg (range 33 to 65). A tubular slotted steel stent (1. 2 cm long) was deployed within the <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> after inflation of an 8 to 15 mm diameter balloon catheter that was introduced through the femoral vein. A stent was delivered to all valved conduits; however, in two baboons, balloon undersizing resulted in stent dislodgment. In the remaining three baboons, the transconduit gradient was reduced by 59 % (49 to 20 mm Hg) and right ventricular systolic pressure decreased acutely by 35 % (77 to 50 mm Hg). It is concluded that stent deployment is feasible in right ventricular to pulmonary artery stenotic <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> and may result in significant hemodynamic improvement. However, successful stent delivery is critically dependent on the proper selection of stent length and balloon diameter...|$|R

In this study we have evaluated the merits of our newly developed calcification-free biologic valve incorporated in a compatible conduit of biologic origin in an animal model. Methods: Porcine aortic valves and main pulmonary arteries were cross-linked in glutaraldehyde, followed by coupling to partially degraded heparin through an intermediate surface-bound substrate containing amino groups. Because commercially available valves are treated only with glutaraldehyde, control aortic valves and main pulmonary arteries were cross-linked in 0. 625 % glutaraldehyde. <b>Valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were fabricated from main pulmonary arteries, which were sewn to the aortic and ventricular ends of aortic <b>valves.</b> <b>Valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were examined for calcification and other pathologic changes after being implanted in the descending thoracic aorta in juvenile sheep for 5 months. Results: Severe calcification was noticed in all layers of cusps (calcium, 231. 86 ± 17. 90 mg/gm) and aortic wall (calcium, 123. 24 ± 24. 72 mg/gm) of aortic valves and main pulmonary arteries (calcium, 135. 43 ± 26. 63 mg/gm) of <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> treated with 0. 625 % glutaraldehyde.

To assess the fate of homograft <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> in the intermediate-term follow-up period, 38 children with 38 conduits had a repeat echocardiogram at 6 to 25 months (mean 15 +/- 6) after surgery. Of the 38 conduits examined, 10 (26 %) had no regurgitation, 25 (66 %) had 1 + regurgitation and 3 (8 %) had 2 + regurgitation. Progression of the amount of regurgitation occurred in 11 (29 %) patients. At the follow-up examination, peak velocity was 2. 6 m/s across 1 valve. This latter patient had a 3. 2 -m/s jet across the proximal insertion of the conduit and no further increase across the valve itself. Thus, no patient had evidence of <b>conduit</b> <b>valve</b> stenosis. Of the 38 patients, 9 had Doppler evidence of obstruction at the conduit insertion (8 at the distal end and 1 with the aforementioned proximal obstruction).

An uncommon surgical option to aortic valve replacement is the apicoaortic <b>valved</b> <b>conduit.</b> In this article the techniques and outcomes of 13 cases of apicoaortic <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> insertions in high-risk patients are described. MethodsFrom 2002 through 2005, 13 patients (mean age, 75 ± 8. 7 years; 8 men) with severe calcific aortic stenosis had insertions of an apicoaortic <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> because of a porcelain aorta (n = 4), previous coronary bypass grafting (n = 6), or both (n = 3). The off-pump technique was used in 9 patients, and a heparinized miniextracorporeal circulation system was used in 4 patients. Follow-up time was 6 to 33 months. ResultsMean intensive care stay was 2 ± 2. 7 days, and mean hospital stay was 12 ± 8 days. The 30 -day mortality was 15 % (2 patients; postoperative days 3 and 28, both caused by myocardial infarction).

Methods: Fresh bovine jugular veins with a retained native valve procured from a slaughterhouse were used as raw materials to fabricate the <b>valved</b> <b>conduits.</b> A naturally occurring crosslinking agent, genipin, was used to fix the procured jugular veins. The glutaraldehyde-fixed counterpart was used as a control. A canine model was used in the study. Results: Echocardiography revealed that the motion of the valvular leaflets in both the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed conduits was satisfactory. The transvalvular pressure gradients of both studied groups were minimal. No endothelium-like cells were observed on the luminal surface of the conduit and the valvular leaflet for the glutaraldehyde-fixed group throughout the entire course of the study. In contrast, endothelium-like cells were observed on the entire surface of the genipin-fixed <b>valved</b> <b>conduit</b> retrieved at 6 months postoperatively in all the cases studied. There was no evidence of luminal fibrous peel in any the <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> studied. Degradation of valvular leaflet in one of the glutaraldehyde-fixed conduits was observed. In this particular case, thrombus formation was also observed {{on the surface of the}} valvular leaflet. On the other hand, no apparent degradation or thrombus formation was observed on the surfaces of the genipin-fixed valvular leaflet and conduit. A significantly more severe inflammatory reaction was observed for the glutaraldehyde-fixed conduit than for its genipin-fixed counterpart throughout the entire course of the study. The calcium contents of the samples before implantation and those retrieved at distinct implantation duration were minimal for both the glutaraldehyde- and genipin-fixed tissues.

Methods: Between May 2007 and July 2011, 16 patients, underwent implantation of a Contegra <b>valved</b> <b>conduit.</b> All operations were performed through a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. Indications included: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n= 11), Tetralogy of Fallot with absent Pulmonary Valve (PV) syndrome (n= 2), double outlet right ventricle, transposition of great arteries and pulmonary stenosis (n= 1), isolated aortic valve disease (n= 1) and a pseudo-aneurysm with infective endocarditis (n= 1).

Patients who received homografts (n = 2 patients), heterografts (n = 3 patients), and valveless conduits (n = 19 patients) and those patients who died within 90 days after the operation were excluded. Fifty-four survivors of pulmonary outflow reconstruction with fresh autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> were followed up from 5 to 15 years (mean, 7. 47 ± 2. 8 years). Diagnosis include d -transposition of great arteries (n = 16 patients), L -transposition of great arteries (n = 14 patients), tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n = 11 patients), truncus arteriosus (n = 10 patients), and double-outlet ventricle (n = 3 patients). Implantation age ranged from 0. 25 to 24 years (mean, 5. 2 ± 4. 2 years). Median conduit diameter was 16 mm. Two-dimensional echocardiographic Doppler evaluations were made yearly; 9 patients underwent cardiac catheterization. Reintervention for stenosis was indicated when the pressure gradient exceeded 50 mm Hg. Results: Three late deaths were unrelated to the conduit. Thirty-five autologous pericardial <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> increased in diameter (1 - 7 mm), remained unchanged in 15 patients, and reduced 1 to 2 mm in 4 patients.

Methods: This was {{a retrospective analysis}} of all such patients from 1986 through May 2001. Results: There were 25 operations (11 aortic allografts, 9 pulmonary autografts, and 5 mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduits)</b> among 23 patients. The mean time to reoperation was 6. 3 years. There were 2 in-hospital deaths (8 %, 1 patient with a pulmonary autograft and 1 with a mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduit).</b> There were 2 early nonfatal valve-related events (1 patient with an aortic allograft and 1 with a pulmonary autograft). There were no late valve-related deaths and 2 late non-valve-related deaths of patients with aortic allografts placed. No variable predicted early death or early valve-related event. No differences in preoperative characteristics, hospital variables, early outcomes, or late outcomes were detected among the groups. Overall, 19 patients are alive (18 in New York Heart Association functional class I and 1 in New York Heart Association functional class III) at a mean follow-up of 49 months. Two late aortic allograft failures necessitated reoperation. All patients with successful pulmonary autografts had excellent autograft function at a mean follow-up of 68 months. All early survivors with mechanical <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> are alive and free of valve-related events (mean follow-up 71 months).

Late cardiac catheterization was done in 6 patients who were suspected of having valve failure and right ventricular hypertension by two-dimensional echocardiography. All 6 of these patients showed a high pressure gradient between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle and also had elevated right ventricular pressure. In conclusion, two-dimensional echocardiography is a simple, non-invasive and very accurate method for detecting <b>conduit</b> stenosis and <b>valve</b> failure. An echocardiographic series should be performed for a long-time postoperatively because obstructions of <b>valved</b> <b>conduits</b> may be progressive, and an operation may be advisable {{in order to prevent}} the development of advanced right ventricular hypertrophy and deterioration. </p...|$|R
