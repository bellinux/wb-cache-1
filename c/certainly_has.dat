5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> {{to be the most}} historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but it <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms {{consists}} of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E

Two other bases include Al Sulayyil ballistic missile base (the older base located 450km southwest of Riyadh) and Al Jufayr base (placed 90km south of Riyadh) share many similarities, suggesting that they share the same role.|$|E

25|$|Superficially, {{the ceiling}} is a Humanist construction. The figures are of superhuman {{dimension}} and, {{in the case}} of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it really looks as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles Times said NASA and {{the wider}} {{scientific}} community anticipated the film {{as a way to}} publicize a human mission to Mars. The New York Times reports that the film [...] "serves as a nice plug for NASA, which has returned the favor by pushing the movie on its website. (On Monday , scientists announced that signs of liquid water could be seen in photographs taken on Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, timing that suggests NASA <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> the whole cross-promotion thing down.)". Jim Erickson, NASA project manager, said the film would show moviegoers [...] "the risks and rewards" [...] of humans traveling to Mars.|$|E
500|$|The playoff {{goal was}} Richard's last, as on September 15, 1960, he {{announced}} his retirement as a player. Richard had reported to Montreal's training camp that autumn, but Selke compelled Richard to end his playing career, fearing he was risking serious injury. In Richard's retirement speech, {{he said he had}} been contemplating leaving the game for two years, and stated that at age 39, the game had become too fast for him. Upon learning of Richard's retirement, Gordie Howe offered praise for his former rival: [...] "He sure was a drawing card. He brought in the crowds that helped pay our wages. Richard <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> been one of the greatest players in the game and we will miss him." ...|$|E
500|$|Off track, the {{argument}} {{over the new}} rules implemented at the Grand Prix and the inclusion of lawyer Roberto Causo as a race steward was renewed. FIA president Max Mosley published a letter dated from 19 October to Ron Dennis which accused him of damaging the image of Formula One with his recent stream of comments over the issues. Mosley also defended Race Director Charlie Whiting's announcement that marshals could use racing flags to caution drivers over unsportsmanlike behaviour. Dennis responded by apologising for his comments, saying {{that he did not}} intend to bring Formula One into disrepute and cause disrespect to Causo. [...] "It <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> not ever been my intention to damage a sport to which I have devoted most of my working life." [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "The Job" [...] 8.2/10. He {{believed}} that the episode [...] "pulled off some rather brilliant turns" [...] with the storylines concerning Jan and Jim, Karen, and Pam. Fickett opined however that the episode was at its weakest during the Dwight's take-over scenes in Scranton, as he knew Michael would be returning. He concluded his review on a more positive note by commenting that Ryan's selection [...] "makes for some interesting scenarios for next season. All in all this was a funny episode that wrapped up some key story lines while still leaving open some questions to be answered next season. It wasn't a home run finale, but it <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> us eagerly await the fall premiere." [...] AOL TV contributor Jay Black highlighted scenes he found humorous, including Dwight's preferred choice of an assistant and Michael's reaction to Jan's implants. He gave the episode [...] "7 Shrute Bucks out of 7." [...] Various cast members were also lauded for their performances, including Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Melora Hardin.|$|E
500|$|David Quantick in The Word {{commented that}} [...] "musically, Seduction is awe-inspiring {{in the way}} the Maels {{perfectly}} meld their current style – intense, repetitive beats and melodies (there's even a bit of squelching techno here) and caustic, snappy lyrics – with the demands of an actual musical." [...] He called the album an [...] "amazing record", a [...] "commissioned piece that not only does what it's been asked to do, but transcends the brief and creates a genuinely exciting piece of music in its own right." [...] Andy Gill in The Independent gave The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman a maximum rating of five stars and included the record among his 20 albums of the year: [...] "Sharply scripted, with that sly, knowing touch so typical of Sparks, it's also scored with scrupulous intelligence, the arrangements drawing on a range of apt influences, from Kurt Weill to jazz, pop and rock, and the orchestrations ingeniously duplicitous, wistful and sinister, as the action dictates. It may well {{turn out to be the}} pinnacle of Sparks' career, and <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> an ambition well beyond the usual remit of popular culture." ...|$|E
500|$|Fonda, in The Huffington Post, {{said she}} regretted {{some of the}} {{language}} used in the original protest letter and how it [...] "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." [...] She continued, writing [...] "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens." [...] Fonda emphasized that she, [...] "in no way, support the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people." [...] Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to The Huffington Post rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as [...] "a strong supporter and friend of Israel".|$|E

500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
500|$|The owners {{immediately}} {{worked to}} crush the union. [...] Toronto owner Conn Smythe compared the players association to communism: [...] "I feel that anything spawned in secrecy as this association was <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> to have some odour to it." [...] Red Wings president Bruce Norris responded by trading Lindsay to his brother's team, the Black Hawks. [...] The move was widely seen as punitive, as the Hawks had finished last in the NHL every season, save one, from 1949 until 1957. [...] Lindsay {{was not the only}} player sent to Chicago as punishment; Glenn Hall was included as he refused to distance himself from Lindsay. In Toronto, Smythe repeatedly benched Jim Thomson, who was the union's secretary, before also dealing him to the Black Hawks. [...] The Players' Association responded by filing a $3million anti-trust lawsuit against the NHL. Persuaded by teammates Gordie Howe and Red Kelly, the Red Wings players voted to withdraw from the association in November 1957. [...] Other teams quickly followed, and the union capitulated. [...] Union leadership ultimately agreed to drop the lawsuit in exchange for small concessions, which included a minimum annual salary of $7,000, increases to the pension contributions and moving expenses for traded players.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the major}} trade journals, Todd McCarthy of Variety called the film an [...] "expansively {{entertaining}} special effects extravaganza" [...] with [...] "fresh energy and stylistic polish", while Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film, while nonetheless finding [...] "disappointment [...] a climatic [...] battle between different Iron Man prototypes [...] how did Tony's nemesis {{learn how to}} use the suit?" [...] In one of the first major-daily newspaper reviews, Frank Lovece of Newsday lauded the film's [...] "emotional truth [...] pitch-perfect casting and plausibly rendered super-science" [...] that made it [...] "faithful to the source material while updating it [...] and recognizing what's made that material so enduring isn't just the high-tech cool of a man in a metal suit, but the human condition that got him there". A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film [...] "an unusually good superhero picture. Or at least – since it <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> its problems – a superhero movie that's good in unusual ways." [...] Among the specialty press, Garth Franklin of Dark Horizons commended the [...] "impressive sets and mechanics that combine smoothly with relatively seamless CG", and said, [...] "Robert Downey Jr., along with director Jon Favreau [...] help this rise above formula. The result is something that, whilst hardly original or groundbreaking, is nevertheless refreshing in its earnestness to avoid dark dramatic stylings in favor of an easy-going, crowd-pleasing action movie with a sprinkle of anti-war and redemption themes".|$|E
