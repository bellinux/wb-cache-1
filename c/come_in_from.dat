5|$|Early May 2014 Dutch railway {{refurbishment}} and overhaul company NedTrain {{announced they}} {{had won the}} contract to refurbish the entire fleet. The first set was to arrive in May 2014 for inspection, scheduling of the works involved and evaluation of the process while {{the remainder of the}} fleet would <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> spring 2015. All sets were to be transported by rail via Sweden, Denmark and Germany to the main facility in Haarlem.|$|E
5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} strip of land between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course than it had up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E

Both {{highways}} merge in Alturas and {{head out of the}} city as a concurrency northeast toward Lakeview, Oregon and Cedarville, respectively.|$|R

St. Mary's church is a 14th-century flint built church stands at {{the centre of the}} village, just west of this junction.|$|R
5|$|In June 1943, Mayer {{encountered}} Robert S. Johnson, {{a future}} ace from the 56th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force. Johnson's P-47 Thunderbolt had been badly shot-up by some Focke Wulf Fw 190s during a routine mission. As Johnson limped home, with a canopy {{that would not}} open and hydraulic fluid and oil covering his windscreen, Mayer pulled alongside him in his Fw 190. Mayer looked the wounded P-47 over, and then circled to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Johnson's six-o'clock {{to give it the}} coup de grâce. The first gun pass failed to knock the heavy American fighter out of the sky. Mayer made two more runs on Johnson, without success. After running out of ammunition, Mayer pulled alongside Johnson, saluted him and headed for home. Johnson landed his plane, and counted more than 200 holes, without even moving around the airplane. He also saw that a 20mm cannon shell had exploded just behind his headrest, which had made it impossible to open his canopy.|$|E

25|$|The Abruzzo {{region has}} the Apennines running along its western border and {{includes}} Corno Grande, {{the highest point}} on mainland Italy. The mountain range serves as a tempering influence on the climate, blocking many storms that <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the west. However, this does leave the area prone to storm systems originating from the east, which are blocked in their westward progression by the mountains, causing high levels of precipitation to fall on the vineyards, as happened during several rain soaked vintages of the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|At Fitzgerald's Ford, the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry, {{supported}} by the 5th North Carolina Cavalry, were thrown back as the 5th North Carolina {{had been in the}} morning. Only the 1st North Carolina Cavalry could keep a foothold across the ford. Rooney Lee ordered Brigadier General Richard L. T. Beale's Virginia cavalry brigade to attack across the creek and <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the left. Both Beale's and Barringer's cavalry brigades now rushed across Smith's line, forcing the Union force to retreat into an open field and quickly withdraw.|$|E

Mackenzie had to pause twice to break up pockets of resistance. The Union cavalrymen captured large numbers of prisoners during their advance. At about 9:00p.m., Mackenzie halted and reported his location to Sheridan. Sheridan sent instructions to have a cavalry detail relieve the infantry detachment then guarding the Hatcher's Run ford on Ford's Road.|$|E
25|$|The {{first trial}} lasted {{three weeks and}} {{took place at the}} Dunedin High Court in May 1995. The Crown put forward that Bain shot to death his mother, two sisters and brother in {{undetermined}} order before going on his morning paper run. On his return he waited for his father to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the caravan and go into the lounge to pray and then shot him from behind the computer alcove curtain, typed the message on the computer, arranged the scene {{to make it look like}} a suicide, and called 111. The defence submitted that Robin Bain killed the other family members, typed the message and shot himself while David was out on his paper round.|$|E
25|$|At the West Seneca town line, US20 turns {{due east}} when Reserve Road merges {{in from the}} west. After another mile, the road makes a 90-degree left turn at NY187's {{northern}} terminus. It is now headed due north as Transit Road, a busy regional route that continues north as far as Lockport. After yet another mile, NY16 and NY78 <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> East Aurora to the southeast. NY16 continues west to downtown Buffalo while NY78 turns north to join US20. Just north of the junction, Transit Road connects to the entrance ramps for an interchange with the NY400 freeway, US20's first interchange with a limited-access highway since meeting the Thruway in Irving.|$|E

25|$|But Charles {{was in no}} case {{to resume}} his {{northern}} march. Fairfax and the New Model, after reducing Bridgwater, had turned back to clear away the Dorsetshire Clubmen and to besiege Sherborne Castle. On the completion of this task, it had been decided to besiege Bristol. On 23 August 1645, while the King's army was still in Huntingdon, and Goring was trying to raise a new army to replace {{the one he had}} lost at Langport and Bridgwater, the city was invested. In these urgent circumstances Charles left Oxford for the west only a day or two after he had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the Eastern Association raid. Calculating that Rupert could hold out longest, he first moved to the relief of Worcester.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, from November to February, {{there are}} light rains called equipatas ("horse hoofs", {{named after the}} sound the rain makes). These rains <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the north from the {{southern}} extensions of frontal storms that originate in the northern Pacific Ocean. These end by March or April when the fronts are no longer strong enough to reach this far south. They end even earlier in the extreme south of the state as the storm systems retreat, with the dry season lasting eight or nine months {{in this part of}} the state. In the north these rains support a wide variety of spring annuals and wildflowers, but the water they supply in the south of the state is still important to help replenish wells.|$|E
25|$|Grüner Veltliner is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with Austria where {{it is the most}} widely planted grape variety in the country, covering almost a third of all Austrian vineyards, with 17,034 hectares (42,092 acres) in cultivation in 2012. The grape is authorized in five Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) regions—the Weinviertel where it is the only permitted grape variety; Leithaberg where it can be made as a varietal or blended with Pinot blanc, Chardonnay and Neuburger; Traisental, Kremstal and Kamptal where it is planted with Riesling. The grape is also found in the Donauland (now known as the Wagram region) and in the Wachau region of Lower Austria. Along the Danube river warm air currents <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the Pannonian Basin to the east and blow westward, warming the vines. This area tends to produce more full bodied wines with peach flavor notes.|$|E

25|$|Rams (embolon) were {{fitted to}} the prows of warships, and {{were used to}} rupture the hull of the enemy ship. The {{preferred}} method of attack was to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> astern, with the aim not of creating a single hole, but of rupturing as big a length of the enemy vessel as possible. The speed necessary for a successful impact depended on the angle of attack; the greater the angle, the lesser the speed required. At 60 degrees, 4 knots was enough to penetrate the hull, while it increased to 8 knots at 30 degrees. If the target for some reason was in motion {{in the direction of}} the attacker, even less speed was required, and especially if the hit came amidships. The Athenians especially became masters in the art of ramming, using light, un-decked (aphraktai) triremes.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN needed {{will depend on}} what the winemaker's goals are for fermentation, {{particularly}} whether or not wild fermentation is desired or if the wine will be fully fermented to dryness. The state of the grapes and the conditions of fermentation will influence the amount of nitrogen needed. Fruit that is damaged, moldy or botrytis infected will usually be more depleted of nitrogen (as well as other vitamin resources) when they <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the vineyard than clean, intact grapes. This depletion can be further exacerbated by over clarification of the must and high sugar content. Wines fermented at higher temperatures tend to progress at a faster rate, requiring more nitrogen than longer, cooler fermentation. Also the amount of oxygen exposure will influence the rate of nitrogen uptake by the yeast with wine fermented in complete anaerobic conditions (such as many white wines in stainless steel tanks) requiring less nitrogen than wines fermented in barrels or open top fermentors.|$|E
25|$|E. V. Ramasami (affectionately called Periyar by the Tamilians) {{came with}} his wife Nagamma {{and a group of}} {{followers}} and offered Satyagraha on 14 April. As the head of the Satyagraha, Periyar was imprisoned twice. Gandhi, who was also present on the Vaikom scene, was disturbed about the whole affair but seemingly unable to stop it. His concern grew when other religious groups became involved. Thus the Sikh community offered to meet expenses. Money was also said to have <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Burma, Singapore, and Malaysia, from non-Brahmin immigrants, Muslims and Christians. Gandhi tried under the circumstances to keep the whole thing an intra-Hindu affair. However, in the end a compromise was reached. The streets in the temple area were opened to Harijans or Untouchables. In 1936, they were allowed to enter the temple. The Satyagraha paved the way for subsequent Temple Entry Act.|$|E
