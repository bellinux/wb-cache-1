5|$|A lone Japanese {{soldier was}} able to fire off three mortar rounds toward the main gate. Although members of F Company quickly located the soldier and killed him, several Rangers, Scouts, and POWs were wounded in the attack. Battalion surgeon Capt. James Fisher was mortally injured in the stomach and was <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearby village of Balincari. Scout Alfred Alfonso had a {{shrapnel}} wound to his abdomen. Scout Lt. Tom Rounsaville and Ranger Pvt. 1st Class Jack Peters were also wounded by the barrage.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} ecclesiastics died at or {{shortly after the}} council, {{including}} Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, who fell ill {{on the third day}} of the council and died on either 14 or 16 April 1148. The Bishop of Angouleme died in June, after attending the council. The Archbishop of Trier, Albero de Montreuil, was so ill he was <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> council on a horse litter.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells, which are <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface. Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated by simple filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E

5|$|Drones {{can also}} mate with {{existing}} queens by entering a foreign colony. When the drone is initially {{attacked by the}} workers, it releases a mating pheromone. If recognized as a mate, it will be <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> queen to mate. Males may also patrol the nest and fight others by grabbing them with their mandibles, piercing their exoskeleton and then marking them with a pheromone. The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E

5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement. Stein however appeared {{to think that the}} final whistle had been blown, as he rose from his seat and began to make his way towards the Welsh bench to shake hands with England. However, as he got up, he then fell to his knees before collapsing to the ground. He was immediately <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stadium's medical room where attempts were made to resuscitate him.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} were advanced. Some {{surmised that}} the money had been found at a distant location by someone (or possibly even a wild animal), <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river bank, and reburied there. The sheriff of Cowlitz County proposed that Cooper accidentally dropped a few bundles on the airstair, which then blew off the aircraft and fell into the Columbia River. One local newspaper editor theorized that Cooper, knowing he could never spend the money, dumped it in the river, or buried portions of it at Tina Bar (and possibly elsewhere) himself. No hypothesis offered to date satisfactorily explains all of the existing evidence.|$|E

5|$|Cool air, <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ground by}} {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow {{until they reach}} their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E

5|$|Insect wing {{muscle is}} a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes fuel and oxygen at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly organized tissue so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The fuel and oxygen rich blood is <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} the high level of energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of fuel and oxygen from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the liquid phase and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island by winds {{and their own}} power. Some were {{believed to have been}} blown across {{from as far away as}} mainland Europe. Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. When a large, grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E
5|$|Material worn {{from the}} margins of the land {{eventually}} ends up in the sea, where it is subject to attrition as currents flowing parallel to the coast scour out channels and transport material away from its place of origin. Sediment <b>carried</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea by rivers settles on the seabed causing deltas to form in estuaries. All these materials move back and forth under the influence of waves, tides, and currents. Dredging removes material and deepens channels but may have unexpected effects elsewhere on the coastline. Governments make efforts to prevent flooding through building breakwaters, seawalls, and other defenses against the sea. In Britain, the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surges, while the failure of the dykes and levees around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina created a humanitarian crisis in the United States. Land reclamation in Hong Kong permitted the construction of Hong Kong International Airport through the leveling and expansion of two smaller islands.|$|E
