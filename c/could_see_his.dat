5|$|Galileo made {{original}} {{contributions to}} the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E
25|$|For the Moon race, Korolev's staff {{started to}} design the immense N1 rocket in 1961, using the {{unreliable}} NK-15 liquid fuel rocket engine. He also {{was working on the}} design for the Soyuz spacecraft that was intended to carry crews to LEO and to the Moon. As well, Korolev was designing the Luna series of vehicles that would soft-land on the Moon and make robotic missions to Mars and Venus. Unexpectedly, he died in January 1966, before he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> various plans brought to fruition.|$|E
25|$|Valentino went {{on strike}} for financially based reasons. At {{the time of his}} lawsuit against the studio, Valentino was earning $1,250 per week, with an {{increase}} to $3,000 after three years. This was $7,000 per week less than Mary Pickford made in 1916. He was also upset over the broken promise of filming Blood and Sand in Spain, and the failure to shoot the next proposed film in either Spain or at least New York. Valentino had hoped while filming in Europe he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> family, whom he had not seen in 10 years.|$|E

25|$|Robin's mother {{comes back}} on a leave from her spy duties to help care for Robin until {{the birth of her}} grandchild. Patrick realizes what Robin and this baby truly mean to him and knows that he wants them to be a family {{in every sense of the}} word, but Robin still has concerns. Although Robin states that Patrick <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully {{committed}} or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony does she realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees.|$|E
25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no one <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act {{as if he wanted to}} send them a message.|$|E
500|$|Before {{going to}} sleep, the crew took {{a phone call}} from President Barack Obama, who congratulated them on their {{successful}} mission, joked with them, asking if they <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> house in Chicago, and expressed his pride in the crew. Obama told the crew, [...] "Like a lot of Americans, I've been watching with amazement the gorgeous images you've been sending back, and the incredible repair mission you've been making in space," [...] he said. [...] "I think you're providing a wonderful example of the kind of dedication and commitment to exploration that represents America and the space program generally. These are traits that have always made this country strong, and all of you personify them." ...|$|E

500|$|Zakaria Mohieddin, who was Nasser's vice president, {{said that}} Nasser {{gradually}} changed during his reign. He ceased consulting his colleagues and made {{more and more}} of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said [...] that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, in 1967 he started a bluffing game [...] "but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser's opponent <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces" [...] and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. [...] "All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes... That was the only rational explanation for his actions in 1967".|$|E
500|$|When asked before {{publication}} {{about the}} forthcoming book, Rowling stated {{that she could}} not change the ending even if she wanted. [...] "These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they're all leading a certain direction. So, I really can't". She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, [...] "almost as though they are two-halves of the same novel". She has said that the last chapter of the book was written [...] "in something like 1990", as part of her earliest work on the series. Rowling also revealed she originally wrote the last words to be [...] "something like: 'Only those who he loved <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> lightning scar. Rowling changed this because she did not want people to think Voldemort would rise again and to say that Harry's mission was over.|$|E
500|$|The club {{were drawn}} in Group H, along with UEFA Cup holders Sevilla, Slavia Prague of the Czech Republic and Romania's Steaua București. Arsenal started their {{campaign}} in good stead, beating Sevilla 3–0 {{and followed the}} result with a 1–0 victory against Steaua București. Against Slavia Prague at the Emirates, Arsenal equalled their best ever victory in a European competition, scoring seven goals. Walcott, who scored his first two goals {{of the season in}} the match, earned the praise of manager Wenger: [...] "Once Theo scored his first, you saw him much more. When they opened up the space, you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> runs and pace, and the fact he is clinical in front of goal." [...] Qualification into the knockout stages was ensured with a draw away to Slavia Prague on 7 November 2007. Defeat against Sevilla at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium was Arsenal's first loss since April 2007, ending a run of 28 matches undefeated in all competitions. The result moved them down into second place, and in spite of winning their final group match against Steaua at home, Arsenal ended two points behind group winners Sevilla.|$|E

500|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} Duncan's orders was to split his fleet into two uneven divisions, each sailing {{in a loose}} formation towards the unified Dutch line. The northern, or windward, division comprised six third rate ships of the line, two fourth rate ships and the frigate Circe, tasked with repeating signals from the flagship Venerable, which led the division with [...] and [...] close behind. This force was aiming for the Dutch flagship, Vrijheid, which lay fifth in the Dutch line. The southern, or leeward, division comprised eight third rate ships {{of the line and}} the repeater frigate , and was led by Vice-Admiral Richard Onslow on [...] Onslow's force was aiming for the rear of the Dutch line, to strike the fourth ship from the end. Behind the two divisions lay a line of small craft tasked with repeating Duncan's signals so that the entire fleet <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> intentions. At 11:53, Duncan raised the signal for each ship to pass through the Dutch line and attack from the far side, but the poor weather prevented the more distant ships from recognising the signal.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started {{to make sure he}} <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on it was so easy for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
500|$|Universal spent $1.8 million {{promoting}} Jaws, {{including an}} unprecedented $700,000 {{on national television}} spot advertising. The media blitz included about two dozen 30-second advertisements airing each night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later. Beyond that, {{in the description of}} film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal [...] "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" [...] for the picture's marketing. As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film. The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the film. The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams's theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer. The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel. The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that [...] "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough". Seiniger ultimately decided that [...] "you had to actually go underneath the shark so you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> teeth." ...|$|E

500|$|Other Enterprise {{crew members}} include the ship's first officer William Riker, played by {{director}} Jonathan Frakes. Frakes {{said he did}} not have much difficulty directing and acting at the same time, having done so on the television series. Brent Spiner portrays the android Data; rumors before the film's release suggested that since Data's skin had been largely removed {{at the end of the}} story, it would allow another actor to assume the role. LeVar Burton plays Geordi La Forge, the ship's chief engineer. La Forge is a blind character, and for the television series and previous film had worn a special visor to see. Burton lobbied for many years to have his character's visor replaced so that people <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> eyes, since the [...] "air filter" [...] he wore prevented the audience from seeing his eyes and limited his acting ability. Moore finally agreed, giving the character ocular implants that were never explained in the film, beyond showing they were artificial. Gates McFadden plays Beverly Crusher, the ship's doctor. McFadden considered Star Trek women finally on par with the men: [...] "We've come a long way since Majel Barrett was stuck in the sick bay as Nurse Chapel in the [...] and made to dye her hair blond." [...] Crusher was instrumental in helping Picard set the auto-destruct sequence, to prevent the Borg from completely assimilating the Enterprise and Earth. Ship's counselor Deanna Troi is portrayed by Marina Sirtis. The actress missed working on the television show, and was acutely aware that expectations and stakes for First Contact were high: [...] "we were scared that people thought we couldn't cut it without the original cast", she said. Other Starfleet members included former Enterprise chief of security, and commander of the USS Defiant, Worf (Michael Dorn). The Defiant is badly damaged in the battle with the Borg but is left salvageable. An early screenplay draft called for the Defiant to be destroyed, but Deep Space Nine executive producer Ira Steven Behr objected to the destruction of his show's ship and so the idea was dropped. Neal McDonough plays Hawk, the Enterprise helmsman who aids in the defense of the ship until he is assimilated and killed. McDonough was cavalier about his role as an expendable [...] "redshirt", saying that since one of the characters in the deflector dish battle had to die, [...] "that would be me".|$|E

2500|$|During the interval, Spofforth made an {{announcement}} to his team-mates in the dressing-room: [...] "This thing can be done.!" [...] In spite of being reduced to fifteen for two early on, England {{made a good}} start in its pursuit of a victory target of 85. The score rose to 51 for two, with Grace and Ulyett hitting out strongly. Spofforth changed ends, and Neville Cardus wrote thus of this move: [...] "Now I was behind his arm; I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> superb break-back. And he bowled mainly medium pace at this time. With each off-break I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> right hand, {{at the end of}} the swing over, finish near the left side, 'cutting' under the ball. Sometimes his arm went straight over and continued straight down in the follow-through – and then the batsmen had to tackle fierce topspin. There was the sense of the inimical in his aspect now. He seemed taller than he was half an hour ago, the right arm more sinuous. There was no excitement in him he was ... cold-blooded." ...|$|E
