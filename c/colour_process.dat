40|$|Colourisation is a <b>process</b> {{of adding}} <b>colour</b> {{information}} onto a monochrome image or video frame. The advancement in digital computing technology reduces the tedious manual <b>colouring</b> <b>process.</b> The common colourisation process normally involves image segmentation and colouring of each segmented region. Both tasks required user interaction {{either in the}} image segmentation process or in the <b>colouring</b> <b>process.</b> Recent development of colourisation technique eliminates the trouble of precise image segmentation process by limiting the colour flow along the object boundary through the luminance intensity anlaysis...|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s Higgins {{operated}} with Neville Bletcher {{the production}} company, Solarchrome Color Productions, at 300 Pitt st, Sydney, with studio at St Johns Road, Glebe NSW (1). Solarchrome {{was his own}} adaptation of a bi-pack (two tints) <b>colour</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born as the {{youngest}} of five daughters in Boston, Massachusetts, Murdoch turned to photography in the 1890s after first training as an artist.

25|$|This step also {{provides}} a herbal complexity that is typical of high quality absinthe. The natural <b>colouring</b> <b>process</b> is considered critical for absinthe ageing, since the chlorophyll remains chemically active. The chlorophyll serves a similar role in absinthe that tannins do in wine or brown liquors.|$|R

50|$|In cinematography, bipacking, or a bipack, is {{the process}} of loading two reels of film into a camera, so that they both pass through the camera gate together. It was used both for in-camera effects (effects that are {{nowadays}} mainly achieved via optical printing) and as an early subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Verte ("green" [...] in French) absinthe {{begins as}} a blanche. The blanche is altered by the {{colouring}} step, by which a separate mixture of herbs is steeped into the clear distillate. This confers a peridot green hue and an intense flavour. Vertes represent the prevailing type of absinthe that {{was found in the}} 19th century. Artificially coloured green absinthes may also claimed to be verte, though they lack the characteristic herbal flavours that result from the <b>colouring</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

50|$|Ludwig Blattner {{was also}} {{involved}} in an early colour motion picture process: in about 1929 he bought the rights for the use outside the USA of a lenticular <b>colour</b> <b>process</b> called Keller-Dorian cinematography. This process was then known as the Blattner Keller-Dorian process, which lost out to rival colour systems.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{a method}} {{proposed}} in 1869 by Louis Ducos du Hauron in Les Couleurs en Photographie - Solution du Probleme, the Joly <b>colour</b> <b>process</b> used a glass photographic plate with fine vertical red, {{green and blue}} lines less than 0.1 mm wide printed on them.

50|$|The School for Scandal is a 1930 British comedy film {{directed}} by Thorold Dickinson and Maurice Elvey and starring Basil Gill, Madeleine Carroll and Ian Fleming.

50|$|Joly also {{invented a}} {{photometer}} for measuring light intensity, a meldometer {{for measuring the}} melting points of minerals, a differential steam calorimeter for measuring specific heats and a constant-volume gas thermometer, all of which bear his name, together {{with one of the}} first color photographic processes, the Joly <b>Colour</b> <b>process.</b> It was the first successful process for producing color images from a single photographic plate.|$|E

30|$|The {{ligation}} product-contained DNA nanotubes were diluted 103 folds in TAE–Mg 2 + buffer (pH 8). Then, 5  μl diluted {{sample was}} immobilized on the HOPG by drying for 3  h {{at room temperature}} [18]. The samples were imaged using topographic mode with STM, with 0.1  nA current set point and 0.2  V sample bias through a platinum iridium tip. Rough data were first processed using line adjust, plain adjust and average filters of the NAMA-STM Nanoanalyzer software. Then, the <b>colouring</b> <b>process</b> was tested on the obtained micrographs for different levels [19].|$|R
40|$|For two {{photochromic}} isopropyl-thiophenefulgides {{a complete}} photokinetic analysis is given. For one compound (5 b), the partial quantum yield for the <b>colouring</b> <b>process</b> (&# 934;EC = 54 %) {{is the highest}} value found for thiophenefulgides. EZ-isomerisations do not play an important role. The colouring quantum yield is temperature independent down to 20 K, whereas bleaching requires little thermal activation. In case of an adamantylidene substituted isopropyl-thiophenefulgide (5 c), the bleaching efficiency (&# 934;CE = 31 %) is very high. Upon heating of the cyclic products, thermal bleaching occurs with an activation energy of 1 eV...|$|R
