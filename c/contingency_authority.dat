While, undoubtedly there are other mechanisms that contribute to state formation and political development, the ideas of improvement of both person and nature permeated nineteenth-century America. Although internal improvements served to connect markets and aid {{the development of a}} national economy, the projects presented new obstacles for individuals, challenged previous business practices, and helped redefine the roles of state and federal governments. Such projects also provided cases that challenged English common law traditions and aided in the emergence of a distinct American legal system. While not all of the internal improvement projects were completed and operational, the efforts themselves provided the mechanism of change and development. In fact, ongoing negotiations over control highlights the role of local, state, and regional internal improvement projects in defining the relationships between individuals, corporations, and governments in nineteenth-century America. These changes are highlighted through relations and authority between states or territories and the national government, the states and their citizens, the national government and it citizens, between states, within the same levels of government, and public and private matters. In highlighting the role of the natural resources, specifically water and its relation with society, this dissertation will first examine the intellectual origins of improvement, the integration of improvement into empowering a positive government, and the formative role of water-based transportation in the development of nineteenth-century America. For a more acute examination of the transformative role that harnessing water for transportation served in the formation of nineteenth century America, I turn to three water-based improvement projects, The Louisville and Portland Canal, The Illinois and Michigan Canal, and the Des Moines River Improvement Project. Each case provided an environment of political, economic, and social negotiations that resulted in the institutionalization of positive government, economic development, and societal development...|$|E

To answer this question, this article adopts a sociological approach and method which go beyond current political science narratives about regional democracies. To study how choices over participatory democracy are mediated, we locate an 'observatory site'—the Regional Government Site—and examine interactions and strategies of actors therein. When {{applied to the}} institutionalization of citizens' juries in Rhnes-Alpes, our approach reveals how, through the resolution of <b>contingencies,</b> regional <b>authorities</b> become producers of participatory democracy. Organizational struggles combined with ideological struggles over visions of democracy transformed the region into a space for politics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims to {{contribute}} to Western theology by exploring plurality as well as unity within Christianity. By looking {{at the history of}} orthodoxy as a narrative construction of identity, I argue that Christian identity is not based on doxa, dogma, or practises. Instead, I suggest that Christian identity should be rooted primarily as a practise in the experience of and participation with God through the living Christ. I propose that ecumenical unity is not ecclesial or doxalogical but rather practical because unity is achieved when groups act together and participate in each other without ceasing to be different. I explore in my first chapter the philosophical concepts (time and narrative) which form the basis of identity. I introduce the thoughts of G. Deleuze and P. Ricœur separately before bringing them together in a dialogue. The dialogue develops the concepts of time and narrative into a general theory for constructing identity. I analyse identity in the second chapter by reading historical reactions to I. Kant's conception of a permanent identity because Kant is a central focus in contemporary philosophical thought on identity. Inspired by the dialogue between Deleuze and Ricœur introduced previously, I construct a new approach to identity. My concept of identity can be applied equally to individuals and groups, however I primarily follow group identity in my thesis. My third chapter applies this theory of identity to the discussion of the concept of orthodoxy. I present a model for interpreting orthodoxy in terms of group identity, then I trace the history of orthodoxy in three general periods: the early Church, the Reformation era, and our contemporary period. I show that concerns with theological truth in questions of orthodoxy were often politicised and used to establish an authority to control Christian identity. During the Reformations, reforms were treated as questions of authority and at times resulted in exclusion rather than reform. Political moves subsequently created multiple authorities which I suggest reveal the <b>contingency</b> of <b>authority.</b> Since the nineteenth century, groups approached Christian unity without addressing the implications of <b>authority's</b> <b>contingency.</b> In my fourth chapter, I pursue the question of ecumenical unity by interpreting authorities as created and embedded in particular contexts which render impossible a single, universal authority. In contrast to a singular definition of the Church, I argue that Pauline images of the body of Christ shape Christian identity as polydox. My model of relating differences within unity reveals the extent to which many theological 'controversies' still are politicised. Finally, I argue that the ecumenical dialogue overlaps with inter-religious and 'secular' dialogues, both of which are necessary for the Church's work on identity as organic unity...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} a group of adults with high {{functioning}} autism (HFA) or Asperger Syndrome (AS) to distinguish moral, conventional and disgust transgressions was investigated using a set of six transgression scenarios, each of which was followed by questions about permissibility, seriousness, <b>authority</b> <b>contingency</b> and justification. The results showed that although individuals with HFA or AS (HFA/AS) were able to distinguish affect-backed norms from conventional affect-neutral norms along the dimensions of permissibility, seriousness and authority-dependence, they failed to distinguish moral and disgust transgressions along the seriousness dimension and were unable to provide appropriate welfare-based moral justifications. Moreover, they judged conventional and disgust transgressions to be more serious than did the comparison group, and the correlation analysis revealed that the seriousness rating was related to their ToM impairment. We concluded that difficulties providing appropriate moral justifications and evaluating the seriousness of transgressions in individuals with HFA/AS may be explained by an impaired cognitive appraisal system that, while responsive to rule violations, fails to use relevant information about the agent’s intentions and the affective impact of the action outcome in conscious moral reasoning...|$|R

To start with, it identified the major problems associated with the Global financial crisis and its effects on the Nigeria economy. As the crisis affect trade and investment flows, the Nigerian money market have so far triggered a rebound and allayed panic about the systemic financial collapse. The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) technique of regression analysis was adopted in analyzing the empirical data for Non-crisis period from 2000 - 2005 and the crisis period from 2006 - 2009 after necessary adjustment were carried out on the relevant data. Money supply/Gross Domestic Product (which stands as proxy for the impact of the Global financial meltdown) serves as the dependent variable while other money market indicators (TBs, CPs, Bas, CDs, BLR and INF) serve as the explanatory variables in the first and second models. The findings from the empirical analysis showed that in the non-crisis era (2000 - 2005) the explanatory variables all met apriori expectation. However, in the crisis era, only the coefficient of inflation retained its apriori sign. This implies that economic activities were adversely affected by the global financial meltdown as seen in the adverse effect on financial deepening. This in turn has a corresponding effect on the Nigerian money market, thus dis-stabilizing its indicators. This {{can be attributed to the}} failure of the Nigerian money market regulator to fulfill its primary responsibilities of supplying needed funds to critical sectors where such funds are needed during the period of financial crisis. This study therefore recommends that adequate procedures for handling systemic crisis should be drawn up promptly in preparation for <b>contingencies.</b> Monetary <b>authorities</b> should identify the vulnerabilities of the money market and safeguard its effectiveness as a means of reducing the further effects of the financial meltdown on Nigerian economy at large. </p...|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to moral {{political}} endeavors, the good eventually achieved is never identical to the good initially pursued. This is true {{if for no other}} reason than the fact that time passes with every new political moment. We move from goods intended to goods achieved. At the same time such movement is not simply a product of the temporal character of our lives. Occupying a middle ground between accounts of human agency as wholly determined or wholly ambiguous there is a sense in which any exercise of the will is fundamentally indeterminate. Said more simply, we are contingent beings. Thus, while it may be possible to speak conceptually of a determinate or atemporal political good, the possibility of a moral political endeavor – that is, a purposive movement toward some political good – rests upon the inescapably contingent and temporal character of our lives. If political endeavors are never entirely under (or out of) our control and always take shape temporally then it is important to insist that the discrepancy between intended goods and actual goods need not be interpreted negatively. That is to say, the indeterminate character of our moral lives need not be seen as a tragic disruption to what would otherwise be seamless political existence. Rather, the indeterminacy is a deliberate (read: good) feature of created existence in time. This allows for recognition of a structure to political morality. Agents seize the opportunity afforded by contingency to pursue identified political goods with purpose and direction. At the same time moral pursuits are always highly conditioned by <b>contingencies</b> of delimited <b>authority,</b> responsibilities of representation, demands of process, etc. The constantly changing political landscape perpetually requires both reactive and anticipatory adjustments of the political good in sight. If contingency and temporality shape and limit any political pursuit of the good, then a chief task of political theology is to illuminate the theological significance of those features of created existence. Political theology bears the burden of articulating the divine origin and purpose of the structures which make political morality possible. In this way contingency comes into view not as an incidental feature of humanity but as the gift of a good creator making possible faithful creaturely response. Similarly, political goods take shape not merely in time but in a particular time between creation and eschaton. This thesis is a study in the theological significance of indeterminacy and temporality in the pursuit of political goods by way of an analysis of the political writings of 20 th century moral theologian Paul Ramsey. His reflections on the unique moral structure of political actions provide the theological and analytical resources to animate such a study. Close attention to his work pursues an understanding of how theological language describes, interprets and accounts for the nature of political morality and the function that such descriptions have in defining and shaping concepts of the political good.
