25|$|Believed to be a {{stowaway}} on a U.S. military transport {{near the}} end of World War II, the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) was accidentally introduced to Guam, which previously had no native species of snake. It nearly eliminated the native bird population. The problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island. The brown tree snake, known locally as the kulebla, is native to northern and eastern coasts of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands. It is slightly venomous, but relatively harmless to human beings; it is nocturnal. Although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on Guam, residents rarely see them. The United States Department of Agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the island's <b>cargo</b> <b>flow.</b> The United States Geological Survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the region's islands.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{information}} technologies and market requirements in effective control over <b>cargo</b> <b>flows,</b> forces enterprises {{to look for}} new ways and methods of automated control over the technological operations. For rail transportation {{one of the most}} complicated tasks of automation is the <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> distribution over the sites of loading and unloading. In this article the solution with the use of one of the methods of artificial intelligence – a fuzzy inference has been proposed. The analysis of the last publications showed that the fuzzy inference method is effective for the solution of similar tasks, it makes it possible to accumulate experience, it is stable to temporary impacts of the environmental conditions. The existing methods of the <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> distribution over the sites of loading and unloading are too simplified and can lead to incorrect decisions. The purpose of the article is to create a distribution model of <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> of the enterprises over the sites of loading and unloading, basing on the fuzzy inference method and to automate the control. To achieve the objective a mathematical model of the <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> distribution over the sites of loading and unloading has been made using fuzzy logic. The key input parameters of the model are: «number of loading sites», «arrival of the next set of cars», «availability of additional operations». The output parameter is «a variety of set of cars». Application of the fuzzy inference method made it possible to reduce loading time by 15 % and to reduce costs for preparatory operations before loading by 20 %. Thus this method is an effective means and holds the greatest promise for railway competitiveness increase. Interaction between different types of transportation and their influence on the <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> distribution over the sites of loading and unloading hasn’t been considered. These sites may be busy transshipping at that very time which is characteristic of large enterprises.

The similar economical, {{social and cultural}} background of Finland and Estonia {{as well as the}} EU integration give good preconditions to create a twin-city of Helsinki and Tallinn. The relatively long distance between Helsinki and Tallinn is challenging. Therefore, good transport infrastructure and functioning connections are required to form a twin-city of Helsinki and Tallinn. The connections between these cities can be considered also in broader perspective than only from the viewpoint of the twin-city concept. New markets areas have been emerged in Europe due to collapse of planned economy and integration of Europe. Also the transport routes to the markets are changing. The Hel-sinki-Tallinn sea route can be considered as a fast route to the new markets in the Cen-tral and Eastern Europe. The Helsinki-Tallinn sea route is also a potential route to the Western European markets. This study provides an analysis of transport and <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> between Finland and Esto-nia for regional and local planners. The main purpose of the study is to clarify the pre-sent situation of the seaborne <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and how the <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> will develop in the future. The study focuses on the following thematic enti-ties: the Finnish and Estonian seaborne transport system and <b>cargo</b> <b>flows,</b> the structure and volume of the <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> on the Helsinki-Tallinn route, the hinterland <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> on the Helsinki-Tallinn route and the transport methods used on the Helsinki-Tallinn route. The study was carried out as a desk research, a statistical analysis and an inter-view study during the spring–autumn 2011. The study reveals that during the period 2002 – 2010 the volume of the seaborne cargo traffic between Finland and Estonia has increased significantly while the trend of the trade volume between Finland and Estonia has remained nearly constant. This indicates that the route via Estonia is increasingly used in the Finnish foreign trade. Because the ports of Helsinki and Tallinn are the main ports in the cargo traffic between Finland and Estonia, the role of the Helsinki-Tallinn route as a sea leg in the hinterland connections of Finland has increased. The growth of the cargo volume on the Helsinki-Tallinn route was estimated to continue on the annual level of 10 % during the next couple of years. In the long run the growth of the cargo volumes depends on the economical and indus-trial development of the former Eastern European countries. If the IMO’s sulphur regu-lations will come in force, the Helsinki-Tallinn route will become one of the main routes also to the Western European markets, besides of the route via Sweden. The study also shows that the fast and reliable connections year round on the Helsinki-Tallinn route have made it possible for service and logistics companies to reconsider their logistics strategies in a new way in the both side of the Gulf of Finland. Anyway, the ropax concept is seen as the only economical profitable solution on the Helsinki-Tallinn route because cargo and passenger traffic are supporting each other. The trucks (vehicle combinations) will remain the main mode of transport on the Helsinki-Tallinn route because general cargo is the main commodity on the route.

The share changes of major Japanese ports for handling international container cargo indicated that only the Kobe port experienced significant volume reduction. However, port market areas have greatly changed in the last 20 years. Major ports lost shares of neighbouring market areas and gained small shares of remote areas (i. e. from regional ports). In contrast, regional ports groups expanded their market area beyond their regional areas. These structural changes to port market area differ between export and import cargo.

(Dataset D 0095 contains the data collected on the port of Antwerp.) The statistics offer detailed time-series on international <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> passing through Rotterdam. Cargo shipped to and from the port by domestic short-sea shipping is not registered by the sources, because in this kind of transport no border is crossed. Furthermore, like sea-borne transport, only hinterland transport from and to Rotterdam that has a foreign origin or destination is registered in the available statistical series. In other words, not all maritime-related hinterland transport is registered: transports within the Netherlands are missing. On the other hand, the hinterland data also contain <b>cargo</b> <b>flows</b> that have no relation with sea-borne transport to and from Rotterdam at all. It is not possible to assess the volume of these so-called continental transports. They consist for instance of exports by Rotterdam manufacturing firms to neighbouring European countries.

It implies that it is not possible to match the sea-borne traffic with the hinterland transports or, in other words, to assess the total modal split in hinterland transport of cargo that is shipped to and from Rotterdam by sea.
