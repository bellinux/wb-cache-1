50|$|The International Scientific Forum on Home Hygiene has {{developed}} a risk management approach to reducing home infection risks. This approach uses microbiological and epidemiological evidence to identify the key routes of infection transmission in the home. These data indicate that the critical routes involve the hands, hand and food contact surfaces and <b>cleaning</b> <b>utensils.</b> Clothing and household linens involve somewhat lower risks. Surfaces that contact the body, such as baths and hand basins, can act as infection vehicles, as can surfaces associated with toilets. Airborne transmission can be important for some pathogens. A key aspect {{of this approach is}} that it maximises protection against pathogens and infection, but is more relaxed about visible cleanliness in order to sustain normal exposure to other human, animal and environmental microbes.|$|E

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{the design of}} malaria prevention and control programs in tropical Africa, a qualitative investigation of treatment seeking behaviors and perceptions of the causes and symptoms of malaria was conducted {{in a rural area}} in South Western Uganda's Masaka District. Components of the investigation included focus group discussions involving 42 participants recruited from women's clubs and prenatal and child health clinics, semi-structured interviews with 395 female outpatients 13 years of age and above and adult women escorting young children to government subdispensaries for treatment of a new malaria episode, and household interviews with 64 mothers. In this rural community, there is no specific word for malaria; rather, the word "omusujja" is used to refer to malarial symptoms as well as any kind of fever. Respondents consistently identified omusujja as the most prevalent, serious disease in their community. They linked its causation to food and drink, environmental conditions, vectors such as mosquitoes, and other illnesses. There was widespread awareness that omusujja presents differently according to age group, e. g. fever, refusal to suck, crying, vomiting, and mouth sores in infants as compared to miscarriage, vomiting, weakness, chills, and joint pain in pregnant women. Treatment is initiated promptly, although it mainly consists of use of local herbs; if the herbs fail to reduce the fever, hospital care is sought. Preventive methods cited included boiling water, <b>cleaning</b> cooking <b>utensils,</b> avoiding raw mangoes and roasted maize, and keeping mosquitoes out of the home.

Methods: A total of 216 women {{were selected from}} a women's center and a selected district by trained volunteers for a single interview using convenience sampling; 63 respondents had paid work and 153 were full-time homemakers. The study included a surveillance of self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms for the past 12 months and a time use log to report respondents' daily activities retrospectively during a 24 -h reference day. Results: Significant {{differences were found in}} the mean hours spent in paid work, outdoor activities, and passive leisure between respondents with paid and those with unpaid work (P = 0. 000 - 0. 021). Although the reported musculoskeletal problems were mostly mild to moderate, more than 60 % of homemakers experienced at least one musculoskeletal symptom over the spine or upper or lower extremities in the 12 months prior to the survey. Homemakers {{were more likely to report}} discomfort in their upper back (OR = 2. 70, 95 % CI 1. 27 - 5. 71) and shoulder (OR = 3. 50, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 10. 19) while shopping; in their lower back (OR = 1. 90, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 3. 50), wrist (OR = 2. 02, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 3. 84), and hip (OR = 2. 35, 95 % CI 1. 07 - 5. 13) while washing utensils; and in their finger (OR = 1. 45, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 2. 03) and knee (OR = 1. 84, 95 % CI 1. 19 - 2. 82) during cleaning tasks.

40|$|Former {{studies of}} water quality in {{southwest}} Morocco shows that some water {{sources in the}} rural region of Agadir are affected by intrusion bringing chemical values above normal in drinking water of the villagers. In this study, I want to investigate if the intrusion also creates increasing exposure of microorganisms and water borne diseases among the villagers. In a field- study, face to face interviews following a questionnaire were used to gather socioeconomic, clinical and water use information about the subjects living in the study area. Water sampling was made in 10 rural areas around Agadir. PH, conductivity and temperature were measured directly at the water locations. These parameters were re-measured at the chemical laboratory of Ibn Zohr University using traditional analytical methods. Additional chemical analysis (Bicarbonate, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Sulfate, Nitrate, and Chlorine) were also made at the university. The bacterial analysis (microorganisms at 22 ºC and 37 ºC, Coliform bacteria, Echerichia coli, Intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfingens) was made with the same water sampling approach as the chemical analysis adding 1 random urban district for comparison. Water samples for bacterial analysis were analyzed within 24 hours at Veto lab using ISO methods according to NM 7899 - 2, 6461 - 2, 9308 - 1, and 6222. The results show that all rural water samples according to the guidelines for drinking water are classified as non- drinkable and the urban water sample is classified as drinkable.

40|$|The growing street food {{sector in}} low-income {{countries}} offers {{easy access to}} inexpensive food {{as well as new}} job opportunities for urban residents. While this development is positive in many ways, it also presents new public health challenges for the urban population. Safe food hygiene is difficult to practice at street level, and outbreaks of diarrheal diseases have been linked to street food. This study investigates local perceptions of food safety among street food vendors and their consumers in Kumasi, Ghana in order to identify the most important aspects to be included in future public health interventions concerning street food safety. This qualitative study includes data from a triangulation of various qualitative methods. Observations at several markets and street food vending sites in Kumasi were performed. Fourteen street food vendors were chosen for in-depth studies, and extensive participant observations and several interviews were carried out with case vendors. In addition, street interviews and Focus Group Discussions were carried out with street food customers. The study found that although vendors and consumers demonstrated basic knowledge of food safety, the criteria did not emphasize basic hygiene practices such as hand washing, <b>cleaning</b> of <b>utensils,</b> washing of raw vegetables, and quality of ingredients. Instead, four main food selection criteria could be identified and were related to (1) aesthetic appearance of food and food stand, (2) appearance of the food vendor, (3) interpersonal trust in the vendor, and (4) consumers often chose to prioritize price and accessibility of food—not putting much stress on food safety. Hence, consumers relied on risk avoidance strategies by assessing neatness, appearance, and trustworthiness of vendor. Vendors were also found to emphasize appearance while vending and to ignore core food safety practices while preparing food. These findings are discussed in this paper using social and anthropological theoretical concepts such as ‘purity’, ‘contamination’, ‘hygiene puzzles’, and ‘impression behaviors’ from Douglas, Van Der Geest, and Goffman. The findings indicate that educating vendors in safe food handling is evidently insufficient. Future public health interventions within the street food sector should give emphasis to the importance of appearance and neatness when designing communication strategies. Neglected aspects of food safety, such as good hand hygiene and cleanliness of kitchen facilities, should be emphasized. Local vendor networks can be an effective point of entry for future food hygiene promotion initiatives...|$|R

The analysis consisted of investigating hazards associated with microbial contamination and critical control points (CCPs) in the preparation and handling of foods in the schools. Food and water samples as well as swabs of food contact surfaces were collected in addition to animal droppings found in or near the food preparation areas and transported to the laboratory for further investigations. Enterotoxin production by Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli strains was performed on New Zealand white rabbits using the ileal loop technique. All the foods (akamu, eba, tuwo and vegetable soup) attained cooking temperatures of 60 – 100 oC capable of destroying vegetative forms of food borne pathogens. However, a concentration of 3 - 5 log 10 cells of B. cereus, 2 - 3 log 10 cells Staphylococcus aureus and 1 - 2 log 10 coliforms were isolated per 100 g/ml of some of the cooked foods. The water samples for drinking, cooking and washing dishes were contaminated with coliforms below 2 log 10 cells/ml. The food and water samples were found to have counts within acceptable limits but the isolation of enterotoxigenic strains of B. cereus and Escherichia coli, hazards such as inadequate (5 - 10 min) time/temperature exposure of foods (akamu, tuwo, eba), high level initial contamination associated with raw foods, food ingredients, food contact surfaces, food handlers and inadequate <b>cleaning</b> of food <b>utensils</b> call for concern.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim to study the extent and level of farm women awareness about climate variability and its effect on water resources. The {{study was conducted}} in three agro-climatic zones of Punjab, India. One district from each zone was selected purposively for the investigation. A sample of 120 randomly selected farm women was interviewed. The data was analyzed using appropriate statistical tools like frequency, percentages, mean weighted scores. Majority of the farm women (> 60 %) are fully aware that pollution, deforestation, paddy straw burning and cultivation of paddy are the reasons for climate change. Most of them (> 70 %) are fully aware that increase in temperature and variation in rainfall were due to change in climate. Majority of them (80 %) are fully aware that change in climate is leading to stress on water resources in Punjab and sixty per cent respondents perceived that more area under paddy cultivation was the major factor responsible for depleting groundwater. Most of the farm women (98 %) were fully aware that water is wasted while performing various household tasks like washing of clothes, <b>utensils,</b> <b>cleaning</b> the floor, bathing animals with water pipes etc. The study concluded that majority of the farm women (59 %) had medium level of awareness regarding reasons of climate change whereas most of them (80 %) had low level of awareness regarding factors accountable for depletion of water.
