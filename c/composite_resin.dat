As the price of glass fibers is only about one tenth the price of carbon fiber, glass fiber is still dominant.|$|E
40|$|Dentists are {{accustomed}} to advantages and disadvantages in the materials at their disposal. This article was concerned with one disadvantage of microfilled <b>composite</b> <b>resins,</b> namely, chip fractures. Probably due to their higher coefficient of thermal expansion, higher water sorption, higher polymerization shrinkage, and lower tensile strengths, cohesive as well as adhesive chip fractures occur {{three to four times}} more often with microfilled <b>composite</b> <b>resins</b> than with conventional <b>composite</b> <b>resins.</b> Microfilled <b>composite</b> <b>resins</b> are indicated for esthetic purposes. They are contraindicated for Class IV and stress-bearing restorations. They are indicated for limited use in Class I restorations where esthetics is of primary importance. The technique of use must include acid-etching and intermediate bonding. The microfilled <b>composite</b> <b>resins</b> enjoy a smooth finish and high luster.

50|$|In {{the late}} sixties, <b>composite</b> <b>resins</b> were {{introduced}} {{as an alternative}} to silicates and unfulfilled resins, which were frequently used by clinicians at the time. <b>Composite</b> <b>resins</b> displayed superior qualities, in that they had higher mechanical properties than silicates and unfulfilled <b>resins.</b> <b>Composite</b> <b>resins</b> were also seen to be beneficial in that the resin would be presented in paste form and, with convenient pressure or bulk insertion technique, would facilitate clinical handling. The faults with <b>composite</b> <b>resins</b> at this time were that they had poor aesthetics, poor marginal adaptation, difficulties with polishing, difficulty with adhesion to the tooth surface, and occasionally, loss of anatomical form.|$|R

25|$|Most {{of these}} materials, with the notable {{exception}} of gold, have not been used as long as amalgam, and some are known to contain other potentially hazardous compounds. Teaching of amalgam techniques to dental students is declining in some schools in favor of <b>composite</b> <b>resin,</b> {{and at least one}} school, University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands, eliminated dental amalgam from the curriculum entirely in 2001. This is largely a response to consumer pressure for white fillings for cosmetic reasons, and also because of the increasing longevity of modern resin composites. These alternative dental restorative materials are not free of potential health risks, such as allergenicity, inhalation of resin dust, cytotoxicity, and retinal damage from blue curing light.|$|E

[...] Composite restorations are not as strong as dental amalgam and gold; some dentists consider the latter as the only advisable restoration for posterior areas where chewing forces are great. [...] When the decay is too extensive, there may not be enough tooth structure remaining to allow a restorative material to be placed within the tooth. [...] Thus, a crown may be needed. [...] This restoration appears similar to a cap and is fitted over the remainder of the natural crown of the tooth. Crowns are often made of gold, porcelain, or porcelain fused to metal.|$|E

Currently, there is no available information regarding the repair potential of silorane <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> with either silorane or methacrylate based <b>resin</b> <b>composite.</b> Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the repaired microtensile bond strength of aged silorane <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> using different surface treatments and either silorane or methacrylate based <b>resin</b> <b>composite.</b> Methods: One hundred and eight silorane <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> blocks (Filtek LS) were fabricated and aged by thermocycling between 8 oC and 48 oC (5000 cycles). A control (solid <b>resin</b> <b>composite)</b> and four surface treatment groups (no treatment, acid treatment, aluminum oxide sandblasting and diamond bur abrasion) were tested. Each treatment group was randomly divided in half and repaired with either silorane <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> (LS adhesive) or methacrylate based <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> (Filtek Z 250 /Single Bond Plus). Specimens were 12 blocks and 108 beams per group. After 24 hours in 37 oC distilled water, microtensile bond strength testing was performed using a non-trimming technique. Fracture surfaces were examined using an optical microscopy (20 X) to determine failure mode. Data was analyzed using Weibull-distribution survival analysis. Results: Aluminum oxide sandblasting followed by silorane or methacrylate based <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> and acid treatment with methacrylate based <b>resin</b> <b>composite</b> provided insignificant differences from the control (p> 0. 05).
