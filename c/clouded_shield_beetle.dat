40|$|Throughout {{the study}} of ecology, {{there has been a}} growing {{realization}} that indirect effects among species cause complexity in food webs. Understanding and predicting the behavior of ecosystems consequently depends on our ability to identify indirect effects and their mechanisms. The present study experimentally investigates indirect interactions arising between two prey species that share a common predator. In a natural field experiment, we introduced different densities of mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), an alternative prey, to a previously studied predator–prey system in which paper wasps (Polistes dominulus) preyed on <b>shield</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (Cassida rubiginosa). We tested if alternative prey affects predation on the first prey (i. e., the predator-dependent functional response of paper wasps) by modifying either interference among predators or the effective number of predators foraging on <b>shield</b> <b>beetles.</b> Presence of mealworms significantly reduced the effective number of predators, whereas predator interference was not affected. In this way, the experimentally introduced alternative prey altered the wasps' functional response and thereby indirectly influenced C. rubiginosa density. In all prey-density combinations offered, paper wasps constantly preferred T. molitor. This led to an asymmetrical, indirect interaction between both prey species: an increase in mealworm density significantly relaxed predation on C. rubiginosa, whereas an increase in C. rubiginosa density intensified predation on mealworms. Such asymmetrical outcomes of a fixed food preference can significantly affect the population dynamics of the species involved. In spite of the repeated finding of a Type III functional response in this system, our experiment did not reveal switching behavior in paper wasps. The variety of mechanisms underlying direct and indirect interactions within our study system exemplifies the importance of incorporating alternative prey when investigating the impact of a generalist predator on a focal prey population under realistic field conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the development of}} a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to the hemolymph of fifth-instar larvae of the <b>shield</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cassida rubiginosa Muell. (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), {{to be used as a}} tool for predator gut analysis. The MAb reacts with all life stages of C. rubiginosa, shows no cross-reactions outside the genus Cassida (31 herbivorous insect species and 12 potential predators of C. rubiginosa were tested), and is less reactive with other Cassida species than with C. rubiginosa. Specificity tests were conducted using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western blot analysis following SDS–PAGE showed that the MAb reacts with a single protein of molecular weight 32 kDa. The immunoblot of a native PAGE showed a reaction with three bands, the monomer of 32 kDa and two bands with approximate molecular weights of 60 and 90 kDa. Using this MAb, we were able to unambiguously identify individuals of the model predator Nabis mirmicoides Costa (Hemiptera, Nabidae) after feeding on one C. rubiginosa last-instar larva. The MAb may be useful for predator gut analysis to identify the predator complex of C. rubiginosa...|$|R

40|$|Creeping thistle, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Asteraceae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious weeds in {{ecological}} compensation areas (within-field or border refugia) in Europe. Since conventional weed control measures are restricted in compensation areas, augmenting indigenous agents for biological control of the weed may be a feasible alternative. In this paper, we studied the effect of density of the <b>shield</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cassida rubiginosa Miiller (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae), and two vegetation types typical for ecological compensation areas, on the performance of creeping thistle plants in an open field experiment. Early-season larval feeding had no measurable effect on creeping thistle growth, while late-season feeding signiJicantly reduced shoot growth. These findings were attributed to higher feeding rates of the herbivores at higher ambient temperatures late in the season. Defoliation had a strong eflect on the above-ground performance of C. arvense plants, but not on the below-ground performance. In contrast, the plant community affected all below-ground performance parameters measured, but only some of the above-ground performance parameters of creeping thistle. A combination of high levels of plant competition and herbivory by C. rubiginosa larvae led to 50 % mortality in C. arvense plants during the growing season. We conclude that augmentation of indigenous herbivores of C. arvense in combination with breaking up the root system by tillage and the establishment of a highly competitive plant community of beneficial herbs may be a feasible way to control this problematic weed in ecological compensation areas...|$|R

5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{generally}} forages in {{the branches}} and foliage of trees, in small groups of up to seven birds. Occasionally larger flocks of up to 30 individuals have been reported, and the species has been encountered in a mixed-species foraging flock with the little friarbird (Philemon citreogularis). The bulk of their diet consists of insects, including cockroaches, termites, grasshoppers, bugs such as lerps, scale (Coccidae) and <b>shield</b> bugs (Pentatomidae), <b>beetles</b> such as bark beetles, chafers (subfamily Melolonthinae), click beetles (genus Xanthophaea), darkling beetles (genera Chalcopteroides and Homotrysis), leaf beetles (genus Paropsis), ladybirds of the genus Scymnus, weevils such as the pinhole borer (Platypus australis), {{and members of the}} genera Mandalotus, Polyphrades and Prypnus, as well as flies, moths, bees, ants and spiders. Birds have been reported preying on small lizards. Prey are caught mostly by sallying, although birds also probe and glean. In Kakadu National Park, birds prefer to hunt prey between the leaf bases of the screw palm Pandanus spiralis.|$|R

Spider-Man pursues the Beetle after he steals a vial containing a sample of Sandman. After a brief fight on a construction site, the Beetle manages to escape from Spider-Man. When asking the nearby people if they have seen the Beetle pass by, {{they point to the}} Latverian Embassy. Later on, Fury visits Peter {{at the top of the}} Daily Bugle, warning him not to go to the Latverian Embassy. After Peter leaves, Fury tells Sharon Carter that Peter will do the opposite anyway. When Spider-Man tries to infiltrate the Latverian Embassy, Green Goblin emerges, forcing Spider-Man to pursue him. Saving people the Goblin's put in harm's way, they fight outside the Baxter Building and eventually end up inside the U.N. building. After being defeated, Green Goblin is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody by Sharon Carter and some <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.</b> agents. The <b>beetle</b> is later dispatched to collect a sample of the Venom suit. Venom eventually pursues him to a warehouse, fights, and defeats him.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Plant {{chemistry}} and predation {{are thought to}} be major factors responsible for the recurrent evolution of die-tary specialization in herbivorous insects. However, their relative importance {{and the degree to which}} they interact to drive diet evolution remain unknown. The present study aims to test predictions of the ‘nasty host plant hypothesis’, which posits that an herbivore’s diet becomes more restricted as its reliance upon novel host plant compounds that con-fer protection from predators increases. The tortoise <b>beetle</b> larval <b>shield</b> system affords a unique opportunity to examine how predation and host plant chemistry interact. Shields can be micro-manipulated, including removal, chemical modi-fication and reattachment, without harm to the larvae. We subjected larvae of different diet breadths produced from basal and derived hosts to a predation bioassay and compared the relative effectiveness of their shields under different treatment conditions. Failure-time analyses, the most appropriate statistical approach for right-censored temporal data, revealed that specialist larvae were consistently less susceptible to predation than were generalists feeding on the same plant. Although generalists were as competent as specialists at handling non-polar host chemistry, specialists were better at manipulating more polar host-derived compounds, which are more likely to include novel chemistry. Host shifts may be constrained to only those plants that possess novel, polar compounds. The interaction between plant {{chemistry and}} beetle diet evolution may be one of escalation driven by predation, wherein specialists are increasingly more effective than generalists in the assimilation of host plant polar compounds into shield defenses.

5000|$|The Ultimate Marvel {{incarnation}} of Beetle {{appears in the}} Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon series, voiced by Steven Blum. This version is depicted as a highly capable criminal mercenary that rarely says anything and his notable trademark is the unusually large amount of fold-out rocket launchers hidden all {{over the surface of}} his armor. In the episode [...] "Beetle Mania", he targets the Daily Bugle Communications for J. Jonah Jameson's campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains (i.e. springing MODOK from prison and dealings with Doctor Doom). When he fights the <b>S.H.I.E.L.D.</b> trainees, <b>Beetle's</b> assassination attempt is stopped by Spider-Man and he is knocked out by Power Man; Jameson was on monitor renderings the whole time unlike Mary Jane Watson actually being in the office. In the episode [...] "The Attack of the Beetle", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their previous encounter as well as Phil Coulson for being 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use May Parker as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode [...] "Hawkeye", Beetle went to destroy the new S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier but is defeated and captured by Spider-Man and Hawkeye. In the episode [...] "The Sinister Six", Beetle appeared {{as a member of the}} Sinister Six alongside Doctor Octopus, Electro, the Rhino, Kraven the Hunter and the Lizard. Along with the group, he fought Spider-Man. When the trainees arrive, Beetle fights with Nova but is defeated by Iron Fist after Spider-Man's teammates switch opponents and is later detained in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. In the episode [...] "Agent Venom", Beetle is hired by Taskmaster to obtain a sample of the Venom symbiote. Failing with the Venomized Scorpion, he chases after Flash Thompson, ignoring Harry Osborn and Mary Jane in the process. Beetle subsequently had to fight with Spider-Man and then Agent Venom. While Spider-Man deals with Taskmaster, Beetle is eventually defeated by Agent Venom. In the episode [...] "New Warriors", Beetle is among the escaped supervillains along with Doctor Octopus, the Scorpion and the Green Goblin during a showdown between Taskmaster's team and the New Warriors. Along with his fellow supervillains, Beetle is eventually defeated by the New Warriors. In the episode [...] "Contest of Champions" [...] 1, Beetle - alongside the Abomination and the Executioner - are sent by the Grandmaster to obtain Spider-Man for the contest against the Collector. In the episode [...] "Anti-Venom", Beetle attempts to steal a truck only to be attacked by Spider-Man and Agent Venom in order to defeat possible Sinister Six recruits. However, Hydra agents had previously upgraded Beetle's armor, allowing him to fight off the duo until the Patrioteer hacks Beetle's armor and sends Beetle crashing into the pavement.|$|R
