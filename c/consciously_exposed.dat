50|$|The {{scenes of}} Kavanagh's stories {{are almost always}} laid in France. Her style is domestic, simple and pleasing, aimed at younger woman readers; her main {{characters}} tend to be strong independent and resourceful women. She was popular and had a loyal readership. She was also a prolific contributor to periodical literature, and also wrote many biographical sketches. Modern scholars see a pronounced awareness of gender politics in Kavanagh's writing and view her as a writer whose works <b>consciously</b> <b>exposed</b> the anomalies of social and sexual difference while still adhering to the conventions of the time.|$|E
30|$|By {{deciding}} {{to participate in}} a future-oriented planning and shaping process in a concrete social field, the participatory (futures) researcher cannot bypass questions of power hierarchies. While in case of variable-manipulative research strategies (e.g. in case of quasi experiments) these issues have already been methodically resolved in order to facilitate a distanced research attitude even before the researcher comes into the picture, the participatory and variable-configuratively oriented researcher has to <b>consciously</b> <b>expose</b> themselves to the complicated interactive dynamics of defining role and position under “natural” conditions. In this situation, the researcher can do nothing else but legitimise their “claims to power” (providing suggestions; offering methods, action and/or strategy recommendations, etc.).|$|R
30|$|While all variable-manipulative {{methods of}} field {{research}} and many {{manifestations of the}} variable-configurative research strategy (e.g., secondary analyses, comparative case studies, etc.) attempt to exclude the “self-reinforcing tendency of interactive processes” [24, p 305] from the research process through standardisation of research processes {{as well as through}} exclusion (which reduces the research process to a falsification of hypothesis) of the usage context, the participatory practice researcher has to <b>consciously</b> <b>expose</b> themselves to the interactive dynamics of defining role and position under “natural” conditions. 2 These indications suggest that participatory research, in addition to the methodological, research-methodical and discipline-specific knowledge and competencies that are essential for any scientific work, demands extremely well-developed communicative competency, and to some extent even self-reflexive competency, from the researcher. Psycho-analytically oriented authors like Horn [26] or Schülein [24] discussed this problem many years ago.|$|R
5000|$|As {{was often}} the case with the Qalandariyya dervishes, Bari Imam did not {{transmit}} any of his doctrines to writing; as such, it may be rightly presumed that he bequeathed all of his teachings orally. Bari Imam was renowned in his own life for being an ascetic who subjected himself to great self-humiliation in the public sphere, [...] "living among the pariahs and <b>consciously</b> <b>exposing</b> himself to the disdain of the people." [...] A celebrated miracle worker, Bari Imam is also described in regional lore as one through whom God performed many marvels to convince the local people of the truth of Islam; thus, {{some of the most popular}} miracles ascribed to him are his having caused water to gush forth from rocks and his having brought back to life the dead buffaloes of a peasant who had earlier provided the saint with milk during his ten years of spiritual seclusion.|$|R
40|$|On a {{daily basis}} we are exposed to interactions, and we make {{judgments}} about them. The influence that recent ideas or events have on an interpretation of something else is called priming. Through the process of priming, our interpretations {{of the world around}} us can be influenced by recently or frequently accessible stimuli. The purpose of this current research is to study how emotions can influence one’s impression of a social interaction. The priming effects of emotions on interpretations of social situations are being studied to make a connection between one’s emotional state and their perception/opinion of others. This may lead to an understanding of how emotions affect our relationships with others. In this research, to <b>consciously</b> <b>expose</b> the subjects to emotional words for priming, a sentence completion task with different variations of each sentence for each condition will be conducted. There will be the three conditions of neutral, positive (happy), and negative (angry). After the subjects have been primed by completing the sentence completion task, they will then view an ambiguous image to interpret. The hypothesis {{of this study is that}} participants exposed to the negative emotional primes will have an interpretation of the ambiguous image that has assimilated to the primed emotion. The results are expected to show that both conditions will have some assimilation to the primes, but the negative condition will assimilate at a higher rate...|$|R

Hence, a Chinese-adapted evaluative scale to measure youth′s attitude toward noise could rigorously evaluate data validity and reliability. After authenticating the youth attitude to noise scale (YANS) originally developed by Olsen and Erlandsson, we purposively sampled and surveyed 642 freshmen at Capital Medical University in Beijing, China. To establish validity, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis according to Olsen′s classification. To establish reliability, we calculated Cronbach′s alpha coefficient and split-half coefficient. We used Bland-Altman analysis to calculate the agreement limits between test and retest. Among 642 students, 550 (85. 67 %) participated in statistical analysis (399 females [72. 55 %] vs. 151 males [27. 45 %]). Confirmatory factorial analysis sorted 19 items into four main subcategories (F 1 -F 4) in terms of factor load, yielding a correlation coefficient between factors < 0. 40. The Cronbach′s alpha coefficient (0. 70) was within the desirable range, confirming the reliability of Chinese-adapted YANS. The split-half coefficient was 0. 53. Furthermore, the paired t-test reported a mean difference of 0. 002 (P = 0. 9601). Notably, the mean overall YANS score (3. 46) was similar to YANS testing in Belgium (3. 10), but higher than Sweden (2. 10) and Brazil (2. 80). The Chinese version of the YANS questionnaire is valid, reliable, and adaptable to Chinese adolescents. Analysis of the adapted YANS showed {{that a significant number}} of Chinese youth display a poor attitude and behavior toward noise. Therefore, Chinese YANS can play a pivotal role in programs that focus on increasing youth awareness of noise and hearing health...|$|R

Clayton’s mother, Mary Knight Agnew, was a homemaker and renowned Southern cook, whose dinner gatherings drew friends from far and near. She had two siblings, Jerry, Jr. and Sarah Elizabeth (a well-known Southern California educator). Jerry and Mary <b>consciously</b> chose to <b>expose</b> their children to African Americans of accomplishment. During a 1936 visit to Arkansas by Mary McLeod Bethune, Clayton’s parents drove a significant distance {{to be sure that}} their children could hear her speak. Dr. Bethune remained a lifelong inspiration for Dr. Clayton," [...] according to the MCLM website.|$|R
