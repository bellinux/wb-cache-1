40|$|As life {{expectancy}} increases overall incidence of distal humeral fractures is increasing worldwide. Objectives: To evaluate {{the results of}} JESS External fixator {{in the management of}} supracondylar fracture with or without intercondylar extension in adults. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was conducted on thirty adults in a tertiary care Hospital of eastern India after obtaining permission from Institutional ethical committee and consent of the patients in a time span of one year. JESS external fixator was applied within 3 days of admission. Results: According to AO classification 16 cases has C 1 fractures and 14 cases had C 2 fractures. Among 16 C 1 fractures 10 were open injury and 6 were close injury and among 14 C 2 fracture 8 were open injuries and 6 were <b>close</b> <b>fractures.</b> The mean duration of JESS application was 16 week. The mean follow-up was 10 months. The functional outcome was evaluated by use of Cassebaum′s functional rating system. C 1 <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> (6 cases) showed excellent results and C 2 <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> (6 cases) showed good to fair results. Irrespective of injury pattern (open/close) among 16 C 1 fracture 12 cases (75 %) showed excellent to good results and 4 cases(25 %) showed fair result in contrast to 14 cases of C 2 fracture where only 2 (14 %) cases showed good result and rest 12 cases(86 %) showed fair to poor results. Irrespective of fracture pattern among 12 <b>close</b> <b>fracture</b> 8 cases (67 %) showed good to excellent results and 4 case (33 %) showed fair results. Among 18 open cases 6 cases (33 %) showed good results and 12 cases (67 %) showed poor to fair results. Conclusions: JESS-external fixation technique represents a viable option in the management of open as well as <b>close</b> intercondylar <b>fractures</b> of the distal humerus...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection could potentially {{play an important}} role in the management of fractures as they have been shown to affect fracture healing and the post-operative risk of implant sepsis. Methods A systematic review of the relevant literature was performed on PubMed and Scopus databases. Twenty-six studies were identified, critiqued and analysed accordingly. No randomised controlled trials were identified. Results HIV positivity was not shown to influence an individual’s risk of early wound infection in operatively managed <b>closed</b> <b>fractures.</b> The rate of pin track infection in open injuries managed with external fixators was low. However, in open injuries managed with internal fixation, early wound infection rates were increased in the HIV-positive population compared to HIV-negative individuals. Regarding late implant infection, in <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> there appeared to be no increased risk of infection but there is limited evidence for open injuries. Additionally, further evidence is needed to establish if the rate of union in both open and <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> are influenced by HIV status. Conclusion Overall, no evidence was found to suggest that surgical management of fractures in the HIV population should be avoided, and fixation of <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> in the HIV population appeared to be safe. The effect of anti-retroviral therapy is unclear and this should be further researched. However, based on the limited evidence, caution should be taken in the management of open fractures due to the potentially increased infection risk. The impact of anti-retroviral therapy on the outcomes of surgery needs further evaluation...|$|R

5000|$|When a child {{experiences}} a fracture, {{he or she}} will have pain and {{will not be able to}} easily move the fractured area. A doctor or emergency care should be contacted immediately. In some cases even though the child will not have pain and will still be able to move, medical help must be sought out immediately. To decrease the pain, bleeding, and movement a physician will put a splint on the fractured area. Treatment for a fracture follows a simple rule: the bones have to be aligned correctly and prevented from moving out of place until the bones are healed.

30|$|Operative {{treatment}} {{has been used}} in patients with multiple trauma, open fractures, unstable or segmental fractures, but has been controversial in <b>closed</b> stable <b>fractures</b> [11]. Recent literature continues to demonstrate advantages of intramedullary nailing vs non-operative treatment of unstable tibial fractures [12 – 14]. The definitive treatment of <b>closed</b> tibial shaft <b>fractures</b> has remained somewhat debated, and a recent meta-analysis of these fractures concluded that “the published literature are inadequate for decision-making with regard to the treatment of <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> of the tibia [11].” It is particularly questionable whether closed, stable, minimally displaced tibial fractures are best treated with surgery or casting, and no study has been published comparing operative vs non-operative treatment of these types of fractures. This study attempts to evaluate if cast treatment or intramedullary nailing of <b>closed,</b> stable tibial <b>fractures</b> has any short or long-term advantage in healing, avoidance of complications, or functional outcome.|$|R

40|$|Abstract】Ulnar nerve {{injury in}} <b>closed</b> <b>fracture</b> of forearm in {{children}} is uncommon. Commonly, neurapraxia {{is the reason}} for this palsy but other severe injuries or nerve entrapment has been reported in some cases. The impor-tance of diagnosis concerning the types of the nerve injury {{lies in the fact that}} they have totally different management. We present a case of ulnar nerve deficit in a child following a <b>closed</b> <b>fracture</b> of the forearm bones. It is imperative to diagnose exact cause of palsy as it forms the basis for treatment. MRI scan can help diagnosis and accordingly guide the management. Simple nerve contusion should be treated conservatively, and exploration with fixation of the fracture should be done in lacerations and entrapments of the nerve. Surgery is not the treatment of choice in cases that could be managed conservatively. Key words: Ulnar nerve; Peripheral nerve injuries; Forearm injuries; Chil...|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjective:to {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of two analgesia protocols (ketamine versus morphine) associated with midazolam for the reduction of dislocations or <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> in children. Methods:randomized clinical trial comparing morphine (0. 1 mg/kg; max 5 mg) and ketamine (2. 0 mg/kg, max 70 mg) associated with midazolam (0. 2 mg/kg; max 10 mg) in the reduction of dislocations or <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> in children treated at the pediatrics emergency room (October 2010 and September 2011). The groups were compared {{in terms of the}} times to perform the procedures, analgesia, parent satisfaction and orthopedic team. Results: 13 patients were allocated to ketamine and 12 to morphine, without differences in relation to age, weight, gender, type of injury, and pain scale before the intervention. There was no failure in any of the groups, no differences in time to start the intervention and overall procedure time. The average hospital stay time was similar (ketamine = 10. 8 + 5. 1 h versus morphine = 12. 3 + 4. 4 hs; p= 0. 447). The median pain (faces pain scale) scores after the procedure was 2 in both groups. Amnesia was noted in 92. 3 % (ketamine) and 83. 3 % (morphine) (p= 0. 904). Parents said they were very satisfied in relation to the analgesic intervention (84. 6 % in the ketamine group and 66. 6 % in the morphine group; p= 0. 296). The satisfaction of the orthopedist regarding the intervention was 92. 3 % in the ketamine group and 75 % in the morphine group (p= 0. 222). Conclusion:by producing results similar to morphine, ketamine can be considered as an excellent option in pain management and helps in the reduction of dislocations and <b>closed</b> <b>fractures</b> in pediatric emergency rooms...|$|R
