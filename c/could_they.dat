5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At this point the Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they <b>could,</b> <b>they</b> left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E
5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. <b>Could</b> <b>they,</b> someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E

Eisenhower's theatre headquarters, dealing with nightly German air raids. Contreras remembers {{that the women}} who served abroad were not treated like the regular Army servicemen. They did not receive overseas payment nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> receive government life insurance. They had no protection if they became ill, wounded or captured. She served until 1945 and earned the European-African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with 2 Battle Stars, World War II Victory Medal, American Campaign Medal, Women's Army Corps Service Medal and the Army Good Conduct Medal.|$|E

5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But {{in other}} respects, {{they were a}} dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, {{the income}} from the {{navigation}} had dropped, {{as a result of}} attempts to compete against the railways, but economies were made, and capital works continued. The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue. Nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> be closed, since they allowed surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames, without causing flooding.|$|E
5|$|The Muslims found {{themselves}} in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, <b>could</b> <b>they</b> resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E

5|$|Aside from Nikki, Victor {{is known}} for his {{relationship}} with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). While Ashley was at a low point in her life, he had an affair with her. This led to her pregnancy, which he left Nikki for. However, Nikki was diagnosed with cancer and he returned to her, and Ashley aborted her baby; a move she regretted for many years. Ashley stole his sperm many years later, and had a child, Abby Carlton. Abby was believed to be Brad Carlton's (Don Diamont) daughter until she was five years old. Victor was married to Ashley from 1990 to 1993. In 2008, Victor married Sabrina Costelana (Raya Meddine), which was short-lived following her accidental death. Afterward, he left town and Ashley tracked him down when nobody else <b>could.</b> <b>They</b> reconnected their romantic relationship, later remarried and Ashley became pregnant. Davidson stated she was surprised by Ashley's pregnancy, but decided to like the storyline as it was unexpected. Victor and Ashley's second marriage ended after she miscarried the child.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were {{in a state of shock}} {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to understand what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E

Thus, they could not become members of the cabinet; nor <b>could</b> <b>they,</b> as judges or as members of committees, take part in discussions concerning religious questions.

25|$|There {{were three}} phases in Virginia's Reconstruction era: wartime, presidential, and congressional. Immediately {{after the war}} President Andrew Johnson {{recognized}} the Francis Harrison Pierpont government as legitimate and restored local government. The Virginia legislature passed Black Codes that severely restricted Freedmen's mobility and rights; they had only limited rights and were not considered citizens, nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> vote. The state ratified the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and revoked the 1861 ordnance of secession. Johnson was satisfied that Reconstruction was complete.|$|E
25|$|Usury {{was still}} {{banned by the}} Church in this period, with an {{interpretation}} concisely expressed as Quidquid sorti accedit, usura est ("Whatever exceeds the principal is usury"). So the Medici Bank could not openly adopt the modern formula of promising to pay interest on demand deposits and loaning out {{a fraction of the}} deposits at greater interest to pay for the interest on the deposit, since a depositor would gain revenue on the principal without any risk to the principal, which would have made both parties usurers and sinners; nor <b>could</b> <b>they</b> charge fees or other such devices.|$|E

25|$|Performances at {{the public}} theatres were {{generally}} allowed six days per week; the theatres were closed on Sundays and major religious holidays like Good Friday. Other restrictions were laid upon the players, some of which they evaded as consistently as they <b>could.</b> <b>They</b> were supposed to cease playing entirely during Lent but violated this stricture regularly. In the spring of 1592, for example, the Lord Strange's Men played daily at the Rose Theatre right through Lent. After 1623, companies circumvented the Lenten restriction through the simple expedient of paying bribes to Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels.|$|E

Later, Adam Air announced that they did indeed intend to select a company to conduct the operation shortly and would pay for this themselves.|$|E
