The downstream transcriptional networks guiding their functional activities are poorly understood. Additionally, important contributions elsewhere are likely masked due to redundancy.

Surprisingly, we discovered they not only activate mesodermal gene expression but also redundantly regulate key endodermal determinants, leading to substantial loss of endoderm in double mutants. To further explore the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) governing endoderm formation, we identified targets of Ta/Tbx 16 -regulated homeodomain transcription factor Mixl 1, which is absolutely required in zebrafish for endoderm formation.

Feasibility of {{microwave}} Doppler radar for non-contact physiological {{monitoring and}} detection is explored in this dissertation.

In this work several sources of signal distortion are investigated. Contributions to the field of electrical engineering include novel hardware and software techniques to overcome distortions and improve signal estimation in wireless vital sign monitoring. Channel imbalance in quadrature receivers is one of the distortion sources that has been systematically investigated, theoretically and experimentally. It has been demonstrated that imbalance can introduce error in displacement estimation, radar cross section, and even rate measurements. Innovative hardware approaches, including packet radar and pulse low-IF receiver architectures, were proposed to resolve AC coupling issues, channel imbalance, and position sensitivity. Signal estimation for single and multiple subject detection was explored. True human presence estimation is demonstrated with Doppler radar occupancy sensors based on heart and respiration rates to overcome the limitations of <b>common</b> <b>occupancy</b> sensors.

Occupancy models are widely used to describe the distribution of rare and cryptic species— those that occur on only a portion of the landscape and cannot be detected reliably during a single survey. However, occupancy models often provide inaccurate estimates of occupancy (ψ ̂) and detection probabilities (p ̂) under these circumstances. We developed a new "conditional" occupancy design that more accurately estimates occupancy for rare species.

40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) already {{make a major}} {{contribution}} to driving safety. To further increase this contribution, it is, however, vital that future intelligent vehicles perceive, predict, and assess their environment more comprehensively. In this context, the present dissertation approaches the questions i) how to represent the driving environment adequately within an environment model, ii) how to obtain such a representation, and iii) how {{to predict the future}} traffic scene evolution for proper criticality assessment. Bayesian inference provides the common theoretical framework of all designed methods. Based on the shortcomings of existing environment representations, a novel parametric representation of general driving environments is first introduced in this work. It consists of a combination of dynamic object maps for moving objects and so-called Parametric Free Space (PFS) maps for static environment structures. PFS maps model the environment by a closed curve around the vehicle, which encloses relevant drivable free space. The representation compactly describes all essential information contained in <b>common</b> <b>occupancy</b> grid maps, suppresses irrelevant details, and consistently separates between static and dynamic environment objects. A novel method for grid mapping in dynamic road environments provides the basis to realize this representation. Therein, dynamic cell hypothesis are detected, clustered, and subsequently tracked and classified with an adaptive Bayesian multiple model filter for jump Markov nonlinear systems – the so-called Interacting Multiple Model Unscented Kalman Probabilistic Data Association Filter (IMM-UK-PDAF). The intermediate result is a dynamic object map and an optimized grid of the static driving environment. From the optimized grid, relevant free space is then extracted by methods of image analysis, and robustly converted to a PFS map in a final B-Spline contour tracking step. Evaluations and experiments, which were performed with an experimental vehicle equipped with radars and a stereo camera in real driving environments, confirm the advantages of the real-time capable approach. The so-obtained representation additionally forms the basis of a novel method for long-term trajectory prediction and criticality assessment. Therein, a three-layered Bayesian network is used to infer current driving maneuvers of traffic participants initially. A trash maneuver class allows the detection of irrational driving behavior and the seamless application from highly-structured to non-structured environments. Subsequently, maneuver-based prediction models in form of stochastic processes are presented and employed to predict the vehicle configurations under consideration of uncertainties in the maneuver executions. Finally, the criticality time metric Time-To-Critical-Collision-Probability (TTCCP) is introduced as a generalization of the time metric Time-To-Collision (TTC) for arbitrary, uncertain, multi-object driving environments and longer prediction horizons. The TTCCP considers all uncertain, maneuver-based predictions and is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations confirm its potential to suppress false warnings, to generate timely true warnings, and to generate warnings in critical almost-collision situations effectively. All methods are part of the driver assistance system PRORETA 3, which has been co-developed {{in the context of this}} thesis. It constitutes a novel, integrated approach to collision avoidance and vehicle automation and thereby makes a valuable contribution to realize the Vision Zero – the vision of a future without traffic deaths...|$|E

Unlike currently popular inverse sensor models, forward sensor models can be found experimentally and can represent sensor characteristics better. The formulation is applicable to both 2 D and 3 D range sensors and does not {{have some of the}} theoretical and practical problems associated with the current approaches which use forward models. As an illustration of this procedure, a new prototype 3 D forward sensor model is derived using a beam represented as a spherical sector. Furthermore, this model is used for fusion of point-clouds obtained from different 3 D sensors, in particular, time-of-flight sensors (Swiss-ranger, laser range finders), and stereo vision cameras. Several techniques are described for an efficient data-structure representation and implementation. The range beams from different sensors are fused in a <b>common</b> local Cartesian <b>occupancy</b> map.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify landscape characteristics which predict the presence of mesocarnivore species in forests fragmented by urban development. I used remote cameras to detect mesocarnivores in 21 forest patches in Newark, Delaware in June and July 2012. Using the program PRESENCE, I determined which of the following seven landscape characteristics were the most likely predictors of occupancy for the four species detected: proportion of multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) cover within the plot; average distance of the plot to the nearest road and to the nearest stream; patch size; and proportions of forest, agriculture, and non-forest cover within a 100 -m buffer surrounding the plot. The proportion of multiflora rose cover and proportion of surrounding forest cover were <b>common</b> predictors of <b>occupancy</b> for domestic cats (Felis catus), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana). For foxes and opossums, occupancy probability increased with forest cover and decreased with rose cover. The reverse was true for cats. No landscape variables could be identified as effective predictors of occupancy for raccoons (Procyon lotor), possibly reflecting the species??? ability to adapt to a variety of habitat types. While not applicable for all mesocarnivores, the models derived from my research may be useful in predicting the occupancy of select species in forest fragments based solely on landscape characteristics.

30|$|We only {{studied a}} {{snapshot}} of the forest community, where the Afromontane community exhibits a rather fine-scale pattern or the lack of notably spatial structure. As a promising future research area, considering more realistic temporal and recruitment dynamics at landscape scales could be fruitful (Condit et al. 2006), for instance using the framework of landscape demography (Hui et al. 2017) which could handle the covariance in local patch dynamics caused by both dispersal and the Moran effect. Indeed, many works have pointed toward the role of demographic rates in space and time as the potential framework for unifying community assemblage patterns and methods (Law et al. 2003; Condit et al. 2006). Extending the zeta diversity framework from a platform of spatial turnover analysis to temporal turnover investigation is an ongoing research area. The extremely slow rate of zeta diversity decline in this community suggests a number of extremely common species dominating the landscape, while the rare species could have a large temporal turnover across years. In particular, the four most common species Ironwood (Olea capensis subsp. Macrocarpa), Kamassi (Gonioma kamassi), Real Yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius) and Assegai (Curtisia dentata), were also most common in the community in 1972 (15  years before the current survey). In contrast, the 10 most rare species include White Silky Bark (Cassine eucleiformis), Cape Plane (Ochna arborea), Wild Pomegranate (Burchellia bubalina), Cape Beech (Rapanea melanophloeos), Coalwood (Lachnostylis hirta), Cape Holly (Ilex mitis), Dune Olive (Olea exasperata), and three newly emerged species in 1987 : Cape Pock-ironwood (Chionanthus foveolatus), Glossyleaf (Rhamnus prinoides) and Wild Gardenia (Rothmannia capensis). Three rare species found in 1972 disappeared in the 1987 community: Hard Pear (Olinia ventosa), Wild Peach (Kiggelaria africana) and White Alder (Platylophus trifoliatus). In particular, Olinia ventosa is fast-growing and regarded to be more light demanding, requiring bigger disturbances for establishment. This could explain its absence during the 1987 re-measurement. As predicted from the zeta diversity framework (Fig. 5), the probability of retention for rare species (roughly occupancy <[*] 5 sites) is much lower than for <b>common</b> ones (<b>occupancy</b> greater than 100 sites). This suggests that conservation planning should differentiate common from rare species as different processes could drive their recruitment and persistence.|$|R

40|$|In {{these years}} we are {{experiencing}} an incredible explosion for mobile connectivity. Devices such as smart-phones, tablets and laptops {{are more and}} more data hungry, asking for faster and faster connections. In the meantime, many industry sectors are pushing mobile network operators to provide internet connectivity with different characteristics for a new set of machine-driven applications. Machine-to-machine (M 2 M) or machine type communications (MTC), is the new paradigm: lower latencies, lower energy consumption, less signalling, higher reliability, are only few of new requirements. MTC devices will become a massive presence in tomorrow mobile networks and finally the Internet of Things will become real in its entirety. Although still under constant update, the current 4 G mobile networks have some limitations due to their intrinsic architecture. A newer disruptive mobile network generation is the only possible solution to satisfy the future demands for connectivity. While within the so-called 5 G networks, many new technologies are under study, focusing on reaching higher point-to-point data-rates, {{one of the most important}} aspects of 5 G is the support for MTC. In this thesis different aspects of M 2 M communications are taken into account. Inter-vehicular communications and the IEEE 802. 11 p protocol for vehicular ad-hoc networks are analysed. In particular the IEEE 802. 11 p shortcomings on channel response estimation and channel access are taken into consideration. The physical layer of the IEEE 802. 11 p protocol does not provide sufficient information to track the channel response; we propose a novel technique that exploits information provided by in-car sensors like GPS or speedometer to improve channel response tracking. Current protocols for vehicular direct communications considers the concurrent use of more than one radio channel at the same time, and leave to terminals the duty of choosing which channel to use. In this thesis we consider the most <b>common</b> channel <b>occupancy</b> detectors, derived by the cognitive radio theory, in a vehicular environment, and measure their performances in terms of probability of misdetection and detection delay. In the field of MTC, we present out implementation of an IETF IPv 6 - 6 LoWPAN protocol stack for resource-constrained devices. The stack provides the minimum requirements for these devices to support IPv 6 -based connectivity. The architecture is organized to decouple the stack from the data-link protocol and to seamlessly manage more than one radio access technology interface present in the device. Our tests show an increase in the final throughput respect to the other most known implementation, thanks to a memory usage optimization. Finally 5 G networks and green communications are considered in this thesis. In particular we analyse HARQ protocols, largely used in modern wireless protocols, in terms of energy efficiency. We use the recent theory on channel coding in finite block-length regime by Polyanskiy-Poor-Verdù, the most appropriate in MTC scenarios, as starting point to find the analytic formula of the outage probability for HARQ protocols of Type-I and Type-II. We then propose a novel optimal allocation strategy for the transmitting power of the subsequent transmission attempts. Results show the outstanding performances in terms of energy saved that even the simplest combining techniques that such protocols use, could bring into play...|$|R

Different industries approach corporate real estate in ways that best support their operational needs. This paper quantitatively compares the relationship between the share price, occupancy costs per employee, and net income during the period 1999 to 2013 for U. S. Fortune 500 financial and technology companies. The first part of the paper explains our data collection methodology. We collected share prices and extracted data from 10 -k filings submitted to the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The extracted data consists of firm gross revenue, net income, total full-time employee number, plant, property equipment (PPE), real estate PPE, rental expense, and occupancy costs. The derivation of occupancy costs is also explained in this part. The second part studies the relationship between share price, occupancy costs, and net income for the two sectors. Consistent with our expectations, there is positive and significant correlation between share price and net income for both sectors. On the contrary, the market punishes technology firms for higher occupancy costs per employee but not as much for financial firms. The third part of the paper examines the relationship between occupancy costs and net income per employee.

40|$|Motion-activated {{cameras are}} a {{versatile}} tool that wildlife biologists can use for sampling wild animal populations to estimate species occurrence. Occupancy modelling provides a flexible {{framework for the}} analysis of these data; explicitly recognizing that given a species occupies an area the probability of detecting it is often less than one. Despite the number of studies using camera data in an occupancy framework, there is only limited guidance from the scientific literature about survey design trade-offs when using motion-activated cameras. A fuller understanding of these trade-offs will allow researchers to maximise available resources and determine whether the objectives of a monitoring program or research study are achievable. We use an empirical dataset collected from 40 cameras deployed across 160 km 2 of the Western Slope of Colorado, USA to explore how survey effort (number of cameras deployed and the length of sampling period) affects the accuracy and precision (i. e., error) of the occupancy estimate for ten mammal and three virtual species. We do this using a simulation approach where species occupancy and detection parameters were informed by empirical data from motion-activated cameras. A total of 54 survey designs were considered by varying combinations of sites (10 – 120 cameras) and occasions (20 – 120 survey days). Our findings demonstrate that increasing total sampling effort generally decreases error associated with the occupancy estimate, but changing the number of sites or sampling duration can have very different results, depending on whether a species is spatially <b>common</b> or rare (<b>occupancy</b> = ψ) and easy or hard to detect when available (detection probability = p). For rare species with a low probability of detection (i. e., raccoon and spotted skunk) the required survey effort includes maximizing the number of sites and the number of survey days, often to a level that may be logistically unrealistic for many studies. For common species with low detection (i. e., bobcat and coyote) the most efficient sampling approach was {{to increase the number of}} occasions (survey days). However, for common species that are moderately detectable (i. e., cottontail rabbit and mule deer), occupancy could reliably be estimated with comparatively low numbers of cameras over a short sampling period. We provide general guidelines for reliably estimating occupancy across a range of terrestrial species (rare to common: ψ = 0. 175 – 0. 970, and low to moderate detectability: p = 0. 003 – 0. 200) using motion-activated cameras. Wildlife researchers/managers with limited knowledge of the relative abundance and likelihood of detection of a particular species can apply these guidelines regardless of location. We emphasize the importance of prior biological knowledge, defined objectives and detailed planning (e. g., simulating different study-design scenarios) for designing effective monitoring programs and research studies...|$|R
