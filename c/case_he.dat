5|$|Viète {{used this}} {{approach}} to shrink one of the given circles to a point, thus reducing the problem to a simpler, already solved <b>case.</b> <b>He</b> first solved the CLL case (a circle and two lines) by shrinking the circle into a point, rendering it a LLP <b>case.</b> <b>He</b> then solved the CLP case (a circle, a line and a point) using three lemmas. Again shrinking one circle to a point, Viète transformed the CCL case into a CLP <b>case.</b> <b>He</b> then solved the CPP case (a circle and two points) and the CCP case (two circles and a point), the latter case by two lemmas. Finally, Viète solved the general CCC case (three circles) by shrinking one circle to a point, rendering it a CCP case.|$|E

These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb.
