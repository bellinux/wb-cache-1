Manipal Hospitals is the second hospital {{in the world to}} adopt this technology and first in the world to offer it to patients online as an expert second opinion through their website.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{emergence}} of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> Yoga is used for treatment of <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and to increase anxiety control, {{although there is a}} generally low quality of research and uncertainty for proving this effect. In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found no evidence that yoga was effective for metabolic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. Studies {{have shown}} that 218% of lung <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> develop hoarseness because of recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, usually left-sided. This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates inoperable tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung cancer surgery in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
40|$|Patient {{survival}} {{is the most}} important single measure of <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> care (the diagnosis and treatment of cancer). The optimal method for monitor-ing and evaluating the effectiveness of <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> care is through the population-based study of <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> survival, which is only possible us-ing data collected by population-based cancer registries. The results of such studies are representative of the entire population, a perspective which is vital for cancer control activities. Population-based studies of <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> survival, the topic of this text, dif-fer in many ways from clinical studies of <b>cancer</b> <b>patient</b> survival. Population-based studies are generally based on a larger number of non-selected patients, who are followed-up less closely with respect to many clinical outcomes over a longer time period. Although conceptually similar, the design, analysis, and interpretation of the two types of studies involve different issues, both practically and statistically. Efficacy of cancer therapy, for example, is best evaluated through the study of patient survival in a (preferably randomised...|$|R

5|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} its Island Records debut, The Artist in the Ambulance. The album's title is {{in reference to}} Burn Collector by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band's desire {{to do more than}} make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album's proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{has been}} studied as an {{alternative}} to vancomycin in the treatment of febrile neutropenia in <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the vitreous humor, and may therefore be effective in treating endophthalmitis (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin injected directly into the eye.|$|E
5|$|Selenium may be {{measured}} in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior elimination in the urine. <b>Cancer</b> <b>patients</b> receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of <b>cancer</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung <b>cancer</b> <b>patients,</b> chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised <b>cancer</b> <b>patients.</b> Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E
