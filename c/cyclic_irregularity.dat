40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the combustion characteristics of blends of n-butanol to gasoline with volume ratios of 0 %, 20 %, 50 %, and 85 % in addition to neat n-butanol on an electronic fuel injection (EFI) gasoline engine. Without any modifications to the original engine, the tests were carried out using the above five test fuels, with the engine working at maximum torque speed (3000 rpm) and four loads (25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of the maximum torque). The combustion characteristics including cylinder pressure, instantaneous and cumulative heat release were analysed. The test results show that all the peak values of cylinder pressure (CP), pressure rise rate (PRR), instantaneous heat release rate (IHRR) as well as total heat release of n-butanol/gasoline blends are lower than those of gasoline, and the higher the percentage of n-butanol is, the larger the reduction becomes. The crank angles of the peak values of CP, PRR and IHRR are larger than those of gasoline, whereas the crank angle of the total heat release is smaller than that of gasoline. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>irregularity</b> of n-butanol/gasoline bends is higher than that of gasoline. Therefore, the combustion of n-butanol/gasoline blends becomes mild, which further gives the benefit of reducing NOX emissions. However, the spark timing of the prototype should be advanced more in order to avoid power decreasing of n-butanol /gasoline blends...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is conducted {{to evaluate the}} effects of using neat cottonseed oil or its neat ME (methyl ester) bio-diesel, on the combustion behavior of a standard, high speed, direct injection (HSDI), 'Hydra' diesel engine located at the authors' laboratory. Combustion chamber and fuel injection pressure diagrams are obtained at medium and high load using a developed, high-speed, data acquisition and processing system. A heat release analysis of the experimentally obtained cylinder pressure diagrams is developed and used. Plots of histories in the combustion chamber of the heat release rate and other related parameters reveal some interesting features, which shed light into the combustion mechanism when using these bio-fuels. These results, combined with the differing {{physical and chemical properties}} of the bio-fuels between themselves and against those for the diesel fuel, which constitutes the baseline fuel, aid the correct interpretation of the observed engine behavior performance-and emissions-wise. Moreover, the possible existence of cyclic (combustion) variability is examined as reflected in the pressure indicator diagrams, by analyzing for the maximum pressure and its rate, and the dynamic injection timing and ignition delay, by using statistical analysis for averages, standard deviations and probability density functions. The key results are that with the use of these bio-fuels against the neat diesel fuel case, the ignition delay is hardly affected, the fuel injection pressure diagrams are very slightly advanced accompanied with higher injection pressures, maximum cylinder pressures remain the same with the vegetable oil and slightly increased with the bio-diesel, maximum cylinder pressure rates are increased with the bio-diesel and decreased with the vegetable oil, while the <b>cyclic</b> <b>irregularity</b> is not affected with these bio-fuels remaining at the acceptable neat diesel fuel case levels.

40|$|Clatter and {{rattle noise}} is an {{increasing}} challenge {{for the development of}} low-noise transmissions. Efforts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions of combustion engines combined with a decrease of the idle speed cause increasing <b>cyclic</b> <b>irregularities</b> within modern drivelines which result in an increasing clatter and rattle noise and can even lead to serious damage of driveline components. Beside these aspects, the improvement of transmission efficiency as part of the powertrain efficiency and therefore fuel consumption of the vehicle is a major task during {{the development of a new}} transmission. In order to design future transmissions that implicate improvements on both tasks simultaneously, new grounds were broken by the Institute of Machine Components (IMA) of the University of Stuttgart, Germany in the field of clatter and rattle noise free automotive transmissions. This is achieved in principle by decoupling all gears which are not in the power flow. On the basis of a patented solution named CARF-Transmission, the Clatter And Rattle noise Free transmission is presented as well as derived developments. Both targets, i. e. reduction of the emitted clatter and rattle noise as well as the efficiency enhancement by reducing the drag torque can be achieved with this transmission...|$|R
40|$|Good {{progress}} has been made {{during the past two decades}} in improving the diagnostic methods for detecting the various types of bovine infertility. Nevertheless, the sterility worker is still frequently confronted with cows and heifers belonging to a category variously designated as "repeat breeders", "problem cows'', "slow breeders'', "hard-to-settle" cows, etc. Vanderplassche (1957) who refers to the condition as "Symptomlose Unfruchtbarkeit", with some justification states that this "Sterilitat sine materia" is one about which we know nothing or very little. Reproductive failure due to physiological or functional derangement of ovarian activity is known to be an important cause of poor breeding performance in bovines, and may be present to such a degree as to constitute a herd problem. Most forms of this physiological infertility are manifested by objective symptoms, notably <b>cyclic</b> <b>irregularities,</b> which attract attention and render diagnosis of the actual type relatively easy. Ovulatory failure, however, is an exception to this rule since it usually presents no visible evidence suggestive of an ovarian aberration. Even palpation of the ovaries per rectum generally fails to reveal the abnormality unless such an examination is carried out a day or two after the animal was known to have been in oestrus. This type of infertility frequently presents the most puzzling problems to both the owner and the sterility worker, since the oestrous cycle generally runs a normal course, except when the more advanced stage of cystic degeneration has been reached. Notwithstanding this apparent regularity of the cycle and the absence of evident pathology or infection in any part of the genital tract, the fertility of the affected animal is subnormal. By virtue of its abstruse nature ovulatory failure has not been subjected to intensive research in the past, and information on its prevalence and significance is scanty. Roberts (1957), for instance, states that delayed ovulation has not been studied sufficiently to ascertain its importance, and that it probably does not occur very frequently. Successful fertilization of the ovum is conditioned by a close co-ordination between the time of insemination or coitus and the time of ovulation, and by the viability of the sperm in the female genitalia. The cow is unique in that ovulation normally occurs only six to fourteen hours after the cessation of oestrus, and since the fertilizing capacity of sperm is lost after a sojourn of 24 to 48 hours in the female genitalia, any undue delay in ovulation will prevent conception, especially if the cow is bred during the early stages of oestrus.
