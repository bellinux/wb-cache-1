This method also reduces the time cost associated with signature detection. Region of Interest in an image document is taking attention in research area. In this method, the signature document image converted into the binary image. This Binary image is normalized (resize) the signature image. To show the signature effective areas in signature image resizing may be required. Now we are performing Adaptive thresholding because it dynamically set all pixels whose intensity values are above a threshold to a foreground value and all the remaining pixels to a background value over the signature document image. This signature document image has some discontinuity between the pixels to remove this discontinuity we are using morphology. This morphological method uses bridge to connect the pixels and remove operator to remove the interior pixel region. The remaining pixel makes the signature image skeleton.

Conventional photo <b>cropping</b> <b>methods</b> suffer from three drawbacks: 1) the semantics used to describe photo aesthetics {{are determined by the}} experience of model designers and specific data sets, 2) image global configurations, an essential cue to capture photos aesthetics, are not well preserved in the cropped photo, and 3) multi-channel visual features from an image region contribute differently to human aesthetics, but state-of-the-art photo <b>cropping</b> <b>methods</b> cannot automatically weight them. Owing to the recent progress in image retrieval community, image-level semantics, i. e., photo labels obtained without much human supervision, can be efficiently and effectively acquired. Thus, we propose weakly supervised photo cropping, where a manifold embedding algorithm is developed to incorporate image-level semantics and image global configurations with graphlets, or, small-sized connected subgraph. After manifold embedding, a Bayesian Network (BN) is proposed. It incorporates the testing photo into the framework derived from the multi-channel post-embedding graphlets of the training data, the importance of which is determined automatically. Based on the BN, photo cropping can be casted as searching the candidate cropped photo that maximally preserves graphlets from the training photos, and the optimal cropping parameter is inferred by Gibbs sampling.

Little change in clay mineralogy is seen in the rotation plot while a significant loss of illitic material from different phases was noted for the continuous-corn cultivation plots. Use of NPK fertilizer since 1955 appears to restore the clay mineralogy in continuous-corn cropping compared to that of the 1913 samples. From these data it appears that the I-S minerals play the role of a K buffer, becoming K-poor when the soil cannot furnish enough K from mineral reserves of detrital phases and K-rich when the soil is able to release enough K to enter into the I-S minerals, where it is available during a growing season, for plant growth...|$|E

Poclostemum ceratophyllum was the primary producer component {{of the community and}} also provided a place of attachment and shelter for a rhcophilic fauna consisting largely of insects. The primary consumer organisms de-rived 66 % of their energy from allochthonous organic matter consisting largely of leaf material. Productivity by phytoplankton in the river water was insignificant as was rcspira-tion in the shifting sand bottom. The river behaved as a heterotrophic stream because of suspended organic detritus in the water. A higher and more variable quantity of particulate detritus was present in the water during summer than winter. This seasonal diffcrcnce was attributed to stream dischargostrcam bed relationships and a more rapid decomposition of organic fragments at higher summer temperatures. The net annual productivities, determined by the <b>cropping</b> <b>method,</b> in Cal/cm 2 for trophic groups were: Podostemum 434, filter fccdcrs 16. 8, herbivores 6. 51, detritus feeders 1. 68, herbivore and detritus feeders 2. 78 (total primary consumer 27. 8), and carnivore 3. 66.

40|$|AbstractThe {{utilization}} {{efficiency of}} solar energy through photosynthesis by crops {{is only a}} few percent at most. Therefore, most solar energy in the field (on-site) remains unused. Plants are, however, able to use certain types of monochromatic light as an environmental signal, and they exhibit various physiological responses to even small amounts of the light. In particular, the significant induction of secondary metabolite production by blue light is well documented. Here, we propose a novel <b>cropping</b> <b>method</b> where unused solar energy is captured on-site by solar cells and converted to monochromatic light by using LEDs. The crops are then irradiated to stimulate enhanced production of secondary metabolites, thus improving crop function without the need for an external energy source. In this study, the effect of blue light on the production of functional secondary metabolites was evaluated in perilla (Perilla frutescens var. crispa f. purpurea), a traditional medicinal crop in Japan. Perilla leaves contain several functional substances such as perillaldehyde, rosmarinic acid, and anthocyanins, which have notable stomachic, antipyretic, detoxification, sedation, and diuretic efficacy. Plants were grown under natural daylight supplemented with blue light irradiation (460 nm, approx. 10 μmol/m 2 /s, 24 h,) for 108 days before harvest. Control plants were grown without supplemental lighting. The content ratio of perillaldehyde in plants grown with blue light was 60 % higher at harvest than in the controls. Moreover, in the vegetative growth stage, the perillaldehyde content increased significantly after only three days of blue light irradiation. These findings suggest that the present approach will benefit agricultural practices in developing countries through more efficient usage of on-site solar energy...|$|E

Measurements taken from 16 animals cropped at night were compared to those taken from 24 animals cropped in daytime. A mean PH 45 of 6. 67 ± 0. 11 was recorded for the night cropped animals compared to a mean pH 45 of 6. 55 ± 0. 23 for the day cropped animals. A mean pHu of 5. 39 ± 0. 08 for animals cropped at night was recorded compared to a mean pHu of 5. 45 ± 0. 11 for the animals cropped in the day. Regression analysis showed the rate of pH decline to be slower in the night cropped animals compared to those cropped in the day. This persisted when the pH values were adjusted to correct for ambient temperature. The cooling rate of the M. longissimus lumborum was twice as fast in the night cropped group.

This paper aims to characterize the plant-to-plant variability in yield and to identify its underlying causes for the two major yam species (Dioscorea alata and Dioscorea rotundata). Four field experiments were carried out between 2006 and 2009 in Benin. Yams were grown using a traditional <b>cropping</b> <b>method</b> (i. e. in mounds at 0. 7 plants m− 2) without biotic or abiotic stresses. In order to test interplant competition, a low density treatment (0. 08 plants m− 2) was included for D. alata in the 2006 experiment. Throughout four years of experimentation, yields varied from 12 Mg ha− 1 to 21 Mg ha− 1. Both yam species presented a high interplant coefficient of variation (CV) for tuber yield (42 – 71 %). The unbiased Gini coefficient (G′) {{was used to measure}} how steep a hierarchy is in an absolute sense. CV and G′ of individual plant biomass both confirm clear plant size hierarchies from early growth. However, no difference in the CV of plant size and plant tuber yield was observed between high and low plant density. This implies that, despite early interaction between neighbouring plants, competition was not the driving factor controlling plant variability. In fact uneven emergence proved to be the primary cause. Yam emergence takes place over a long period (e. g. it took 51 and 47 days for the 90 % central range to emerge for D. alata and D. rotundata, respectively), creating an early inter-plant size hierarchy which later affected tuber production. For both species, plants which emerged early initiated their tuberization earlier in the growing season and reached higher maximum yield regardless of weather conditions (e. g. 1200 and 764 g plant− 1 for early-emerging D. alata and D. rotundata plants respectively, and 539 and 281 g plant− 1 for late-emerging plants). Plant size hierarchization together with its observed left-skewed distribution, led to reduce total and marketable yield by increasing the proportion of small tubers. These results highlight the need to better understand the underlying mechanisms controlling the yams’ uneven emergence before attempting to improve traditional cropping systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis deals {{about the}} dynamic of the migratory trend of Nepalese labors from Nepal to Malaysia. Though the {{remittances}} contribute significantly to Nepal’s national domestic product (GDP), the higher rate of labor migration is problematic concern including labor shortage in Nepalese labor market. The labor shortage mainly in agriculture and construction is high concern. On average more than 1500 Nepalese labors leave the country daily for employment. The recent official record shows that about 2. 5 million Nepalese labors work abroad. Officially, the Malaysian labor market was open for Nepalese labors in 2001 however, now Malaysia constitutes about 40 percent of total international labor migration from Nepal. The earning gap effect and effect of labor migration cost are accounted to drive the fractional migration rate and finally to the labor migration rate. The low earning rate and wage rate in Nepal than in Malaysia are push factors for Nepalese labors to migrate. On other hand, low job creation rate in Nepal is crucial factor of the labor emigration. Additionally, the social network effect on the labor migration cost also plays role to take {{the decision of the}} labor migration. The labor migration increases if both effects are increased however, the increment in the potential Nepalese labors also changes the migration rate. Once the GDP in the country is increased the earning gap decreases that lowers the migration rate. The government policy initiative to increase the GDP through employment generation is proposed to avoid the higher rate of the migration. The policy implementation comprises particularly the training component relating to the entrepreneurship, improved <b>cropping</b> <b>method</b> to increase agricultural yields. The implementation challenges including borrowed money payback is the major concern of the policy though the model does not deal about it extensively.

Os resultados mostraram que o cultivo do arroz no sistema convencional promove aumento no banco de sementes de arroz vermelho, enquanto que a semeadura de arroz em solo inundado (mix de pré-germinado, prégerminado ou transplante de mudas) é tão eficiente na redução do banco de sementes de arroz vermelho quanto a rotação com o sorgo, o pousio do solo sem a presença de animais e também o preparo de verão. In an agricultural ecosystem, the redution of weed seed bank {{is of utmost}} importance. In lowland areas, red rice (Oryza sativa) {{is the most important}} weed. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the evolution of the red rice seed bank under different seeding systems and alternatives of soil management. The experiment was conducted during two years (1996 / 97 and 1997 / 98 growing seasons) in Santa Maria, RS in Albaqualf soil with an average infestation of 556 viable seeds per square meter. The assessement of the seed bank was conducted by ten samplings using a cylinder with 10 cm of diameter and 10 cm depth. After each sampling the seeds were separated and the number of viable seeds was determinated by tetrazolium test. The sampling were carried out before establishing the experiment (September 1996) after the first harvest (May 1997) and after the second harvest (May 1998). The results showed that the traditional rice <b>cropping</b> <b>method</b> increases the red rice seed bank, whereas the systems in which the rice is seeded in flooded soil (no tillage water seeded, water seeded and transplanted seedlings) are as efficient in reducing the red rice seed bank as the system that applies crop rotation with sorghum or fallow without the presence of grazing animals or soil tillage during summer...|$|E

40|$|Premise of the study: We {{developed}} microsatellite markers in the legume Lens culinaris from {{publicly available}} databases {{to enrich the}} limited marker resource available for the <b>crop.</b> <b>Methods</b> and Results: Eighty-two primer sets were identified using expressed sequence sets of L. culinaris available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and were characterized in six species of Lens. Among them, 20 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers produced no amplification product, 43 produced monomorphic products, and 19 were polymorphic. The primers amplified mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide repeats with one to four alleles. These SSR loci successfully amplified in five related wild species, {{with a total of}} 61 primer pairs in L. nigricans and L. odemensis (98. 39...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{and significance of}} integrated and organic farming are briefly discussed. In wheat production, the <b>cropping</b> <b>methods</b> involved are then described and compared to those of a conventional system. Initial results from an experimental farm at Nagele, The Netherlands, indicate that by an integrated, low-input approach considerable savings on pesticides can be achieved which, on average, almost compensate for the resulting yield depressions. It is demonstrated that in future equivalent benefits may be possible with a more radical, no-input or organic system, if current trends of decreasing grain prices and increasing variable costs persist. In both alternative systems technical and financial improvements will depend on more research at the farm level, at which this paper is meant to stimulat...|$|R
