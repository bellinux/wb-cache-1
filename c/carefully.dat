5|$|Each encrustated {{conglomerate}} of concreted {{material was}} <b>carefully</b> documented with photographs, radiographs where practical, and detailed conservation records.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof and}} clock tower were {{destroyed}} by fire in 1984, but have been <b>carefully</b> restored.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{internal}} structure was completely changed, {{the city was}} <b>carefully</b> planned; first to be built were the streets that descended from the elevated center into the gates, ensuring the drainage of rain water.|$|E
5|$|I, Euthalius, {{wrote this}} {{volume of the}} Apostle Paul as <b>carefully</b> as {{possible}} in stichoi, so {{that it might be}} read with intelligence: the book was compared with the copy in the library at Caesarea, written by the hand of Pamphilius the saint.|$|E
5|$|In 1822, {{there was}} an attempt, known as the Ducoudray Holstein Expedition, conceived, <b>carefully</b> planned and {{organized}} by General Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein to invade Puerto Rico and declare it a republic.|$|E
5|$|In late 1998, Polish {{physicist}} Robert Smolańczuk published calculations on {{the fusion}} of atomic nuclei towards the synthesis of superheavy atoms, including oganesson and livermorium. His calculations suggested {{that it might be}} possible to make these two elements by fusing lead with krypton under <b>carefully</b> controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|Modern Cookery, For Private Families, Reduced to a System of Easy Practice, In a Series of <b>Carefully</b> Tested Receipts, In Which the Principles of Baron Liebig and Other Eminent Writers Have Been as Much as Possible Applied and Explained.|$|E
5|$|Monument 215 {{is a part}} of the Cargador del Ancestro sculpture. It {{was found}} {{embedded}} in the east face of Structure 7A, where it was <b>carefully</b> placed at the same time as the royal burial was interred in the centre of the structure.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{excavations}} {{have revealed}} a large temple complex {{on the site}} without parallel in western Europe, {{with more than a}} dozen large temples that were linked to outhouses and kitchens by <b>carefully</b> constructed stone pavements.|$|E
5|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, lead(II) nitrate provides {{one of two}} convenient and reliable sources of dinitrogen tetroxide. By <b>carefully</b> drying lead(II) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel, nitrogen dioxide is produced, which dimerizes into the desired compound.|$|E
5|$|On {{completion}} of {{delivery of the}} radioactive sources, the applicators are <b>carefully</b> removed from the body. Patients typically recover quickly from the brachytherapy procedure, enabling it to often be performed on an outpatient basis.|$|E
5|$|Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it {{gradually}} renders people incapable of tending {{for their own}} needs, caregiving is essentially the treatment and must be <b>carefully</b> managed {{over the course of}} the disease.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to {{the release}} of the inquest verdict on 19 December 2013, the current Minister of Public Safety, Steven Blaney, stated that he had asked his {{officials}} to <b>carefully</b> review the jury's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The Lamu Fort was {{declared}} a scheduled monument on 15 May 1984. Restoration was undertaken <b>carefully.</b> A temporary exhibition was opened in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{marks the}} {{starting}} point of the Great River Race and is on the course of the Twickenham Regatta. As the ferry has right-of-way over rowed craft, the races have to be <b>carefully</b> timed to ensure that the ferry does not interfere with their running.|$|E
5|$|The fleece {{would be}} removed intact, then <b>carefully</b> folded {{to make it}} easier to sort out the {{different}} grades of wool at the mill.|$|E
5|$|The sheep at {{this time}} {{would have been much}} more {{variable}} than modern breeds, which have been <b>carefully</b> selected for specific characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The water then <b>carefully</b> {{evaporated}} {{from the}} acidic solution to produce crystals of SnCl2·2H2O. This dihydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous using acetic anhydride.|$|E
5|$|There are cables with A plugs on both ends, {{which may}} be valid if the cable includes, for example, a USB host-to-host {{transfer}} device with 2 ports, but they could also be non-standard and erroneous and should be used <b>carefully.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though silk was {{exported}} to foreign countries in great amounts, sericulture remained {{a secret that}} the Chinese <b>carefully</b> guarded. Consequently, other peoples invented wildly varying accounts {{of the source of}} the incredible fabric.|$|E
5|$|Visuospatial or {{constructional}} abnormalities {{here may}} be associated with parietal lobe pathology, and abnormalities in executive functioning tests may indicate frontal lobe pathology. This kind of brief cognitive testing is regarded as a screening process only, and any abnormalities are more <b>carefully</b> assessed using formal neuropsychological testing.|$|E
5|$|While {{the real}} {{supplies}} {{in the north}} were <b>carefully</b> hidden, matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south. In the area named Brian after camouflage officer Brian Robb, over 700 dummy stacks, representing food, petrol, ammunition and other supplies, were constructed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the renewed}} failure, Sapountzakis was {{relieved}} of his command {{and replaced by}} Crown Prince Constantine. Constantine now proceeded to <b>carefully</b> marshal his forces, bringing up more men and artillery. The Crown Prince formulated a new plan, whereby his army would feign an attack on Bizani from the southeast, while the main effort would be actually directed on the fortress area's southwestern flank.|$|E
5|$|Astrid Kruse Jensen (born 1975, {{educated in}} the Netherlands and Scotland) specializes in {{photographs}} taken at night which evoke the zone between reality and imagination. <b>Carefully</b> combining the effects of artificial light with the surrounding darkness, she creates mysterious images of lakes, swimming pools and solitary figures in the twilight. Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were laid out on the table and <b>carefully</b> counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a {{potential}} weapon. In the earlier years as a prison, prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, but this was later relaxed, provided that the prisoners communicated quietly.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics differ {{between various}} groups of Icelandic horses, {{depending}} on the focus of individual breeders. Some focus on animals for pack and draft work, which are conformationally distinct from those bred for work under saddle, which are <b>carefully</b> selected {{for their ability to}} perform the traditional Icelandic gaits. Others are bred solely for horsemeat. Some breeders focus on favored coat colors.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of building a station in space, space agencies train astronauts extensively, preparing them to encounter surprises during spacewalks, teaching them how to assemble special tools and equipment, and <b>carefully</b> coordinating every activity during spacewalks. From 1998 to 2005, thirty-seven space shuttle missions were scheduled to assemble, outfit and begin experiments and research aboard the station.|$|E
5|$|Hancock's {{name was}} printed, not signed, on the Dunlap broadside; his iconic {{signature}} appears {{on a different}} document—a sheet of parchment that was <b>carefully</b> handwritten sometime after July 19 and signed on August 2 by Hancock and those delegates present. Known as the engrossed copy, this is the famous document {{on display at the}} National Archives in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore {{that has been}} the subject of several studies. Early studies {{concluded}} that the plant digested proteinaceous offerings, though the methods were crude. Subsequent studies done more <b>carefully</b> tested for the presence of protease activity and found none, though it was noted that the plant has a great capacity for capturing and killing prey.|$|E
5|$|If {{not treated}} <b>carefully,</b> {{necrosis}} will spread, causing skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle {{to separate from}} healthy tissue and eventually slough with serous exudate. The slough may be superficial or deep, sometimes down to the bone. Gangrene and secondary infections commonly occurs and can result in loss of digits and limbs.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the motion}} gear rings {{and the upper}} drive wheel both had 600 teeth, which by Su's {{mathematical}} precision <b>carefully</b> calculated measured units {{of the day in}} a division of 1/600. These gears, having 600 teeth, thus ensured the division of the day into measurements of 2 minutes and 24 seconds each.|$|E
5|$|Labradors have a {{well-known}} reputation for appetite, and some individuals may be highly indiscriminate, eating digestible and non-food objects alike. They are persistent and persuasive in requesting food. For this reason, the Labrador owner must <b>carefully</b> control their dog's food intake to avoid obesity {{and its associated}} health problems (see below).|$|E
5|$|Lamarck {{was largely}} {{ignored by the}} major French {{zoologist}} Cuvier, but he attracted much more interest abroad. The book was read <b>carefully,</b> but its thesis rejected, by nineteenth century scientists including the geologist Charles Lyell and the comparative anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Darwin acknowledged Lamarck as an important zoologist, and his theory a forerunner of Darwin's evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 1877, gamblers Jim Levy and Charlie Harrison {{argued over}} {{a game of}} cards in a saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They met in an alley {{following}} an argument about a card game. Harrison shot first, but missed. Levy aimed <b>carefully</b> and hit Harrison, who died a week later.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans build nests {{specialized}} {{for both}} {{day or night}} use. These are <b>carefully</b> constructed; young orangutans learn from observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. In fact, nest-building is a leading cause in young orangutans leaving their mother for the first time. From six months of age onwards, orangutans practice nest-building and gain proficiency {{by the time they}} are three years old.|$|E
5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded {{must be very}} <b>carefully</b> designed to facilitate the moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E
