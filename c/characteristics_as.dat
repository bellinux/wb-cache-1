5|$|Although {{tropical}} cyclones in {{the extreme}} eastern Atlantic are typically propelled westward by high pressures from a subtropical ridge, this depression took an atypical northwestward path along a breach in the ridge from a previous disturbance. Its cyclonic structure steadily improved as a sharply curved rainband, resembling the precursor to an eye, tightened around the center. At 06:00UTC on August30, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Fred 390mi (625km) east-southeast of Praia, Cape Verdeamong the four easternmost locations for a tropical storm to form since modern record-keeping began in 1851. A steady trend of intensification ensued while Fred moved through a region with ample tropical moisture, light upper winds, and above-average sea surface temperatures. The storm developed a thick, circular central dense overcast with good outflow, and the eye feature became well established {{at all levels of}} the circulation. Based on these <b>characteristics,</b> <b>as</b> well as satellite intensity estimates of 75mph (120km/h) winds, Fred was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 00:00UTC, August31. Then centered 165mi (270km) east-southeast of Sal, Cape Verde, it became the easternmost tropical cyclone ever to attain hurricane status in the tropical Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Able {{was a rare}} {{hurricane}} {{that formed}} outside the typical North Atlantic hurricane season. The first tropical cyclone in 1951, Able developed from a trough of low pressure on May 15 about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda. Initially subtropical in nature, Able acquired tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>as</b> it moved over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and attained hurricane status on May 17 {{off the coast of}} Florida. This made Able one of only four May Atlantic hurricanes on record. On May 22 Able reached peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) about 70miles (115km) off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The hurricane weakened as it turned eastward, and became an extratropical cyclone on May 23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>as</b> it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Greta was an {{extremely}} large late-season Atlantic hurricane in the 1956 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from a tropical depression near Jamaica on October30, the system initially featured non-tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>as</b> it tracked northward. By November2, the system began producing gale-force winds around the low pressure area; however, winds {{near the center of}} circulation were calm. By November3, the system intensified into a tropical storm and was named Greta. Steadily strengthening, Greta attained hurricane intensity on November4, eventually reaching a peak intensity with 100mph (155km/h) winds. Shortly after, Greta began to gradually weaken as it tracked over cooler waters. The storm eventually became extratropical on November7 over the central Atlantic. Although Greta did not directly impact land as a tropical storm or hurricane, it generated large swells that impacted numerous areas. One person was killed in Puerto Rico and coastal damages from the waves amounted to roughly $3.6million (1956 USD).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Josephine was a {{long-lived}} Atlantic hurricane {{that threatened}} the East Coast of the United States {{for several days}} in October 1984. The fifteenth tropical cyclone, tenth named storm, and third hurricane of the season, Josephine developed from an area of disturbed weather near the Bahamas on October7, forming with subtropical characteristics. It quickly organized, and gained tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>as</b> it strengthened into a tropical storm on October8. Gradual intensification occurred thereafter, reaching hurricane status on October10. The storm headed northward, remaining well offshore of the eastern United States. Josephine strengthened further and peaked as a moderately strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on October12. On the following day, Josephine weakened back to a Category1 hurricane before becoming nearly stationary. It later headed northeastward and paralleled the coast well offshore of Nova Scotia. By October17, Josephine weakened back to a tropical storm, shortly before beginning to execute a cyclonic loop {{to the south of}} Newfoundland. While executing the cyclonic loop, Josephine became extratropical on October18.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} a tropical storm, {{the movement of}} Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October28. The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped cloud band and maximum winds far {{from the center of}} the storm at the time. Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81°F (27°C). That afternoon, it gained full tropical <b>characteristics,</b> <b>as</b> an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast. The eye became clearly defined, although it was small in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995season, as it turned northward in response to the nearby low.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of acquired <b>characteristics</b> <b>as</b> the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Inheritance of acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage <b>characteristics</b> <b>as</b> those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|Stagnicola perplexa {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} and shares habitats and a geographical range comparable to Mythicomyces corneipes. S.perplexa generally has a more faded coloration, and produces brownish spore prints lacking purplish tones. The two species can be reliably distinguished by microscopic <b>characteristics,</b> <b>as</b> Stagnicola has smooth spores and cheilocystidia with thin walls. Owing to its similarly colored cap and habitat amongst mosses, Phaeocollybia attenuata might be confused with M.corneipes. Phaeocollybia attenuata can readily be differentiated in the field by the long wirelike pseudorhiza extending below the substrate, and microscopically by the much more heavily ornamented limoniform-globose spores and absence of pleurocystidia. Other morphologically similar species include Hypholoma udum and H.elongatum, but unlike M.corneipes, both of these agarics have smooth spores, yellow chrysocystidia, and lack metuloids. The lookalike Galerina sideroides is found in Washington, Michigan, and Sweden, where it fruits in groups on rotten conifer logs. It has distinct microscopic characteristics, such as {{a wider range of}} basidial widths (20–40µm), and a lack of pleurocystidia.|$|E
