40|$|Consider two {{insurance}} companies (or two {{branches of the}} same company) that receive premiums at different rates and then split the amount they pay in fixed proportions for each claim (for simplicity we assume that they are equal). We model the occurrence of claims according to a Poisson process. The ruin is achieved when the corresponding two-dimensional risk process first leaves the positive quadrant. We will consider two scenarios of the controlled process: refraction and impulse control. In the first case the dividends are payed out when the two-dimensional risk process exits the fixed region. In the second scenario, whenever the process hits the horizontal line, it is reduced by paying dividends to some fixed point in the positive quadrant where it waits for the next claim to arrive. In both models we calculate the discounted <b>cumulative</b> <b>dividend</b> payments until the ruin. This paper is the first attempt to understand the effect of dependencies of two portfolios on the joint optimal strategy of paying dividends.

40|$|The Brazilian {{preference}} shares, in general, {{except when}} they present specific features, such as mandatory redemption and <b>cumulative</b> <b>dividends,</b> meet the accounting definition of equity instruments. However, {{the scientific literature}} believes that those shares {{that do not have}} discretion to avoid the delivery of cash must be classified as financial liabilities. In a context in which remain differences of understanding of their proper accounting treatment, the following question arises: preferred shares of Brazilian companies are being recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the theoretical and normative precepts? Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} verify if the preference shares of Brazilian companies have been recognized in the financial statements for according to the scientific literature and accounting standards. Through content analysis, we analyzed the information of 157 companies listed on BM&FBOVESPA. The results show that 155 companies classify its preference shares as equity instruments and two as financial liabilities. These two companies, as well as 149 of those which qualify as equity instruments, are treating them properly in its accounting. The other six companies should present its preference shares as liabilities, given the absence of discretion to avoid cash delivery, feature present in financial liabilities, unlike equity instruments. It is noticed that, unlike what happens, for instance, in the US market, it is not possible to classify all Brazilian preference shares as a financial liability, since, in Brazil, they are used in different legal format of those widely found in that market. Moreover, almost all of the analyzed shares have essential features for classification as equity instruments.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Past {{research}} on Head Start {{has focused on}} child outcomes, yet Head Start services also target the behaviors of parents. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study (FFCW), the current study examined the effect of Head Start on mother (n = 3, 575) and father (n = 1, 812) involvement in activities at home with children. The first four waves of FFCW data followed {{children and their parents}} from birth to age five. FFCW data included families from low- to middle-income backgrounds allowing direct comparisons in this study between very low-income families whose children were eligible for Head Start to more advantaged families whose children were not. Using scales of parental involvement in at-home activities with children, mothers and fathers of Head Start students were compared to mothers and fathers of children in parent care, daycare, pre-kindergarten and preschool. A two-step analytic process was used (a) to establish that average levels of parent involvement varied significantly across childcare setting groups at each of the three waves, and (b) to control for known background characteristics and previous parent involvement while predicting post-intervention parent involvement. In the first step, analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences between mothers of Head Start children and mothers of children in other childcare categories before Head Start entry, and revealed positive effects of Head Start on mother involvement after program exit. In the second step, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression further controlled background characteristics that have predicted mother involvement in previous literature. The OLS results supported the ANOVA finding that Head Start positively influenced mother involvement. Although ANOVA and OLS regression results suggested that Head Start did not affect the involvement of fathers, results indicated that the level of father involvement when the child was one year old predicted involvement when the child was five years old, even after controlling for whether fathers lived with the child. A post-hoc Structural Equation Model (SEM) further examined the effect of fathers' involvement and co-residence in years one and three on involvement at year five. Fathers who reported high levels of involvement in daily activities when children were very young maintained high levels as children moved through preschool and into kindergarten. Efforts to engage fathers early on in the daily lives of their children may bring <b>cumulative</b> <b>dividends</b> for both father and child through his continued involvement as the child grows older, even - and perhaps especially - when the father no longer lives with the child...|$|R

40|$|The {{compound}} Poisson risk {{model and}} the compound Poisson risk model perturbed by diffusion are considered {{in the presence of}} a dividend barrier with solvency constraints. Moreover, it extends the known result due to [1]. Ref. [1] finds the optimal dividend policy is of a barrier type for a jump-diffusion model with exponentially distributed jumps. In this paper, it turns out that there can be two different solutions depending on the model’s parameters. Furthermore, an interesting result is given: the proportional transaction cost has no effect on the dividend barrier. The objective of the corporation is to maximize the <b>cumulative</b> expected discounted <b>dividends</b> payout with solvency constraints before the time of ruin. It is well known that under some reasonable assumptions, optimal dividend strategy is a barrier strategy, i. e., there is a level b_{ 1 }(b_{ 2 }) so that whenever surplus goes above the level b_{ 1 }(b_{ 2 }), the excess is paid out as dividends. However, the optimal level b_{ 1 }(b_{ 2 }) may be unacceptably low from a solvency point of view. Therefore, some constraints should imposed on an insurance company such as to pay out dividends unless the surplus has reached a level b^{ 1 }_{c}>b_{ 1 }(b^ 2 _{c}>b_{ 2 }). We show that in this case a barrier strategy at b^{ 1 }_{c}(b^ 2 _{c}) is optimal...|$|R
40|$|In {{mathematical}} finance, increasing {{attention is}} being paid to (a) the construction of explicit models for the flow of market information, and (b) {{the use of such}} models as a basis for asset pricing. One notable approach in this spirit is the information-based asset pricing theory of Brody, Hughston and Macrina (BHM), in which so-called information processes are introduced and ingeniously integrated into the general theory of asset pricing. Building on the BHM theory, this thesis presents a number of new developments in this area. I begin with a brief review of the BHM framework, leading to a discussion of the simplest asset pricing models. Then the first main topic of the thesis, which is based in part on Brody, Hughston & Yang (2013 b), is developed, which concerns asset pricing with continuous cash flows in the presence of noisy information. In particular, an information-based model for the pricing of storable commodities and associated derivatives thereof is introduced. The model employs the concept of market information about future supply and demand as a basis for valuation. Physical ownership of a commodity is regarded as providing the beneficiary with a continuous "convenience dividend", equivalent to a continuous cash flow. The market filtration is assumed to be generated jointly by: (i) an information process concerning the future convenience-dividend flow; and (ii) a convenience-dividend process that provides information about current and past dividend levels. The price of a commodity is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the <b>cumulative</b> future convenience <b>dividends,</b> suitably discounted, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. In the situation where the convenience dividend is modelled by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the prices of options on commodities, both when the underlying is a spot price and when the underlying is a futures price, can be derived in closed form. The dynamical equation of the price process is worked out, leading to an identification of the associated innovations process. The resulting model is sufficiently tractable to allow for simulation studies of the resulting commodity price trajectories. The second main topic of the thesis, which is based in part on Brody, Hughston & Yang (2013 a), concerns a generalisation of concept of information process to the situation where the noise is modelled by a general Levy process. There are many practical circumstances in which signal or noise, or both, exhibit discontinuities. This part of the thesis develops a rather general theory of signal processing involving Levy noise, with the view to the introduction of a broad and tractable family of information processes suitable for modelling situations involving discontinuous signals, discontinuous noise, and discontinuous information. In this context, each information process is associated with a certain "noise type", and an information process of a given noise type is distinguished by the message that it carries. More specifically, each information process is associated in a precise way to a Levy process, which I call the fiducial process. The fiducial process is the information process that results {{in the case of a}} null message, and can be regarded as a "pure noise" process of the given noise type. Information processes can be classified by the characteristics of the associated fiducial processes. To keep the discussion simple, I mainly consider the case where the message is represented by a single random variable. I construct the optimal filter in the form of a map that takes the a priori distribution of the message to an a posteriori distribution that depends on the information made available. A number of examples are presented and worked out in detail. The results vary remarkably in detail and character for the different types of information processes considered, and yet there is an overall unity in the scheme that allows for the construction of numerous explicit and interesting examples. The results presented in the second part of the thesis therefore have the potential to pave the way toward a variety of new applications, including applications to problems in finance.
