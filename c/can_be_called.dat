5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> monovalent (or specific) {{if they have}} affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (but potentially different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (but potentially different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|Outside of meetings, {{members of}} the MPC <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> upon by Parliament to answer {{questions}} regarding their decisions, via parliamentary committee meetings, often those of the Treasury Committee. MPC members also speak to audiences throughout the country, with the same aim. Their views and expectations for inflation are also republished in the Bank's quarterly inflation report.|$|E

5|$|A {{referendum}} in Croatia <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within {{the purview of}} parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution {{to call for a}} referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.|$|E
5|$|Model was {{the master}} of the type of defense which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> 'defense limited in time'; in which you defend as long as {{possible}} but then retreat to avoid breakthrough and destruction. He was always at the critical points and took away battlegroups or even single battalions from less threatened sectors. With these units holes were plugged at other locations or short counterattacks were executed and so opportunities were created for bigger solutions. Thus, a closed front was guaranteed while the mixing and tearing apart of units was viewed as the smaller evil.|$|E

Its circuitry is supposedly identical {{to that of the}} XS, but has a 24-bit DAC that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> from any of five S/PDIF inputs. It has more features, a more well-endowed power supply allowing delivery of 80 watts' music, and can bi-amp suitable speakers by adding a secondary power amplifier.|$|E

5|$|The Sabor {{meets in}} public {{sessions}} in two periods; the first from 15 January to 30 June, {{and the second}} from 15 September to 15 December. Extra sessions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> by the President of the Republic, {{by the president of}} the parliament or by the government. The powers of the legislature include enactment and amendment of the constitution, enactment of laws, adoption of the state budget, declarations of war and peace, alteration of the country's boundaries, calling and conducting referenda and elections, appointments and relief of office, supervising the work of the Government of Croatia and other holders of public powers responsible to the Sabor, and granting amnesty. Decisions are made based on a majority vote if more than half of the Chamber is present, except in cases of constitutional issues.|$|E
5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of. Thus, once the party has received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> {{would be unfair to}} them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs of}} residents in that GRC.|$|E
5|$|A linear {{chain of}} amino acid {{residues}} {{is called a}} polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. Short polypeptides, containing less than 20–30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides. The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a protein {{is defined by the}} sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids; however, in certain organisms the genetic code can include selenocysteine and—in certain archaea—pyrrolysine. Shortly after or even during synthesis, the residues in a protein are often chemically modified by post-translational modification, which alters the physical and chemical properties, folding, stability, activity, and ultimately, the function of the proteins. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> prosthetic groups or cofactors. Proteins can also work together to achieve a particular function, and they often associate to form stable protein complexes.|$|E

5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved {{as a means of}} acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.|$|E
5|$|The clade Neoceratopsia {{includes}} all ceratopsians more derived than psittacosaurids. Another subset of neoceratopsians is called Coronosauria, which currently {{includes all}} ceratopsians more derived than Auroraceratops. Coronosaurs show the first {{development of the}} neck frill and the fusion of the first several neck vertebrae to support the increasingly heavy head. Within Coronosauria, three groups are generally recognized, although the membership of these groups varies somewhat from study to study and some animals may not fit in any of them. One group <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> Protoceratopsidae and includes Protoceratops and its closest relatives, all Asian. Another group, Leptoceratopsidae, includes mostly North American animals that are {{more closely related to}} Leptoceratops. The Ceratopsoidea includes animals like Zuniceratops, which are more closely related to the family Ceratopsidae. This last family includes Triceratops and all the large North American ceratopsians and is further divided into the subfamilies Centrosaurinae and Ceratopsinae (also known as Chasmosaurinae).|$|E

5|$|The {{domestic}} cat {{was first}} classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th {{edition of his}} Systema Naturae published in 1758. Because of modern phylogenetics, domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris. This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus. Wildcats have also {{been referred to as}} various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris. The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777, but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature. A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin 1904) but now this population {{is considered to be a}} part of domestic cat.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are {{based on the idea that}} language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E
