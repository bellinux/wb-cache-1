40|$|Sketch {{from the}} {{scrapbook}} of Sarah E. E. Mitchell of Lisdillon on the East Coast of Tasmania 1874. Sketch 27 - Taken 19. 4. 1875 - by Catherine Mitchell. Picnic at Fisherman’s Island, Little Swanport River. S. E. E. M, Minnie (Mary) Giblin, Kate, Amy M. J. M., Mark S Mitchell looking for oysters, found the water deep and Hamilton Radcliffe helped pull him up. Sometimes we went round in our boat, but oftener, rode & drove to Hand’s <b>clearing</b> <b>lease</b> farm & called for Fisherman William who brought his boat & took us about, & cook fish for us. Fisherman’s Island {{used to be}} claimed by Lisdillon Estate & let to men for a bag of oysters per annum. William died in Lisdillon kitchen on the couch, {{he said he would}} like to die there. He said he only wanted money to leave to Miss Kate – He left £ 30 with father but leaving no “will” after funeral expenses were paid – His boat was sold & the money was given to the Government, after trying to find his people in England.

In 1762 building land was leased, but the lease was signed by a Christian named Samuel Champion since it was not <b>clear</b> that <b>leases</b> signed by Jews were legal.

50|$|During {{the early}} {{settlement}} of eastern Australia, the Kiama area was settled by wheat farmers as the soil was volcanic and rain-swept {{unlike most of}} Australia. Early Jamberoo was the population centre from about 1830 to the 1860s and when the wheat failed to grow, the farmers switched to dairying. During this period Kiama became {{the best example of}} 'chain migration' in Australia as many assisted migrants came from Northern Ireland on <b>clearing</b> <b>leases</b> and eventually half the marriages in the Kiama Anglican Church in a hundred years had Northern Irish Protestant ancestry. Kiama was one of the birthplaces of the Australian dairy industry with the first Dairy Factory (The Kiama Pioneer Factory) and first Dairy Co-operative in Australia. There were three original major land grants, Thomas Surfleet Kendall (son of lapsed missionary Reverend Thomas Kendall), Michael Hindmarsh and Matthew Cignarella, all of which married sisters of the Rutter family. The Kendalls were cousins of Henry Kendall, the famous Australian poet. The Kendall name is remembered today in several places such as the spooky Kendall Cemetery in Kiama Heights and Kendalls Beach. The Hindmarshs are remembered in Kiama's main park, Hindmarsh Park, and after 10 generations still live on their original land.|$|R

It also leased fibre optic capacity between Wellington and Christchurch from the Electricorp. The company also had digital microwave links with the major provincial cities of New Zealand. It installed further fibre optic capacity between Wellington and Auckland to increase transmission capacity and provide route diversity. Fibre loops and duct lines were installed in the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch central business districts.|$|R
50|$|The commissioners in {{a stroke}} of intuition had the public lot <b>leased,</b> <b>cleared</b> and {{converted}} into a temporary field. The time came in 1866 when the courthouse was condemned and a proposition was made to the Ohio General Assembly for authorization of $100,000 {{to build a new}} courthouse. The next year the old courthouse was razed and the courts were held in the First German Reformed Church on West Church Street. The approval from the Assembly came in 1867 and construction on the public plot began soon thereafter. The construction was completed in 1872 and came in at a total of over $138,000.|$|R

The Seventh Circuit, the only court of appeals to have considered the issue, said “yes” in Precision Industries, Inc. v.

He continued the evictions to make way for sheep farmers which his mother began when his father was chieftain, and most of the clan was forced to emigrate to British North America, as part of what was later known as the Highland Clearances. Robert Burns wrote a satirical poem about Glengarry in the Address of Beelzebub.|$|R
25|$|In September 2013, then-Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver, in line {{to become}} the next {{commissioner}} upon David Stern's retirement in February 2014, made the announcement that the Milwaukee Bucks would need to replace the aging BMO Harris Bradley Center because of its small size and lack of amenities. The team had recently signed a lease through the 2016–17 NBA season, but the NBA made it <b>clear</b> that the <b>lease</b> would not be renewed past that point. With counties surrounding Milwaukee passing ordinances that they would not approve a regional tax option to fund a new arena, rumors began swirling that owner Herb Kohl would need to sell all or part of his ownership of the team. Though Kohl had repeatedly stated he would not sell to someone intent on moving the Bucks out of Wisconsin, many had pegged the team as a likely potential candidate to move to Seattle.|$|R
