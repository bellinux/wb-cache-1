40|$|Embedded {{condition}} monitoring sensors that eliminate unanticipated failures of critical or high value equipment improve asset utilization while streamlining maintenance and support operations. General Electric and Rolls Royce use embedded sensors on their jet engines that have eliminated failures and allowed maintenance {{to be performed}} on an as-needed basis. As a result, airplane utilization increases while enabling the consolidation of maintenance operations. In more traditional industrial settings, {{condition monitoring}} of manufacturing and industrial equipment can quickly impact bottom lines through improved productivity and streamlined operations in ways comparable to what is already being realized in the aviation industry. Wireless sensor nodes provide embedded sensing with little overhead or infrastructure cost as long as appropriate power sources are available to sustain the node over its target lifetime. Energy is the limiting factor for sensor node lifetimes and data streams. Since most manufacturing and industrial equipment have some associated vibration spectrum when operating, transducing the mechanical energy of vibrations to {{a small amount of}} electrical energy electromagnetically was explored as a way of powering condition monitoring sensors. 	Large pump motors and a machine tool were surveyed to characterize input vibration accelerations associated with manufacturing and industrial operations. Harvestable acceleration peaks occurred below 120 Hz and had magnitudes near or less than 0. 1 g. Metal cutting vibrations were characterized and shown to have vibration frequencies proportional to the number of cutting teeth and the spindle RPM. It was also shown that, the 0. 4 - 1. 0 g acceleration impulses associated with the rapid axis motion of a machine tool are harvestable. 	Simple magnet and coil as well as coreless electromagnetic architectures were pursued using an overall device size constrain of a cube with 2. 5 cm sides. That device size was roughly the same as a c-cell battery that is capable of powering a wireless sensor node for five to ten years. The target power for the harvester designs was the time-averaged powers of hundreds of microwatts to single milliwatts required by commercial wireless sensor nodes. Prototype vibration harvesters based on magnet-coil and voice-coil transducer designs were fabricated and evaluated. Both were able to produce about a milliwatt on a vibration platform for an input acceleration amplitude of 0. 1 g at frequencies consistent with those characterized on the pump motors and machine tool. The power densities of the unoptomized proof of concept prototypes were comparable to commercial vibration harvester but at less than one seventh the size. 	The voice-coil prototype was installed on several 15 - 30 kW pump motors running support systems for a microfabrication lab, and unrectified powers of 0. 2 ¬- 1. 5 mW were harvested. Similarly, 0. 8 - 1. 8 mW was harvested from metal cutting vibrations while facemilling cast iron and stainless steel, showing that powers comparable to commercial sense node requirements could be harvested from industrial settings. 	<b>Coreless</b> <b>motor</b> architectures proved to be best suited for industrial settings because the unconstrained magnetic flux of simple magnet-coil designs interacted with the iron and steel mounting surfaces commonly found on large machines. Simulated coreless magnetic circuit designs showed that gap magnetic flux densities approaching one tesla could be possible but were not implemented...|$|E

25|$|A {{servomotor}} is a motor, {{very often}} {{sold as a}} complete module, which is used within a position-control or speed-control feedback control system mainly control valves, such as motor-operated control valves. Servomotors are used in applications such as machine tools, pen plotters, and other process systems. Motors intended {{for use in a}} servomechanism must have well-documented characteristics for speed, torque, and power. The speed vs. torque curve is quite important and is high ratio for a servo motor. Dynamic response characteristics such as winding inductance and rotor inertia are also important; these factors limit the overall performance of the servomechanism loop. Large, powerful, but slow-responding servo loops may use conventional AC or DC motors and drive systems with position or speed feedback on the motor. As dynamic response requirements increase, more specialized motor designs such as <b>coreless</b> <b>motors</b> are used.

5000|$|The latest mini-z chassis {{released}} {{at the end}} of October 2009 was the MR03 chassis. The most noticeable change is using dynamic strut front suspension instead of sliding knuckle. It uses a small <b>coreless</b> servo <b>motor</b> instead of the brushed servo motor for steering. Small servo motor allows the batteries to be closer to the centerline of the car for lower polar moment if inertia. The modified ASF receiver board comes with a reverse delay of exactly [...]01 second, which for all practical purposes is instant. The reverse delay can be programmed back in using the optional computer interface cable. The MR-03, like the dNaNo, has an optional gyro that can be installed on the car. The gyro senses when the car is about the spin out. It corrects by reducing power to the motor or by correcting steering. The amount of throttle and steering correction from the gyro can be programmed via the ASF connector. The front end of the car has interchangeable parts to allow use of both narrow and wide AutoScale bodies. The rear end of the car uses a different t-plate design but the motor pod mounting holes are the same. This allows motor mounts from the previous generation MR-02 and MR-015 cars to work on an MR-03.

40|$|In {{the design}} of a Steer-by-Wire system, either direct drive motors or geared motors are used, {{independently}} of the motor type. Gearboxes allow for changes in the motor’s torque and speed ranges, thus enabling the motor to function at its best operating ranges. As a consequence smaller motors can be used. Nevertheless, gearboxes introduce nonlinearities to the system such as friction, backlash and flexibility. If a motor with a gearbox is selected for the driver’s feedback system or for the rack and pinion steering system, a controller is required to compensate for these gearbox drawbacks as well as the drawbacks associated with the motor’s amplifier.

The calculation of eddy currents in the magnets requires the simulation of the inverter and the filter {{to obtain the}} harmonic content of the stator currents and FEM analysis of the magnets in the rotor. Due to the low inductance in coreless machines, the induced eddy current losses in the rotor remain lower than in traditional slotted machines. If only machine losses are considered, filters in DC/AC converters are not required in machines with wide airgaps as time harmonic losses in the rotor are very low.

The properties of coreless machine topologies are investigated and some simplifications are proposed for time efficient 3 D-FEM analysis.

As a consequence, smaller and low cost motors can be used in comparison with direct drive motors. Nevertheless, gearboxes introduce nonlinearities to the system such as friction, backlash and flexibility. When geared motors are employed, a controller using a torque sensor or a torque observer is normally required to compensate for the drawbacks associated with the gearbox and the servo-amplifier. The design of such a controller requires the comprehensive knowledge of the system’s dynamics. In this paper, a general approach to model accurately amplifier–motor–gearbox assemblies has been developed. This approach that takes into account backlash, flexibility, friction for stiction and sliding, identification procedures, is applicable {{to a wide range of}} amplifier–motor–gearbox assemblies. It is explained by applying it to a particular case: an amplifier–motor–gearbox assembly for a driver’s force feedback system. In the design of driver’s force feedback systems for steer-by-wire systems or for high fidelity Human in the Loop (HiL) driving simulators, either direct drive motors or geared motors are used, independently of the motor type.

The drivetrain was developed for an ultra-efficient eco vehicle competing in the Shell 2013 Eco Marathon. Various clutch mechanisms were examined. In spite of the complexity and losses associated with additional bearings and release surfaces, an actuated dog clutch was chosen as it offers superior performance due to the dual capability of freewheeling and regenerative braking that results. Track data from the event is presented along with experimental work that indicates that the clutch mechanism reduces power consumption by more than 35 % for a ferrous permanent magnet propulsion motor. Savings were reduced to 5 % for a <b>coreless</b> permanent magnet <b>motor</b> coupled to the driveline via an 11 : 1 straight cut spur gear arrangement.
