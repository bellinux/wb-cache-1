After returning to his seat at 19A (near the fuel tanks and wing, and against {{the skin of the}} plane), he <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had an upset stomach. He was seen pulling a blanket over himself.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill's tenure lasted {{just six}} months; he {{resigned}} after {{a dispute with}} chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal to permit O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, the tipping point was the refusal of Chase to permit the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E
5|$|The illness {{emphasised}} certain {{traits in}} his character. He argued cuttingly, his biting satire did not shrink at insults, and his expressions could be rude and cruel. Though in general Marx had a blind {{faith in his}} closest friends, nevertheless he himself <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was sometimes too mistrustful and unjust even to them. His verdicts, not only about enemies but even about friends, were sometimes so harsh that even less sensitive people would take offence… There must have been few whom he did not criticize like this… not even Engels was an exception.|$|E

He {{suggests}} she take up an activity like ice skating instead, but when she eagerly asks to do <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> refuses once again, <b>complaining</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not want get up early each morning.|$|R
5|$|In 1738, Zahir's forces {{captured}} the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, {{who was known}} for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, hoping to see two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed multazim of Jiddin's subdistrict.|$|E
5|$|In February 1946, Shaughnessy {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} return to Maryland amidst mounting criticism at Pittsburgh, which included the threat of resignation from assistant coaches Charles Hartwig, Bobby Hoel and Stan Olenn. University of Maryland president Dr. H. C. Byrd, himself a former football coach, called Shaughnessy one of the top-three coaches in the nation. Shaughnessy <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not given a fair chance to succeed at Pittsburgh and that controversy over his role with the Redskins was without basis. The Pittsburgh athletic board had recommended Shaughnessy be retained as coach if he resigned from the Redskins, but he refused.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 1905, {{before the}} start of the 1905–06 season, Stuart was {{suspended}} from the league after the western teams <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the Pittsburgh Professionals. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals. A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.|$|E

5|$|Miyamoto {{himself had}} {{high hopes for}} his new project. He lacked the {{technical}} skills to program it alone, so instead came up with concepts and consulted technicians {{to see if they}} were possible. He wanted to make the characters different sizes, move in different manners and react in various ways. Yokoi thought Miyamoto's original design was too complex, though he had some difficult suggestions himself, such as using see-saws to catapult the hero across the screen (eventually found too hard to program, though a similar concept would appear in the aforementioned Popeye arcade game). Miyamoto then thought of using sloped platforms, barrels and ladders. When he specified that the game would have multiple stages, the four-man programming team <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was essentially asking them to make the game repeatedly. Nevertheless, they followed Miyamoto's design, creating a total of approximately 20kilobytes of content. Yukio Kaneoka composed a simple soundtrack to serve as background music for the levels and story events.|$|E
5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E
5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to go sit under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E

5|$|Ashton Court {{dates back}} to before the 11th century. It is {{believed}} that a fortified manor stood on the site, given to Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Coutances, by William the Conqueror. In the Domesday Book it {{is referred to as}} a wealthy estate owned by the Bishop of Countances, with a manor house, a great hall, and courtyards entered through gatehouses. The property passed through successive owners {{and at the end of}} the 14th century it was considerably expanded when Thomas De Lions, a nobleman originally from France, obtained a permit to enclose a park for his manor. The house was owned by the Choke family for some time. In 1506 it was sold to Sir Giles Daubeney, a knight and a Chamberlain of Henry VII. Henry VIII gave the estate to Sir Thomas Arundel in 1541 and four years later in 1545 Sir Thomas sold it to John Smyth. The Smyth family owned the property for the next 400 years. Smyth also bought the land which had been owned, until the Dissolution of the Monasteries, by Bath Abbey. He used the land to extend the deer park, bringing him into conflict with the residents of Whitchurch, who <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had used common land.|$|E
5|$|Pound was 36 {{when he met}} the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} a love affair that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kronan began in October 1665, and the hull was launched on 31 July 1668. The English shipwright Francis Sheldon frequently came {{in conflict with}} the admiralty over the project. The navy administrators <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unduly delaying the project and was spending too much time on his own private business ventures. The most aggravating contention was Sheldon's extensive and lucrative export of mast timber to England. Sheldon in turn complained about constant delays on the navy's part and lack of funds. When the ship was launched, the slipway turned out to be too small and the rear section of the keel broke off during the launching. The admiralty demanded an explanation, but Sheldon's reply was that the damage was easily mended and that the problem was that the timber had been left to dry too long. The conflict between the Admiralty and Sheldon dragged on for several years and caused constant delays. The sculptures were finished in 1669, but the rigging, tackling, and arming was drawn out a further three years, to 1672. The first occasion that the ship sailed was during the celebrations of Charles XI's accession as monarch in December 1672.|$|E

5|$|What {{was seen}} as a failure to keep {{discipline}} on the team hurt Stengel's standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep in the dugout, and players <b>complained</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was growing more irritable with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.|$|E
