50|$|Beginning with de-collectivization in 1956, Poland was {{the only}} member of Comecon where the private sector predominated in agriculture. The state {{maintained}} indirect control, however, through the state agencies that distributed needed input materials and purchased agricultural produce. <b>Compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> quotas were maintained for farms until the beginning of the 1970s. The state also retained significant influence on the process of cultivation, restrictions on the size of farms, and limitations on the buying and selling of land. Until the beginning of the 1980s, the allocation system for fertilizers, machines, building materials, fuels, and other inputs discriminated severely against private farmers. As a result of these policies, private farms remained inefficiently small and labor-intensive.|$|E

40|$|The <b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> of {{agriculture}} products in Poland {{was introduced in}} 1951. The Communist government wanted to control agriculture production in this way. The shortages of food in towns caused big political problems and the communists tried to control farmers by the administrative and penal repression. In 1952 boards judging petty offences were established and they punished farmers by fines. They were high, especially for richer farmers “kulaks”, but for all groups of farmers they were severe. The efficiency of these fines was not very high, because farmers {{did not want to}} pay. Then the authorities introduced an arrest as a substitutive penalty, if the farmer didn’t pay the fine. This penalty gave good results – farmers started fulfilling the deliveries, but the system was very repressive. In 1955, when first syndromes of post-Stalin thaw started, the system became less repressive. In 1956 the range of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> was reduced and economic measures were applied to those, who didn’t fulfill the duty. They were abolished in 1971...|$|E

40|$|Already in {{the last}} years of the Second World War the {{peasantry}} of the Homokhátság region between the Danube and Tisza Rivers on the Great Plain had to activate some of their survival techniques. Some of these were rooted in past peasant skills (e. g. methods of hiding belongings and produce), while others were various adaptation techniques developed in response to the war conditions (e. g. black marketeering, barter trade). This defensive reaction of peasant society was evoked by the introduction of restrictive economic measures by the state (<b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> of produce, system of public supply), then by the fighting and the advancing armies, and inflation. After 1948 there was a radical change in relations between the authorities and the villages. The communist party-state launched an attack on multiple fronts against village society and traditional peasant farming. The method of income withdrawal through <b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> of produce was a minor irritation compared to the attacks on private property. Nevertheless, the compulsory deliveries were one of the factors that gave new strength to the defensive reflex of the peasantry. Between 1948 and 1956 the peasant population of the villages studied responded to actions by the state against the villages with varied and new adaptation techniques. All strata and members of the local peasant society had to resort to these methods. The attempt made by the party-state to divide rural society failed in practice to achieve the goal expressed in propagandistic terms: to turn the kulaks (more prosperous peasants) and the “working peasantry” against each other. Despite all the efforts by the authorities the patron-client relations linking the different strata of peasant society did not disappear, in fact, they were strengthened and served as a frame for the survival techniques...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{describe}} {{the destruction of}} the vineyards in the northern Bihar region. What was still a flourishing horticulture {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century declined between 1945 and 1989. Three factors played a role in the process of destruction. Chronologically the first was the <b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> system of the Rákosi era and its wine tax policy (1949 – 1953). The second factor was the termination of the private ownership of land (1961), the third can be linked to the spread of production for the market in household plots (1968). The decline of the vineyards accelerated between 1968 and 1989, and unquestionably reached its peak in the decades following the change of system when the classification of garden zone (involving the obligation to cultivate the land) was ended and as a consequence the vines were replaced by forest areas (from 1994 to the present) ...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of {{agricultural}} supply response {{is essential to}} investigate the impact of changes {{of agricultural}} marketing and pricing policies. Before market reform in Myanmar, domestic and export markets were monopolized by government and farmers had to sell quota of their marketable surplus at fixed prices. After market reform, <b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> system of agriculture produce was discontinued and private marketing was well-developed in domestic markets {{as well as in}} export of crops such as pulses. This article assesses the impact of market reform by examining acreage response to price with Nerlove partial- adjustment model covering yearly data from 1988 - 2004. Acreage response to liberalization of prices and marketing was statistically significant in export crops, Black gram, Green gram, Pigeon pea and Chickpea except Soybean with lack of export demand. Although the short-run elasticity of acreage was less than unity, the long-run elasticity was quite greater than unity. Agricultural market reform, with price incentive to farmers, can induce the motivation of production. However, complementary interventions for the improvement of infrastructure, marketing, access to inputs and credits, production technology etc are still prerequisite...|$|E

These exchanges are aimed at enhancing efficiencies of the existing value chain of commodities by developing appropriate platforms for modern spot markets, financing of commodities based on credible warehouse management arrangements, reducing transaction costs, supporting Futures Exchanges, regulators and the Government with standardized and structured spot markets for <b>compulsory</b> <b>delivery</b> in all agri-commodities. Successful operation of such technologiesdriven initiatives require congenial policy support as these are largely governed under the state laws of APMC. From the case study of NCDEX SPOT market in the Gulbarga district of Karnataka state, it has been observed that for facilitating the small and marginal farmers in participating in new age marketing system, it is required that all the stakeholders work seamlessly in an integrated manner, which are state agencies (warehousing, APMC, Mandi, Board, etc.), financial institutions, other infrastructural facilities, etc. With the help of NCDEX SPOT, tur grower-farmers in the Karnataka states are able to reduce the marketing cost by 50 - 70 per cent and are also able to sell their produce, whenever they want by paying a small charge for warehousing. It is also evident that the farmers could realize, on an average, 5 - 10 per cent higher price for their produce as compared to traditional APMC market. Although the business model seems to be working successfully and showing reasonable confidence to all the stakeholders, requires for upscaling across the board customization according to the law of land of respective states. However, it is a win-win proposition for the farmers-state governments-NCDEX SPOT-banks, etc, as its creates values at every stages of value chain. Agricultural and Food Policy,...|$|E
50|$|While {{it remains}} unclear how the Smallholders Party would have solved the {{problems}} resulting from their dwarf properties, the plans of the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) soon became clear. The model of Stalinist collectivization would be adopted and applied with physical force if necessary. In July 1948, government regulations allowed the seizure of larger landholdings from nagygazdák (Hungarian kulaks). These regulations enabled over 800 square kilometers of land to be confiscated, 60% of which went to recently formed farming co-operatives, the rest going to private peasants. This first serious attempt at collectivization corresponded with the first Five Year Plan, and both bore the marks of Stalinist agricultural policy. Both economic and direct police pressure were used to coerce peasants to join co-operatives, but large numbers opted instead to leave their villages. In the early 1950s, only one quarter of peasants agreed to join co-operatives. Even once collectivized, farms were subject to harsh <b>compulsory</b> <b>deliveries</b> (production quotas in physical units passed down from central planning) and incredibly low agricultural producer prices. Although individual families were allowed a small private household plot intended to serve their own personal needs, decrees passed in 1949 and 1950 limited these plots with an absolute limit of 4,300 square meters, and its output was also subject to <b>compulsory</b> <b>deliveries.</b> The Five Year Plan initially promised 11 billion forints of credit for co-operatives (later downscaled to 8 million) but by 1953, {{less than half of}} that had been made available. Without credit from the government, or any reasonable ability to earn a surplus, peasants were unable to invest in their own farms and the co-operatives began to crumble.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{rather than}} {{enforcing}} {{the system of}} <b>compulsory</b> crop <b>deliveries</b> and of workdays credit the collectivizers used monthly cash wages. Later in the ‘60s, cooperatives were permitted to enter into related and then general auxiliary businesses such as food processing, light industry, and service industry.|$|R

This signifies a further development of economic relationships between the collective farms and socialist industry, an expansion of commodity circulation between town and country, and a wider utilization in collective farm production of the law of value of commodity and monetary relationships in the interests of a sharp upsurge in the collective farm economy, a raising of the level of socialization of the means of production and of labor, and a gradual uplift of the collective and collective farm form of property to the level of general public property. ...|$|R

Here not so much the form of procurement is important as the state of production. Second, how much the state can spend on procurement of these products and how much the village will get for them. This determines the distribution of the national income between cities and villages. Third, how the income of agriculture will be distributed among its branches, regions and types of farms. This depends upon the prices of various agricultural products, upon zonal differentiation of prices, and the structure of prices. ...|$|R
5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other consumer goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their <b>compulsory</b> <b>deliveries</b> abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|R
50|$|Although {{certainly}} not radical, Imre Nagy's “New Course,” introduced in 1954, promised an easing of social tension between co-operatives and the state. First, the <b>compulsory</b> <b>deliveries</b> were abolished, alleviating much stress for farmers. Second, the government devoted nearly {{one quarter of}} its national investment to agriculture and in just one year “more tractors were put into service than during the entire 1950-3 period.” These new beginnings would not last long, however, as power struggles within the MDP {{in the spring of}} 1955 led to Mátyás Rákosi's return to power and a condemnation of the “right deviation” supported in the Nagy's New Course. Rákosi renewed the drive for collectivization, again using physical force to encourage membership. This attempt failed to last even as long as the previous drive. Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech and Rákosi's ensuing resignation led to second failure at collectivization. The weaknesses in the Stalinist model had been rather apparent to some after the first wave in the early 1950s, but the inflexibility of the Rákosi government left no room for any creative solutions.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of an Ethiopian farn household which captures three {{important aspects of}} the policy regime characterising the Derg period. These aspects are <b>compulsory</b> grain <b>delivery,</b> rationing in manufactured consumer goods, and rationing in modern farn inputs. The model involves two main innovations with the agricultural household modelling framework. First, a new procedure of analysing the impact of the policy of forced grain procurement is introduced. The procedure enables us to directly characterize the effects of that policy on farm households’ welfare, as well as the production and consumption choices they make. Second, it pulls together various strands of te relevant literature in a simple manner. In particular, it provides a more direct way of determining the welfare effects of rationing, <b>compulsory</b> grain <b>delivery,</b> prices and incomes. Both individual and joint effects can be handled this way. The comparative static properties of the model directly show that forced grain procurement by the state reduces the welfare of farm households and distorts their production choices. The results also indicate that shortages (rationing) in manufactures consumer goods and modern inputs make commodity demands, input demands, and output supplies less price responsive. ...|$|R

Sarawak, together with North Borneo and Brunei, formed a single administrative unit named Kita Boruneo (Northern Borneo) under the Japanese 37th Army headquartered in Kuching. Sarawak was divided into three provinces, namely: Kuching-shu, Sibu-shu, and Miri-shu, each under their respective Japanese Provincial Governor. The Japanese retained pre-war administrative machinery and assigned Japanese for government positions. The administration of Sarawak's interior was left to the native police and village headmen, under Japanese supervision. Though the Malays were typically receptive toward the Japanese, other indigenous tribes such as the Iban, Kayan, Kenyah, Kelabit and Lun Bawang maintained a hostile attitude toward them because of policies such as <b>compulsory</b> labour, forced <b>deliveries</b> of foodstuffs, and confiscation of firearms. The Japanese did not resort to strong measures in clamping down on the Chinese population because the Chinese in the state were generally apolitical. However, a considerable number of Chinese moved from urban areas into the less accessible interior to lessen contact with the Japanese.|$|R
