In this case stem cells were used to treat animal models who had been injured {{in a way that}} mimicked CP. This brings up a neuroethical issue of animal models used in science. Since most of their [...] "diseases" [...] are inflicted and do not occur naturally, they <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> be reliable examples of how a person with the actual disease would respond to treatment. The stem cells used did survive implantation, but did not show significant nerve regeneration. However, studies are ongoing in this area.|$|E

Let them cherish it, too, {{for the sake}} of those who, from every clime, are daily seeking a dwelling in our land. And when in the calm moments of reflection they shall have retraced the origin and progress of the insurrection, let them determine whether it has not been fomented by combinations of men who, careless of consequences and disregarding the unerring truth that those who rouse <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> appease a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from an ignorance or perversion of facts, suspicions, jealousies, and accusations of the whole Government.|$|E

It was Butcher the Shrike. Often he is called just Butcher Bird. He did not look at all terrible. He was not quite as big as Sammy Jay. He had no terrible claws like the Hawks and Owls. There was a tiny hook {{at the end of his}} black bill, but it wasn't big enough to look very dreadful.

60|$|The common {{argument}} against free trade was a fallacy {{of the same}} nature. The purchaser of British silk encourages British industry; the purchaser of Lyons silk encourages only French; the former conduct is patriotic, the latter ought to be prevented by law. The circumstance is overlooked, that the purchaser of any foreign commodity necessarily causes, directly or indirectly, the export of an equivalent value of some article of home production (beyond what would otherwise be exported), either to the same foreign country or to some other; which fact, though from the complication of the circumstances it <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> be verified by specific observation, no observation can possibly be brought to contradict, while the evidence of reasoning on which it rests is irrefragable. The fallacy is, therefore, {{the same as in}} the preceding case, that of seeing a part only of the phenomena, and imagining that part to be the whole; and may be ranked among Fallacies of Non-observation.|$|E

5000|$|One way to {{identify}} a nominative absolute is to add a conjunction and a verb: one <b>can</b> often (though <b>not</b> <b>always)</b> create a subordinate clause out of a nominative absolute by adding a subordinating conjunction (such as [...] "because" [...] or [...] "after") and a form of the verb to be.|$|R
60|$|An income-tax, fairly {{assessed}} on these principles, would be, {{in point of}} justice, the least exceptionable of all taxes. The objection to it, in {{the present state of}} public morality, is the impossibility of ascertaining the real incomes of the contributors. Notwithstanding, too, what is called the inquisitorial nature of the tax, no amount of inquisitorial power which would be tolerated by a people the most disposed to submit to it could enable the revenue officers to assess the tax from actual knowledge of the circumstances of contributors. Rents, salaries, annuities, and all fixed incomes, can be exactly ascertained. But the variable gains of professions, and still more the profits of business, which the person interested <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> himself exactly ascertain, can still less be estimated with any approach to fairness by a tax-collector. The main reliance must be placed, and always has been placed, on the returns made by the person himself. The tax, therefore, on whatever principles of equality it may be imposed, is in practice unequal in one of the worst ways, falling heaviest on the most conscientious.|$|E

40|$|Although {{interest}} in fish welfare is growing, {{little research has}} addressed the welfare of laboratory or ornamental fish. Our aim here was to evaluate the effects of handling fish with a scoop, where the fish remained submerged in water, compared to handling with a net. We investigated {{the effect of the}} scoop vs. a dip-net in three different species: three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Panamanian bishops (Brachyraphis episcopi) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) using a variety of assays. The results demonstrate that keeping fish within water in a scoop while transferring them between tanks <b>can,</b> but <b>not</b> <b>always,</b> decrease the negative effects of handling on stress responses...|$|R

The paper analyses the high-profile case of the European Asylum Policy, particularly the four main directives, its legal and political construction, and demonstrates the significance of the Commission in the political and normative process...|$|R

5000|$|With {{alienation}} to non-Indians, their increased {{presence on}} numerous reservations {{has changed the}} demography of Indian Country. One of many implications of this fact is that tribes <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> effectively embrace the total management of a reservation, for non-Indian owners and users of allotted lands contend that tribes have no authority over lands that fall within the tax and law-and-order jurisdiction of local government.|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{reasons for}} possible failures of 'good' economic reforms, we consider an institution {{which is always}} successful in making the best public decision from the utilitarian perspective.

Thus, if equity is a primary concern, then some reforms with positive aggregate net gain might not be undertaken. If the utilitarian welfare is the only guide for making public decisions, implementing a reform might require the ability to ignore the associated social costs of inequality. ...|$|R
