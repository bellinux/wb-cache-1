50|$|By definition, a {{magazine}} paginates with each issue starting at page three, {{with the standard}} sizing being 8 3/8 × 10 7/8 inches. However, in the technical sense a journal has <b>continuous</b> <b>pagination</b> throughout a volume. Thus Business Week, which starts each issue anew with page one, is {{a magazine}}, but the Journal of Business Communication, which starts each volume with the winter issue and continues the same sequence of pagination throughout the coterminous year, is a journal. Some professional or trade publications are also peer-reviewed, an example being the Journal of Accountancy.
