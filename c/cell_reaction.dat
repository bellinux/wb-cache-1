40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract (engl.) : AlGaN/GaN based pH-sensors {{have been}} {{characterized}} and further {{developed for the}} in situ monitoring of <b>cell</b> <b>reactions.</b> Generally, good proliferation of different cell lines was observed on AlGaN and GaN surfaces without using any kind of thin films of organic material for improving of the cellular adhesion and biocompatibility. NG 108 - 15 nerve cells were chosen for {{the investigation of the}} sensor response on cell activity. In an open setup with contact to normal atmosphere, the monitoring of the spontaneous cell activity (“breathing”) was recorded. By titration in complex electrolytes, it was demonstrated that these sensors are able to monitor complex <b>cell</b> <b>reactions</b> on different neuroinhibitors. Numerical simulations as well as simplified analytical calculations of ion fluxes give strong evidence that the signal in the cell-transistor coupling experiments is primarily generated by the Na+ flux. In conclusion, the AlGaN/GaN-ISFETs show stable operation under physiological conditions, exhibit a very good signal resolution and are suitable for long-time monitoring of <b>cell</b> <b>reactions</b> on different stimuli.

40|$|Pre-{{penetration}} {{and early}} penetration phases of two pathogenic strains of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (HM 502, HM 514) from Zaire were investigated quantitatively on four Stylosanthes guianensis genotypes (cv. Schofield, cv. Graham, CIAT 184 and CIAT 10136) of {{various levels of}} susceptibility. The results demonstrated control of the rates and type of conidial germination by the fungus, influenced {{to a lesser extent}} by the host genotype. <b>Cell</b> <b>reactions</b> were visible as papillae and cytoplasmic aggregations closely associated with the penetration peg. No fungal growth was observed when deposits of papillae occurred under appressoria-forming infection pegs, whereas the effect of the cytoplasmic aggregations varied according to the host genotype. In the interactions with strain HM 502, the highest rates of plant reaction were recorded on the resistant CIAT 184 genotype, while the highest level of penetration without reaction was observed on the most susceptible cv. Schofield. Cytoplasmic aggregations were also observed under a few ungerminated appressoria on this genotype. Differences were thus detected in the rates and types of conidial germination, in the rates and types of <b>cell</b> <b>reactions</b> under appressoria and in the appressorial penetration rates without <b>cell</b> <b>reactions.</b> However, these differences did not completely explain the range of macroscopic symptoms observed on the various genotypes...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{its ability}} to {{maintain}} high proton conductivity in intermediate temperatures (~200℃), CsHSO4 {{is considered to be}} prime candidate for proton transferring agent in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). Transfer of proton across the catalyst layer is the primary limiting step of the <b>cell</b> <b>reaction</b> and electrolysis, thus the high proton conductivity of CsHSO4 can contribute greatly to the cell’s performance. CsHSO4 has advantage over typical low-temperature PEMs, which require water-rich environment limiting them to temperatures below 100 °C. CsHSO4 combined with polymer has been shown to surpass even some other high-temperature PEMFC systems in performance.|$|E
50|$|Someone {{allergic}} to walnuts or pecans {{may not have}} an allergy to cashews or pistachios, because the two groups are only distantly related {{and do not necessarily}} share related allergenic proteins. The severity of the allergy varies from person to person, and exposure can increase sensitization. For those with a milder form of the allergy, a reaction which makes the throat feel like cotton may occur. Subjects {{allergic to}} tree nut can experience asthma, skin rashes, itchy throat, swollen eyes. The most severe reaction can lead to anaphylaxis and sensitive subjects may need to carry with them at all times disposable adrenaline injectors prescribed by their GP. Less severe reaction can be dealt with by assuming antihistamines tablet. The raw nut protein usually causes a more severe reaction than the oil, and extra roasting or processing can reduce the allergic reaction. Those diagnosed with anaphylaxis will have a more immediate mast <b>cell</b> <b>reaction</b> and be required to avoid all exposure to any allergen-containing products or byproducts, regardless of processing, as they are prone to even greater sensitivity. An allergy test or food challenge may be performed at an allergy clinic to determine the exact allergens. New immunotherapy treatments are being developed for tree nut allergy.|$|E
5000|$|Prosthetic TMJ {{placement}} {{surgery is}} used as a last resort to manage severe pain and restricted function due to TMJ disorders. At the onset of symptoms, primary prevention such as a soft diet, cessation of gum chewing, physiotherapy and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are put into place. If primary prevention fails, TMJ joint replacement is one of the several surgical options. Recent studies have shown TMJ replacement surgery to be highly successful, improving mean pain scores, mean diet scores, mean maximum inter-incisal opening, and mean function and speech scores. [...] Synthetic jaw implants already on the market prior to the 1976 Federal law requiring medical devices be proven safe and effective were exempt and continued to be sold after 1976 without proof of safety. Teflon implants made by Vitek, and silicone ones made by Dow Corning, raised the most concern. Vitek-Kent Proplast-Teflon partial & total prosthesis were manufactured from 1982 to 1990 in Houston TX. TMJ prostheses became popular with the introduction of Vitek, but evidence that the implants could cause debilitating reactions including pain, malocclusion, and foreign body giant <b>cell</b> <b>reaction</b> (FBGCR) resulting in degeneration of the surrounding tissue led to a recall by the FDA on 1/7/91. Since Vitek declared bankruptcy in June 1990 and the owner fled the country, the FDA was left to handle the recall, which they did by sending out a safety alert and public health advisory. Otherwise, there was next to no follow-up on the recall. Silastic silicone TMJ Implants produced by Dow Corning became popular during the 1970s, but reports of widespread mechanical failure with wear, tearing, and fracture began to surface. Debris and fragments led to an inflammatory response, joint degeneration, bony ankylosis, and lymph node swelling. Marketing of Silastic for use in the TMJ was discontinued on 6/15/93 after warnings from the FDA and the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS).|$|E
