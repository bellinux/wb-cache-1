40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of microwave treatment, especially at low power level on compressive strength and <b>cutting</b> <b>rate</b> of granite rock by using multimodal cavity. The power level and cooling rate of treated samples were found to have an effect on the compressive strength, and the <b>cutting</b> <b>rate.</b> This effect is due to the induction of the plastic zones and micro cracks in the rock matrix, especially at the grain boundaries induced by the thermal stresses of rock forming minerals which have the difference in dielectric properties after microwave heating for a certain exposure time together with the thermal-shock treatment after the heating. It was found that the strength of treated granite is less than 60 % of the original after 30 minutes of exposure. The dry heated samples with a water quenching seem to be the most affected samples. They exhibit a significant decrease in compressive strength up to 70 % and <b>cutting</b> <b>rate</b> up to 38 % after 30 -minute treatment at the power of 850 W, and after 10 -minute treatment at the power of 600 W respectively. Prolonged treatment causes the relaxation of induced thermal stresses in the rock mass, leading to a slight increase in compressive strength, and a slight decrease in <b>cutting</b> <b>rate.</b> For dry samples, the <b>cutting</b> <b>rate</b> can be enhanced because of a decrease in hardness of rock mass dropped from 61. 5 to 55. 4 HRC afterthe 10 -minute heating at 600 W with thermal shock treatment. The absorbed water in the pores of rock mass also has an effect on a decrease in compressive strength.

40|$|Oxyacetylene {{flame cutting}} is a {{relevant}} and widespread industrial process. The {{basic principles of}} the process lie in rapid high-temperature oxidation of the cut metal. The kinetics of the process depends, among other things, on {{the composition of the}} cut metal, the activity of the reactants. In this present work, a report of the role of carbon on the kinetics of the process is made; effects of the activities of oxyfuel gases on the flame cutting process is also elucidated. This was done by investigation of the effects of carbon content and the cutting pressures on the <b>cutting</b> <b>rates</b> of steels by the oxyacetylene cutting process. Six 10 mm steel rods of different wt% C were flame cut using different acetylene and oxygen pressures. The composition of the steel rods used ranged from 0. 16 wt% C to 0. 33 wt% C, the acetylene pressures used ranged from 3. 45 x 10 - 2 N. m- 2 to 5. 52 x 10 - 2 N. m- 2, while oxygen pressure ranged from 2. 76 x 10 - 1 N. m- 2 to 3. 17 x 10 - 1 N. m- 2. The result shows that the <b>cutting</b> <b>rates</b> decreased with carbon content of the steel as a result of reduction of iron oxide during decarburization reactions; however, <b>cutting</b> <b>rates</b> increased with the oxyfuel pressures as a result of increased activity of oxyfuel gases with increased pressure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this study, the {{machinability}} {{of standard}} GGG 40 {{nodular cast iron}} by WEDM using different parameters (machin-ing voltage, current, wire speed, and pulse duration) was inves-tigated.

40|$|The {{machining}} {{of carbon}} reinforced plastics (CFRP) is considerably {{different from the}} machining of metallic materials. CFRP is a heterogeneous material, because fibres and matrix have different properties. Furthermore carbon fibres are hard which causes high abrasive tool wear and thus induced high costs.

40|$|In {{the current}} low growth environment, {{accompanied}} by {{a high degree of}} uncertainty, calls for an even easier monetary policy have gained momentum. However, our model approach – which rests on the so-called theory of the "option value of waiting " – shows that the impact of monetary policy on growth and employment is strongly diminished in an environment of high (revenue) uncertainty. This finding is actually based on the existence of sunk investment, e. g. hiring costs. Against the background of the prevailing uncertainty, our model provides three important implications for ECB monetary policy: (1) <b>cutting</b> interest <b>rates</b> is not effective as long as high uncertainty continues to prevail; (2) by <b>cutting</b> <b>rates</b> under high uncertainty, the ECB reduces the option value of waiting, thereby reducing its effectiveness in future periods; and (3) a hectic ECB monetary policy, that is frequent interest rate changes, induces additional uncertainty to the economy which would most likely aggravate the weakness of in-vestment and consumer goods demand...|$|R
