40|$|This study {{examined}} the determinants of savings and capital accumulation in Isoko north local government area of Delta state, Nigeria. It specifically sought to identify the socioeconomic/demographic variables of the rural dwellers that affect their savings and capital accumulation. It also examined the strategies and motives for saving and the various constraints to savings and capital accumulation in the study area. A total of 150 households were randomly sampled from seven communities out of the 13 {{that make up the}} local government area. Data for the study were collected using structured questionnaire and analysed through the use of descriptive statistics such as means, percentages and frequency distribution as well as inferential statistics such as multiple regression analysis. Results from findings revealed that volume of savings is based on the rural farmers’ farm income, nonfarm income, years of experience in a saving programme, age of the farmers and the distance to formal financial institution. The result also showed that majority of the rural farmers save or accumulate capital in non-monetary form as a strategy of saving and are motivated to save in order to increase production. The main constraints to accumulation of savings were low productivity and lack of access to financial credit. It is therefore the recommendation of the study that to further improve on rural farmers savings in the study area, the government should make <b>credit</b> <b>available</b> <b>by</b> empowering formal and informal financial institutions activities in rural areas...|$|E

These enterprises are created to fulfill the primary needs of man and are formed under conditions of risk and considerable uncertainty. This sector is encumbered by many problems chief among them being financing.

The rotating savings and credit association (Rosca), or chit fund as it is known in India, is an informal community-based financial arrangement found throughout the developing world. 2 While the traditional Rosca is a savings mechanism, the commercial chit fund is essentially a financial intermediary.

30|$|Over {{the past}} decade, many {{empirical}} studies have confirmed a positive association between financial innovation {{and economic growth}} (e.g., Lumpkin 2010; Sekhar 2013). Financial innovation helps economic growth by allowing for capital mobilization, efficient financial intermediation, capital accumulation, and enhanced overall efficiency in financial institutions. That is why financial innovation is treated as a prime catalyst for financial development (Laeven et al. 2015). As with other innovations, financial innovation is a continuous process of bringing about changes in the financial system through the improvement and diversification of financial products and processes (Sood and Ranjan 2015). Demetriades and Andrianova (2005) argued that emergence of new financial assets and services in the financial system improves banking-sector performance and capital-market development, eventually boosting {{economic growth in the}} host country. Schumpeter (1912, 1982), meanwhile, argued that robust financial systems comprise efficient financial institutions, diversified financial assets and services, comprehensive financial services coverage, efficient channels for economic resource mobilization, and <b>available</b> <b>credit</b> flows for investment across a country. Financial innovation made <b>credit</b> <b>available</b> in economies <b>by</b> way of new and hybrid forms of financial institutions (e.g., microfinance institutions) outside the framework of formal banking systems (Blair 2011).|$|R

40|$|The wave of bank {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} experienced in European and U. S. credit markets during the Nineties has deeply changed the geography of banking industry. While the number of bank branches has increased in almost every country, reducing the operational distance between banks and borrowers, bank decisional centres and strategic functions have been concentrated {{in only a few}} places within each nation, increasing the functional distance between banks and local communities. In this paper, we carry out a multivariate analysis to assess the correlation of functional and operational distances with local borrowers' financing constraints. We apply our analysis on Italian data at the local market level defined as provinces. Our findings consistently show that increased functional distance makes financing constraints more binding, it being positively associated with the probability of firms being rationed, investment-cash flow sensitivity, and the ratio of credit lines utilized by borrowers to <b>credit</b> lines make <b>available</b> <b>by</b> banks. These adverse effects are particularly evident for small firms and for firms located in southern Italian provinces. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the negative impact on financing constraints following the actual increased functional distance over the period 1996 - 2003 has substantially offset (and sometimes exceeded) the beneficial effects of the increased diffusion of bank branches occurring during the same period. financing constraints, funtional distance, local banking system, operational proximity...|$|R
