I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and God replied, 'Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, maybe because they thought I was different, so I had to defend myself. [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E
500|$|In the {{television}} series Alias (2001–06), Cooper achieved some {{success for the}} role of Will Tippin, a local reporter for a newspaper and the best friend of Jennifer Garner's character, Sydney Bristow. Garner {{was one of the first}} people he met in Los Angeles and was, in Cooper's words, [...] "very maternal... She wanted to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> make sure I was okay all the time." [...] He acted in the 2002 psychological thriller Changing Lanes. The scenes in which he appeared were edited out of the final cut of the film, but are featured on the film's DVD and Blu-ray releases. Also in 2002, he played a man involved in a love triangle in the romantic drama Bending All the Rules. He guest-starred in the short-lived TV series Miss Match and played the part of cowboy and race horse trainer Morgan Murphy in {{the television}} film The Last Cowboy, which aired on the Hallmark Channel in January 2003. He later appeared in the television film I Want to Marry Ryan Banks (2004) with Jason Priestley and as a regular guest star in the WB series Jack & Bobby (2004–05).|$|E

500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that is why I am trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E
500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope. I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can. The song ends with a quote from the Bible's Book of Matthew: 'For I was hungry and you gave me food. I was naked and you gave me clothing. I was sick and you took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and God replied, [...] "Whatever you did for the least of my brothers... you did it to me.' Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show.|$|E
2500|$|Bradley {{contends that}} the Angus have been good to her. In an {{interview}} with screenwriter Anne Rapp, Bradley acknowledged that [...] "Most women don’t want to live out this far. You either love it, or you hate it. I love this old country. It’s the best friend I’ve had for fifty years, and it’s never let me down. It’s taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> this old country.

2500|$|Dionne Warwick married {{actor and}} drummer William David Elliott (1934–1983) (CBS's Bridget Loves Bernie - 1972–73) in 1966; they {{divorced}} in May 1967. They reconciled and were remarried in Milan, Italy, in August 1967, according to Time. On January 18, 1969, {{while living in}} East Orange, New Jersey, {{she gave birth to}} her first son, David Elliott. In 1973, her second son Damon Elliott was born. On May 30, 1975, the couple separated and Warwick was granted a divorce in December 1975 in Los Angeles. The court denied Elliott's request for $2000 a month in support pending a community property trial, and for $5000, when he insisted he was making $500 a month in comparison to Warwick making $100,000 a month. Warwick stated in Don't Make Me Over: Dionne Warwick, a 2002 Biography Channel interview, [...] "I was the breadwinner. The male ego is a fragile thing. It's hard when the woman is the breadwinner. All my life, the only man who ever took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> financially was my father. I have always taken care of myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carl Frederick Buechner, {{the eldest}} son of Katherine Kuhn and Carl Frederick Buechner Sr., was born on July 11, 1926 in New York City. During Buechner's early {{childhood}} the family moved frequently, as Buechner's father searched for work. In The Sacred Journey Buechner recalls: [...] "Virtually every year of my life until I was fourteen, I lived in a different place, had different people to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> went to a different school. The only house that remained constant was the one where my maternal grandparents lived {{in a suburb of}} Pittsburgh called East Liberty...Apart from that one house on Woodland Road, home was not a place to me when I was a child. It was people." [...] This changed in 1936, when Buechner's father committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, a result of his conviction that he had been a failure. Immediately afterwards, the family moved to Bermuda, where they remained until World War II forced the evacuation of Americans from the island. [...] In Bermuda, Buechner experienced [...] "the blessed relief of coming out of the dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." ...|$|E

2500|$|But {{the plans}} to make the film with Jessel would fall through, for {{multiple}} reasons. Jessel's contract with Warner Bros. had not anticipated that the movie they had particularly signed him for would be made with sound (he'd made a modestly budgeted, silent comedy in the interim). When Warners had hits with two Vitaphone, though dialogue-less, features in late 1926, The Jazz Singer production had been reconceived. Jessel asked for a bonus or a new contract, but was rebuffed. According to Jessel's description in his autobiography, Harry Warner [...] "was {{having a tough time}} with the financing of the company.... He talked about taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> if the picture was a success. I did not feel that was enough." [...] In fact, around the beginning of 1927, Harry Warner—the eldest of the brothers who ran the eponymous studio—had sold $4 million (US$ in [...] dollars) of his personal stock to keep the studio solvent. Then came another major issue. According to Jessel, a first read of screenwriter Alfred A. Cohn's adaptation [...] "threw me into a fit. Instead of the boy's leaving the theatre and following the traditions of his father by singing in the synagogue, as in the play, the picture scenario had him return to the Winter Garden as a blackface comedian, with his mother wildly applauding in the box. I raised hell. Money or no money, I would not do this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Music producer, Steve Morales, took T Lopez to Miami, Florida {{to begin}} {{recording}} her own music. Later Lopez {{would join the}} cast of a TV cable network that caters to the bicultural Latino population called Sí TV, where she would co-hosts a Latin American music show, The Drop. Lopez continued acting, hosting, and recording music. After putting a few movies, multiple TV appearances, and an album's worth of songs under her belt, T Lopez met brothers and co-CEO's of Cash Money Records, Ronald [...] "Slim" [...] Williams and Bryan [...] "Baby" [...] Williams, and they invited her to visit their New Orleans, Louisiana home base. T Lopez was very impressed by their loyalty to each other, but she asked the guys if {{they really wanted to}} work with her and her music because it was so different. Slim is great, he takes great <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and he is really involved in my project T Lopez said. T Lopez said that heads of companies are not always like that. Then T Lopez officially joined the Cash Money family and has not looked back since. T Lopez is currently recording on her as-yet-untitled solo debut album in Miami, Florida, with features from T-Pain, Daddy Yankee, Lil Wayne, Flo Rida, Glasses Malone, Colby O'Donis and Birdman. Producers Timbaland, J.R. Rotem, Rodney Jerkins are also along to build what's best described as urban pop. In 2008, she collaborated with Los del Rio, The Art of Sound, and The D.E.Y. on [...] "Macarena (The Art of Sound Group Mix)", in honor of the 15th anniversary of the Macarena.|$|E
2500|$|Nina {{has been}} one of the highest-selling acts of Warner Music Philippines since she became part of the label in 2002, with her {{certified}} Diamond album Nina Live! (2005). In 2010, she was rumored to have switched to Universal Records. In February 2010, she collaborated with Universal's R singer Jay R on the song [...] "Muli" [...] for his album Jay R Sings OPM Love Classics. In May of the same year, she appeared on Kris Aquino's compilation, Blessings of Love, performing Michael Jackson's [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] for the album. The album was also released by Universal. On June 30, 2010, she performed the song [...] "Bagong Pilipinas", together with other Universal artists, in the inauguration of Philippine President Benigno Aquino III. It was evident that she has transferred from Warner to Universal, but there was still no confirmation until 2010 ended. On April 15, 2011, she confirmed transferring to Universal, when she wrote an article in The Philippine Star stating [...] "Late last year, I moved to my new record label Universal Records and I consider it one of the biggest blessings in my career." [...] In May 2011, she covered another song for Kris Aquino's album My Heart's Journey. It was [...] "I Want to Know What Love Is", originally recorded by Foreigner. On July 15, 2011, she stated in an interview that she properly asked for permission when she left Warner. She further mentioned how the label took good care of her career, and that their separation ended in good terms. She also described Universal staffs' warm welcome as she transferred, saying [...] "Actually, even though I was new to them, I didn't feel like a newcomer [...] They took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> during the recording, and also during other shows by Universal." ...|$|E
