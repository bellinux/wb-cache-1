5000|$|A {{variant of}} this that was popular {{for a time in}} online newsgroups, called riism, modifies li {{slightly}} to ri as a signal that the speaker is using gender-neutral pronouns, but then in order to avoid confusion eliminates li and ŝi completely, so that the inventory becomes ri [...] "s/he" [...] and ili [...] "they". The riist [...] "manifesto" [...] also adopts the masculine suffix *-iĉo and the occasional epicene use of ge- to avoid any resulting confusion. Critics maintain {{that it is important to}} retain the option of gendered pronouns, if for no other reason than the translation of much of the world's literature; and that in actual rather than theoretical use, *ri as a pronoun would cause <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion</b> with the many verbs that begin with ri-, such as ri gardas [...] "s/he keeps" [...] vs rigardas [...] "looks", ri petas [...] "s/he asks" [...] vs ripetas [...] "repeats", etc.|$|E
40|$|Tiagabine (TGB), a novel GABA reuptake {{inhibitor}} antiepileptic drug, {{has been}} reported to induce nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) in patients with generalized or partial onset seizures. We describe six patients with refractory partial epilepsy treated with add-on TGB. They developed acute intermittent or progressive <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion</b> associated with diffuse slowing of the electroencephalogram (EEG), shortly after an increase in dose of TGB. This remitted in each situation after reduction of the daily dose. The possibility of nonconvulsive status epilepticus or toxic encephalopathy is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Aim.   This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} and research-based literature {{related to the}} management of people with <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion</b> {{as a consequence of}} dementia in the acute care setting. Background.   People aged 65 years and over are at increased risk of poor outcomes when admitted to the acute care setting as a result of comorbity and mismanagement of their <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion.</b> The challenge of caring for people with dementia in acute care is one that requires special attention. Results.   The theoretical literature outlines a number of principles of care necessary for best practice in the care of people with dementia. A number of different models of care are reported in the literature and some evaluative research has been undertaken to assess the benefits of the different models. Conclusion.   There are a number of interventions that if put into place in acute care may improve care of people with dementia and reduce the burden of care. There is emerging evidence that interventions such as staff education, skilled expertise, standardized care protocols and environmental modification help {{to meet the needs of}} people with dementia in acute hospital settings. This paper adds to our current understanding of management of dementia in the acute care setting, an area that demonstrates the need to move from descriptive to intervention studies to ensure evidence for care of persons with a dementing condition...|$|E

50|$|GAF (Ghana Armed Forces) {{external}} operation and military operation presence was proudly advertised in {{the operations of}} Cambodia−UNTAC. A total of 3,359 GA (Ghana Army) soldiers and 283 GMP (Ghana Military Police) military police personnel from GAF (Ghana Armed Forces) operated in UNTAC laying to rest the <b>chronic</b> military <b>confusion</b> in Cambodia. The UNTAC operation lasted two years, 1992−1993. After a long running Cambodia civil war ignited by external interventions, a resolution was accepted by the four warring fractional parties. Operation UNTAC was the GAF largest {{external operation}} since the GAF first external operation in military operation ONUC. Operation UNTAC and its contingent UNAMIC had a combined budget of more than $1.6 billion. Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) soldiers and (GMP) military police personnel from GA (Ghana Army) effectively contributed to bringing political and military to Cambodia.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this ethnographic study was to {{describe}} the experience of African American adults providing in-home care for a family member with <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion</b> living in the Arkansas Delta. We conducted this study over fourteen months in two rural Delta counties using participant observation and in-depth interviews. The majority of caregivers were adult daughters. Nearly half attributed <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion</b> to a difficult life and emotional stress or 2 ̆ 2 worry; 2 ̆ 2 a third believed {{it to be a}} natural component of 2 ̆ 2 old age. 2 ̆ 2 Caregivers tended to view their work as an expression of love and devotion that was accompanied by emotional stress and personal sacrifice. While just under half of the caregivers had no other family members willing or available to assist with the physical care of the elder, the majority were able to turn to family members for emotional support. Further they identified strong religious beliefs as the primary force that sustained them in the caregiving role. The centrality of spirituality, faith/religion was noted in nearly all aspects of life. Faith in God was seen as continuing to be an important aspect of the care recipients 2 ̆ 7 lives as well. Recipients 2 ̆ 7 spiritual needs were addressed by accompanying the care recipient to church services and reading Bible passages to them on a regular basis. Selective community services (i. e., adult day care, home health services) were used that supported efforts at maintaining the family caregiver role. Findings are discussed within the context of historical and sociopolitical factors of the geographic region...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} propose {{institutional}} actions based on nursing diagnoses {{for the prevention}} of falls in the elderly. Qualitative, exploratory and descriptive research, with 30 institutionalized senior citizens from Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. During data collection five instruments were applied from March to July 2009. One presents the elderly’s profile; aspects that favored the falls; nursing diagnoses; proposals for institutional actions to prevent falls. The nursing diagnoses were identified: impaired physical mobility, decreased ability to transfer, shower self-care deficit, dressing self-care deficit, impaired environmental interpretation syndrome, <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion,</b> impaired memory; syndrome of stress due to changes; risk of falls, risk of trauma. Through the identification of nursing diagnoses it was possible to make a proposal for institutional actions aimed at preventing falls in the elderly who reside in long-stay institutions. ...|$|E
40|$|A 54 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our Korsakoff Center because of extensive cognitive problems following acute Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE). She had a relatively short his-tory of alcohol abuse and was found {{lying on the floor}} in her home by her son. After 5 days without treatment, she was diagnosed with WE in a general hospital. During the course of the disease, minimal change to the acute situation occurred, with <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion,</b> attention deficits, and incoherent behavior symptoms most notable unlike classical Kor-sakoff’s syndrome. Neuropsychological assessment after 4 and 16 months after admission to the hospital revealed global cognitive decline, with striking impairments in attentional, executive, and memory functions. The present case study suggests that the state of confu-sion and the neuropsychological symptoms in WE can become chronic in case of very late treatment. We therefore recommend that confused alcoholics should receive appropriate parenteral thiamine according to the current clinical standards...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Fatigue is {{probably}} the most common symptom of illness affecting sufferers of both acute and <b>chronic</b> conditions. However, <b>confusion</b> surrounds the definition and use of the term fatigue. As with many other nursing concepts, it is a word that is commonly used in colloquial language. This concept analysis aims to identify the attributes that are essential to the concept of fatigue, and to distinguish between its colloquial and its nursing usage by following the strategy suggested by Walker and Avant (1995, Strategies for Theory Construction in Nursing, Appleton Lange, London). A review of the literature identifies nursing uses of the term fatigue which reflect and conflict with colloquial uses. Defining attributes, demonstration cases, antecedents, consequences and empirical referents are identified before a definition of fatigue is developed and proposed for nursing. This clarification of the phenomenon has particular relevance for clinical nursing, future research and the development of fatigue theories...|$|R
40|$|Older age is {{one stage}} of the lifecourse where dignity maybe {{threatened}} due to the vulnerability created by increased incapacity, frailty and cognitive decline in combination {{with a lack of}} social and economic resources. Evidence suggests that it is in contact with health and welfare services where dignity is most threatened. This study explored the experiences of older people in acute National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in relation to dignified care and the organisational, occupational and cultural factors that affect it. These objectives were examined through an ethnography of four acute hospital Trusts in England and Wales, which involved interviews with older people (65 +) recently discharged from hospital, their relatives/carers, and Trust managers, practitioners and other staff, complemented by evidence from non-participant observation. The picture which emerged was of a lack of consistency in the provision of dignified care which appears to be explained by the dominance of priorities of the system and organisation tied together with the interests of ward staff and clinicians. The emphasis on clinical specialism meant that staff often lacked the knowledge and skills to care for older patients whose acute illness is often compounded by physical and mental co-morbidities. The physical environment of acute wards was often poorly designed, confusing and inaccessible, and might be seen as ‘not fit for purpose’ to treat their main users, those over 65 years, with dignity. Informants generally recognised this but concluded that it was the older person who was in the ‘wrong place’, and assumed that there must be a better place for ‘them’. Thus, the present system in acute hospitals points to an inbuilt discrimination against the provision of high-quality care for older people. There needs to be a change in the culture of acute medicine so that it is inclusive of older people who have <b>chronic</b> co-morbidities and <b>confusion</b> as well as acute clinical needs...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: {{to raise}} the {{diagnosis}} of elderly nursing in nursing consultation and relate those diagnostics {{with the results of}} neurological test. Method: a documental research with 8 elderly of age or older than 60 years old of the program participants of health care of elderly and diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. There were used forms of consultations of nursing, and neurological and cognition tests between may to october 2011; they were statistically treated and with cep no. 0239. 0. 258. 000 - 11. Results: the nursing diagnosis was the <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion</b> with test results for evaluation of immediate memory, incidental and late. Risk of falls was related to the watch test. Poor knowledge was related to recognition of figures and evaluation of learning. Standard prejudiced sleep, risk of solitude and chronic sadness helped to diagnose depression. Conclusion: this work allowed establishing relationship between nursing diagnosis with neurology for planning of nursing care...|$|E

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of older patients needing orthopaedic surgical care suffer from dementia, delirium, or depression. These disorders may present before or after surgical treatment and {{increase the risk of}} surgical complications including death. Dementia is characterized by insidious loss of intellectual functions as well as by behavioral and affective disturbances. Delirium is characterized by disturbances in consciousness, attention, and cognition. Both dementia and delirium cause confusion and lack of compliance with medical care. Unlike dementia or <b>chronic</b> <b>confusion,</b> delirium or acute confusion develops over {{a relatively short period of}} time, and in many instances is caused by stress, metabolic imbalances, infection, or medications. Furthermore, it is often reversible. Depression is a heterogeneous affective disorder characterized by disturbances in mood, lack of interest and pleasure, and vegetative signs and symptoms. It may also cause noncompliance, and can contribute to diminished self-care and health-related activities, such as poor nutrition. All three of these conditions may be exacerbated by the stress of injury or surgical treatment. Early recognition and treatment of these disorders is critical to prevent complications and give patients the best possible outcome...|$|E
