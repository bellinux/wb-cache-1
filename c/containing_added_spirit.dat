40|$|International audienceFive isonitrogenous diets (~ 33 % crude protein) {{were fed}} to the brood female carp, Catla catla (weighing 3. 0 to 5. 5 kg), {{for a period}} of 93 days in order to observe their {{breeding}} performance in earthen ponds. Diet-I (control) contained only basic ingredients like rice bran, groundnut oil cake, roasted soybean meal, fish meal and mineral mixture; diet-II <b>contained</b> <b>added</b> vitamins; diet-III <b>contained</b> <b>added</b> vitamins and vegetable oil (rich in n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, PUFA); diet-IV <b>contained</b> <b>added</b> vitamins and fish oil (rich in n- 3 PUFA); and diet-V <b>contained</b> <b>added</b> vitamins and a mixture of vegetable and fish oils. The results showed that nutritional quality of the diet considerably influenced breeding performance in the species. The total number of matured females was the highest in the diet-V group and maturity was advanced by 35 days in this group compared to the control. In diet-III and diet-V groups, all the maturated females bred fully and the relative fecundity was increased significantly in diet III, IV and V. The maximum (73. 4 %) fertilisation rate was observed in the diet-V group, followed by 61. 3 %, 56. 8 %, 49 % and 22. 7 % in diet-I, diet-IV, diet-III and diet-II groups respectively. Most of the eggs in the diet-II treatment group remained immature. The various data thus obtained suggest that dietary supplementation of both n- 3 and n- 6 PUFA, is essential to improve gonadal maturation, breeding performance and spawn recovery in the catla female broodstock...|$|R

50|$|Further {{liberalization}} of alcohol policy {{led to the}} birth of several long drink brands by different companies. Some experimented with using lemon, orange or other flavors instead of grapefruit. Others started manufacturing mild long drinks based on fermentation rather than on <b>adding</b> <b>spirits.</b> The same composition can be achieved by diluting a 10% beer into 5% with water and gin and grapefruit flavors, and the 4.7% product can be sold in grocery stores. The 2000s saw the reintroduction of the brandy long drink, now manufactured by Laitilan Wirvoitusjuomatehdas.|$|R

50|$|In some countries, {{especially}} those in Europe, dishwashers include a built-in water softener that removes calcium and magnesium ions from the water. Dishwasher salt, which is coarse-grained sodium chloride (table salt), is used to recharge the resin in the built-in ion-exchange system. The coarse grains prevent it from clogging the softener unit; unlike certain types of salt used for culinary purposes, it does not <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> insoluble anticaking agents or magnesium salts. The presence of magnesium salts will defeat the purpose of removing magnesium from the water softener. Anticaking agents may lead to clogging or may contain magnesium. Table salt may <b>contain</b> <b>added</b> iodine {{in the form of}} sodium iodide or potassium iodide. These compounds will not affect the ion-exchange system, but adding table salt to the dishwasher's water softening unit can damage it.|$|R
