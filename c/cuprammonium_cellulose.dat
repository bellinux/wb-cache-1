Plasma /? 2 -M was {{measured}} by radio-immunoassay in samples obtained before and after dialysis with seven different dialysers, tested according to the protocol of the International Cooperative Biocompatibility Study (ICBS). Plasma /J 2 -M was cor-rected for contraction of its distribution volume, which {{was assumed to be}} equal to the extracellular fluid volume. The uncorrected plasma /? 2 -M concentration increased with all conventional dialysers, including the G 10 - 3 N, (<b>cuprammonium</b> <b>cellulose</b> plate), G 120 M (<b>cuprammonium</b> <b>cellulose</b> hollow fibre), CD 4000 (cel-lulose acetate) and T 150 (polymethylmethacrylate). However, {{no significant differences were found}} between the predialysis and the corrected postdialysis plasma /? 2 -M concentrations with these conventional dialysers, and thus no evidence of net generation or release of P 2 -M was found in this study. With high-permeability membranes, the corrected postdialysis /? 2 -M values were decreased by 27. 1 % with the Duo-Flux® Artificial Kidney, 53. 5 % with F 60, and 34. 6 % with Filtral, indicating that dialysers with these membranes eliminate plasma /? 2 -M to a certain extent. The complex of granulocyte elastase with arantipro-teinase in plasma was also measured in samples from the arterial blood line collected before, and after 30 and 120 min of dialysis with each of the seven dialysers in this study. All dialysers elicited an increase in the mean plasma elastase concentrations which was more than twice as high with <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>cellulose</b> plate than with all of the others. The change of elastase at 120 min of dialysis varied considerably with each dia-lyser and was statistically significant with all except CD 4000, F 60, and Filtral. The lowest mean increase was observed with Filtral...|$|E
40|$|Cu {{particles}} decorated {{carbon composite}} microspheres (CCMs) {{with a unique}} sesame ball structure have been prepared by combining the mass-producible spray drying technique with calcinations. The conventional <b>cuprammonium</b> <b>cellulose</b> complex solution obtained by dissolving cellulose in a cuprammonia solution has been applied as raw materials for the preparation of Cu(NH) /cellulose complex microspheres via a spray drying process. The resulted Cu(NH 3) 4 2 +/cellulose complex microspheres are then transformed into the Cu particles homogeneously decorated porous carbon spheres in situ by calcinations at 450 or 550 °C. The coordination effect between the Cu(NH) species and the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose macromolecules has been exploited for directing the dispersion of the Cu particles in the resultant composite CCMs. The antimicrobial effects of the CCMs are evaluated by determining the minimum growth inhibitory concentrations using Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli as representatives, respectively. The CCMs show high efficiency catalytic properties to the conversion of 4 -nitrophenol to 4 -aminophenol using NaBH as a reductant in a mild condition. The recyclability and stability of the CCM catalysts have also been studied...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to produce {{membranes}} using the adapted <b>cuprammonium</b> method. The <b>cellulose</b> utilized was obtained from recycled agroindustrial residues: sugarcane bagasse, corn stover and soybean hulls. The levels of Cu (II) ions in regenerated cellulose membranes produced with cellulose from bagasse, corn stover and soybean hulls were 0. 0236 wt%, 0. 0255 wt% and 0. 0268 wt%, respectively. These levels were approximately 15 times lower than those observed in previous studies (0. 3634 wt%). Cellular viability data show that membranes produced from bagasse cellulose do not present toxicity to the cellular cultures studied. These results demonstrate an evolution in production of regenerated cellulose membranes from agroindustrial residues mainly due to a decrease in the Cu (II) ions level, showing the possibility of application of these systems with improved membranes processing...|$|R
