5|$|As {{keeper of}} the seal, and {{subsequently}} as chancellor, Neville was noted for his impartiality, and he oversaw a number of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the chancery operated. Neville was deprived of the Great Seal in 1238 after quarrelling with the king, but continued to hold the title of chancellor until his death. He died in his London palace, built on a street later renamed Chancery Lane owing to his connection with the chancery.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} the Hungarian {{language}} {{is one of the}} main sources of the research on the ethnogenesis of the Hungarian people because a language shows the circumstances of its own development and its contacts with other idioms. According to a scholarly theory, the oldest layers of Hungarian vocabulary show features of the territory in which the language emerged. The study of loan words from other languages is instrumental in determining direct contacts between the ancient speakers of the Hungarian language and other peoples. Loan words also reflect <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of life of the Magyars.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{selection}} for the Gator Bowl {{was not without}} controversy. The Hokies' three Big East losses pushed them to third place in the conference, behind Miami (which earned an automatic bid to the national championship game) and Syracuse, which lost only one Big East Conference game. Instead of attending the Gator Bowl, Syracuse earned a bid to the 2002 Insight Bowl, {{considered to be a}} less prestigious game due to its lesser payout and shorter history. Syracuse fans, coaches, and players were offended that Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the Gator Bowl despite Syracuse's better record due to Tech's reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games. In the wake of Tech's selection, Syracuse athletic director Jake Crouthamel vowed to lobby for <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the Gator Bowl's Big East selection was made.|$|E

5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation in early stage clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E
5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing too much from doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E

25|$|<b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> people {{perceive}} attachment tend to occur with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{people perceive}} support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends {{and found that}} when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship {{did not affect the}} perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.|$|E
30|$|This perhaps {{represents}} a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>the</b> national media reported on nuns {{rather than a}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> that Japanese society viewed nuns. Katsumoto Karen (b. 1955), a scholar and a Tendai nun, notes that contemporary societal views of nuns have not changed, and many still consider nunhood to be a sad thing signifying old age, or, if the nun is younger, that she is escaping from a bad relationship or mourning {{the death of her}} husband (Katsumoto 2012, preface).|$|R

25|$|The {{enactment}} of the Privacy and Security Rules has caused major <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> physicians and medical centers operate. The complex legalities and potentially stiff penalties associated with HIPAA, {{as well as the}} increase in paperwork and the cost of its implementation, were causes for concern among physicians and medical centers. An August 2006 article in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine detailed some such concerns over the implementation and effects of HIPAA.|$|E
25|$|Web 2.0 {{refers to}} World Wide Web {{websites}} that emphasize user-generated content, usability (ease of use, even by non-experts), and interoperability (this {{means that a}} website can work well with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. The term was popularized by Tim O'Reilly and Dale Dougherty at the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 Conference in late 2004, though it was coined by Darcy DiNucci in 1999. Web 2.0 does not refer to an update to any technical specification, but to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Web pages are designed and used.|$|E
25|$|However most railway historians now {{regard it}} as a costly failure and a missed opportunity; {{an attempt was made}} to simply update the {{railways}} as they already stood rather than reacting to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> goods and people were travelling in the post-war years. Massive investments were made in marshalling yards {{at a time when the}} small wagonload traffic which they dealt with was in steep decline and being lost rapidly to the roads, while new diesel locomotives were often rushed into service with little testing - resulting in poor build quality and reliability.|$|E

25|$|With the St. Petersburg Times in 1963, a {{team led}} by Martin Waldron wrote a total of 150,000 words as part of the newspaper's {{coverage}} of unchecked spending by the Florida Turnpike Authority that led to estimated costs quadrupling from initial estimates of $100 million. Waldron received a tip about excessive spending by John Hammer, chairman of the Florida Turnpike Authority, which included expensive hotels and meals, corsages for his secretary and overcharging for a chartered plane. His coverage earned the newspaper the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1964, the first for the newspaper, and led to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the state of Florida managed highway construction projects.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{thalidomide}} increased fears regarding {{the safety of}} pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology. The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada {{is responsible for the}} Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances. Thalidomide brought on <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Irradiation {{reduces the}} risk of {{infection}} and spoilage, does not make food radioactive, and the food is shown to be safe, but it does cause chemical reactions that alter the food and therefore alters the chemical makeup, nutritional content, and the sensory qualities of the food. Some of the potential secondary impacts of irradiation are hypothetical, while others are demonstrated. These effects include cumulative impacts to pathogens, people, and the environment due to the reduction of food quality, the transpiration and storage of radioactive goods, and destruction of pathogens, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we relate to food and how irradiation changes the food production and shipping industries.|$|E

25|$|After his {{dialysis}} series, {{he joined}} with Martin Gottlieb, a health reporter with the newspaper, in a multi-year investigation of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, {{which at the}} time was the largest health care company in the world. The investigation, which led to multiple articles in the paper, sparked a criminal investigation of Columbia, and led to significant <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the federal government compensated hospitals, according to Bruce Vladek, then the head of the Medicare program. An article in the magazine Content cited the work by Eichenwald, Gottlieb and two other reporters as the year’s best public service journalism. Eichenwald received his second Polk award, along with his colleagues, for this work.|$|E
25|$|In 1883 {{the most}} {{prominent}} trustee, Sheridan, regarding the ground as {{the responsibility of the}} trustees, began to act independently of the NSWCA, resulting in the NSWCA losing control of the ground. Over the next century there was constant conflict between the Trust and the NSWCA over whether other sports such as rugby, tennis and cycling, the organisers of which were all keen to use the venue, had access to it. One conflict in 1904, over the Trust's plan to hold a cycling event which clashed with a cricket match, ended up in court. The NSWCA's influence was eventually reduced even further over the years due to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the State Government appointed trustees.|$|E
25|$|From the 1980s onward, {{the major}} league game has changed {{dramatically}} {{from a combination of}} effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility. These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance-enhancing substances like steroids tainting the race for records. Through this period crowds generally rose. Average attendances first broke 20,000 in 1979 and 30,000 in 1993. That year total attendance hit 70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.|$|E
