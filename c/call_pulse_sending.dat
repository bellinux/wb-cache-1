50|$|The {{time taken}} by the {{transceiver}} to receive a <b>pulse,</b> <b>send</b> out the response {{and return to the}} receiving condition was about 100 microseconds. With a pulse timing of about 100 a second, a transceiver would be busy for 10,000 μS out of ever second responding to the signals from any one aircraft. This would leave 990,000 μS free to respond to other aircraft, giving a theoretical capacity of 100 aircraft. In practice, due to the jitter", about 70 to 80 aircraft could use a station at a time.|$|R

50|$|Vagus nerve {{stimulation}} (VNS) is a neurological procedure that sends electrical impulses {{into the brain}} {{in an effort to}} improve chronic depression symptoms. Vagus {{nerve stimulation}} is one of several newer types of brain stimulation methods designed to treat depression when standard treatment hasn't worked. Vagus nerve stimulation is sometimes called vagal nerve stimulation. With vagus nerve stimulation, a device <b>called</b> a <b>pulse</b> generator is surgically implanted in the chest. A wire threaded under the skin connects the pulse generator to the left vagus nerve in the neck. The <b>pulse</b> generator <b>sends</b> out electrical signals along the vagus nerve to the brain. These signals affect mood centers in the brain, possibly improving depression symptoms. Vagus nerve stimulation is recommended only for certain cases of severe or chronic depression.|$|R

50|$|The {{ratio of}} on to off {{time can be}} {{adjusted}} to vary the RMS voltage while maintaining a constant frequency with a technique <b>called</b> <b>pulse</b> width modulation (PWM).
