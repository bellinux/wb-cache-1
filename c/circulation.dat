5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This <b>circulation</b> consists of the systemic <b>circulation</b> {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary <b>circulation</b> to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary <b>circulation</b> exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic <b>circulation</b> then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the heart for transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level <b>circulation,</b> though as it tracked westward, the <b>circulation</b> failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the <b>circulation</b> had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|A westward-moving {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on July 17. It tracked across the unfavorable Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development, and after crossing Central America, it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 25. The cloud pattern and convection began to become better organized on July 28, and shortly thereafter a mid-level <b>circulation</b> developed. It continued to organize, and subsequent {{to the development of}} a low-level <b>circulation</b> it formed into Tropical Depression Seven-E while located about 975miles (1,575km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas on July 29. Operationally, tropical cyclone advisories were not initiated until visible satellite images confirmed the low-level <b>circulation</b> twelve hours after the depression formed.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of steady, nonlinear <b>circulations</b> in a flow susceptible to conditionally symmetric instability is studied, treating the latent heating as an energy source which is implicitly {{related to the}} motion field. The viscous nonlinear <b>circulations</b> of symmetrical instability are briefly discussed, and an existence theorem for steady, nonlinear symmetric <b>circulations</b> with bounded rates of latent heat release is given.

30|$|To {{examine whether}} these {{anomalous}} vertical atmospheric <b>circulations</b> were reinforced in high EASMI years, those <b>circulations</b> in 100 °– 180 °E where TCs mainly occur were averaged to analyze differences in vertical meridional atmospheric <b>circulations</b> {{between the two}} groups. Anomalous secondary <b>circulations</b> were formed in which air currents ascended in regions south to 25 °N and descended in 25 °– 40 °N. Because of the anomalous vertical meridional atmospheric <b>circulations</b> reinforced as such in high EASMI years, positive relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in regions south to 30 °N, while negative relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in 30 °– 45 °N. These conditions of anomalous vertical meridional atmospheric <b>circulations</b> and relative humidity became favorable environments for more TCs to occur in high EASMI years and have more effects on regions around Korea.|$|R

5|$|By September29, Georges had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} storm and completed a small clockwise loop over southern Mississippi. Subsequently, the storm began tracking west-northwestward at a faster pace. Around 1200UTC, Georges weakened to a tropical depression, and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) initiated public advisories. The depression maintained a well-defined <b>circulation</b> as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico; however, the center of <b>circulation</b> remained inland. Large quantities of tropical moisture fed the storm, allowing it to produce torrential rainfall. By September30, the low-level <b>circulation</b> began to detach from the upper-level <b>circulation.</b> The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean, and it fully dissipated several hours later.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low <b>circulation.</b> While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had a <b>circulation</b> of 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, {{it was common}} practice during the eighteenth century for an individual copy of each publication to be read by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, <b>circulation</b> numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of the}} 18th century, {{the penny}} was a small silver coin rarely seen in <b>circulation,</b> and that was principally struck {{to be used for}} Maundy money or other royal charity. Beginning in 1787, the chronic {{shortage}} of good money resulted in the wide <b>circulation</b> of private tokens, including large coppers valued at one penny. In 1797 industrialist Matthew Boulton gained a contract to produce official pennies at his Soho Mint in Birmingham; he struck millions of pennies over the next decade. After that, it was not until 1825 that pennies were struck again for <b>circulation,</b> and the copper penny continued to be issued until 1860.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{computed}} tomography angiography (CTA) manifestations of collateral <b>circulations</b> in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS).

In addition to obstructed HVs and IVCs, collateral <b>circulations</b> were found in each of the patients. The collateral <b>circulations</b> were classified as intrahepatic, extrahepatic and portosystemic pathways.

5|$|Hilda {{gradually}} weakened over cool waters but {{maintained a}} rather large level of <b>circulation.</b> This caused its dissipation to be slower than normal.

It continued to weaken that evening, and early on September 1, the tropical storm was absorbed by the larger system.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{south of}} the Gulf of Tehuantepec on October18, the system {{consolidated}} and developed a small, defined <b>circulation.</b> Associated convection became more concentrated around its center. Another gap wind event soon impacted the system, temporarily delaying development of the disturbance into a tropical depression. The low soon relocated to the northeast, aligning itself east of the gap wind event which aided in development. A small, well-defined <b>circulation</b> formed by early on October20 within a broader cyclonic <b>circulation.</b> With increasing deep convection, the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression, assigned the identifier Twenty-E, by 06:00UTC. Upon its designation, the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the NHC {{immediately}} classified {{the system}} as Tropical Storm Earl based on a Hurricane Hunter Reconnaissance mission that found flight-level winds of 49mph (79km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 40mph (65km/h). Due {{to the existence of}} multiple <b>circulation</b> centers, the initial movement of the storm was uncertain, but forecasters anticipated a general northward movement. In post-season analysis, it was determined that the system intensified into Tropical Storm Earl while located about 575miles (925km) south-southwest of New Orleans. Initial advisories on Earl relocated the center of <b>circulation</b> several times before focusing on the true <b>circulation</b> center.|$|E

They may be further augmented by fluid <b>circulation,</b> either through magma conduits, hot springs, hydrothermal <b>circulation</b> or a combination of these.|$|E
