This may be displayed in the cockpit or cabin to allow the aircrew to monitor the aircraft in flight, and is usually recorded to allow the data to be analysed later.FTI typically monitors between 10 and 120000 parameters - for example temperatures inside the cargo and pressure distribution along the wing.

Changing the excitation signal frequency, allows evaluating the frequency response function of the transducer. However, this test implies the linearity of the transducer or assumes a purely sinusoidal input during operation. Actually, for many years this is no longer representative of the actual working conditions occurring in typical distribution grids, because of the increasing penetration of power electronics, diffuse generation, nonlinear loads, etc. Hence, in order to achieve a more accurate characterization process able to consider also nonlinear phenomena, it is mandatory to investigate the behavior of <b>current</b> <b>transducers</b> with a realistic input signal.

Wireless technology, however, offers a solution to mounting installation costs since it requires no additional wiring to implement. To demonstrate the feasibility of such a system, a prototype wirelessly-controlled advanced lighting system was designed and built. The system includes the following components: a wirelessly-controllable analog circuit module (ACM), a wirelessly-controllable electronic dimmable ballast, a T 8 3 -lamp fixture, an environmental multi-sensor, a <b>current</b> <b>transducer,</b> and control software. The ACM, dimmable ballast, multi-sensor, and <b>current</b> <b>transducer</b> were all integrated with SmartMesh{trademark} wireless mesh networking nodes, called motes, enabling wireless communication, sensor monitoring, and actuator control. Each mote-enabled device has a reliable communication path to the SmartMesh Manager, a single board computer that controls network functions and connects the wireless network to a PC running lighting control software. The ACM is capable of locally driving one or more standard 0 - 10 Volt electronic dimmable ballasts through relay control and a 0 - 10 Volt controllable output. The mote-integrated electronic dimmable ballast is designed to drive a standard 3 -lamp T 8 light fixture. The environmental multi-sensor measures occupancy, light level and temperature.
