5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} {{visible to the naked}} eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to be}} somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not visible to the naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E

25|$|Overall, the few Gladiators and CR.42s {{clashed with}} a {{substantial}} parity: considering all theaters, the kill ratio was 1.2-to-1 {{in favour of}} the former, a ratio {{similar to that of}} the BF.109 and the Spitfire in the Battle of Britain, a duel considered evenly balanced by most historians. However, the Gladiator (optimised for dogfighting) met with only little success against the relatively fast Italian bombers, shooting down only a handful of them and suffering almost as many losses in the process, which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons for its quick retirement from first-line duty; the CR.42 on the other hand was successful against early British bombers, shooting down a hundred of them with minimal losses.|$|E

25|$|Dundas's most {{significant}} {{challenge of the}} battle was navigating both the Naiad and the crippled Belleisle through the rising storm {{to the safety of}} Gibraltar. By 22 October they had lost contact with {{most of the rest of}} the fleet, but Dundas persevered, several times having to haul the ships off the coast as strong winds threatened to drive them onshore. Better weather on the morning of 23 October allowed Dundas to make more sail, but the return of the gale in the afternoon placed both ships in difficulties. During the afternoon the crews had a fright when a ship-of-the-line was spotted speeding up from the south. At first it seemed that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the squadron that had escaped from Trafalgar under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, but after an exchange of signals the mystery ship was revealed to be , rushing northwards to join the fleet. Naiad and Belleisle battled the weather for the rest of the day; several times the tow rope snapped, but it was reattached by the Naiad sailing close enough to the unmanageable hulk of the Belleisle for a rope to be thrown across, as the sea was too rough to risk launching boats. At 1940 that evening the two ships collided, damaging Naiads jolly boat and smashing away most of the starboard quarter gallery.|$|E

Further, {{as a result of}} these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature which <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the reasons [...] "for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks." ...|$|E

[...] In his review, Carl Kimlinger claimed Baccano! to be [...] "one of the best, and certainly the most cleverly written series in recent years" [...] and described it as [...] "lethally fun" [...] before giving the series an 'A' rating for both the subbed and dubbed versions.|$|E
500|$|After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had subsided, archaeologists {{discovered}} rock inscriptions {{which had}} been exposed by the tsunami waves close to the hamlet of Saluvankuppam, near the UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site of Mahabalipuram. The inscriptions by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola kings Parantaka I and Kulothunga Chola I spoke of a Subrahmanya Temple at Thiruvizhchil (the present day Saluvanakuppam). S. Rajavelu, epigraphist with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), identified a nearby mound {{as the site of}} the temple. In 2005, archaeologists unearthed an 8th-century Pallava temple under the mound. G.

Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush rated the song {{four out of}} five stars, describing it [...] "as sweet and as cavity-causing" [...] as Jepsen's debut international single [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] (2011). Sciaretto added that it was possible that [...] "This Kiss" [...] <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the biggest songs of the fall of 2012. Billboard critic Jason Lipshutz deemed the song [...] "as undeniable as the lips of the lyrical object of affection who (gasp!) isn't the boy she has back home." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that [...] "This Kiss" [...] is musically similar to [...] "typical pop" [...] songs, but added that the lyrics are [...] "better written than the work of most of her competition." [...] Carl Williot of Idolator was sure that the song would [...] "monopolize" [...] radio stations like [...] "Good Time" [...] (2012), and added that [...] "with the dance beat and vocal effects," [...] the singer was [...] "going for dance floor domination as well." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breathe" [...] {{received}} mostly positive commentary {{from music}} critics. Michael R. Smith from Daily Vault said [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "Did It Again" [...] are [...] "most notable for the videos that {{went along with}} them and are fair representations of the album at large (which should be the purpose of singles), though {{there are many more}} undiscovered gems here." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected the song as the album's best track by writing [...] "Truth be told, this album lacks an absolute classic to match 'Confide in Me', but 'Breathe' – subtle but sneakily catchy with it – <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> 's most underrated singles." [...] While reviewing Minogue's 2004 compilation, Ultimate Kylie, Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music gave it a mixed review by writing [...] "Beginning in 1994 with the gorgeously glacial, slinkily synthetic 'Confide In Me', Kylie enjoyed brief success before fans fled in droves from awkward faux-rock like 'Some Kind of Bliss' (not included) and flimsy house like 'Breathe'." [...] Reviewing her 2002 compilation, Hits+, Mackenzie Wilson from AllMusic commended Minogue's [...] "seductive vocals" [...] on [...] "Breathe", [...] "Automatic Love" [...] and [...] "Confide in Me".|$|E
500|$|Parker was {{frequently}} compared to Derrick Rose in high school. According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O'Brien, , Rose had a 3–0 advantage in defining moments: [...] "the back-to-back dunks against Washington {{in the city}} championship at the United Center, the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill, the top-ranked team in the country." [...] Rose's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings, Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose's national introduction. Although there are comparisons to Rose, his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce. Dime Magazine describes him as [...] "Grant Hill with a jump shot". Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony. He hopes {{to be regarded as}} the best high school basketball player {{in the history of the}} city of Chicago and has stated that [...] "being compared to Derrick also drives me. I know if I get better than him or break the records he broke I <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best players to come out of Chicago.

500|$|The writing team reconvened {{later that}} day, after Braga met with {{executive}} producer Rick Berman separately. Berman made several suggestions for the plot; that Janeway shouldn't decode the message immediately {{at the start}} of the episode, and that the vengeance seeking alien should be decrepit and attempting to deceive the crew. As the group planned out an overview of the idea on a whiteboard, the alien was once again discussed. The idea of having him be of a species which had already been assimilated by the Borg was warmly received, with Menosky suggesting that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first races assimilated. Braga countered by suggesting three ideas; that it could be an early race; one that was more recent; or that it could be an El-Aurian. Taylor dismissed the El-Aurian suggestion as she wanted the alien to have more interesting makeup. The writers begin to refer to the alien as [...] "Yoda". During the course of that second meeting, the plot of the episode prior to the reveal of the new spacecraft was developed. The [...] "silver bullet" [...] style ship was one which had been suggested by Braga for some time, but until now had not found an appropriate episode.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times Ann Powers {{called it}} [...] "a {{waterfall}} of mixed emotions enfolding a sunlit morning-after," [...] and [...] "the most emotionally vulnerable ballad Jackson's recorded in years." [...] Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music {{wrote that the}} song [...] "proves that ballads don't have to be inane and that she doesn't have to spell out exactly where she wants it and how to be sexy." [...] Glenn Gamboa from Newsday praised the track, writing that it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her best songs ever. Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, simply wrote that [...] "Can't B Good" [...] is completely lovely. Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club called it a [...] "majestic" [...] song produced by Ne-Yo. Tom Young of BBC Music called it [...] "a potential diamond." [...] For Nick Levine from Digital Spy, the song was created to recall classic Jackson ballads like [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] (1990) and [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] (1987), but failed to do so, due to its lack of melody. Chad Grischow of IGN was less favorable, calling it [...] "cheesy late-eighties ballad, featuring wafer-thin breathy vocals that sounds like someone calling you to their hospital bed rather than the bedroom." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} a single was soon deemed a [...] "stupid idea" [...] by Cornell and dropped {{in favor of an}} EP or album. The album was {{recorded}} in only 15 days, produced by the band themselves. Gossard described the recording process as a [...] "non-pressure-filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Eddie Vedder, who had flown up from San Diego to Seattle to audition for Ament, Gossard, and McCready to be the singer of a band initially billing themselves as Mookie Blaylock (so named for a basketball player but eventually settling on Pearl Jam), was at one of the Temple of the Dog rehearsals and ended up providing backing vocals. [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was still figuring out the vocals at practice when Vedder stepped in and filled in the blanks singing the low parts because he saw it was hard for Cornell, as Cornell later described it: [...] "He sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively." [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] became Temple of the Dog's breakout single; it was also Vedder's first featured vocal on a record. On the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, Vedder stated; “That was the first time I heard myself on a real record. It <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my favorite songs that I’ve ever been on — or the most meaningful.” ...|$|E
