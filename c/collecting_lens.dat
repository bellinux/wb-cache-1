40|$|We {{show that}} the nuclear {{architecture}} of rod photoreceptor cells differs fundamentally in nocturnal and diurnal mammals. The rods of diurnal retinas possess the conventional architecture found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, with most heterochromatin situated at the nuclear periphery and euchromatin residing toward the nuclear interior. The rods of nocturnal retinas have a unique inverted pattern, where heterochromatin localizes in the nuclear center, whereas euchromatin, as well as nascent transcripts and splicing machinery, line the nuclear border. The inverted pattern forms by remodeling of the conventional one during terminal differentiation of rods. The inverted rod nuclei act as <b>collecting</b> <b>lenses,</b> and computer simulations indicate that columns of such nuclei channel light efficiently toward the lightsensing rod outer segments. Comparison of the two patterns suggests that the conventional architecture prevails in eukaryotic nuclei because it results in more flexible chromosome arrangements, facilitating positional regulation of nuclear functions...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{theory of}} the Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} is developed using the approach of investigating {{the history of a}} wave front produced by an element of an extended light source.

The theory can also be applied to other two-beam interferometers. 1. Introduction. The Mach-Zehnder interferometer is one of a large class of instruments in which two-beam interference is produced by division of amplitude. Its principle of operation is simple and can be stated very briefly, if the components of the instrument are assumed to be optically perfect.

40|$|Mass-production of {{different}} laser systems often requires {{utilization of the}} focal spot size method for determination of output laser beam spatial characteristics. The main challenge of this method is high accuracy maintenance of a CCD camera beam profiler in the <b>collecting</b> <b>lens</b> focal plane. The aim of our work is development of new method for placing of photodetector array in the <b>collecting</b> <b>lens</b> focal plane with high accuracy. Proposed technique is based on focusing of several parallel laser beams. Determination of the focal plane position requires only longitudinal translation of the CCD-camera to find a point of laser beams intersection. Continuous-wave (CW) diode-pumped laser emitting in the spectral region near 1 μm was created {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the developed technique. Designed microchip laser generates two stigmatic Gaussian beams with automatically parallel beam axes due to independent pumping {{of different}} areas of the one microchip crystal having the same cavity mirrors. It was theoretically demonstrated that developed method provides possibility of the lenses focal plane determination with 1 % accuracy. The microchip laser generates two parallel Gaussian beams with divergence of about 10 mrad. Laser output power can be varied in the range of 0. 1 – 1. 5 W by changing the pumping laser diode electrical current.

40|$|The present {{visit to}} CERN {{was as a}} result of an {{invitation}} from Dr. Colin Johnson of the Antiproton Accumulator (AA) group. Two activities were planned for this visit. First, the second beam test of one of the original Fermilab lithium lenses (serial No. 2). Second, the installation and beam tests for a new Fermilab lens of improved design (serial No. 5). It should be mentioned here that CERN, after realizing the possible gains to be obtained, has started a considerable development effort in short focal length lenses. Presently they have 3 operational lithium lenses, transformers and power supplies for tests. They are in the process of constructing 3 other transformers and designing lenses of 4 cm diameter (twice the present Fermilab lenses). Fermilab should devote some added effort in the field to maintain the initiative. The first beam test of lens No. 2 was performed during the summer of 1983, when the lens was used as an antiproton <b>collecting</b> <b>lens.</b> For this test the original lens was used as a strong focusing element in the 26 GeV proton beam in conjunction with a current carrying target Preliminary tests for this geometry were conducted during 1984, when the lens was exposed to over 2 *E 6 pulses at 320 kAmps and 1. 3 *E 13 protons per pulse. Lens No. 5 was installed as an antiproton <b>collecting</b> <b>lens,</b> immediately following the AA production target, in a geometry similar to the one designed for the Tevatron 1 project at Fermilab. Targets of a different design than the one use normally at CERN were also required.

During antiproton accumulation for the Lear accelerator new records were achieved on the accumulation yield and accumulation rate of antiprotons for the AA machine.

40|$|Microfluidic systems {{based on}} {{fluorescence}} detection {{have been developed}} and applied for many biological and chemical applications. Because of the tiny amount of sample in the system; the induced fluorescence can be weak. Therefore, most microfluidic systems deploy multiple optical components or sophisticated equipment to enhance the efficiency of fluorescence detection. However, these strategies encounter common issues of complex manufacturing processes and high costs. In this study; a miniature, cylindrical and hybrid lens made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to improve the fluorescence detection in microfluidic systems is proposed. The hybrid lens integrates a laser focusing lens and a fluorescence <b>collecting</b> <b>lens</b> to achieve dual functions and simplify optical setup. Moreover, PDMS has advantages of low-cost and straightforward fabrication compared with conventional optical components.

40|$|Researchers {{speculated that}} some child sex {{offenders}} who gather and accumulate indecent images of children (IIOC) {{appear to be}} engaged in some form of collecting behaviour. Original sentencing guidelines (2004) for IIOC offending recommended higher sentences based {{on the nature of the}} images accumulated, the size of the IIOC accumulation and whether it is organised. Updated sentencing guidelines, such as the A, B, C classifications (Sexual Offences Definitive Guidelines in 2014) still see some collecting processes pointing to deviancy in IIOC offenders. This collecting-offending hypothesis is untested and was a prompt for undertaking this thesis. Collecting terminology is not well-defined, there is no unifying psychological theory of collecting and no empirical studies investigating image collecting. Chapter one sought to review the literature in an attempt to operationalise the concept of collecting. From this first formal review of collecting literature coherence in collecting language emerged and a new collecting frame was posited. This collecting frame is thought to incorporate three core collecting units termed the collectible, the collection and the collector. Three core elements are proposed, that is nature, function and process, and these along with the collecting units form part of a relational matrix which was termed the collecting frame. In chapter one the boundary between pathological (hoarding disorder) and normative collecting is also reviewed and it was concluded that whilst further boundary refinement work is needed they are likely to be distinct phenomena. Chapter two contributes original work, as IIOC offending research is reviewed through a <b>collecting</b> <b>lens.</b> Applying the new collecting frame from Chapter one to IIOC offending was not straightforward, and the terms used for core collecting units needed to be adapted to account for the abusive and illegal nature of some images and to avoid reinforcing offence supportive distorted thinking which might encourage further IIOC offending (Sheldon & Howitt 2007). The term collector was changed to IIOC offender, the collectible became the IIOC or images of child erotica, and collection was referred to as the IIOC accumulation. The collecting process was discussed in regard to actual behaviours, that is, gathering, acquiring, keeping and maintaining accumulations. Applying the collecting frame helped map the topography of the extant IIOC literature which pertains to the collecting-offending hypothesis under study. It was identified that whilst the use of objective measures of IIOC classification and collection configuration are popular and useful, this approach fails to take account of the dominant view from collecting theory which emphasises that what is defined as a collectible and collection can also be subjectively defined. The implications of examining the subjective and objective nature of collecting amongst IIOC offenders is examined, and the lack of studies holistically and prospectively studying the function and processes in IIOC offenders accumulating is pointed out based on the review of expert opinion and empirical papers. A case is also made for systematic testing of McIntosh and Schmeichel's (2004) psychological model of collecting process, using a parsimonious model which integrates collecting and offending processes. This thesis also contributes three original studies, using a mixed method design to explore the collecting-offending hypothesis. The first IPA study in this thesis addressed a gap in the collecting literature by exploring the experiences of image collectors. Next a similarly designed IPA study was conducted to examine the subjective experiences of a sample of convicted sex offenders who self-reported gathering and accumulating indecent images of children. Finally in study three a newly developed survey drawn from collecting theory and IIOC research was implemented to examine whether a collecting group could be identified, along with the nature, function and process of collecting-offending in a convicted sample of IIOC offenders. This study also aims to examine the pathological collecting-offending hypothesis suggested by Sheldon and Howitt (2007) and Murrie, Warren, Kristiansson and Dietz (2002), by measuring hoarding and Asperger related symptomology. In this thesis qualitative and quantitative data were given equal priority and the findings from all the studies were merged in the final conclusion to give meaning and detail to our understanding of collecting behaviour and the collecting-offending hypothesis associated with IIOC offending. Key findings: Using an adapted version of McIntosh and Schmeichel's (2004) model of collecting, a collecting group was identified in the IIOC sample in study three. For both image collectors and IIOC offenders, collecting their objects of interest was an evolving process, and similar collecting processes were found for image collectors and IIOC offenders with a collecting interest, that is the hunt, acquisition, post-acquisition behaviours and refinement. Both groups gained from input with like-minded others, but involvement in collecting communities was especially popular amongst image (postcard) collectors. The function of collecting served cognitive, emotional, behavioural and social functions, and seems to be perpetuated by both positive and negative reinforcement. A possible pathological collecting function was identified for a small minority of IIOC offenders in study three, and any link between IIOC offending and collected related disorders would need further investigation before conclusions could be drawn. Cognitive-emotional processes used to relate to the image and to continue collecting differed significantly between image collectors and IIOC offenders. IIOC offenders seem to project shame and anxiety onto the image, and use cognitive distortions to support abuse of children. The image collectors appear to imbue images with affection and many built long-term attachments to the images they collected. With more clarity about the processes or steps taken when collecting, McIntosh and Schmeichel’s (2004) model of collecting was adapted and updated to develop a new testable model of normative collecting and a modified version of this new collecting model was developed for IIOC offenders. Limitations and implications for each of the studies are discussed, along with ideas for future research...|$|E

40|$|Long {{molecules}} such as fibrous proteins {{are particularly}} difficult to characterise structurally. We have recently designed a microvolume Couette flow linear dichroism (LD) cell whose sample volume is only 20 - 40 mL {{in contrast to}} previous cells where the volume of sample required has typically been {{of the order of}} 1000 - 2000 mL. This brings the sample requirements of LD to a level where it can be used for biological samples. Since LD is the difference in absorption of light polarised parallel to an orientation direction and perpendicular to that direction, it is the ideal technique for determining relative orientations of subunits of e. g. fibrous proteins, DNA-drug systems, etc. For solution phase samples, Couette flow orientation, whereby the sample is sandwiched between two cylinders, one of which rotates, has proved to be the optimal technique for LD experiments in many laboratories. Our capillary microvolume LD cell has been designed using extruded quartz rods and capillaries and focusing and <b>collecting</b> <b>lenses.</b> We have developed applications with PCR products, fibrous proteins, liposome-bound membrane proteins, as well as DNA-dye systems. Despite this range of applications, to date there is nothing reported in the literature to enable one to validate the performance of Couette flow LD cells. In this paper we establish validation criteria and show that the data from the microvolume cells are reproducible, vary by less than 1 % with sample reloading, follow the Beer-Lambert law, and have signals linear in voltage over a wide voltage range. The microvolume cell data are consistent with those from the large-volume cells for DNA samples. Surprisingly, upon extending the wavelength range by adding the intercalator ethidium bromide, the spectra in the microvolume and large-volume cells differ by a wavelength dependent orientation parameter. This wavelength variation was concluded {{to be the result of}} Taylor-vortices in the large-volume cells which have inner rotating cylinders in our laboratory. Thus the microvolume LD cells can be concluded to provide better data than our large-volume LD cells, though the latter are still to be preferred for titration series as it is extremely difficult to add sample to the capillary cells without introducing artefacts...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{accurate}} range sensor for the three-dimensional reconstruction of environments is designed and developed. Following {{the principles of}} laser profilometry, the device exploits a set of optical transmitters able to project a laser line on the environment. A high-resolution and high-frame-rate camera assisted by a telecentric <b>lens</b> <b>collects</b> the laser light reflected by a parabolic mirror, whose shape is designed ad hoc to achieve a maximum measurement error of 10 mm when the target is placed 3 m away from the laser source. Measurements are derived {{by means of an}} analytical model, whose parameters are estimated during a preliminary calibration phase. Geometrical parameters, analytical modeling and image processing steps are validated through several experiments, which indicate the capability of the proposed device to recover the shape of a target with high accuracy. Experimental measurements show Gaussian statistics, having standard deviation of 1. 74 mm within the measurable range. Results prove that the presented range sensor is a good candidate for environmental inspections and measurements...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) {{can be used as}} an alternative method for the determination of macro (P, K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients (B, Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn) in pellets of plant materials. However, information is required regarding the sample preparation for plant analysis by LIBS. In this work, methods involving cryogenic grinding and planetary ball milling were evaluated for leaves comminution before pellets preparation. The particle sizes were associated to chemical sample properties such as fiber and cellulose contents, as well as to pellets porosity and density. The pellets were ablated at 30 different sites by applying 25 laser pulses per site (Nd:YAG@ 1064 nm, 5 ns, 10 Hz, 25 Jcm− 2). The plasma emission <b>collected</b> by <b>lenses</b> was directed through an optical fiber towards a high resolution echelle spectrometer equipped with an ICCD. Delay time and integration time gate were fixed at 2. 0 and 4. 5 μs, respectively. Experiments carried out with pellets of sugarcane, orange tree and soy leaves showed a significant effect of the plant species for choosing the most appropriate grinding conditions. By using ball milling with agate materials, 20 min grinding for orange tree and soy, and 60 min for sugarcane leaves led to particle size distributions generally lower than 75 μm. Cryogenic grinding yielded similar particle size distributions after 10 min for orange tree, 20 min for soy and 30 min for sugarcane leaves. There was up to 50 % emission signal enhancement on LIBS measurements for most elements by improving particle size distribution and consequently the pellet porosity...|$|R
