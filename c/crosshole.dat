50|$|Geological {{models can}} be {{simulated}} {{for a variety}} of geophysical measurement systems such as conventional dipole-dipole, , time domain electromagnetics(TEM), Magnetotellurics(MT), /, magnetic, gravity, resistivity and induced polarization systems. Surveys can be airborne, ground, down a hole, <b>crosshole,</b> underwater or on the water. A survey is defined by properties related to a transmitter, a receiver and other system properties. The system and survey parameters are stored with the input data allowing the user freedom from continually specifying these parameters for every model. Synthetic measurements at the receiver due to the model are what are calculated during a simulation. Early versions of EMIGMA could simulate the responses of 3d blocks, thin plates and the response of a many layered earth model. Simulation algorithms now include one for a sphere model, and alternate algorithms for thin plates and various algorithms for 3D prisms and polyhedra.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} {{significant}} advances in the acquisition and processing of <b>crosshole</b> seismic reflection data, and the method {{has been shown to}} be a high resolution imaging technique. However, the fidelity of the final images produced by this technique needs to be considered carefully to avoid incorrect interpretation. This thesis concerns the imaging capability of <b>crosshole</b> surveys, as well as advances made in processing techniques for application to <b>crosshole</b> seismic reflection surveys. In a migrated seismic section, a meaningful image is only obtained if a range of dips around the local structural dip is sampled at each image point. For <b>crosshole</b> seismic reflection surveys, the distribution of dips sampled at an image point is controlled principally by the survey geometry, including source and receiver array lengths and their element spacings. By considering the dips sampled, the imaging capability of <b>crosshole</b> reflection surveying is discussed, with suggestions as to how to ensure optimal imaging of the target zone. To overcome problems encountered in applying standard processing procedures, two new processing techniques are presented which enhance the imaging potential of <b>crosshole</b> reflection seismics. Generalised Berryhill migration has been developed as a full generalised Kirchhoff migration to include the near-field term, with the aim of improving image accuracy close to the source and receiver arrays. 3 -D f-k-k filtering is an improved method of wavefield separation for <b>crosshole</b> seismic data. Finally, the results of processing three types of dataset are presented. One is from a site in the Groningen gas field, another was acquired through a model interrogated at ultrasonic frequencies in a water tank, and the third type was acquired using coal exploration boreholes in Yorkshire. The results demonstrate the imaging capability of the <b>crosshole</b> reflection method, and the success of the two new processing schemes...|$|E

The holes have been drilled through a horizontally layered sequence of Carboniferous limestones, shales and sandstones. Estimates of intrinsic Q were obtained for frequencies between approximately 500 Hz and 1. 5 kHz. A comparison {{with the results of}} Part I suggests evidence of frequency-dependent intrinsic Q with attenuation at 1 kHz being significantly greater than at 100 Hz. No change of intrinsic attenuation with ray direction from horizontal (O O) to 60 " was observed. However, since no high-frequency <b>crosshole</b> data for ray angles between 60 " and vertical is available, we cannot entirely discount the possibility that the difference in intrinsic Q estimates from the vertical VSP data (Part I) and the <b>crosshole</b> data is due, at least in part, to anisotropic intrinsic attenuation.

The {{results show that the}} <b>crosshole</b> significantly alters the shakedown behaviour of thick cylindrical vessels. The limit pressure is relatively unaffected, but the shakedown pressure decreases significantly.

40|$|The {{integration}} of geophysical data into the subsurface characterization {{problem has been}} shown in many cases to significantly improve hydrological knowledge by providing information at spatial scales and locations that is unattainable using conventional hydrological measurement techniques. In particular, <b>crosshole</b> ground-penetrating radar (GPR) tomography has shown much promise in hydrology because of its ability to provide highly detailed images of subsurface radar wave velocity, which is strongly linked to soil water content. Here, we develop and demonstrate a procedure for inverting together multiple <b>crosshole</b> GPR data sets in order to characterize the spatial distribution of radar wave velocity below the water table at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS) near Boise, Idaho, USA. Specifically, we jointly invert 31 intersecting <b>crosshole</b> GPR profiles to obtain a highly resolved and consistent radar velocity model along the various profile directions. The model is found to be strongly correlated with complementary neutron porosity-log data and is further corroborated by larger-scale structural information at the BHRS. This work is an important prerequisite to using <b>crosshole</b> GPR data together with existing hydrological measurements for improved groundwater flow and contaminant transport modeling...|$|E

The <b>crosshole</b> seismic survey is well suited to the mapping of injection fluids or fracture patterns following reservoir stimulation. Both traveltime tomography and wave-equation techniques {{can be used to}} monitor and map changes in the seismic velocities, given pre-stimulation and post-stimulation <b>crosshole</b> seismic data. In order to evaluate algorithms for EOR mapping using <b>crosshole</b> seismic surveys, data were ob-tained from a scale model of a <b>crosshole</b> seismic survey. The epoxy resin model contained simulated geological structures with strong velocity contrasts. Two versions of the same model were constructed, both with and without a simulated “flood ” zone of a known geometry. Traveltime tomography and tow wave-equation algorithms, the inverse generalized Radon transform (inverse CRT) and fre-quency-domain wave-equation imaging,were used to attempt to locate the extent and velocities of the perturbation. The results of this experiment show that traveltime tomography suffices to locate the flood zone and to determine the magnitude of the velocity perturbations.

All current <b>crosshole</b> georadar waveform inversion strategies are based on the assumption of frequency-independent electromagnetic constitutive parameters. However, in reality, these parameters are known to be frequency-dependent and complex and thus recorded georadar data may show significant dispersive behavior. In this paper, we evaluate synthetically the reconstruction limits of a recently published <b>crosshole</b> georadar waveform inversion scheme in the presence of varying degrees of dielectric dispersion. Our results indicate that, when combined with a source wavelet estimation procedure that provides a means of partially accounting for the frequency-dependent effects through an "effective" wavelet, the inversion algorithm performs remarkably well in weakly to moderately dispersive environments and has the ability to provide adequate tomographic reconstructions...|$|E

40|$|Electromagnetic (EM) methods, long {{used for}} {{borehole}} logging as a formation evaluation tool in developed oil fields, are rarely applied in surface or <b>crosshole</b> configurations or applied in cased wells.

However, recent experimental success with <b>crosshole</b> EM systems for water and steam flood monitoring using fiberglass cased wells has shown promise in applying these techniques to development and production (D & P) problems. This paper describes technological solutions that will allow for successful application of EM techniques in oil fields, despite surface noise and steel casing. First an example sites the application of long offset logging to map resistivity structure away from the borehole. Next, a successful application of <b>crosshole</b> EM where one of the wells is steel cased is described. The potential application of earth`s field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to map fluid saturation at large distances from the boreholes is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Hidden mineshafts {{located in}} urban areas are a {{significant}} problem {{across much of the}} industrialized world. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a technique that can detect and characterize hidden mine entries by exploiting resistivity contrasts between the shaft and surrounding materials, resulting from either compositional or structural differences. A case study is presented in which both surface and <b>crosshole</b> 3 D ERT surveys are used to image a hidden backfilled mineshaft at a built environment site, situated on Carboniferous Lower Coal Measures strata in the UK. Backfilled shafts generally present the greatest challenge for detection using geophysical methods, as contrasts between the fill and bedrock are typically low compared to air or water-filled conditions. Nevertheless, the shaft in this case was identified by both the surface and <b>crosshole</b> 3 D surveys. The shaft appeared as a strongly resistive anomaly relative to background materials, which we interpreted as resulting from the disturbed fabric of the fill materials rather than any significant compositional differences. The study highlighted the respective strengths and weaknesses of the surface and <b>crosshole</b> ERT methodologies for this type of problem. The surface survey, which covered a non-rectangular area to accommodate irregular boundaries and other physical obstructions, provided a relatively rapid means of investigating the study site. However, this method had a limited depth of investigation and was constrained in its coverage by the locations of buildings. By contrast, the 3 D <b>crosshole</b> method was able to image the shaft {{to the level of the}} deepest borehole electrodes. Although <b>crosshole</b> ERT is too expensive to be used for large-scale mineshaft surveys, this study clearly demonstrates its suitability for targeted investigations where surface methods cannot be deployed, such as scanning beneath surface structures or in situations where it is essential for resolution to be maintained with depth.

The method largely avoids assumptions about the radiation pattern and in-situ intensity of the transmitting antenna, which introduce errors in conventional single-frequency <b>crosshole</b> electromagnetic-absorption tomography. Application of the method to field data achieved an improvement in resolution of anomalies over traditional single-frequency absorption tomography.

40|$|Original {{wide band}} antennas {{dedicated}} to the imaging of the subsurface by <b>crosshole</b> or surface radar for civil engineering application have been developed. The challenge in the developments is twofold: {{in the case of}} <b>crosshole</b> radar, the design of a narrow antenna less than 61 cm wide working in the frequency band [0. 5; 1. 5] GHz, {{and in the case of}} a surface radar the design of a compact antenna less than 55 cm long working in the frequency range [0. 3; 1] GHz. FDTD simulations have allowed to propose optimized antenna geometries and to model both types of transmission links in the presence of a layered soil representing a moisture gradient. A first measurement campaign performed in the frequency domain in a clay sand embankment has allowed to validate the theoretical developments associated with the <b>crosshole</b> radar and to extract the dielectric parameters (permittivity and attenuation coefficient) as a function of the depth. The experimental validation of the surface radar will further be made and the performances of both types of radars will be compared...|$|E

In this paper, the shakedown and ratchetting {{behavior of a}} thin cylinder, a thick cylinder, and a thick cylinder with a radial <b>crosshole</b> is investigated by inelastic finite element analysis. Load interaction diagrams identifying regions of elastic shakedown, plastic shakedown, and ratchetting are presented. The interaction diagrams for the plain cylinders are shown {{to be similar to}} the Bree diagram. Incorporating a radial crossbore, Rc/Ri= 0. 1 or less, in the thick cylinder significantly reduces the plastic shakedown boundary on the interaction diagram but does not significantly affect the ratchet boundary. The radial <b>crosshole,</b> for the geometry considered in this study, can be regarded as a local structural discontinuity and neglected when determining the maximum shakedown or (primary plus secondary stress) load in design by analysis.

A profile of RMT data collected over highly resistive granite was used to map subhorizontal fracture zones below 300 m depth, as well as a steeply dipping fracture zone, which was also observed on a coinciding seismic reflection profile. One-dimensional inverse modelling and 3 D forward modelling with displacement currents included were necessary to test the reliability of features found in the 2 D models, where the forward models did not include displacement currents and only lower frequencies were considered. An inversion code for RMT data was developed and applied to RMT data with azimuthal electrical anisotropy signature collected over a limestone formation. The results indicated that RMT is a faster and more reliable technique for studying electrical anisotropy than are azimuthal resistivity surveys. A new sequential inversion method to estimate hydraulic conductivity fields using <b>crosshole</b> GPR and tracer test data was applied to 2 D synthetic examples. Given careful surveying, the results indicated that regularization of hydrogeological inverse problems using geophysical tomograms might improve models of hydraulic conductivity. A method to regularize geophysical inverse problems using geostatistical models was developed and applied to <b>crosshole</b> ERT and GPR data collected in unsaturated sandstone. The resulting models were geologically more reasonable than models where the regularization was based on traditional smoothness constraints.

We derive the far-field approximation of an electric field radiated by an electric point source. In this derivation, {{we assume that the}} point source is in a cylindrically layered medium, while the observed electric field is in another cylindrically layered medium. The equations that are derived are used as a transfer function to connect the two impedance matrices—one for the transmitting antenna and the other one for the receiving one. In these matrices, the influence of the scattered field by the borehole is included completely. We conducted field experiments in granite with a controlled borehole medium in order to investigate the influence of the borehole. In this paper, we estimated the relative amplitude and the group delay of the received signals between the water-filled borehole case and the air-filled borehole case. This paper showed that the estimated amplitude and delay depend on the frequency and that the proposed MoM could predict these frequency dependencies.

40|$|Copyright ASEG 2001 The {{electrical}} resistivity method {{has been used}} in the exploration industry for many years. However, it is mainly used on surface surveys and has not been applied extensively in <b>crosshole</b> situations. Two reasons for this are {{that there is not a}} very good inversion technique developed for <b>crosshole</b> geometries and there is not a good way to display <b>crosshole</b> survey data like pseudosections in surface surveys. But the need for detecting geological structures between two boreholes in the mining industry is urgent. Here we present a few examples for detecting ore body continuity with the 2. 5 D resistivity tomography method. Firstly, we produce a few sets of borehole numerical modelling data for different models, with our 2. 5 D FEM resistivity modelling program. Then, our 2. 5 D FEM resistivity inversion program is used to invert the model data to obtain the resistivity distribution between the two boreholes. The three examples show that 2. 5 D resistivity inversion can clearly detect the ore body continuity between two boreholes from simple bipole bipole scanning data. The technique can be very easily used in exploration and is most useful for mining purposes to delineate the structure between boreholes. Jingping Zhe and Stewart Greenhalg...|$|E
40|$|Waveform-based tomographic imaging of <b>crosshole</b> {{georadar}} data is {{a powerful}} method to investigate the shallow subsurface because {{of its ability to}} provide images of electrical properties in near-surface environments with unprecedented spatial resolution. A critical issue with waveform inversion is the a priori unknown source signal. Indeed, the estimation of the source pulse is notoriously difficult but essential for the effective application of this method. Here, we explore the viability and robustness of a recently proposed deconvolution-based procedure to estimate the source pulse during waveform inversion of <b>crosshole</b> georadar data, where changes in wavelet shape with location as a result of varying near-field conditions and differences in antenna coupling may be significant. Specifically, we examine whether a single, average estimated source current function can adequately represent the pulses radiated at all transmitter locations during a <b>crosshole</b> georadar survey, or whether a separate source wavelet estimation should be performed for each transmitter gather. Tests with synthetic and field data indicate that remarkably good tomographic reconstructions can be obtained using a single estimated source pulse when moderate to strong variability exists in the true source signal with antenna location. Only in the case of very strong variability in the true source pulse are tomographic reconstructions clearly improved by estimating a different source wavelet for each transmitter location...|$|E
40|$|Spatially highly {{resolved}} {{mapping of}} aquifer heterogeneities {{is critical for}} the accurate prediction of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Here, we demonstrate the value of using full-waveform inversion of <b>crosshole</b> ground penetrating radar (GPR) data for aquifer characterization. We analyze field data from the Krauthausen test site, where <b>crosshole</b> GPR data were acquired along a transect of 20 m length and 10 m depth. Densely spaced cone penetration tests (CPT), located close to the GPR transect, were used to validate and interpret the tomographic images obtained from GPR. A strong correlation was observed between CPT porosity logs and porosity estimates derived from GPR using the Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM). A less pronounced correlation was observed between electrical conductivity data derived from GPR and CPT. Cluster analysis of the GPR data defined three different subsurface facies, which were found to correspond to sediments with different grain size and porosity. In conclusion, our study suggests that full-waveform inversion of <b>crosshole</b> GPR data followed by cluster analysis is an applicable approach to identify hydrogeological facies in alluvial aquifers and to map their architecture and connectivity. Such facies maps provide valuable information about the subsurface heterogeneity {{and can be used}} to construct geologically realistic subsurface models for numerical flow and transport prediction...|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain the}} highest-resolution ray-based tomographic images from <b>crosshole</b> ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data, wide angular ray {{coverage}} of the region between the two boreholes is required. Unfortunately, at borehole spacings {{on the order of}} a few meters, high-angle traveltime data (i. e., traveltime data corresponding to transmitter-receiver angles greater than approximately 50 ° from the horizontal) are notoriously difficult to incorporate into <b>crosshole</b> GPR inversions. This is because (1) low signal-to-noise ratios make the accurate picking of first-arrival times at high angles extremely difficult, and (2) significant tomographic artifacts commonly appear when high- and low-angle ray data are inverted together. We address and overcome these two issues for a <b>crosshole</b> GPR data example collected at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site (BHRS). To estimate first-arrival times on noisy, high-angle gathers, we develop a robust and automatic picking strategy based on crosscorrelations, where reference waveforms are determined from the data through the stacking of common-ray-angle gathers. To overcome incompatibility issues between high- and low-angle data, we modify the standard tomographic inversion strategy to estimate, in addition to subsurface velocities, parameters that describe a traveltime 2 ̆ 7 correction curve 2 ̆ 7 as a function of angle. Application of our modified inversion strategy, to both synthetic data and the BHRS data set, shows that it allows the successful incorporation of all available traveltime data to obtain significantly improved subsurface velocity images...|$|E

In particular, recent evidence has suggested that the stochastic inversion of <b>crosshole</b> GPR traveltime data can allow for a significant reduction in uncertainty regarding subsurface van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) parameters. Much of the previous work on the stochastic estimation of VGM parameters from <b>crosshole</b> GPR data has considered the case of steady-state infiltration conditions, which represent {{only a small fraction of}} practically relevant scenarios. We explored in detail the dynamic infiltration case, specifically examining to what extent time-lapse <b>crosshole</b> GPR traveltimes, measured during a forced infiltration experiment at the Arreneas field site in Denmark, could help to quantify VGM parameters and their uncertainties in a layered medium, as well as the corresponding soil hydraulic properties. We used a Bayesian Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo inversion approach. We first explored the advantages and limitations of this approach with regard to a realistic synthetic example before applying it to field measurements. In our analysis, we also considered different degrees of prior information. Our findings indicate that the stochastic inversion of the time-lapse GPR data does indeed allow for a substantial refinement in the inferred posterior VGM parameter distributions compared with the corresponding priors, which in turn significantly improves knowledge of soil hydraulic properties.

40|$|Seismic waveform-inversion offers {{opportunities}} for detailed {{characterization of the}} subsurface. However, its full potential can only be exploited when any systematic source and receiver effects are either carefully avoided or appropriately accounted for during the inversions. Repeated <b>crosshole</b> measurements in the Mont Terri (Switzerland) underground laboratory have revealed that receiver coupling may significantly affect the seismic waveforms. More seriously, coupling conditions may vary {{during the course of}} a monitoring experiment. To address this problem, we have developed a novel scheme that estimates medium properties, frequency-dependent source functions, and frequency-dependent receiver-coupling factors. We demonstrate the efficacy of the new scheme via a synthetic 2 D <b>crosshole</b> experiment in which realistic receiver-coupling factors are incorporated. Because determination of medium parameters and estimation of source functions and receiver-coupling factors are largely separated, the method can be easily adapted to any other waveform-inversion problem, including elastic, anisotropic, 2. 5 D, or 3 D situations.

40|$|Non-linear {{stress-strain}} {{characteristics and}} stiffness-strain relationships of sedimentary soils and sands at small strains {{have been reported}} by many researchers. Research work on the behaviour of weathered or decomposed granites at small strains, however, has rarely been reported. This paper compares some stiffness measurements of decomposed granites from field investigations involving <b>crosshole</b> seismic, self-boring pressuremeter (SBPM), and high pressure dilatometer as well as results from laboratory tests using bender element and internal transducers. The in-situ <b>crosshole</b> measurements show that the elastic stiffness of Moderately Decomposed Granite (MDG, approximately 7000 MPa) is about 25 % greater than that (about 5500 MPa) of Highly Decomposed Granite (HDG), which is in turn approximately 18 times higher than that (about 300 MPa) of Completely Decomposed Granite (CDG). This is likely attributable to the materials' different bond strengths and structures. A new method has been adopted to interpret the SBPM data. Measured data from <b>crosshole</b> seismic and self-boring pressure meter tests for CDG {{are found to be}} consistent. Bender element laboratory tests on CDG indicate that the measured A-coefficient in the expression of G(0) /p(t) = A(p/p(t)) (n) lies between the results from clay and sand as reported in the literature. However, the measured n-value for CDG is generally larger for clays and sands. The measured bender element results are consistent with data from internal transducers. Highly non-linear characteristics of CDG were observed in both the laboratory and field tests.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{geometric}} errors on <b>crosshole</b> resistivity data are investigated using analytical methods. Geometric errors are systematic and can occur due to uncertainties {{in the individual}} electrode positions, the vertical spacing between electrodes in the same borehole, or the vertical offset between electrodes in opposite boreholes. An estimate of the sensitivity to geometric error is calculated for each of two generic types of four-electrode <b>crosshole</b> configuration: current flow and potential difference <b>crosshole</b> (XH) and in-hole (IH). It is found that XH configurations are not particularly sensitive to geometric error unless the boreholes are closely spaced {{on the scale of}} the vertical separation of the current and potential electrodes. However, extremely sensitive IH configurations are shown to exist for any borehole separation. Therefore, it is recommended that XH configurations be used in preference to IH schemes. The effects of geometric error are demonstrated using real XH data from a closely spaced line of boreholes designed to monitor bioremediation of chlorinated solvents at an industrial site. Asmall fraction of the data had physically unrealistic apparent resistivities, which were either negative or unexpectedly large. However by filtering out configurations with high sensitivities to geometric error, all of the suspect data were removed. This filtering also significantly improved the convergence between the predicted and the measured resistivities when the data were inverted. In addition to systematic geometric errors, the measured data also exhibit a high level of random noise.

Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) {{is an essential part}} of this multi-method concept in order to image the spatial extent of the CO 2 plume. ERT is shown to be sensitive to saturation changes caused by propagation of supercritical CO 2 within a brine-filled reservoir. A permanent downhole electrode installation is placed behind casing in the three Ketzin wells (one for CO 2 injection and two for observation). The so-called Vertical Electrical Resistivity Array (VERA) is deployed as <b>crosshole</b> configuration at a depth ranging from 590 to 735 meters, penetrating the Stuttgart formation, which hosts the target storage reservoir. For more than two years after finishing drilling and installation work the electrode array has been operating at a temperature of about 35  °C, an average reservoir pressure of about 75 bar, and a formation fluid pH of 5. 5. These conditions have an effect on the life time of the components of the electrical monitoring system. Therefore, the performance of the VERA system has to be evaluated thoroughly during its long-term application. From the first results of the ongoing project we can conclude that <b>crosshole</b> ERT is indeed valuable as part of the CO 2 monitoring program. Further use of the time-lapse resistivity data is in progress, e. g.  support of CO 2 distribution mapping in conjunction with results of seismic measurements. In the frame of an integrated monitoring concept, <b>crosshole</b> ERT can support the regulator’s work concerning safe reservoir operation and efficient risk management...|$|E
40|$|Thermal tracing {{experiments}} are becoming common in hydrogeology to estimate parameters governing heat transport processes and to study geothermal reservoirs. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has proven {{its ability to}} monitor salt tracer tests, but few studies have investigated its performances, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in thermal tracing experiments. In this study, we monitored a heat injection and pumping experiment in an alluvial aquifer using both surface and <b>crosshole</b> ERT. The data sets of the surface profile, located along the main direction of flow, are distorted during injection by an electrical short-circuit through the external pumping-heating-injection experimental set-up. Current is flowing outside the subsurface leading to bad data for electrode dipoles located near the pumping and injection wells. The <b>crosshole</b> ERT panel is perpendicular to the main direction of flow. Difference inversion time-lapse images clearly show a preferential flow path {{in the bottom of}} the aquifer related to the presence of a coarse and clean gravel layer. Direct temperature measurements are available in control piezometers during the experiment to validate the ERT-derived temperatures and confirm the spatial pattern of temperature observed with ERT. Breakthrough curves are correctly retrieved in time and difference of 10 to 20 % are observed for temperature estimation. The latter requires site-specific petrophysical laws and chemical stability assumptions that must be carefully verified. Our study proves that ERT, especially <b>crosshole</b> ERT, is a reliable tool to follow thermal tracing experiments but also to characterize heat transfer in the subsurface and to monitor geothermal resource exploitations. We also show that surface ERT may be impacted by the survey layout in unsuspected ways...|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce costs and {{increase}} revenues at mines, there is a strong incentive to develop high-resolution techniques both for near-mine exploration and for delineation of known orebodies To investigate the potential of high-frequency EM techniques for exploration and delineation of massive sulfide orebodies, radio frequency electromagnetic (RFEM) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted in boreholes through the McConnell massive nickel-copper sulfide body near Sudbury, Ontario, from 1993 - 1996. <b>Crosshole</b> RFEM data were acquired with a JW- 4 electric dipole system between two boreholes on section 2720 W. Ten frequencies between 0. 5 and 5. 0 MHz were recorded. Radio signals propagated through the Sudbury Breccia over ranges of at least 150 m at all frequencies. The resulting radio absorption tomogram clearly imaged the McConnell deposit over 110 m downdip. Signal was extinguished when either antenna entered the sulfide body. However, the expected radio shadow did not eventuate when transmitter and receiver were {{on opposite sides of the}} deposit. Two-dimensional modeling suggested that diffraction around the edges of the sulfide body could not account for the observed held amplitudes. It was concluded at the time that the sulfide body is discontinuous; according to modeling, a gap as small as 5 m could have explained the observations. Subsequent investigations by INCO established that pick-up in the metal-cored downhole cables was actually responsible for the elevated signal levels. Both single-hole reflection profiles and <b>crosshole</b> measurements were acquired using RAMAC borehole radar systems, operating at 60 MHz. Detection of radar reflections from the sulfide contact was problematic. One coherent reflection was observed from the hanging-wall contact in single-hole reflection mode. This reflection could be traced about 25 m uphole from the contact. In addition to unfavorable survey geometry, factors which may have suppressed reflections included host rock heterogeneity, disseminated sulfides, and contact irregularity. Velocity and absorption tomograms were generated in the Sudbury Breccia host rock from the <b>crosshole</b> radar. Radar velocity was variable, averaging 125 m/mus, while absorption was typically 0. 8 dB/m at 60 MHz. Kirchhoff-style 2 -D migration of later arrivals in the <b>crosshole</b> radargrams defined reflective zones that roughly parallel the inferred edge of the sulfide body. The McConnell high-frequency EM surveys established that radio tomography and simple radio shadowing are potentially valuable for near- and in-mine exploration and orebody delineation in the Sudbury Breccia. The effectiveness of borehole radar in this particular environment is less certain...|$|E
