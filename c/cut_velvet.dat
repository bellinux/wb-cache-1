2500|$|Some of {{the costumes}} created by Biggar's staff {{did not appear}} in {{the final version of the}} films. In Revenge of the Sith, for example, a multi-colored [...] "Peacock Gown" [...] and a [...] "Green <b>Cut</b> <b>Velvet</b> Robe" [...] worn by Padmé in scenes {{featuring}} the Delegation of 2000 were deleted during post-production. Biggar remarks that the Peacock Gown had been one of her favorite designs and that much time and money had been invested in these particular costumes. Ultimately, the Peacock Gown would be used only for the film's theatrical poster. The velvet robe was ultimately re-used for a short scene filmed during pick-up photography, thus appearing in the film, and features on the DVD cover art.|$|E

25|$|The general {{trend toward}} {{abundant}} surface ornamentation in the Elizabethan Era was expressed in clothing, especially amongst the aristocracy in England. Shirts and chemises were embroidered with blackwork and edged in lace. Heavy <b>cut</b> <b>velvets</b> and brocades were further ornamented with applied bobbin lace, {{gold and silver}} embroidery, and jewels. Toward {{the end of the}} period, polychrome (multicolored) silk embroidery became highly desirable and fashionable for the public representation of aristocratic wealth.|$|R

6000|$|A famous tailor {{from the}} West End of the town--Mr. Osborne {{would have none}} of your City or Holborn bunglers, he said, for the boy (though a City tailor was good enough for HIM)--was summoned to {{ornament}} little George's person, and was told to spare no expense in so doing. So, Mr. Woolsey, of Conduit Street, gave a loose to his imagination and sent the child home fancy trousers, fancy waistcoats, and fancy jackets enough to furnish a school of little dandies. Georgy had little white waistcoats for evening parties, and little <b>cut</b> <b>velvet</b> waistcoats for dinners, and a dear little darling shawl dressing-gown, {{for all the world like}} a little man. He dressed for dinner every day, [...] "like a regular West End swell," [...] as his grandfather remarked; one of the domestics was affected to his special service, attended him at his toilette, answered his bell, and brought him his letters always on a silver tray.|$|E
50|$|The festive {{ceremonial}} costumes differ somewhat across regions. In the Sahel, {{the centerpiece}} of the ceremonial dress is a dress draped in wool or cotton, drawn to a bodice embroidered with silk and silver, a velvet jacket decorated with gold, lace pants and a silk belt. Until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, the brides of the wealthy aristocracy of Tunis often wore a Kaftan <b>cut</b> in <b>velvet,</b> brocade or silk and richly embroidered with gold and enriched with precious stones. Nowadays, some marrying in Sousse and Hammamet still wear a kaftan with elbow-length sleeves, an open front, and varying in length from the knee to the mid calf. The richness and originality of the costumes are typically based less on the cut or the fabric as they are on woven patterns or embroidery.|$|R

This grass was used in Europe for estate lawns and golf courses because it could be <b>cut</b> so short. <b>Velvet</b> bent grass requires similar upkeep and maintenance to creeping bent. Velvet bent has recently had a resurgence in the UK due to the high demands on greens from inclement weather and speed expectations. This species also has a lighter color than the two previous species.|$|R

He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a {{listless}} manner with the pommel of his dagger. On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat, {{and a pair of}} riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed-pearls wrought into a curious device. A short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings. Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|She {{found the}} Sultana and her six {{beautiful}} {{children in a}} room which, though not imposing in size, glittered with decoration. The ceiling and walls were rich with tessellated and arabesque work. The floor {{was covered with a}} carpet of <b>cut</b> <b>velvet,</b> with a pattern of the richest and most brightly-coloured flowers; and this carpet was strewn with costly jewels, which shone in the variegated light of the stained-glass windows above like glowing fire-flies. Around the walls were several recesses or niches, arched in the Moorish horse-shoe style. In one of these was a glass cabinet, on the shelves of which were some splendid articles of jewellery. In another recess hung a variety of swords and pistols, chiefly of Eastern manufacture, their handles and scabbards blazing with diamonds. Opposite to these stood a gilt four-post European bedstead, with four mattresses of gold brocade, and curtains of blue tiffany embroidered with gold sprigs. In fact, the apartment and its occupants were adorned with so much magnificence that the genie of Aladdin's famous lamp would not have improved it, for, although that remarkable personage might have brought unlimited treasure to its decoration, he would not have found a spare inch anywhere on which to bestow it! ...|$|E

Stripes will arrange your dressing things;' and that functionary, entering {{at the same}} time, proceeded to gut my portmanteau, and {{to lay out the}} black kerseymeres, 'the rich <b>cut</b> <b>velvet</b> Genoa waistcoat,' the white choker, and other polite articles of evening costume, with great gravity and despatch. 'A great dinner-party,' thinks I to myself, seeing these preparations (and not, perhaps, displeased at the idea that some of the best people in the neighbourhood were coming to see me). 'Hark, theres the first bell ringing! 'said Ponto, moving away; and, in fact, a clamorous harbinger of victuals began clanging from the stable turret, and announced the agreeable fact that dinner would appear in half-an-hour. 'If the dinner is as grand as the dinner-bell,' thought I, 'faith, I'm in good quarters!' and had leisure, during the half-hour's interval, not only to advance my own person to the utmost polish of elegance which it is capable of receiving, to admire the pedigree of the Pontos hanging over the chimney, and the Ponto crest and arms emblazoned on the wash-hand basin and jug, but to make a thousand reflections on the happiness of a country life--upon the innocent friendliness and cordiality of rustic intercourse; and to sigh for an opportunity of retiring, like Ponto, to my own fields, to my own vine and fig-tree, with a placens uxor in my domus, and a half-score of sweet young pledges of affection sporting round my paternal knee.|$|E
60|$|The apartment, {{in which}} our adventurer now found himself, afforded no bad {{illustration}} {{of the character of}} its occupant. In its form, and proportions it was a cabin of the usual size and arrangements; but, in its furniture and equipments, it exhibited a singular admixture of luxury and martial preparation. The lamp, which swung from the upper deck, was of solid silver; and, though adapted to its present situation by mechanical ingenuity, there was that, in its shape and ornaments, which betrayed it had once been used before some shrine of a far more sacred character. Massive candlesticks of the same precious metal, and which partook of the same ecclesiastical formation, were on a venerable table, whose mahogany was glittering with the polish of half a century, and whose gilded claws, and carved supporters, bespoke an original destination very different from the ordinary service of a ship. A couch, covered with <b>cut</b> <b>velvet,</b> stood along the transom; while a divan, of blue silk, lay against the bulkhead opposite, manifesting, by its fashion, its materials, and its piles of pillows, that even Asia had been made to contribute to the ease of its luxurious owner. In addition to these prominent articles, there were cut glass, mirrors, plate, and even hangings; each of which, by something peculiar in its fashion or materials, bespoke an origin different from that of its neighbour. In short, splendour and elegance seemed to have been much more consulted than propriety, or conformity in taste, in the selection of most of those articles, which had been, oddly enough, made to contribute to the caprice or to the comfort of their singular possessor.|$|E

Michael not only gave me a job, he gave me a tiny apartment upstairs. The whole operation employed about five girls, who drilled pin blocks, used a table saw and a lathe, but also worked on eccentric machines that Michael had made himself out of sewing machine parts: we used those to wind wire, <b>cut</b> felt and <b>velvet,</b> and make the jacks that pluck harpsichord strings. Sometimes we ran out of parts and I was supposed to write what we needed on a blackboard. Instead ... I used the blackboard to write poems.|$|R

His form, which was a large and stately one, was clad in a brilliant blue <b>velvet,</b> <b>cut</b> in the richest Renaissance fashion, and slashed so as to show gleams and gaps of a wonderful lemon or pale yellow. He had several chains round his neck, and his plumes, which were of several tints of bronze and gold, hung down to the great gold hilt of his long sword.

60|$|He {{followed}} the tramp as far off {{as he could}} and still keep him in sight, and he sometimes thought he had lost him, in the streets that climbed and crooked beyond the Common towards the quarter whither they were going; but he reappeared, slouching and shambling rapidly on, {{in the glare of}} some electric lights that stamped the ground with shadows thick and black as if <b>cut</b> in <b>velvet</b> or burnt into the surface. Here and there some girl brushed against the boy, and gave him a joking or jeering word; her face flashed into light for a moment, and then vanished in the darkness she passed into. It was that hot October, and the night was close and still; on the steps of some of the houses groups of fat, weary women were sitting, and children were playing on the sidewalks, using the lamp-posts for goal or tag. The tramp ahead of Lemuel issued upon a brilliantly lighted little square, with a great many horse-cars coming and going in it; a church with stores on the ground floor, and fronting it on one side a row of handsome old stone houses with iron fences, and on another a great hotel, with a high-pillared portico, where men sat talking and smoking.|$|R

2500|$|The English {{account is}} similar, but {{mentions}} {{the presence of}} five or six thousand horsemen and some foot soldiers, positioned to prevent the short march from Granton to Leith at a ford on the Water of Leith. The Cardinal was with this army but after a few shots and only a couple of casualties on either side, the Scots abandoned their position at the ford of a stream, leaving their eight cannon. (Lisle said two slings and three serpentines were placed to fire across the river, agreeing with Lee's plan). [...] The Earls of Huntly and Moray also left the field. Hertford's own dispatch describes this as a half hour fight, [...] "right sharply handled on both parts," [...] with Peter Mewtas's [...] hagbuters giving good service.

40|$|<b>Cut</b> Acacia holosericea (<b>Velvet</b> Leaf Wattle) foliage has a short vase life, {{possibly}} because of blockage in xylem vessels. We indirectly investigated a hypothesised role for peroxidase and phenoloxidase enzyme activities in xylem occlusion of Acacia stems by using their inhibitors. We also tested these inhibitors with cut Chamelaucium uncinatum (Geraldton waxflower), another woody stemmed cut flower. The peroxidase inhibitors used were 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (AT), catechol (CH), hydroquinone (HQ), p-phenylene diamine (PD) and copper sulphate (CS, Chamelaucium only). The catechol oxidase inhibitors were tropolone (TP), 4 -hexylresorcinol (HR) and 2, 3 -dihydroxynaphthalene (DN). A laccase inhibitor, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CM), was also used. Other phenoloxidase inhibitors tested were p-chlorophenol (CP), p-nitrocathechol (NC), p-nitrophenol (NP) and sodium metabisulphite (SM). 2 -Mercaptoethanol (ME), phenyl hydrazine (PH) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SH) {{were used as}} inhibitors of both peroxidase and phenoloxidase. Twelve inhibitors (CH, HQ, DN, HR, TP, CM, CP, NC, NP, SM, PH and SH) significantly improved water uptake, maintained relative fresh weight and increased vase life of Acacia {{at least once in}} two experiments. In Chamelaucium, six inhibitors had significant positive effects on water relations (CH, PD, CS, CM, CP and PH) and vase life (AT, CH, PD, CS, ME and PH), while four of them (DN, TP, NC and NP) were phytotoxic at applied concentrations. Only one of the 46 inhibitor treatments inhibited transpiration and increased fresh weight, suggesting that the inhibitors mainly acted by increasing water uptake. Overall, results indicate that oxidative enzyme activities, potentially through phenolic deposition, contribute to xylem occlusion in woody cut stems of Acacia and Chamelaucium...|$|R

As he investigated the subject--and he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took up--he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that Time brought on beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any rate, had escaped that. Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged. No winter marred his face or stained his flower-like bloom. How different it was with material things! Where had they passed to? Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena? Where, the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus, and were figured with [...] "lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature;" [...] and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning [...] "Madame, je suis tout joyeux," [...] the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy, and was decorated with [...] "thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold." [...] Catherine de Médicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in <b>cut</b> black <b>velvet</b> upon cloth of silver. Louis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment. The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions. It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.|$|R

60|$|Even to read of the marvellous {{works of}} {{embroidery}} that were fashioned in bygone ages is pleasant. Time {{has kept a}} few fragments of Greek embroidery of the fourth century B.C. for us. One is figured in M. Lefebure's book--a chain-stitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a mulberry- coloured worsted material, with graceful spirals and palmetto-patterns: and another, a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks, was reproduced in the Woman's World some months ago for an article by Mr. Alan Cole. {334a} Now and then we find in the tomb of some dead Egyptian a piece of delicate work. In the treasury at Ratisbon is preserved a specimen of Byzantine embroidery on which the Emperor Constantine is depicted riding on a white palfrey, and receiving homage from the East and West. Metz has a red silk cope wrought with great eagles, the gift of Charlemagne, and Bayeux the needle-wrought epic of Queen Matilda.

Charles of Orleans had a coat, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning 'Madame, je suis tout joyeux,' the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls. {334b} The room prepared in the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy was decorated with 'thirteen hundred and twenty-one papegauts (parrots) made in broidery and blazoned with the King's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the Queen's arms--the whole worked in fine gold.' Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her 'of black velvet embroidered with pearls and powdered with crescents and suns.' Its curtains were of damask, 'with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls,' and it stood in a room hung with rows of the Queen's devices in <b>cut</b> black <b>velvet</b> on cloth of silver.

40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of <b>velvet</b> (<b>cut</b> and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
