The first pumping station is situated on the river bank, [...] upstream from Morgan. Here a large concrete chamber was constructed, the floor of which is below the river's low water level, and the walls of which rise to above the flood level. The chamber is somewhat elliptical in shape and is divided by a wall across the smaller diameter; one half housing the pumps and the other containing the screening machinery. The concrete walls of the chamber are over a metre thick to give it sufficient weight to prevent it floating during a flood. A control room above the chamber houses the switch board, instruments and a diesel stand-by generator. Water is drawn from the river and passes through rotary screens having a fine wire mesh of 200 openings to the inch (80 per cm). This removes all solid matter except <b>colloidal</b> <b>clay,</b> which when present gives rise to a milky appearance. The water receives no other treatment, and its salinity and hardness are less than that of Mundaring water which is used in the comparable Goldfields pipeline. The centrifugal pumps are driven by 400 h.p. (300 kW) electric motors, the power for which was originally supplied from the Osborne Power Station, and later from Port Augusta. The four intermediate pumping stations, which are all similar, fill a receiving tank elevated to , and are each at a lower elevation than the previous storage tank, so the centrifugal pumps run with a flooded inlet and do not require priming.

40|$|The natural {{environment}} of soil bacteria is highly complex from a nutritional standpoint. The <b>colloidal</b> <b>clay</b> fraction {{is the most}} active constituent of the soil in controlling a balance of the mineral nutrients, since it is {{this portion of the}} soil which adsorbs the various essential ions (Albrecht and McCalla, 1938). The <b>colloidal</b> <b>clay</b> is a hydrated aluminum silicate composed of superimposed layers of aluminum and silicon, bound together through oxygen bridges (Ford, Loomis, and Fidion, 1940). When the sheets of the clay crystal become hydrated, they ex-pand and the clouds of adsorbed ions vibrate around and between these sheets.

Due to the import ance of these processes in the subsurface environment, the transport of <b>clay</b> <b>colloidal</b> particles has been studied in several disciplines, including soil sciences, petr ology, hydrology, etc. Specifically, in environmental engineering, clay colloid re lease and transport in the sediments have been extensively investigated, which are motiv ated by environmental concerns such as colloid-facilitated contaminant transport in groundwater and the subsurface soil. Clay colloid release is resulted from physical alteration of subsurface sediments. Despite the potential importance of clay colloid activiti es, the detailed mechanisms of release and transport of <b>clay</b> <b>colloidal</b> particles with in natural sediments are poorly understood. Pore medium structure, properties and flow dynamics, etc. are factors that affect clay colloid generation, mobilization, and subse quent transport. Possible mechanisms of clay colloid generation in the sediments in clude precipitation, erosion and mobilization by changes in pore water chemistry and clay colloid release depends on a balance of applied hydrodynamic and resisting adhesive torques and forces. The coupled role of pore water chemistry and fluid hydrodynamics thus play key roles in controlling clay colloid release and transport in the sediment s. This paper investigated <b>clay</b> <b>colloidal</b> particle release and transport, especially th e colloidal particle release mechanisms {{as well as the}} process modeling in the sediments.

Two significant results have been found, and each has been submitted for publication. Both studies found non-DLVO behavior in simulant systems. These separate but related studies were performed concurrently. It was previously shown in Rassat et al. 's report Physical and Liquid Chemical Simulant Formulations for Transuranic Wastes in Hanford Single-Shell Tanks that <b>colloidal</b> <b>clays</b> behave similarly to transuranic waste sludge (PNNL- 14333, National Technical Information Service, U. S. Dept. of Commerce). Rassat et al. also discussed the pH and salt content of actual waste materials. It was shown that these materials exist at high pHs, generally above 10, and at high salt content, approximately 1. 5 M from a mixture of different salts. A type of clay commonly studied, due to its uniformity, is a synthetic hectorite, Laponite. Therefore the work performed {{over the course of the}} last year was done mainly using suspensions of Laponite at high pH and involving high salt concentrations. One study was titled ''Relating <b>Clay</b> Rheology to <b>Colloidal</b> Parameters''. It has been submitted to the Journal of Colloid and INterface Science and is currently in the review process. The idea was to gain the ability to use measurable quantities to predict the flow behavior of clay systems, which should be similar to transuranic waste sludge. Leong et al. had previously shown that the yield stress of colloidal slurries of titania and alumina could be predicted, given the measurement of the accessible parameter zeta potential (Leong YK et al. J Chem Soc Faraday Trans, 19 (1993) 2473). <b>Colloidal</b> <b>clays</b> have a fundamentally different morphology and surface charge distribution than the spheroidal, uniformly charged colloids previously studied. This study was therefore performed in order to determine the applicability of the previous findings to the systems of interest. The yield stress of clay slurries was measured using the Physica MCR 300 purchased in year 1 of this project. The zeta potential of these systems was then measured using the Brookhaven Zeta PALS, also purchased in year 1. These two parameters were then plotted and compared with the Leong result. It was found that this system behaved in a non-DLVO manner. Leong found that colloidal slurry yield stress decreases with increased zeta potential which is consistent with the DLVO theory's assertion that particle attractions decrease as their electrostatic repulsion increases. Clay systems, however, show an increase in yield stress as zeta potential is increased. This is due to the nature of the charge distribution on the surface of clay particles.

40|$|Effective {{flocculation}} and dewatering {{of mineral}} processing streams containing <b>colloidal</b> <b>clays</b> {{has become increasingly}} urgent. Release of water from slurries in tailings streams and dam beds for recycle water consumption, is usually slow and incomplete. To achieve fast settling and minimization of retained water, individual particles need to be bound, {{in the initial stages}} of thickening, into large, high-density aggregates, which may sediment more rapidly with lower intra-aggregate water content. Quantitative cryo-SEM image analysis shows that the structure of aggregates formed before flocculant addition has a determinative effect on these outcomes. Without flocculant addition, 3 stages occur in the mechanism of primary dewatering of kaolinite at pH 8 : initially, the dispersed structures already show edge–edge (EE) and edge–face (EF) inter-particle associations but these are open, loose and easily disrupted; in the hindered settling region, aggregates are in adherent, chain-like structures of EE and stairstep face–face (FF) associations; this network structure slowly partially rearranges from EE chains to more compact face–face (FF) contacts densifying the aggregates with increased settling rates. During settling, the sponge-like network structure with EE and FF string-like aggregates, limits dewatering because the steric effects in the resulting partially-gelled aggregate structures are dominant. With flocculant addition, the internal structure and networking of the pre-aggregates is largely preserved but they are rapidly and effectively bound together by the aggregate-bridging action of the flocculant. The effects of initial pH and Ca ion addition on these structures are also analyzed. Statistical analysis from cryo-SEM imaging shows that there is an inverse correlation of intra-aggregate porosity with Darcian inter-aggregate permeability whereas there is a strong positive correlation of Darcian permeability with settling and primary dewatering rate as a function of pH in suspension. Graphs of partial void contributions also suggest that it is not total porosity that dominates permeability in these systems but the abundance of larger intra-aggregate voids...|$|R
40|$|The Soom Shale lagerstatte {{is unusual}} in three respects: it is Ordovician in age, {{a time when there}} is a dearth of other {{conservation}} deposits; it was deposited at a high latitude under glacial influences; and, the mode of preservation of hard and soft tissues is unique. The Soom Shale is a finely-laminated black shale and contains a highly restricted marine biota. Several taxa preserve soft tissues, notably the giant conodont Promissum pulchrum Kovacs which preserves muscle tissues through replacement by clay minerals to the subcellular level, a level of detail which has only previously been reported in phosphatized soft tissues. Replacement of soft tissues by clays occurred either directly, or indirectly through a phosphate precursor. Bottom and pore water conditions were dominantly anoxic-euxinic and without carbonate to buffer the pH, the biominerals aragonite, calcite and apatite were rapidly dissolved. The extremely low pH environment may have also militated against the authigenesis of phosphate indicating that direct replacement of soft tissues by <b>colloidal</b> <b>clays</b> was the most likely taphonomic route. Recalcitrant biomolecules such as chitin and scleratin show either complete replacement or coatings of clay minerals, suggesting the reactivity of the substrate was important in controlling mineralization. Longicone orthocones in the shale are associated with Ungulate brachiopods, ostracodes and cornulitids. Orthocone-epibiont relationships demonstrate that the size distribution of epibionts on the host may determine the timing of epibiont attachment. The orbiculoid epibionts on one orthocone attached whilst the host was alive as did cornulitids, which have grown aligned to a forward head-on orthocone swimming direction.
