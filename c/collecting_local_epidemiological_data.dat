40|$|Background. Gram-negative {{antimicrobial}} resistance (AMR) is of global concern, {{yet there are}} few reports from low- and low-middle-income countries, where antimicrobial choices are often limited. Methods. This study offers a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and World Health Organization (WHO) regional databases of Gram-negative bacteremia in children in low- and low-middle-income countries reporting AMR since 2001. Results. Data included 30 studies comprising 71 326 children, of whom 7056 had positive blood cultures, and Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 4710 (66. 8 %). In neonates, Klebsiella pneumoniaemedian resistance to ampicillin was 94 % and cephalosporins 84 % in Asia; 100 % and 50 % in Africa. Large regional variations in resistance rates to commonly prescribed antibiotics for Salmonella spp. were identified. Multidrug resistance (resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole) was present in 30 % (interquartile range [IQR], 0 – 59. 6) in Asia and 75 % (IQR, 30 – 85. 4) in Africa.

We also present results of a questionnaire on current treatment practice in Europe. The expert panel concluded that β-lactam monotherapy is as efficacious as and less toxic than β-lactam-aminoglycoside combination therapy as empirical therapy. The choice of β-lactam should be based on <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data,</b> antibiotic resistance patterns, recent β-lactam use and available evidence.

30|$|Community-acquired, hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) are {{the most}} common infections in intensive care units (ICU). They are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [1, 2], particularly if the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy is delayed [3 – 6]. The choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy is a challenge since it can only be validated a posteriori when sample cultures and antibiotic susceptibility testing are known [7]. Because of frequent long hospital stays, complex underlying pathologies and previous antimicrobial exposure, pneumonia is often related to multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) [8, 9]. Incidence of ESBL-E is increasing, 15 % of patients admitted in ICU have an ESBL-E digestive colonization in a French study conducted between 2010 and 2011 [10].

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{burden of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae infections is highest in children. Estimates in adult {{population}} are uncommon. We determined {{the burden of}} disease associated with pneumococcus in adults in Colombia in year 2008. MethodologyUsing different data sources (official mortality records, medical databases, published literature and <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data)</b> we estimated prevalence, incidence, mortality and disability due to bacterial pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and bacteremia of any cause for year 2008, and the fraction of these that {{can be attributed to}} S. pneumoniae. ResultsA total of 63, 463 DALYs are lost due to S. pneumoniae in Colombians age 15 or over. Most of this burden (51, 848 DALYs, 81. 7 %) is due to pneumonia, followed by meningitis (9241 DALYs, 14. 6 %). The three conditions, overall, represent 2. 03 DALYs per 1000 Colombians in that age range. ConclusionsDespite the lower incidence of pneumococcal disease in adults, as compared with children, its burden is still significant, comparable to that of schizophrenia or epilepsy.

40|$|Infections {{continue}} to {{play a significant role in}} the overall global mortality and disability more so in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and plague developing countries more intensively. The ICUs are often called “the hubs” of infections owing to highly vulnerable patients’ profile. The most important nosocomial infections in the ICU are catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. The epidemiology of ICU infections in India is different from its Western counterparts in terms of prevalence and nature of microorganisms causing it. While Gram-positive infections are more prevalent in Western ICUs, Indian ICUs are commonly afflicted with Gram-negative bugs showing a high degree of antimicrobial resistance with blurring of traditional boundaries of early drug sensitive and later drug resistance infections. Increasing number of multidrug resistance organism infections in ICUs is a big public health threat and challenge both from the perspective of prevention and treatment.

In this study, we aimed to present the first <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data</b> from Turkey, analyze fusariosis cases that have been monitored in a university hospital during the past 20 years, identify the responsible Fusarium species, and determine antifungal susceptibilities. A total of 47 cases of fusariosis was included in the study. Fusarium isolates were identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antifungal susceptibility was tested by the broth microdilution method according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) methodology. Of the Fusarium infections, 23. 4 % were superficial, 44. 7 % were locally invasive, and 31. 9 % were disseminated. A significant increase was observed over the years. The Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFSC) proved to be the most frequent agent group (17 cases; 51. 5 %), followed by the Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) (14 cases; 42. 4 %), the Fusarium dimerum species complex (FDSC), and the Fusarium oxysporum species complexes (FOSC) (one case each). Amphotericin B had the highest in vitro activity against all species. Voriconazole and posaconazole showed interspecies variability across and within Fusarium species complexes. In conclusion, our data support the fact that regional differences exist in the distribution of the Fusarium species and that species-specific differences are observed in antifungal susceptibility patterns.

Our objectives were to assess the economic implications of a public health program for stroke by: (1) predicting what potential health-gains and cost-offsets could be achieved; and (2) determining the net level of annual investment that would offer value-for-money. Methods: Lifetime costs and outcomes were calculated for additional cases that would benefit if ‘current practice’ was feasibly improved, estimated for one indicative year using: (i) <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data,</b> coverage rates and costs; and (ii) pooled effect sizes from systematic reviews.

This article applies current evidence to our <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data</b> to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different HCC screening programmes for hepatitis B carriers aged 40 to 69. The estimated number of persons needed to screen (NNT) for 30 years is 16 for men and 44 for women and the cost is HK$ 1. 30 million for men and HK$ 3. 56 million for women per life saved by four-monthly ultrasonography and serum alpha foetal protein (α-FP) screening. The cost per life saved is lower for the less intensive screening programmes but some potentially preventable HCC deaths may be missed.

Methods: The susceptibility pattern of 11 antibiotics from 216 positive blood cultures from January 2012 to January 2013 was analyzed based on local policy. The length of hospitalization before bacteremia and the unit (ward or intensive care unit) were the analyzed variables. Bacteremia was classified as early, intermediate or late. The antibiotics were combined according to the combination model presented herein. Results: A total of 55 possible mathematical associations were found combining 2 by 2, 165 associations with 3 by 3 and 330 combinations with 4 by 4. In the intensive care unit, monotherapy never reached 80 % of susceptibility. In the ward, only carbapenems covered more than 90 % of early bacteremia. Only three drugs combined reached a susceptibility rate higher than 90 % anywhere in the hospital. Several regimens using four drugs combined reached 100 % of susceptibility.

40|$|Background: Cause-specific {{mortality}} statistics are primary evidence for health policy formulation, programme evaluation, and epidemiological research. In Turkey, a partially functioning vital registration system {{in urban areas}} yields fragmentary evidence on levels and causes of mortality. This article discusses the application of innovative methods to develop national mortality estimates in Turkey, and their implications for national health development policies. Methods: Child mortality levels from the Demography and Health Survey (DHS) were applied to model life tables to estimate age-specific death rates. Reported causes of death from urban areas were adjusted using re-distribution algorithms from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. Rural cause structure was estimated from <b>epidemiological</b> models. <b>Local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data</b> was used to adjust model-based estimates. Results: Life expectancy at birth in 2000 {{was estimated to be}} 67. 7 years (males) and 71. 9 years (females), about 8 – 10 years lower than in Western Europe. Leading causes of death include major vascular diseases (ischaemic heart disease, stroke) causing 35 – 38 % of deaths, chronic obstructive lung disease and lung cancer in men, but also perinatal causes, lower respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases. Injuries cause about 6 – 8 % of deaths, although this may be an underestimate. Conclusions: Mortality estimates are uncertain in Turkey, given the poor quality of death registration systems.

Several centers have published data regarding the incidence and relative frequency of Candida spp. ObjectiveWe performed a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the available evidence regarding {{the distribution of the}} relative frequency of Candida spp isolated from blood, according to geographic region and study design, during the period 1996 to 2009. MethodsWe searched PubMed and Scopus and retrieved 81 relevant articles reporting data on the relative frequency of Candida spp. ResultsC. albicans was the predominant species in almost all studies. The highest proportion of C. albicans was found in North and Central Europe and the USA. Non-albicans species were more common in South America, Asia, and South Europe. C. glabrata was commonly isolated in the USA and North and Central Europe; C. parapsilosis in South America, South Europe, and several parts of Asia; and C. tropicalis in South America and Asia. The relative frequency of C. krusei was low in all regions.

30|$|The {{appropriateness}} of empirical antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia {{is a critical}} issue in ICU. Current guidelines suggest to use <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data</b> and individual patient’s risk factors to guide probabilistic antimicrobial therapy [11]. This {{may lead to the}} overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, particularly carbapenems. In the present study, we hypothesized that a systematic detection of ESBL-E digestive colonization may help to limit the use of carbapenems despite the high incidence of MDR pathogens risk factors in ICU. It is presumed that bacterial flora changes during ICU stay with colonization of the upper airway by digestive flora [24]. The performance of rectal swab to predict EBSL-E presence or absence in respiratory samples was then investigated in early (≤ 5  days) and late (> 5  days) period after ICU admission. Moreover, this approach could be pragmatic taking into account the evolution of inflammatory patterns along time with an initial intense inflammatory response that may result in organ dysfunction and early death, followed by a later phase characterized by a post-aggressive immunosuppression [25]. Medical and surgical ICU patients were investigated, insuring good external validity. The main results were: (1) Medical and surgical patients had similar prevalence of EBSL-E in rectal swab and in respiratory samples, despite very different clinical characteristics; (2) the early and late groups showed very different prevalence of EBSL-E in rectal swabs and respiratory samples; (3) when rectal swabs were negative, the risk of having ESBL-E in respiratory samples was very low for both early and late groups.|$|R
40|$|Objective/Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{detection}} of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species derived from sputum specimens of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) suspects. Increasing prevalence and incidence of pulmonary infection by NTM species have widely been reported in several countries with geographical variation. Materials and Methods: Between January 2014 and September 2015, sputum specimens from chronic pulmonary TB suspect patients were analyzed. Laboratory examination of mycobacteria was conducted in the TB laboratory, Department of Clinical Microbiology, Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya. Detection and identification of mycobacteria were performed by the standard culture method using the BACTEC MGIT 960 system (BD) and Lowenstein–Jensen medium. Identification of positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) was based on positive acid-fast bacilli microscopic smear, positive niacin accumulation, and positive TB Ag MPT 64 test results (SD Bioline). If the growth of positive cultures and acid-fast bacilli microscopic smear was positive, but niacin accumulation and TB Ag MPT 64 (SD Bioline) results were negative, then the isolates were categorized as NTM species. MTBC isolates were also tested for their sensitivity toward first-line anti-TB drugs, using isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and streptomycin. Results: From 2440 sputum specimens of pulmonary TB suspect patients, 459 isolates (18. 81 %) were detected as MTBC and 141 (5. 78 %) as NTM species. Conclusion: From the analyzed sputum specimens, 18. 81 % were detected as MTBC and 5. 78 % as NTM species.

The fact that the efficacy of these interventions is not restricted to certain types of infection should not detract from the importance of a full understanding of the microbial epidemiology of sepsis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy remains the mainstay of sepsis treatment [5]. Furthermore, among a number of promising novel therapies that are in phase II and III clinical trials, several have pathogen-specific modes of action.

40|$|Background: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the second}} highest cause of {{mortality}} in Hong Kong. The most significant manifestation is acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both treatment and cardiac rehabilitation for AMI are costly. Knowledge {{of the cost of}} management of AMI is important for better planning for allocation of medical resources. The present study aims to evaluate and describe the cost of management of patients with explicit Q-wave AMI in a local public hospital in Hong Kong. Methods: A retrospective study was performed of patients admitted to the United Christian Hospital in Hong Kong. The study cohort consisted of patients who were aged >= 18 years with _a _diagnosis _of _Q-wave _AMI _from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000 admitted to the coronary care unit. Cost items studied included hospital stay, outpatient clinic visits, diagnostic tests, medications, and percutaneous coronary interventions. Results: Ninety-five cases were evaluated. The average annual medical cost per patient for AMI management in the year 2000 was $US 9323. 4 +- 5792 ($US 1 = HK$ 7. 8). The total annual cost per patient increased with the complexity of the disease from $US 7745 +- 6245 for non-fatal AMI without procedure to $US 12 _ 344 +- 3129 for non-fatal AMI with procedure. Based on the <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data,</b> the prevalence rate of CAD is 2. 2 % and assuming 3 % of patients with CAD may experience AMI with medical care, the estimated total cost of AMI management in Hong Kong was $US 45 million per year or 0. 5 % of the 2000 - 2001 total healthcare expenditure. Conclusion: This study provides information on the cost of AMI management in a local hospital of Hong Kong. Public awareness of CAD and the implementation of appropriate health measures should be reinforced. Cost-analysis, Myocardial-infarction...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the rates of}} antimicrobial resistance of Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from patients from 1990 to 2009 and identified risk factors associated with resistance. Gastric biopsy specimens were collected from several digestive disease centers in Brussels, Belgium. We routinely performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clarithromycin (CLR), metronidazole, amoxicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin. Evaluable susceptibility testing was obtained for 9, 430 strains isolated from patients who were not previously treated for Helicobacter pylori infection (1, 527 isolates from children and 7, 903 from adults) and 1, 371 strains from patients who were previously treated (162 isolates from children and 1, 209 from adults). No resistance to amoxicillin was observed, and tetracycline resistance was very rare (< 0. 01 %). Primary metronidazole resistance remained stable over the years, with significantly lower rates for isolates from children (23. 4 %) than for isolates from adults (30. 6 %). Ciprofloxacin resistance remained rare in children, while it increased significantly {{over the last years}} in adults. Primary clarithromycin resistance increased significantly, reaching peaks in 2000 for children (16. 9 %) and in 2003 for adults (23. 7 %). A subsequent decrease of resistance rates down to 10 % in both groups corresponded to a parallel decrease in macrolide consumption during the same period. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that female gender, age of the patient of 40 to 64 years, ethnic background, the number of previously unsuccessful eradication attempts, and the different time periods studied were independent risk factors of resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin. Our study highlights the need to update <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data.</b> Thus, the empirical CLR-based triple therapy proposed by the Maastricht III consensus report remains currently applicable to our population.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} patients who were more likely to experience septicemia after endoscopic biliary drainage. In an attempt to determine the relative importance of each risk factor and their possible interdependancy to more precisely identify high-risk patients and to deduce some guidelines for prevention, a discriminant regression analysis of risk factors for septicemia was used. Clinical, biological, and radiological data of 34 consecutive patients who experienced septicemia within 3 days after endoscopic biliary stenting were reviewed retrospectively and compared with data of a group of 71 patients without any septic complication. If only data available before the procedure were used in the discriminant analysis, prior cholangitis and leucocytosis appeared as significant risk factors, but the linear combination of these data could not predict septicemia in 50 % of cases. When information concerning the quality of drainage after the procedure was introduced into the analysis, 91 % of the septicemic patients were identified, and other expected risk factors such as the nature of the stricture, the type of drainage, or prior cholangitis and leukocytosis had no or marginal predictive values. Patients referred from centers where duodenoscopes might have been poorly disinfected appeared to be at higher risk for Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia. These results emphasize the crucial role of the quality of drainage as a risk for septicemia. Regarding the prevention of infection, it is concluded from this study that (a) pure diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography should be avoided in obstructed patients if drainage cannot be performed during the same procedure; (b) drainage should be as complete as possible; (c) antibiotics should be administered before ERCP to every patient with suspected obstructive jaundice and should cover P. aeruginosa if <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data</b> suggest that there is a problem with disinfection of the endoscopes; and (d) the quality of drainage should guide the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial {{demonstrated}} {{the efficacy of}} empagliflozin {{in the treatment of}} type 2 diabetes (T 2 D) with a previous history of cardiovascular (CV) disease. The drug is currently reimbursed for T 2 D Italian patients, but the reduction of CV mortality and morbidity shown in the trial opens a new treatment perspective in those patients with associated high CV risk. OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness analysis of empagliflozin for the treatment of T 2 D patients with a previous history of CV disease, from the Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: The analysis was performed with an individual simulation model, which can predict the time to CV events or death through a set of time-dependent regressions estimated on the patient-level data of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. This design allows the direct simulation of long-term outcomes and costs without the need for surrogate endpoints. The model was adapted to the Italian setting, considering <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data,</b> baseline quality of life (QoL) utility, background mortality and unit costs from current prices and tariffs. The cost perspective was that of the Italian NHS and the horizon of the simulation was lifetime. Costs and benefits were discounted at a 3. 5 % rate. RESULTS: Base case results were estimated on a cohort of 5, 000 patients, which ensured the convergence of the simulation. Patients treated with empagliflozin in add-on to the standard of care (SoC) lived on the average 13. 8 undiscounted years as compared to 11. 8 years of patients on SoC alone. The gain in discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 1. 0, due to improved survival and QoL linked to the reduced incidence of CV events and CV mortality. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 4, 811 €/QALY, well below the commonly applied threshold of 30, 000 - 50, 000 €/QALY. CONCLUSION: Empagliflozin in add-on to the SoC is a highly cost-effective strategy for the treatment of T 2 D patients with known CV disease in the Italian setting...|$|R
40|$|Fifty years ago, the {{introduction}} of penicillin, followed by many other antibacterial agents, represented an often underestimated medical revolution. Indeed, until that time, bacterial infections were the prime cause of mortality, especially in children and elderly patients. The discovery of numerous new substances and their development on an industrial scale confronted us with the illusion that bacterial infections were all but vanquished. However, the widespread and sometimes uncontrolled usage of these agents {{has led to the}} selection of bacteria resistant to practically all available antibiotics. Bacteria utilize three main resistance strategies: (i) decrease in drug accumulation, (ii) modification of target, and (iii) modification of the antibiotic. Bacteria can decrease drug accumulation either by becoming impermeable to antibiotics, or by actively excreting the drug accumulated in the cell. As an alternative, they can modify the structure of the antibiotic's molecular target [...] usually an essential metabolic enzyme of the bacteria [...] and thus escape the drug's toxic effect. Lastly, they can produce enzymes capable of modifying and directly inactivating the antibiotics. In addition, bacteria have evolved extremely efficient genetic transfer systems capable of exchanging and accumulating resistance genes. Some pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci are now resistant to almost all available antibiotics. Vancomycin is the only non-experimental drug left to treat severe infections due to such organisms. However, vancomycin resistance has already appeared several years ago in enterococci, and was also recently described in staphylococci, in Japan, France and the United-States. Antibiotics are precious drugs which must be administered to patients who need them. On the other hand, the development of resistance must be kept under control by a better comprehension of its mechanisms and modes of transmission and by abiding by the fundamental rules of anti-infectious chemotherapy, i. e. : (i) choose the most efficient antibiotic according to clinical and <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data,</b> (ii) target the bacteria according to the microbiological data at hand, and (iii) administer the antibiotic at an adequate dose which will leave the pathogen no chance to develop any resistance...|$|R
40|$|Background Historically, policy {{initiatives}} have made variable contributions to improvements in public health. Today {{there is a}} growing interest in translating evidence from health research into healthy public policy. Although research evidence may be a component of policy development, it is rarely enough, because policy makers are subject {{to a wide range of}} influences. Furthermore, researchers and policy makers usually work within different time frames and rules of evidence. There is a growing, albeit limited, literature on how researchers can most effectively engage with policy makers. Evidence suggests that more active and effective dialogue between researchers and policy makers is needed, in the formulation of research questions, presentation of evidence, and drafting and choice of policy options. Aim To develop, implement, and evaluate an interactive approach to informing policy for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Setting This work is being undertaken in four eastern Mediterranean territories, known to have high burdens of CVD and diabetes: Palestine, Tunisia, Turkey and Syria. Methods and results Available <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data</b> are being identified, appraised and used to populate the IMPACT CHD Policy Model in order to examine CHD trends. Two corresponding epidemiological models have been developed to examine trends in type 2 diabetes and ischaemic stroke. An intensive review of the literature and consultation assists in the identification of efficacious policy interventions. A situation analysis is being undertaken within each country using mixed methods, which include: key informant and in depth interviews, document reviews, and participant observation. Its aim is to review current policy (stated and implemented), perceived facilitators and barriers to policy change, including health beliefs, and aspects of the health system. Policy makers are explicitly involved as key informants, participants, advisors and “lobbyists”. The epidemiological modelling, evidence based reviews, and situation analyses are together being used to generate diverse policy options. The cost-effectiveness of each chosen option will then be assessed. Conclusions We have developed a provisional framework for developing policy options, initially for the prevention of CVD and diabetes. This is based on <b>local</b> <b>epidemiological</b> <b>data,</b> an assessment of the socio-political-cultural context and cost effectiveness. Policy makers are involved throughout, and will be presented with costed policy options along with their potential consequences. Implemented options will then be evaluated. The framework represents a “policy effectiveness-feasibility loop”, analogous to Tugwell's clinical effectiveness loop. The impact of this approach, and its potential generalisability, will be rigorously evaluated. </p...|$|R
