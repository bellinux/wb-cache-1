He thought that the death penalty might deter at least one prospective rapist. It might encourage victims to report the crime. It might increase the general feeling of security among members of the community. The fact that the magnitude of the harm caused by the murderer is greater than that caused by the rapist was beside the point. The Eighth Amendment was not the Code of Hammurabi; if [...] "innocent life and limb are to be preserved I see no <b>constitutional</b> <b>barrier</b> in punishing by death all who engage in... criminal activity which consistently poses serious danger of death or serious bodily harm."

40|$|Proposals {{to allow}} the {{purchase}} of insurance across state lines (PASL) have gained some support in recent years. Health insurers have traditionally been allowed to sell a policy only within the state that approved and regulates that particular policy. PASL would allow insurers to sell a policy approved in one state to people residing in any state. Any federal legislation to enact PASL in an individual insurance market would have to address two main legal considerations: 1) the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which allows the states to retain their regulatory authority over insurance, and 2) a constitutional prohibition against the commandeering of state officials by the federal government. This paper outlines these obstacles and potential solutions, and concludes {{that as long as}} the legislation is thoughtfully drafted, there is no significant legal or <b>Constitutional</b> <b>barrier</b> to enacting PASL. Additionally, the concepts discussed here may be relevant to any federal health reform legislation involving regulation of health insurance or the use of state officials...|$|E
40|$|Congress {{continues}} {{to debate the}} efficacy and constitutionality of federal regulation of firearms and ammunition. It is a contentious debate, with strong advocates for and against the further federal regulation of firearms.

40|$|Volumes {{have been}} written — both by courts and {{commentators}} — about the so-called independent agencies. These agencies are thought of as distinct from executive branch agencies and constitutionally insulated from presidential influence. Yet few have {{taken the time to}} ask even the most basic question: What features make an agency “independent” as opposed to “executive?” This Article is the first to systematically survey the administrative agencies for a broad set of indicia of independence — removal protection, multi-member structure, partisan balance requirements, budget and congressional communication authority, litigation authority, and adjudication authority — to answer that question. It also examines the functional differences between independent and executive agencies. As it turns out, there is no single feature, structural or functional, that every agency commonly thought of as independent shares, not even the for-cause removal provision commonly associated with independence. We therefore reject the binary distinction between independent and executive agencies. Instead all agencies should be regarded as executive and seen as falling on a spectrum from more independent to less independent. From this new understanding of administrative agencies flows a new and simpler theory of presidential control of agencies: A President can take an action with respect to an agency (assuming it is within his Article II powers) unless Congress has prohibited that action by statute. There is no tenable argument to justify any additional <b>constitutional</b> <b>barrier</b> to presidential interaction with agencies, and the dicta in Humphrey’s Executor suggesting otherwise is incorrect and should be abandoned. Most importantly, we believe there is no statutory or <b>constitutional</b> <b>barrier</b> to the extension of the regulatory review executive orders to all administrative agencies. These executive orders have long exempted “independent agencies. 2 ̆ 2 As a result those agencies perform shoddy cost-benefit analysis when promulgating regulations, when they do so at all. The Dodd-Frank reform bill requires financial agencies, almost all of which are considered independent, to promulgate over 300 regulations. This upcoming flood of regulations underscores what has been obvious for decades that independent agencies impose massive regulatory costs, just like executive agencies. This Article aims to make it clear there is no legal barrier to the extension of the regulatory review executive orders in the hopes of emboldening a future President to overcome the political barriers to doing so...|$|E

Deeply frustrated with the republic's chaotic [...] "sejmocracy" [...] parliamentary structure, Piłsudski led rebellious Polish Army units to overthrow the government in the May Coup of 1926, effectively ending the Second Republic's brief experiment with parliamentary democracy, as well as the prime minister's free and popular elected mandate for the next sixty years.|$|R

40|$|Vernonia Sc/i. 131 st. 47 J v. Acton that middle-school and high-school athletes can be {{required}} to submit to suspicionless drug tests {{as a condition of}} athletic participation (Greenhouse 1995). Although the decision removeda major constitutional roadblockto the adoption of such programs by public schools nationwide, the response was initially tepid: as of January 1996, six months after the ruling, only 1 percent of the country’s 16, 000 public high schools had implemented random drug-testing programs. For many schools, the financial barrier of drug testing ($ 20 to $ 30 per standard drug screen; $ 100 per steroid test) proved far harder to surmount than the <b>constitutional</b> <b>barrier</b> (Dohr-mann 1996). In the past year, however, the number of schools engaged in drug testing has continued a slow but steady rise. For instance, the high school in Kokomo, Indiana, began subjecting all students who partici-pate in extracurricular activities to random drug testing in April 1996 (Glass 1997 : 20), and the city of Oceanside, California, began a drug-testing program for its high-school athletes early in 1997 (Penner 1997). Future improvements in testing technologies that lower costs and increase reliabilitypromise to accelerate the spread of such testing (Renter 1988 : 556). Not surprisingly, suspicionless drug testing has come under attack from a number of quarters. Civil libertarians (e. g., Shufler 1996) and newspaper editorialists (e. g., Berkow 1995, Goodwin 1995, Bradley 1995) have assailed the Supreme Court decision and condemned random drug testing of student athletes as an unjustified invasion o...|$|E
40|$|First Amendment law has {{generally}} been leery of government attempts to change the marketplace of emotions—except when it has not been. Scientific evidence indicates that emotion and rationality are not opposed, as the law often presumes, but rather inextricably linked. There is no judgment, whether moral or otherwise, without emotions to guide our choices. Judicial failure to grapple with this reality has produced some puzzles in the law. Part I of this Symposium contribution examines the intersection of private law, the First Amendment, and attempts to manipulate and control emotions. Only false factual statements can defame, not mere derogatory opinions. Yet trademark law allows {{exactly the kind of}} control over nonfactual, emotional appeals that modern defamation law precludes. These two bodies of law thus stand in contrast, one constrained by the First Amendment to cover only facts and the other allowed to reach much further into the dark heart of emotional manipulation. Part II turns to compelled speech, and again finds two contrasting regulations united by their emotional mechanisms, but divided by their constitutional fates. Courts have struck down mandatory smoking warnings in visual form, but have approved mandatory abortion disclosures and ultrasound requirements that operate in the same emotional register. Regardless of whether the regulation involves a direct government mandate or private parties claiming competing rights to influence the audience’s emotional state, then, current First Amendment law doesn’t have a consistent account of the proper role of emotion in speech regulation. Part III suggests that the contradictions of current doctrine could be ameliorated by less distrust of emotion and more acceptance that where information is being conveyed, emotion will regularly follow. Our focus then should not be on whether deployment of emotion is “manipulative,” but whether {{it is part of a}} discriminatory or factually misleading regulation. When the government can otherwise constitutionally mandate disclosure, the fact that these disclosures have emotional resonance is not an independent <b>constitutional</b> <b>barrier...</b>|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis Methodology and Sources [...] - There is an {{overarching}} agreement in Romanian politics, that a territorial autonomy arrangement {{would violate the}} constitution of the country, and is therefore not feasible. This theoretical concept arises from the misinterpretation of the connection between state and autonomy, and as such can be falsified by the experiences of the functioning autonomies, as well as by international law and the corresponding scientific literature. Consequently, my main hypothesis was that the territorial autonomy of Szeklerland does not contradict the constitutional order of Romania. I analysed this hypothesis through legal doctrinal analysis, and comparative legal analysis based on the relevant legal material: The Constitution and laws of Romania; The two Opinions of the Legislative Council of the Parliament of Romania on the rejection of the Draft Law on the Autonomous Status of Szeklerland; Decision Nr. 80 / 2014 of the Constitutional Court rejecting the constitutional amendments proposed by the Special Committee of the Parliament; relevant decrees of the Prefect’s of Romania; the Statutes of European autonomies, as well as the constitutions and laws of their host countries; international legal material ratified by Romania. The issue of the constitutionality of territorial autonomy within Romania emerges every now and then, depending on the political discourse in the country, but extensive scientific scrutiny has so far avoided the topic. In this respect, the novelty of my theoretical approach was twofold: 1.) The constitutional aspects of a Szekler autonomy arrangement in themselves were largely neglected within academia, leaving behind a gap that is very much ripe for scientific review. 2.) Additionally, even if the topic was discussed, it was mostly done {{within the framework of the}} “nation-state discourse”, and all the natural conceptual restraints thereof. My dissertation surpassed these constraints, along with some of the most widespread, albeit false presuppositions and misconceptions surrounding the issue at hand. Ultimately, I invited the reader to engage in a mind-game, in order to deconstruct the “constitutional myth” regarding autonomy. [...] - Novelty conclusions of the dissertation [...] - •	Conclusions of the conducted legal doctrinal analysis, and comparative legal analysis proved that the assumption that autonomy would contradict the constitutional order, and violate the unitary, indivisible, and national character of the Romanian state, arises from the misinterpretation of the connection between state and autonomy. •	Chapters 1, and 152 of the Constitution of Romania (stipulating and protecting the above characteristics), are thus of no legal relevance, and cannot be understood as an effective constitutional legal barrier. •	Territorial autonomy as an institutional solution does not contradict the constitutional order of Romania. There are no provisions in the Romanian legal system whatsoever, which would constitute a legal obstacle to the creation of an autonomous region. •	There are only political obstacles, which tend to be wrapped and presented as legal ones, due to historical resentments towards Hungarians, and the centuries long Romanian endeavour to establish an ethnically homogenous nation state. •	While on the one hand we see no <b>constitutional</b> <b>barrier</b> to autonomy, on the other hand: the notion of autonomy is not at all alien to the constitution, as it makes references to several forms of it (personal, functional, and administrative). Furthermore, if one reads the constitution without an ethnocentric mind-set, and in junction with international treaties on minority protection ratified by Romanian, one could easily adopt a more pluralistic interpretation of the constitution, open to accommodate minority claims on ethnic-power sharing...|$|E
40|$|Public {{school funding}} in Florida differs {{from other states}} {{in a number of}} {{important}} ways. First, Florida has a highly equalized resource-distribution formula resulting in a high degree of interdistrict equity. Second, concerns for quality, while constant, have had to compete with the state's phenomenal growth. Third, the state exercises a much greater degree of control over the level of total funding (state and local) than many other states, which means that public school financing is highly vulnerable to shifts in the financing of other state programs. This paper describes the current condition of education funding for public schools in Florida, reviews the pressures facing educational finance in the state, and analyzes the fiscal, political, and judicial issues they raise. The state funding formula does not address educational need or adequacy.

40|$|Sovereigns, like individuals, must {{sometimes}} make commitments that limit their own {{freedom of action}} {{in order to accomplish}} their goals. Social scientists have observed that constitutional arrangements can, by restricting a sovereign’s power, enable the sovereign to make such commitments. This essay advances several claims about the commitment problems that sovereigns face. First, constitutions do not necessarily solve such problems but can instead aggravate them, by entrenching inalienable governmental powers and immunities. Second, sovereigns and other actors face two distinct varieties of commitment problems – undercommitment and overcommitment – between which they must steer: an actor that can bind itself has surmounted the problem of undercommitment but must then face the risk of hobbling itself to an unforeseen or undesirable extent, or overcommitting itself. Third, courts are well positioned to navigate a course between these matching perils and to optimize the extent of the sovereign’s commitments, {{even in the face of}} <b>constitutional</b> <b>barriers</b> to commitment by the sovereign.
