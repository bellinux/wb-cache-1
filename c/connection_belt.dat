30|$|The Tibetan-Yi Corridor is a transitional, linking {{channel for}} ethnic flows, and {{it acts as}} a border for the contact and exchanges between the Han and Tibetans and between the Yi and Tibetans. If {{something}} is called “corridor,” it means {{that it is a}} place of transition and linking. As a corridor for ethnic migrations, the Tibetan-Yi Corridor clearly possesses these qualities, which is why Fei Xiaotong called it “the border area for the contact between Han and Tibetans and between Yi and Tibetans”. The transition and <b>connection</b> <b>belt</b> between Tibetans and Han goes from east to west in the Tibetan-Yi Corridor, which is the channel for the contacts, exchanges and interactions between Han and Tibetans, as well as the region of mutual cultural influence and blending between these two groups. It was precisely because of this that some scholars have used the name “Han-Tibetan Corridor,” adopting the angle of the relations between the Han and Tibetans. Looking from north to south, we see the structure of “Tibetans in the north” and “Yi in the south,” which is the border of contact between the Yi and Tibetans: thus another feature of the corridor is the contacts and interactions between Yi and Tibetans (the term Yi is used in its wider meaning here, mainly indicating the Yi subgroup living {{in the southern part of}} the corridor). It is necessary to point out that, as the “border of contact between Han and Tibetans and between Yi and Tibetans,” the Tibetan-Yi Corridor was shaped through a long-term, gradual historical process, and was the result of the interaction of multiple factors. For example, when it comes to the borders between the Yi and the Tibetans, even though the eastward expansion of the Tubo, the southward expedition of the Mongols, the expansion of the Mu chieftains and the northward migration of the Yi were all important factors leading to the formation of the “Tibetans to the north, Yi to the south” pattern, as well as the borders between Tibetans and Yi, the formation of the borders between Tibetans and Yi depended on clear ecological factors. It is not difficult to see that because the Tibetan people were mostly adapted to the ecological environment at high altitudes, this caused the border between Tibetans and Yi in the corridor to often be located at the intersection between the Tibetan-Yi plateau and the Yunnan-Guizhou plateau, therefore the border between the Tibetans and Yi was a cultural border as well as an ecological border. The border between Han and Tibetans was also characterized by similar circumstances, although the Han-Tibetan border was formed through many years of contacts and interactions between the two ethnic groups, the Han people living in the corridor were mainly concentrated in towns, along traffic routes, and in low altitude river valleys, and formed intertwined and adjacent relations with the local Tibetans who lived at high altitude pastures. Therefore, the ethnic “borders” in the corridor were often multi-dimensional and closely related to the ecological environment. Furthermore, it is necessary to note that the ethnic “borders” in the Tibetan-Yi Corridor were in fact not just a linear or geographic “border”; for the ethnic groups living in “border” areas, the most important features were the “connection links” that enabled the interactions and mutual cultural acceptance and tolerance between different ethnicities, as well as becoming reciprocally closer psychologically and emotionally. For instance, the Nakhi creation epic Chong ban chongze contains the legend that the ancestors of the Nakhi and the Tibetans were brothers, and the ancestor of the Tibetans was the older brother, while the ancestor of the Nakhi was the second-born. (Lijiang Working Group, Creation Myth, 1960) Another Nakhi epic, the Creation Myth also says that the ancestors of the Tibetans, Nakhi and Bai people were brothers: “The three brothers spoke three different languages, and were the ancestors of three ethnic groups. The eldest one was Tibetan, and he lived on the top; […] the youngest one was Bai, and he lived below; […] the second son was Nakhi, and he lived in the middle” (Xijiang Long 1991). In the Tibetan-Yi Corridor there were also legends of the Yi and Tibetans descending from the same ancestor (Guoyu Fang 1984, Li Shaoming, Chen Xianmin, 1991). This kind of legends reflects the “ethnic views” of the local people, as well as their unique understanding of ethnic “borders.” Furthermore, from the Song dynasty large quantities of Han-grown tea started to be transported to the Tibetan region through the Tibetan-Yi Corridor, becoming an important economic link between the Han and the Tibetans. The heroic epic of the local Tibetan people, the Epic of King Gesar contains the following explanation of the exchanges between Han and Tibetans by King Gesar himself: “Are the goods produced by the Han and transported to Bo (the Tibetan area) things that we cannot produce here? Not at all, but it is necessary to connect the two people ”(Quoted from: Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Science, Report on the Feasibility of the Tourism Development of the Old Tea-Horse Road in Qamdo County, Tibet) 2001). This represents the unique understanding of the Tibetan people living in the Tibetan-Yi Corridor toward “borders.” Generally speaking, “border” has two main functions: one is to “divide,” and the other is to “link.” Since the borders between the Han and Tibetans, and Yi and Tibetans in the Tibetan-Yi Corridor were gradually formed through a long historical process of ethnic contacts and interactions, the ethnic groups living along these “borders” have been living to this day in an intertwined fashion, becoming inseparable from each other. Thus, in the eyes of the people living in the corridor, “border” is a way of “connecting” rather than “dividing,” creating friendly relations and mutual identities: this is perhaps an important characteristics of the ethnic “borders” of the Tibetan-Yi Corridor.|$|E

40|$|The best {{indication}} {{of the significance of}} the Kuiper belt lies in its multiple connections to other aspects of the Solar system. The dust in the Zodiacal cloud, the rocks in the meteor streams, the nuclei of comets, the Centaurs, perhaps also the irregular moons of the planets and the Trojans that lead and trail planets in their orbits, are all related to the parent population in the Kuiper belt. Further afield, the dusty debris disks of other stars are likely produced by collisional shattering of parent bodies in unseen Kuiper belts about them. Because of these many <b>connections,</b> Kuiper <b>belt</b> science has already had significant impact on the study of the contents, origin and evolution of the Solar system, and on understanding the Solar system in the context set by other stars. While we know much more than we used to, we still don’t know many things about the Kuiper belt. The Solar system formed from a flattened, rotating disk of gas and dust, itself produced by gravitational collapse from the interstellar medium. The explosion of a nearby massive star, a “supernova”, may have provided the initial compression causing the cloud to collapse, as suggested by the products of decay of short-lived radioactive elements (esp. 26 Al) embedded in meteorites (Lee et al. 1977, Dauphas and Chaussidon 2011). Planets formed quickly in the dens...|$|R
50|$|Family {{dynamics}} {{also play}} a vital role in the novel. Unlike other 1930s Leftist novels, Daughter of Earth depicted family as a negative entity which would ruin an individual's chances for a happy life. The role of the daughter is pertinent to the novel. Daughter symbolizes legacy, not just of the family, but also, in the case of Daughter of Earth, of the nation and the world. Yerkes notes that Smedley’s Freudian psychoanalysis made her all too aware of philosophy. Smedley consciously uses her psychoanalysis when addressing her issues with gender in Daughter of Earth. As a child, Marie has an extreme hatred for her mother and feels her father can do no wrong. Barbara Foley makes a similar Freudian argument when she acknowledges Marie’s <b>connection</b> between the <b>belt</b> buckle of Juan Diaz and the colorful belt her father wore.|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of a curved side-wall of a {{pressurised}} tyre is presented. The model uses a previously derived wave equation. The side-wall is assumed to have a uniform thickness over the whole distance between the belt and the hub. A vertical or a horizontal displacement is input at the <b>connection</b> with the <b>belt</b> and the forces input and those transmitted to the hub are calculated and {{described in terms of}} dynamic stiffness. The effect of various parameters such as pressure, geometry, belt wavelength and material properties are investigated. The side-wall model is applied to a belt model to give a full tyre model. An integral around the belt circumference is performed to give the forces transmitted to the hub. The effect of the air within the cavity is calculated from the uncoupled carcass vibration. Finally, some experiments were made on a tyre and the model was fitted, thereby giving an estimate of the tyre material properties and validating the model for both belt vibration prediction and force transmission to the hub...|$|R

Parking lots were randomized to treatment condition. A community traffic intersection served as a comparison group. Trained observers re-corded safety belt use rates (SBURs) of subjects (front seat occupants) over a two-week period at baseline and after a four-week period of intervention. Results were analyzed by chi-square comparisons of pre-treatment and post-treatment SBURs. At baseline, significant differences in SBURs between treatment groups were observed. Significant pre-to-post differences were found for TC 3 and TC 4 : the SBUR in TC 3 went from 18. 3 %- 38. 4 % (p < 0. 001) and the SBUR in TC 4 went from 16. 9 %- 44. 8 % (p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{auditory}} cortex of macaque monkeys {{contains a}} core of primary-like areas surrounded by a narrow belt of associated fields that encompass much of the superior temporal plane in these animals. Adjacent to the lateral belt on the superior temporal gyrus is a parabelt region that contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). In a previous study (Hackett et al. [1998] J. Comp. Neurol. 394 : 475 – 495), we determined that the parabelt has topographic <b>connections</b> with the <b>belt</b> areas surrounding the core, but minimal connections with the core itself. In this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. Injections confined to the parabelt labeled large numbers of neurons in the dorsal (MGd) and magnocellular (MGm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), suprageniculate (Sg), limitans (Lim), and medial pulvinar (PM) nuclei. Only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (MGv) division of the MGC, consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. The rostrocaudal topography o...|$|R
40|$|Both {{past and}} recent {{research}} {{results indicate that}} solar wind speed has a close <b>connection</b> to radiation <b>belt</b> electron fluxes [e. g., Paulikas and Blake, 1979; Reeves et aI., 2011]: a higher solar wind speed {{is often associated with}} a higher level of radiation electron fluxes. But the relationship can be very complex [Reeves et aI., 2011]. The study presented here provides further corroboration of this viewpoint by emphasizing the importance of a global perspective and time history. We find that all the events during years 2010 and 2011 where the > 0. 8 MeV integral electron flux exceeds 10 (exp 5) particles/sq cm/sr/s (pfu) at GEO orbit are associated with the high speed streams (HSS) following the onset of the Stream Interaction Region (SIR), with most of them belonging to the long-lasting Corotating Interaction Region (CIR). Our preliminary results indicate that during HSS events, a maximum speed of 700 km/s and above is a sufficient but not necessary condition for the > 0. 8 MeV electron flux to reach 10 (exp 5) pfu. But in the exception cases of HSS events where the electron flux level exceeds the 10 (exp 5) pfu value but the maximum solar wind speed is less than 700 km/s, a prior impact can be noted either from a CME or a transient SIR within 3 - 4 days before the arrival of the HSS - stressing the importance of time history. Through superposed epoch analysis and studies providing comparisons with the CME events and the HSS events where the flux level fails to reach the 10 (exp 5) pfu, we will present the quantitative assessment of behaviors and relationships of various quantities, such as {{the time it takes to}} reach the flux threshold value from the stream interface and its dependence on different physical parameters (e. g., duration of the HSS event, its maximum or average of the solar wind speed, IMF Bz, Kp). The ultimate goal is to apply what is derived to space weather forecasting...|$|R
