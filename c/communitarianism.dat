5|$|An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 {{textbook}} by the British political theorist Alasdair Cochrane. It is {{the first}} book in the publisher Palgrave Macmillan's Animal Ethics Series, edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. Cochrane's book examines five schools of political theory—utilitarianism, liberalism, <b>communitarianism,</b> Marxism and feminism—and their respective relationships with questions concerning animal rights and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.|$|E

May, revised and expanded the manuscript {{under the title}} Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons. Deseret Book published the book in 1976. The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book {{was not allowed to}} reprint the book and Church News was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but too willing to give Mormonism credit for modern welfare programs.|$|E
5000|$|One major way the communitarian {{position}} {{differs from}} the social conservative one is that although <b>communitarianism's</b> ideal [...] "good society" [...] "reaches into the private realm, it seeks to cultivate only a limited set of core virtues through an organically developed set of values rather than having an expansive or holistically normative agenda given by the state. For example, American society favors being religious over being atheist, but is rather neutral with regard to which particular religion a person should follow. There are no state-prescribed dress codes, [...] "correct" [...] number of children to have, or places one is expected to live, etc. In short, a key defining characteristic of the ideal communitarian society is that {{in contrast to a}} liberal state, it creates shared formulations of the good, but the scope of this good is much smaller than that advanced by authoritarian societies." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{tries to}} make the case for a variant of the good life based on a {{synthesis}} of liberalism and ethnicity. Liberal <b>communitarianism's</b> treatment of ethnicity tends to fall under the categories of either liberal culturalism or liberal nationalism. Both, it is argued, fail to come to terms with the reality of ethnic community, preferring instead to define ethnicity in an unrealistic, cosmopolitan manner. By contrast, this essay squarely confronts four practices that are central to ethnic communities: symbolic boundary-maintenance; exclusive and inflexible mythomoteurs; the use of ancestry and race as boundary markers; and the desire among national groups to maintain their ethnic character. This article argues that none of these practices need contravene the tenets of liberalism as long as they are reconstructed so as to minimize entry criteria and decouple national ethnicity from the state. The notion of liberal ethnicity thereby constitutes an important synthesis of liberal and communitarian ends...|$|R
40|$|This thesis assesses whether communitarian {{critique}} {{can still}} inform contemporary liberal political theory. The {{suggestion is that}} although liberalism has correctly rejected calls for a politics of 'community', it has ignored one important aspect of that critique, namely emphasis on the social embeddedness of the individual. Investigation of this hypothesis proceeds in two stages. The first involves reconsideration of the liberal-communitarian debate {{in the light of}} Charles Taylor's distinction between ontological and normative issues. This reveals how the arguments for social embeddedness (or ontological holism) fit in with more traditional appeals to community. Further analysis of the idea of ontological holism emphasises the potentially philosophical or empirical character of holist claims. The second stage of the argument ascertains whether liberal theory should heed <b>communitarianism's</b> recommendation of a more holist approach. Analysis of liberal texts reveals that liberal theorists already do adopt such an approach, however they do so in a piecemeal fashion, and generally without reference to supporting empirical evidence. Given the assumption that liberal theory is not expressly Utopian, some attention to limiting empirical factors would seem to be required. To back up this claim a case-study of liberal tolerance is undertaken, comparing the theoretical and social psychological accounts of inter-group toleration and its development. This comparison reveals that liberal tolerance is too narrow in scope, failing to absorb some of the most virulent forms of inter-group antagonism (such as gender- or race-based antipathy). Further, social psychological study shows that socially intolerant attitudes may be at least as harmful as, political ones, as they undermine the development of self-respect. Overall, important conclusions are reached as to the theoretical changes required of liberalism if it is to adopt a more thoroughly holist approach. Attention to the operation of factors at the localised rather than national level is vital, as is attention to empirical detail. Thus the 'politics of locality' complements traditional focus on the nation-state. </p...|$|R

25|$|Her {{activities}} {{in support of}} the mill workers in Lowell, Massachusetts put her in contact with a broader network of reformers in areas of women’s rights, <b>communitarianism,</b> abolition, peace, prison reform, and health reform. Bagley and her coworkers became familiar with middle-class reform activities, demonstrating the ways in which working people embraced this reform impulse as they transformed and critiqued some of its key elements. Her activities within the labor movement reveal many of the tensions that underlay relations between male and female working people as well as the constraints of gender that female activists had to overcome.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the topic of active {{voluntary}} euthanasia (AVE) has been significantly neglected in existing political studies research, {{despite the fact that}} AVE reform raises fundamental questions about the scope and application of political authority. While this is predominantly a politics thesis in its focus, the thesis also draws when necessary on the broader scholarly literature on AVE, including literature fields such as ethics, as well as on broader public debate and the views of politicians. The thesis also examines, and engages with, the views of relevant traditional and contemporary political theorists including John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and Amitai Etzioni. Whilst it will be acknowledged that liberal and utilitarian principles have helped shape and inform the AVE reform debate, and have useful contributions to offer, it is maintained that neither of these approaches provide a suitably comprehensive guide to policy. The thesis argues that <b>communitarianism’s</b> emphasis upon the communal good provides an indispensable counterbalance to potential problems that can arise with some other approaches, including excessive individualism and the uncertainties of moral subjectivism. More particularly, it is suggested that without an ongoing commitment to the principles of self restraint and ‘other regarding’ beneficence, legalised euthanasia could pose a serious threat to the welfare of vulnerable citizens. This is a point of view that is also expressed by many religious critics of AVE and it is argued that pro-choice advocates have relied unduly upon the separation of Church and State principle to deflect a legitimate criticism. Although it is conceded that a commitment to secular liberal–democratic principles is at odds with a legislative prohibition against the popularly endorsed option of last resort (beneficent) AVE it is, nevertheless, maintained that the concerns of these and other critics should not be ignored. Indeed, an examination of various case studies highlights the importance of ensuring a balance between individual autonomy and adequate legislative safeguards. Case studies examined include John Ashcroft’s controlled substances intervention in Oregon, US Congressional action to preserve the life of persistent vegetative state patient Terri Schiavo and Australian anti-suicide / active euthanasia legislation, particularly the Northern Territory’s Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. The conclusion of the thesis not only pulls together the key arguments regarding AVE but also highlights the insights which the AVE debate can provide for understanding broader issues in political theory and practice, particularly in regard to the rights of the individual and the responsibility of the state to legislate for the collective good.

25|$|Abraham Leib Zissu (first name also Avram, {{middle name}} also Leiba or Leibu; January 25, 1888 – September 6, 1956) was a Romanian writer, {{political}} essayist, industrialist, and spokesman of the Jewish Romanian community. Of lowly social origin and {{a recipient of}} Hasidic education, he became a noted cultural activist, polemicist, and newspaper founder, remembered primarily for his Mântuirea daily. By the end of World War I, he emerged as a theorist of Religious Zionism, preferring <b>communitarianism</b> and self-segregation to the assimilationist option, while also promoting literary modernism in his activity as novelist, dramatist, and cultural sponsor. He was the inspiration behind the Jewish Party, which competed with the mainstream Union of Romanian Jews for the Jewish vote. Zissu and Union leader Wilhelm Filderman had a lifelong disputation over religious and practical politics.|$|E
500|$|Chapter five {{assesses the}} {{relationship}} between animals and <b>communitarianism.</b> Communitarians criticise liberalism's focus on a state which does not interfere with individuals, instead favouring a political order which takes a stand on moral concerns, drawing from the shared moral values of a given society. Cochrane initially argues that <b>communitarianism,</b> using British society as an example, {{can be used to}} expand justice to animals. He devotes the remainder of the chapter to four arguments against this line of thought. First, <b>communitarianism</b> is particularist; that is, the principles it expounds are wholly contingent on the values in the particular society. Second, there are difficulties inherent in finding [...] "authentic" [...] values within a given society. Third, societies often favour some animals over others, leaving unfavoured animals vulnerable. Fourth, {{there is the question of}} whose values within a society matter: states often contain multiple communities with very different attitudes to animals. Consideration of this fourth question involves analysis of multiculturalism.|$|E

500|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} while {{each of the}} schools of thought he has {{considered}} has problems, they all have something important {{to contribute to the}} debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts the centrality of the individual. <b>Communitarianism,</b> though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that [...] "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" [...] are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.|$|E

For most of their history they were trade protectionists, engaging in free-trade economics in only a limited fashion, as in Empire Free-Trade. Historically they comprised the largest bloc of the original Canadian Conservative party. Notable Red Tories include John Farthing, George Grant, John Diefenbaker, E.

2500|$|According to Miller, democracy, to Diệm, {{was rooted}} in his dual {{identity}} as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with <b>communitarianism</b> and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as [...] "a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty", not in the US sense of [...] "political right" [...] or political pluralism and {{in the context of}} an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Diệm was not a reactionary mandarin and lacking in interest in democracy like the way he has been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking about democracy became key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform.

2500|$|In 2002 Williams {{delivered}} the Richard Dimbleby lecture and chose {{to talk about}} the problematic nature of the nation-state but also of its successors. He cited the so-called 'market state' as offering an inadequate vision of the way a state should operate, partly because it was liable to short-term and narrowed concerns (thus rendering it incapable of dealing with, for instance, issues relating to the degradation of the natural environment) and partly because a public arena which had become value-free was liable to disappear amidst the multitude of competing private interests. (He noted the same moral vacuum in British society after this visit to China in 2006.) He is not uncritical of <b>communitarianism,</b> but his reservations about consumerism have been a constant theme. These views have often been expressed in quite strong terms; for example, he once commented that [...] "Every transaction in the developed economies of the West can be interpreted as an act of aggression against the economic losers in the worldwide game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though the French State is secular, {{in recent}} years the {{government}} has tried to organize a representation of the French Muslims.

Nicolas Sarkozy's views on laïcité have been widely criticized by left- and right-wing members of parliament; more specifically, he was accused, during the creation of the CFCM, of favoring the more extreme sectors of Muslim representation in the Council, in particular the UOIF.|$|E
2500|$|This civic {{republican or}} deliberative {{democratic}} {{conception of the}} good provides both procedural and substantive insights for developing a just allocation of health care resources. Procedurally, it suggests the need for public forums to deliberate about which health services should be considered basic and should be socially guaranteed. Substantively, it suggests services that promote {{the continuation of the}} polity-those that ensure healthy future generations, ensure development of practical reasoning skills, and ensure full and active participation by citizens in public deliberations-are to be socially guaranteed as basic. Conversely, services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed. An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia. A less obvious example is guaranteeing neuropsychological services to ensure children with learning disabilities can read and learn to reason. Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} to elucidate what specific health care services are basic; however, the overlap between liberalism and <b>communitarianism</b> points to a way of introducing the good back into medical ethics and devising a principled way of distinguishing basic from discretionary health care services ...|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel {{distinguished}} between basic services {{that should be}} guaranteed to everybody from discretionary medical services that are not guaranteed. The result would be a two tiered system, where those with more money could afford more discretionary services. He saw a failure to define basic services as the reason attempts at universal health care coverage have failed. As a result, the belief that universal health care would require unlimited costs makes any attempt at providing universal health care seem likely to end in national bankruptcy. Instead of universal coverage of basic health care, those who are well insured have coverage for many discretionary forms {{of health care and}} no coverage for [...] some basic forms of health care. Emanuel said that while drawing a line separating basic and universal health care from discretionary health care is difficult, the attempt should be made. Emaniel mentioned the philosophies of Amy Gutmann, Norman Daniels and Daniel Callahan when arguing that there is an overlap between liberalism and <b>communitarianism</b> where civic republicanism and deliberative democracy meet. According to The Atlantic, Emanuel is describing the philosophy of John Rawls in arguing that society is choosing one value (equality) over another (a healthy society), and this substitution may be responsible for limited choices in health care. PolitiFact says that Emanuel was describing the fact that doctors often have to make difficult choices, such as who should get a liver transplant. [...] PolitiFact also said, [...] "Academics often write theoretically about ideas that are being kicked around. And they repeat and explore those ideas, without necessarily endorsing them." ...|$|E
