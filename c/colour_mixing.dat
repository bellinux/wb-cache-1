2500|$|A {{tungsten}} lamp's colour {{is typically}} controlled by inserting {{one or more}} gels (filters) into its optical path. In the simplest case, a single gel is inserted into the optical path to produce light of the same color. For example, a blue gel is used to create blue light. Custom colours are obtained by means of subtractive CMY <b>colour</b> <b>mixing,</b> by inserting combinations of cyan, magenta and yellow filters into the optical path of the lighting fixture. The inserted filters may have varying densities, with correspondingly varied percentages of transmission, that subtractively mix colours. This creates custom colours {{in a manner similar}} to ink jet printers, which mix varied densities of cyan, magenta and yellow inks. Manufacturers will sometimes include an additional green or amber ("CTO" [...] colour correction) filter to extend the range (gamut) of subtractive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> systems, ...|$|E
2500|$|Moving head {{fixtures}} {{are often}} divided into spot, wash lights and beam lights. They vary in use and functions, but many companies offer profile and wash {{versions of the}} same model of light. Profile lights generally contain features like gobos and prisms, whereas wash lights have simpler optics and a wider beam aperture resulting in wider beam angle, which may be altered by internal lenses or “frost effects”. Wash lights {{are more likely to have}} CMY <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> although it is common for high-end spot lights to have such features too.|$|E

He gave me my watch and chain, and spared no expense in buying them; both were of superior workmanship, and very expensive. I have got them still--the watch goes beautifully.|$|E

The fixture features a MSR700 short arc lamp, the same exceptionally fast 11+1 slot colour wheel, as well as a three-wheel CYM <b>colour</b> <b>mixing</b> system to allow for a nearly unlimited range of colours.

50|$|Red is a warm colour, {{lively and}} agitated; it is forceful, a {{movement}} in itself. Mixed with black it becomes brown, a hard <b>colour.</b> <b>Mixed</b> with yellow, it gains in warmth and becomes orange, which imparts an irradiating movement on its surroundings. When red is mixed with blue it moves away from man to become purple, which is a cool red. Red and green form the third great contrast, and orange and purple the fourth.|$|R

Today his works are on display at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Hague Municipal Museum, and the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} and {{position of the}} terms can be demonstrated by a digital convergence prism (Figure 1), which shows the three components (T, I, M) and their pairs and the triple combination (convergent TIM triplet) according {{to the rule of}} additive <b>colour</b> <b>mixing.</b> Assuming that telecommunications (Telecom) is blue, informatics (IT) is green and Media & Content is red, then teleinformatics/telematics is cyan, telemedia/networked media is magenta, media informatics is yellow, and the convergent TIM is white. In such a way, the integrated TIM sector corresponds to the prism as a whole, the ICT sector to the whole minus the red area (Media & Content), and the Infocommunications relates to Telecom and neighbouring three areas (blue, cyan, magenta and white). That means that, for example, media informatics is a part of ICT but not part of Infocommunications.|$|E

50|$|Rose flowers {{have always}} been {{available}} {{in a number of}} colours and shades; they are also available in a number of <b>colour</b> <b>mixes</b> in one flower.

This gives us yellow, orange, pink, red, white and many combinations of these colours. However, they lack the blue pigment that would give a true purple or blue colour and until the 21st century all true blue flowers were created using some form of dye. Now, however, genetic modification is introducing the blue pigment.|$|R
