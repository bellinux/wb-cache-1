5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is in contact with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is in contact with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is in contact with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> area. So in this case increasing the area in contact with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the American {{palaeontologist}} Kenneth Carpenter {{pointed out}} that the dorsal vertebrae {{from the back of the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale show that the back curved downwards just before the neck (which was not preserved), and unless the neck curved upwards, the head would point to the ground. He therefore inferred that the necks of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs were held in a curved posture (as is the norm in dinosaurs), and that they would therefore not have been able to align their head, neck, and body horizontally straight, which would be needed to transmit stress. Their necks would have to be held below the level of the back, which would have risked damaging the spinal cord on impact. Modern bighorn sheep and bison overcome this problem by having strong ligaments from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which absorb the force of impact), but such features are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These animals also absorb the force of impact through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their foreheads and horns form a broad <b>contact</b> <b>surface,</b> unlike the narrow surface of pachycephalosaur domes. Because the dome of Stegoceras was rounded, it would have given a very small area for potential impact, and the domes would have glanced off each other (unless the impact was perfectly centred). Combating pachycephalosaurs would have had difficulty seeing each other while their heads were lowered, due to the bony ridges above the eyes.|$|E

The effects of spring pressure, friction coefficient, rotational speed of rotary ring, width of <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> on deformation and contact pressure are analyzed. Results indicate that deformation of rotary and stationary rings increases {{with the increase}} of spring pressure and friction coefficient, however, decreases {{with the increase of}} rotational speed of rotary ring and width of <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces.</b> <b>Contact</b> pressure increases with the increase of spring pressure, however, decreases with the increase of friction coefficient and width of <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The effects of spring pressure and friction coefficient on contact pressure are not obvious, and the effect of width of <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> on <b>contact</b> pressure is very small when it is more than 3 mm...|$|R

The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger anastomosis and better surgical results.|$|E
25|$|The {{contributions}} of Archard (1957) {{must also be}} mentioned in discussion of pioneering works in this field. Archard concluded that, even for rough elastic surfaces, the contact area is approximately proportional to the normal force. Further important insights along these lines were provided by Greenwood and Williamson (1966), Bush (1975), and Persson (2002). The main findings of these works were that the true <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> in rough materials is generally proportional to the normal force, while the parameters of individual micro-contacts (i.e., pressure, size of the micro-contact) are only weakly dependent upon the load.|$|E

Microbiological and sanitary conditions on food <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> in four retail fish markets was studied by using Food Stamp Rodac™ (Replicate Organism Detection and Counting) plates and ATP sanitation monitoring system. High plate readings of Total Colony Count (TCC) and indicator organisms such as total coliforms, yeasts and molds and Escherichia coli were obtained from samples collected from most food <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Similarly, significant numbers of pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens were observed in microbiological samples from all fish markets. Hygiene status of the food <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> studied using the AccuPoint® Sanitation Monitoring System showed extremely high levels of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) on all food <b>contact</b> <b>surfaces</b> in all fish markets.

25|$|Brachiosaurids shared synapomorphies, new traits {{typical for}} the group. They possessed middle and rear back {{vertebrae}} with long, 'rod-like' transverse processes. In the pelvis, the ischium had a shortened pubic peduncle, the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> with the pubic bone. Their humeri, upper arm bones, {{had a large}} deltopectoral crest. Their skull roofs showed wide supratemporal fenestrae, openings for the muscles. They had neural arches placed more on front of the vertebrae, shoulder blades that were expanded at the top end, irregularly shaped coracoids in the shoulder girdle, and triangular projections {{on the underside of}} the front branch of their quadratojugal bones at the lower rear corner of the skull.|$|E
25|$|Like the snout, {{the lower}} jaws are elongated. However, in some species, like Eurhinosaurus and Excalibosaurus, {{the front of}} the snout far {{protrudes}} beyond the lower jaws. While {{the front of the}} lower jaw is typically low, its rear depth is very variable. The greater part of the lower jaw is formed by the front dentary, the tooth-bearing bone. At its inner side the dentary is covered by a splenial that extends forwards until the symphysis, the common <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> where both lower jaws are grown together. The jaw joints do not allow a horizontal chewing movement: they function as simple hinges to vertically open or close the jaws.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{contemporary}} Lufengosaurus, Xingxiulong {{does not have}} a ridge on the side of its maxilla. Eleven tooth sockets are preserved {{along the length of the}} maxilla. Further back, in front of the eye socket, the lacrimal bears a prominent projection near the top of its front end, which is also seen in Lufengosaurus, Adeopapposaurus, Massospondylus, and Riojasaurus, but not Yunnanosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, or subsequent sauropodiforms. The <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> between the jugal bone and postorbital bone is fairly long, like Lufengosaurus but not Yunnanosaurus. Among the three branches of the jugal, the backwards-directed branch forms an angle of 80° with the upwards-projecting branch, which is similar to Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus but much larger than other sauropodomorphs.|$|E

25|$|The {{catalyst}} protonates the Alkenes (Propene, Butene) {{to produce}} reactive carbocations, which Alkylate Isobutane. The reaction {{is carried out}} at mild temperatures (0 and 30nbsp&°C) in a two-phase reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the cooling medium needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will suffice. It {{is important to keep}} a high ratio of Isobutane to Alkene at the point of reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of Isobutane back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient <b>contact</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{work done}} by {{friction}} can translate into deformation, wear, and heat that can affect the <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> properties (even the coefficient of friction between the surfaces). This can be beneficial as in polishing. The work of friction is used to mix and join materials {{such as in the}} process of friction welding. Excessive erosion or wear of mating sliding surfaces occurs when work due to frictional forces rise to unacceptable levels. Harder corrosion particles caught between mating surfaces in relative motion (fretting) exacerbates wear of frictional forces. Bearing seizure or failure may result from excessive wear due to work of friction. As surfaces are worn by work due to friction, fit and surface finish of an object may degrade until it no longer functions properly.|$|E
500|$|Debate {{continues}} {{as to how}} Smilodon killed its prey. Traditionally, the most popular {{theory is that the}} cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, generally cutting through the jugular vein and/or the trachea and thus killing the prey very quickly. Another hypothesis suggests that Smilodon targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely have prevented the cat from getting a good bite or stab. In regard to how Smilodon delivered its bite, the [...] "canine shear-bite" [...] hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible was pulled against the hide of a prey. The protruding incisors were arranged in an arch, and were used to hold the prey still and stabilize it while the canine bite was delivered. The <b>contact</b> <b>surface</b> between the canine crown and the gum was enlarged, which helped stabilize the tooth and helped the cat sense when the tooth had penetrated to its maximum extent. Since saber-toothed cats generally had a relatively large infraorbital foramen (opening) in the skull, which housed nerves associated with the whiskers, it has been suggested the improved senses would have helped the cats' precision when biting outside their field of vision, and thereby prevent breakage of the canines. The blade-like carnassial teeth were used to cut skin to access the meat, and the reduced molars suggest that they were less adapted for crushing bones than modern cats. As the food of modern cats enters the mouth through the side while cutting with the carnassials, not the front incisors between the canines, the animals do not need to gape widely, so the canines of Smilodon would likewise not have been a hindrance when feeding.|$|E
