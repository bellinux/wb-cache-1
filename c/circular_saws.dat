The <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades teeth rotate in outer ambient and thus are source of noise with unadvisable effects on working environment. The results of the measuring the noise level of three structuraly different <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades are presented in this paper. The types of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades are: with six compensating slots in radial direction, with six compensating slots in tangential direction and with six sigmoid compensating slots. The diameters of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades were 350 mm. The measurements of the noise level were performed in the cutting process using the standard equipments. The <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blades with compensating slots emited high cutting noise level but their noise level was different.

25|$|After {{moving to}} the borough in 1867, William and Thomas Hoopes (distant cousins of Josiah and Abner) {{established}} a spoke works. They purchased a site on Market Street from a coal yard operator and opened for business in September 1867, though they were not immediately successful. They invited their relative Edward S. Darlington to join the firm and began manufacturing complete sets of wheels in 1869. About a hundred men were employed in various capacities by the spoke works by 1872, such as cutting, hauling, and turning wood with <b>circular</b> <b>saws.</b> Exports of their products reached as far as Europe and the Pacific Coast. With the panic of 1873, profits suffered, and the firm accused the West Chester Railroad of price gouging. Despite threatening to move the factory to Chester or Philadelphia, the Hoopes Brothers & Darlington (as the firm was known) stayed put and the business recovered by 1880. The firm merged with 14 other companies to form the American Wheel Company in 1889, but the Hoopes Brothers and Darlington bought out their share in 1892. The company began producing wooden bicycle wheels in 1894.|$|E
30|$|When <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade {{is cutting}} the work piece, {{tangential}} and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade. Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, which could cause the buckling deformation of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade.|$|R

30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade, causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade is more easily affected by thermal stress.

30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry.

However, <b>circular</b> <b>saw</b> blade can also obtain radial compressive tensioning stress during roll tensioning process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape.

He also taught the men to work in brass, iron, and wood, and his wife--a Cocos girl that he married after comin' out--taught all the women and girls to sew, cook, and manage the house.

60|$|As {{the stream}} of logs came up into the mill the first log was shunted off the chain upon a carriage. Two men {{operated}} this carriage by levers, one to take the log up to the saw, {{and the other to}} run it back for another cut. The run back was very swift. Then a huge black iron head butted up from below and turned the log over as easily {{as if it had been}} a straw. This was what made the jar and crash. On the first cut the long strip of bark went to the left and up against five little <b>circular</b> <b>saws.</b> Then the five pieces slipped out of sight down chutes. When the log was trimmed a man stationed near the huge band-saw made signs to those on the carriage, and I saw that they got from him directions whether to cut the log into timbers, planks, or boards. The heavy timbers, after leaving the saw, went straight down the middle of the mill, the planks went to the right, the boards in another direction. Men and boys were everywhere, each with a lever in hand. There was not the slightest cessation of the work. And a log forty feet long and six feet thick, which had taken hundreds of years to grow, was cut up in just four minutes.|$|E
