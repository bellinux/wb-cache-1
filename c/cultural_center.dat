40|$|<b>Cultural</b> <b>centers</b> are {{traditionally}} {{known as a}} haven for entering students that fosters learning about individuals and their culture. However, many feel that the <b>cultural</b> <b>centers</b> do not fulfill their traditional roles as learning environments. Some feel that <b>cultural</b> <b>centers</b> are exclusionary while others {{feel that they are}} important within the university. The {{purpose of this study is}} twofold. The first is examining the problems students have when they enter the university. The second will analyze how the <b>cultural</b> <b>centers</b> address the concerns of these students. An ethnographic methodology was used, composed of interviews with administrators who are directly involved with the <b>cultural</b> <b>centers,</b> as well as students, undergraduate and graduate, who attend the university. Historical materials were gathered to explore the context and time periods of the struggles for <b>cultural</b> <b>centers</b> as well as initial goals for these centers. At the end of this study, this data is assessed to determine if the <b>cultural</b> <b>centers</b> have adhered to their mission statement. The final result is to understand what possible solutions can be found to ease the transition for students into the university. unpublishe...|$|R
