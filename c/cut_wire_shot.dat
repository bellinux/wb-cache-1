5000|$|Media choices include spherical {{cast steel}} shot, ceramic bead, glass bead or {{conditioned}} (rounded) cut wire. [...] <b>Cut</b> <b>wire</b> <b>shot</b> is preferred because it maintains its roundness {{as it is}} degraded, unlike cast shot which tends to break up into sharp pieces that can damage the workpiece. <b>Cut</b> <b>wire</b> <b>shot</b> can last five times longer than cast shot. Because peening demands well-graded shot of consistent hardness, diameter, and shape, a mechanism for removing shot fragments throughout the process is desirable. Equipment is available that includes separators to clean and recondition shot and feeders to add new shot automatically to replace the damaged material.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cut</b> <b>wire</b> <b>shot</b> is a metal shot {{used for}} shot peening, where small {{particles}} are fired at a workpiece by a compressed air jet. It is a low-cost manufacturing process, {{as the basic}} feedstock is inexpensive. As-cut particles are an effective abrasive due to the sharp edges created in the cutting process; however, as-cut shot is not a desirable shot peening medium, as its sharp edges are not suitable to the process.|$|E

Then, using simulations and experiments in the microwave domain, we investigate the dependence of resonances and retrieved effective index on the incident angle in asymmetric <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> pairs.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} and electromagnetic characterization of a planar composite metamaterial (CMM) {{that is designed}} to achieve dual-frequency double-negative response {{at the lower end of}} the extremely high-frequency (EHF) band. The CMM is based on <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> pairs and continuous wire elements. Dual-frequency operation is obtained by employing <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> pairs of two different lengths within the unit cell of the CMM. The magnetic response of the <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> pairs and the left-handed transmission band of the CMM are demonstrated by experiment and numerical simulations. It is found that the combined electric response of the dual-band CMM is complicated and imposes certain restrictions to the structure design in achieving true left-handed response at both designated frequencies. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMetamaterials made of {{exclusively}} metallic <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> pairs {{have been}} experimentally demonstrated to exhibit a negative refractive index at optical frequencies. However, other related works have not shown a negative index. In this paper, we propose {{an easy way}} to manipulate the magnetic and electric resonances of these metamaterials to produce a negative index. We show that judiciously breaking the symmetry of the structure allows tuning of both resonances leading to an overlapping between the negative permeability and negative permittivity regions. Numerical and experimental parametric studies of several <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> pairs metamaterials are presented to validate our method at microwave frequencies...|$|R

This metamaterial {{is composed of}} only metallic <b>cut</b> <b>wires</b> and is used under normal-to-plane incidence. Using Finite Element Method (FEM) based simulations and microwave experiments, we have investigated the material properties of the structure. Simultaneous negative values are observed for the permittivity e and permeability mu by the inversion method from the transmission and reflection responses. A negative index n is verified in a bulk prism engineered by stacking several layers of the metamaterial.

50|$|Four {{tools are}} {{essential}} {{and several other}} tools are useful {{in the construction of}} wire wrapped jewelry. The basic tools are a flush cutter, round nose pliers, flat nose pliers and chain nose or bent chain nose pliers. A flush cutter is a special type of cutter that leaves one end of the <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> flush or flat, while {{the opposite end of the}} <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> is sharp or pointed. Round nose pliers are pliers with conical jaws and are used for making loops in wire. Chain nose or bent chain nose pliers have flat smooth jaws and are used for gripping and holding wire and for bending wire. Flat nose pliers are just what the name implies…they are flat on both inside surfaces and are used to keep areas flat or to make 90-degree bends in your wire.|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic energy harvesting, i. e., {{capturing}} {{energy from}} ambient microwave signals, may become an essential part in extending the battery lifetime of wearable devices. Here, we present a design of a microwave energy harvester based on a cut-wire metasurface with an integrated PN junction diode. The <b>cut</b> <b>wire</b> with a quasistatic electric-dipole moment is designed to have a resonance at 6. 75 GHz, leading to a substantial cross-section for absorption. The external microwaves create a unidirectional current through the rectifying action of the integrated diode. Using an electrical-circuit model, we design the operating frequency and the resistive load of the <b>cut</b> <b>wire.</b> Subsequently, by optimizing our design using full-wave numerical simulations, we obtain an energy harvesting efficiency of 50 % for incident power densities {{in agreement with the}} typical power density of WiFi signals. Finally, we study the effect of connecting adjacent unit cells of the metasurface in parallel by a thin highly inductive wire and we demonstrate that this allows for the collection of current from all individual cells, while the microwave resonance of the unit cell is not significantly altered, thus solving the wiring problem that arises in many nonlinear metamaterials.
