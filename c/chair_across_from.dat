All I know is I can't wait for Barnes to cross over to the dark side. That burly bastard needs {{something}} else to do than push around Gotham's finest. So, hurry up with it already, Gotham. Please." [...] Vinnie Mancuso of New York Observer wrote, [...] "Elsewhere, Gothams moving parts didn't do much to warrant more than a passing mention, as entertaining as they all are. I mean, it's huge for both character and canon that Oswald Cobblepot articulated, out loud, the words 'I love you,' but it will have more weight when the <b>chair</b> <b>across</b> <b>from</b> him isn't empty. Meanwhile, Erin Richards has been pulling off the Herculean feat of stealing every scene she's in as bananas-as-hell Barbara Kean, while at the same time being given so little of substance to do by Gotham‘s writers. I'm not entirely convinced Richards isn't just showing up to set with a bottle of wine and commenting on the scenes happening around her without a script." ...|$|E
