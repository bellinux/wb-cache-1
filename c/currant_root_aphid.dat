In conjunction to this, pitfall sampling was conducted to determine the beneficial epigeal natural enemy complex in the area, which could contribute to the management of both <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> and glyphosate-resistant weeds. Ground beetles comprised an important and abundant component of this fauna, with 79 species collected throughout this study. ^ The second investigated {{the impact of a}} seed-applied insecticide (Poncho Beta) and sugar beet plant density (25, 000 plants/acre vs. 35, 000 plants/acre) on <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> and beneficial epigeal arthropods. The insecticide significantly reduced <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> populations, but not to levels which can be considered adequate control. Soil-dwelling beneficial arthropods remained largely unaffected by the seed-applied insecticides, except for a single ground beetle species (Bembidion quadrimaculatum oppositum) which showed higher activity in the untreated plots during one of the years. Plant density had minimal impact on the aphids and beneficial arthropods. ^ Finally, this study also investigated the impact of tillage (conventional versus reduced tillage) on beneficial epigeal arthropods, and their associated ecosystem services (particularly weed seed consumption and predation of live prey). Overall, the results indicated a strong incentive for adopting reduced tillage practices for sugar beet production, based on increased activity of spiders, centipedes and rove beetles. Although prey consumption remained unaffected by the tillage system used, increased weed seed consumption was observed under the zone tillage system. This study also illustrated the importance of examining important beneficial taxa, such as ground beetles, on the species level rather than on the family level, based on their differing responses to tillage by different species. ...|$|R

40|$|Pemphigus betae Doane (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is a {{sporadic}} pest {{of sugar}} beet (Beta vulgaris L. var. vulgaris) in all major sugar beet production regions of North America. These oval-shaped, pale-yellowish insects, {{with a body}} length ranging from 1. 9 – 2. 4 mm, secrete a waxy material, giving their subterranean colonies a moldy appearance. Poplars in the genus Populus L. are the preferred primary hosts, while sugar beet and certain weed species, such as common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and kochia (Kochia scoparia (L.)), are among the secondary hosts. Pemphigus betae has a complex and varied life cycle and is usually heteroecious and holocyclic, although anholocyclic apterae are known to overwinter in the soil. Heavy infestations of this aphid can induce significant reductions in yield, sugar content, and recoverable sugar. Under conditions of extreme stress and heavy infestations, the alienicolae can induce stunting, chlorosis, wilting, and even death of sugar beet plants. Accurately establishing population densities for sugarbeet <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> presents a challenge, because the economic important stage of this insect is subterranean. However, use of a fall root rating index aids in estimating relative population densities.

The effects of temperature on performance of this <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> were determined at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 +/- 1 degrees C on rice roots, Oryza sativa L. Nymphal stages from birth to adult decreased from 46. 3 d at 10 degrees C to 8. 5 d at 30 degrees C. Aphid survival and development were lowest at 35 degrees C, and no aphid produced progeny at this temperature. Average adult longevity decreased from 23. 3 d at 15 degrees C to 8. 2 d at temperatures up to 35 degrees C. Average number of nymphs produced per female was highest at 26 degrees C; averaging near 30 nymphs per female, but it dropped to near zero at both 10 and 35 degrees C. The highest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was 0. 241 at 30 degrees C. Net reproductive rate (R- 0) ranged from 29. 8 at 25 degrees C to 0. 2 at 10 degrees C.

40|$|Clonal organisms with {{occasional}} sex {{are important for}} our general understanding of {{the costs and benefits}} that maintain sexual reproduction. Cyclically parthenogenetic aphids are highly variable in their frequency of sexual reproduction. However, studies have mostly focused on free-living aphids above ground, whereas dispersal constraints and dependence on ant-tending may differentially affect {{the costs and benefits of}} sex in subterranean aphids. Here, we studied reproductive mode and dispersal in a community of <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> that are obligately associated with the ant Lasius flavus. We assessed the genetic population structure of four species (Geoica utricularia, Tetraneura ulmi, Forda marginata and Forda formicaria) in a Dutch population and found that all species reproduce predominantly if not exclusively asexually, so that populations consist of multiple clonal lineages. We show that population viscosity is high and winged aphids rare, consistent with infrequent horizontal transmission between ant host colonies. The absence of the primary host shrub (Pistacia) may explain the absence of sex in three of the studied species, but elm trees (Ulmus) that are primary hosts of the fourth species (T. ulmi) occurred within a few km of the study population. We discuss the extent to which obligate ant-tending and absence of primary hosts may have affected selection for permanent parthenogenesis, and we highlight the need for further study of these aphids in Southern Europe where primary hosts may occur close to L. flavus populations, so that all four <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> species would have realistic opportunities for completing their sexual life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Mutualism, {{cooperation}} between different species, is wide-spread in nature. From bees pollinating plants to bacteria aiding digestion {{in the human}} gut: mutualism is essential for life on earth. But how does mutualism evolve? And what mechanisms keep mutualisms stable over evolutionary time and prevent mutualistic partners from parasitising each other? Here, these questions are explored using both computer models that mimic evolution and a detailed ecological study of one particular kind of mutualism, farming mutualism, in which one species ‘farms’ another species for food. The underground Yellow meadow ant tends various <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> in its nest for ‘milk’ (the sugary honeydew that aphids excrete) and ‘meat’ (by eating the aphids). In return, the ants build aphid chambers in their nest and protect the aphids actively from predators. My detailed studies of this farming mutualism on the isle of Schiermonnikoog (NL) surprisingly showed that the most common species of <b>root</b> <b>aphids</b> reproduce predominantly clonally and that they rarely disperse. The studies also show that in most aphid chambers only a single clone of aphids occurs, belonging to a single species. Interestingly, this latter example of ‘monoculture farming’ in combination with clonal reproduction of the ‘crop’ or ‘cattle’ is frequently observed in farming mutualisms. In addition, the computer simulations show that cooperative behaviour can evolve under certain conditions under which partners are able to choose with whom to cooperate. Moreover, these models show that mutualism can readily evolve when interactions are initially based on by-products, for example the honeydew of aphids...|$|R

40|$|Sugar beet, Beta vulgaris, is an {{important}} crop for the global sugar industry {{being one of the}} two major crops cultivated for sugar production. In the USA, the sugar beet <b>root</b> <b>aphid,</b> Pemphigus betae, is a regionally occurring pest which damages sugar beets by feeding on their secondary roots which results in reduced biomass and hence a lower yield. To date, the best alternative to control the aphids is by use of resistant varieties. To find such resistance and to introduce it in plant material by plant breeding it is necessary to have a precise and fast selection method for the resistance. In modern plant breeding more and more of useful plant characteristics are selected for via molecular markers. 	A locus on sugar beet chromosome I is known to harbor resistance to the <b>root</b> <b>aphid,</b> but the markers flanking the locus were too far from the actual gene(s) to be really useful for selections. The aim of this master thesis was to fine map the resistance locus by means of sequencing to enable identification of SNPs in close proximity of the locus and by conducting a phenotypic test under greenhouse conditions. The phenotypic test showed varying results, but was still a useful complement to the marker analysis. Several lines scored fairly consistent, while other lines had plants which scored anything between susceptible and resistant. However, in most cases the results from the phenotypic test were comparable to earlier phenotypic data from a field test, and part of the variation was because there still was segregation among sugar beet offspring but most likely also due to escapes from infestation. Since the phenotypic test was a pilot test there were some aspects that could be improved, for instance the selection of soil type. 	The results from the sequencing showed that nearly 50 % of the DNA targets were polymorphic. The other half of the DNA targets turned out to be either monomorphic or failed due to technical reasons or difficulties in amplification of the locus. From the fine mapping, five SNP markers were found {{in the vicinity of the}} interval where the resistance locus was previously mapped, making it possible to narrow down the resistance locus. The recombination frequency of the two markers closest to the resistance locus was 1. 6 %. Although the new markers can be utilized in marker-assisted breeding for the sugar beet <b>root</b> <b>aphid</b> resistance, recombinant events are still present between the two markers suggesting that further narrowing-down of the interval would be feasible...|$|R
