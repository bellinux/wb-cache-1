2500|$|Fit {{testing of}} tight-fitting masks of negative-pressure {{respirators}} became {{widely used in}} US industry in 1980-s. At the beginning, {{it was thought that}} the half-mask fit quite well to the worker's face, if during a fit test the protection factor (fit factor) is not less than 10 (later, experts began to use [...] "safety factor" [...] = 10 during the fit test; threshold fit factor become 10 × 10 = 100). The widespread use of fit testing in the industry gives professionals optimism, and they allowed to the employers restrict the use of half mask respirators in accordance with the values of worker's personal fit factor (the maximum concentration of pollutants = personal Fit Factor × PEL), but not more than 100 × PEL. However, scientific studies have shown that although such test increases the effectiveness of protection, the risk of leakage of large amounts of unfiltered air is maintained. Furthermore, the studies have shown that non-filtered air under the mask is not uniformly mixed with the filtered air, which leads to large errors in the measurement of the in-facepiece <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants,</b> and subsequent calculations of fit factors - the latter is often much smaller than the [...] "measured" [...] value. So, specialists recommend not allowed usage negative pressure half mask respirators then harmful substances' concentrations exceeds 10 PEL. Therefore, OSHA standards require to restrict using of half-mask negative-pressure respirators up to 10 PEL after obtaining fit factor {{greater than or equal to}} 100 during the mask selection for the worker (they used a safety factor = 10).|$|E

This solution was used in a versatile scheme to describe mean values <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> in environmental flows. An analytical solution and a simple finite difference scheme was used to validate that scheme. The scheme was then used, with empirical information from the flow-field, to describe an elevated line and point source in a region of constant stress within a turbulent boundary-layer where detailed measurements of mean values <b>of</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminant</b> were used for comparison.

50|$|Accumulation of {{chemicals}} by a POCIS device generally follows first order kinetics. The kinetics {{are characterized by}} an initial integrative phase, followed by an equilibrium partitioning phase. During the integrative phase of uptake, a passive sampling device accumulates residues linearly relative to time, assuming constant exposure concentrations. Based on current results, the POCIS sampler remains in a linear phase for at least 30 days, and has been observed up to 56 days. Therefore, both laboratory and field data justify {{the use of a}} linear uptake model for the calculation of sample rates. In order to estimate the ambient water <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> sampled by a POCIS device, there must be available calibration data applicable for in situ conditions regarding the target compound.

50|$|Equilibrium {{partitioning}} Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) are {{a type of}} Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) {{derived by}} the USEPA {{for the protection of}} benthic organisms. ESBs are based on the bioavailable <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> in sediments rather than the dry-weight concentration. It has been demonstrated that sediment concentrations on a dry-weight basis often do not predict biological effects. Interstitial water concentrations, however, predict biological effects much better. This is true because the chemical present in the interstitial water (or pore water) is the uncomplexed/free phase of the chemical that is bioavailable and toxic to benthic organisms. Other phases of the chemical are bound to sediment particles like organic carbon (OC) or acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and are not bioavailable. Thus the interstitial water concentration is important to consider for effects to benthic organisms.|$|E

50|$|AOPs rely on in-situ {{production}} of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (·OH). These reactive species are the strongest oxidants {{that can be}} applied in water and can virtually oxidize any compound present in the water matrix, often at a diffusion controlled reaction speed. Consequently, ·OH reacts unselectively once formed and contaminants will be quickly and efficiently fragmented and converted into small inorganic molecules. Hydroxyl radicals are produced with the help of one or more primary oxidants (e.g. ozone, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen) and/or energy sources (e.g. ultraviolet light) or catalysts (e.g. titanium dioxide). Precise, pre-programmed dosages, sequences and combinations of these reagents are applied in order to obtain a maximum •OH yield. In general, when applied in properly tuned conditions, AOPs can reduce the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> from several-hundreds ppm to less than 5 ppb and therefore significantly bring COD and TOC down, which earned it the credit of “water treatment processes of the 21st century”.|$|E
50|$|UFAD systems {{capitalize}} on the natural stratification that occurs when warm air rises due to thermal buoyancy. In a UFAD design, conditioned air stays in the lower, occupied part of the room, while heat sources such as occupants and equipment generate thermal plumes, which carry the warm air and heat source generated pollutants towards the ceiling where they are exhausted through the return air ducts. The temperature stratification created by the UFAD system has implication for space setpoints. Most of an occupant's body is {{in an area that}} is colder than the temperature at the thermostat height; therefore, current practice recommends raising thermostat setpoints compared to traditional overhead systems. The optimal ventilation strategy controls the supply outlets to limit the mixing of supply air with room air to just below the breathing height of the space. Above this height, stratified and more polluted air is allowed to occur. The air that the occupant breathes will have a lower <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> compared to conventional uniformly mixed systems.|$|E

In this study, a partition-based sampling method was applied {{as a tool to}} estimate bioavailability in soil. The accumulation of organic micropollutants was measured in two earthworm species (Eisenia andrei and Aporrectodea caliginosa) and in 30 -μm poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) -coated solid-phase micro extraction (SPME) fibers after exposure to two field-contaminated soils. Within 10 days, steady state in earthworms was reached, and within 20 days in the SPME fibers. Steady-state concentrations in both earthworm species were linearly related to concentrations in fibers over a 10 000 -fold range <b>of</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Measured concentrations in earthworms were compared to levels calculated via equilibrium partitioning theory and total <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> in soil. In addition, freely dissolved <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> in pore water, derived from SPME measurements, were used to calculate concentrations in earthworms. Measured concentrations in earthworms were close to estimated concentrations from the SPME fiber measurements. Freely dissolved <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> in pore water, derived from SPME measurements, were used to calculate bioconcentration factors (BCF) in earthworms. A plot of log BCFs against the octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow) was linear up to a log Kow of 8.

5000|$|Methanol and ethanol fuels contain soluble and {{insoluble}} contaminants. Halideions, {{which are}} soluble contaminants, such as chloride ions, {{have a large}} effect on the corrosivity of alcohol fuels. Halide ions increase corrosion in two ways: they chemically attack passivating oxide films onseveral metals causing pitting corrosion, and they increase the conductivity of the fuel. Increased electrical conductivity promotes electrical, galvanic and ordinary corrosion in the fuel system. Soluble contaminants such as aluminum hydroxide, itself a product of corrosion by halide ions, clogs the fuel system over time.To prevent corrosion the fuel system must be made of suitable materials,electrical wires must be properly insulated and the fuel level sensor must be of pulse and hold type, magneto resistive or other similar non-contact type. In addition, high quality alcohol should have a low <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> and have a suitable corrosion inhibitor added. Scientific evidence reveals that also water is an inhibitor for corrosion by ethanol.The experiments are done with E50, which is more aggressive & speeds up the corrosion effect. It is very clear that by {{increasing the amount of}} water in fuel ethanol one can reduce the corrosion. At 2% or 20,000 ppm water in the fuel ethanol the corrosion stopped. The observations in Japan are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism is 3 EtOH + Al -> Al(OEt)3 + [...] H2 will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminumwill react preferably with water to produce Al2O3, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer. The aluminum alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer; water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer.|$|E
