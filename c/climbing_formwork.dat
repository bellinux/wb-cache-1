50|$|<b>Climbing</b> <b>{{formwork}}</b> is {{a special}} type formwork for vertical concrete structures that rises with the building process. While relatively complicated and costly, {{it can be an}} effective solution for buildings that are either very repetitive in form (such as towers or skyscrapers) or that require a seamless wall structure (using gliding formwork, a special type of <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork).</b>|$|E
50|$|To {{build the}} pylons, Doka of Austria was {{commissioned}} {{to build a}} custom automatic <b>climbing</b> shutter <b>formwork</b> system, based on their SKE-100 automatic climbing shutter system. This was fabricated on site and employed to execute all tower leg lifts below deck level.|$|R
50|$|The {{manufactured}} {{products in the}} formwork area include wall formwork, column <b>formwork,</b> slab <b>formwork,</b> <b>climbing</b> systems, stage systems, self-climbing formwork, shoring, props, formwork panels, brace frames for single-sided concreting and anchor systems.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the pylon legs {{was carried}} out using {{automatic}} <b>climbing</b> system <b>formwork,</b> in lifts varying from 3m to 4m height. Each segment took about seven days to complete. When the climbing form reached a height of 72.9m, the concrete edge girder was installed by the form traveller supported by permanent stays was chosen - this self-launching system is designed for in situ casting of the segment using the free cantilever method.|$|R

50|$|Various {{types of}} <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> exist, which are either {{relocated}} {{from time to}} time, or can even move on their own (usually on hydraulic jacks, required for self-climbing and gliding formworks).|$|E
50|$|<b>Climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> (self-climbing): In {{this type}} of formwork, the {{structure}} elevates itself {{with the help of}} mechanic leverage equipment (usually hydraulic). To do this, it is usually fixed to sacrificial cones or rails emplaced in the previously cast concrete.|$|E
50|$|The <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> {{structure}} normally {{does not}} only contain the formwork itself, but also usually provides working space / scaffolds for construction crews. It may also provide areas for machinery and screens for weather protection, up to being fully enclosed while yet staying modular around a changing building structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{tower is}} {{constructed}} of high-performance reinforced concrete. Its 12 m diameter shaft (containing three lifts and an emergency stairwell) is supported on eight [...] "legs" [...] based on 16 foundation piles drilled over 12 m {{deep into the}} local sandstone. The main shaft was built using <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{main arch}} {{structure}} {{was constructed in}} a unique fashion: the complete arch was divided into four semi-arches which were built with <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> in an essentially vertical position {{on opposite sides of}} the gorge. These were then rotated and lowered into position in pairs to meet at the centre, thus forming the completed arch structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the rectangular concrete core was subcontracted to Byrne Bros (Formwork) Ltd, who used the PERI ACS self <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> system. This {{was the first time}} this system had been used in the UK. By using the jumpform system, the subcontractor was able to use additional work platforms situated below the main work platform, so that multiple phases of work could be undertaken concurrently.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formwork}} products, {{systems and}} design service include formwork panels, slab formwork, wall formwork, one-sided wall formwork, <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork,</b> tunnel formwork, dam formwork, bridge formwork (cast-in-place balanced cantilever bridge, concrete arch bridge and steel combination bridge formwork), shoring / falsework, tie systems and field support, software and training. Doka’s business {{is based on}} a combination of production, equipment sale & rental, engineering and maintenance. Most of the formwork production takes place at the Group’s central plant in Amstetten. [...] The Doka three-ply sheets are made in the branch plant in Banská Bystrica in Slovakia.|$|E
50|$|The {{two halves}} of the arch were cast using similar <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork,</b> with {{concrete}} provided via a cable conveyor. The construction system had an hydraulic self climbing casting mould which was anchored to themost recently completed arch segment, and segments were added {{at a rate of}} about 1 per week (illustration showing process). Each segment used about 60 cubic meters of k70 class concrete, and there were about 50 segments per side. The arch itself is hollow, and has been provided with heating coils to keep it free from ice and snow build up as well as navigation lights and interior maintenance pathways (info taken from this PDF at the joint bridge info site).|$|E
50|$|The Maastoren is {{designed}} by Dam & Partners Architecten. Also, the architecture firm Odile Decq Benoit Cornette {{was involved in}} the designing progress, and architecture firm OTH designed the interior of the office building. The skyscraper consists of two main elements: one has a height of 165 m and one is slightly turned compared to the first one and is around 105 m tall. Also, the Maastoren has a glass extension. The strength of the building is provided by a core with two inner walls, by other inner walls perpendicular to the core, and by the exterior that consists of prefab elements. These parts are made out of concrete. The core is occupied by the restrooms and some of the elevators among other things. The area of the core varies depending on the height and its dimensions on average are 13 m by 10 m. The core was constructed using a <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork.</b>|$|E
50|$|This bridge {{opened in}} 1979 and {{eliminated}} {{a considerable amount}} of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete suspension tower, which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only 6.4 m broad. They were manufactured with a <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork.</b> The 13-feldrige foreland bridge is a prestressed concrete construction work with a construction height of 3.80 m and a total span of 13 x 60 m = 780 m. thereby exists covers on a length of nine fields from two single-cell hollow boxes with ever 7.0 m broad base plate. The remaining four fields within the range of the bridge removing possess against it a five-cellular box cross-section with base plate width of 29.5 m. A structural steelwork has the 368 m river opening stretching far as if cover.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVertical {{development}} is the ideal solution {{to meet the demand}} of land for the fast growing urban population in India. It is the construction of tall structures such as high-rise buildings, sky scrapers and sky towers etc., rather than constructing laterally to accommodate large population in quiet a lesser area. However the construction of high-rise buildings are highly complex and requires advanced construction techniques and equipment. One of the most important requirements is the advancement in forming technology. Though the conventional or traditional method of forming high-rise building is economical, it suffers seriously on the time, quality, safety and sustainability factors. Therefore, the advanced systems known as <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> was introduced later. The <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> is relatively new technology developed from the slipform in late 1960 s. Unlike the developed countries, the practice of <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> is adopted only in the specialized construction projects in India. The reason being, lack of awareness about the <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> among many construction personnel and misconception about the erection and operation processes. Thus to reinforce the importance of <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> in the Indian construction, a firm research is carried out on the selection and operation of different <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> using constructability survey. A valid comparison of different <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> with the conventional formwork is done for the lift core-wall in the 20 storey high-rise building model using Building Information Modeling (BIM). From the developed 3 D BIM model, the cost, time, quality, safety and sustainability factors of both conventional and <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> are explored in detail by quantitative and qualitative indices. The constructability factors associated with the conventional and different <b>climbing</b> <b>formwork</b> systems are generated...|$|E
