5|$|George Orwell in {{his essay}} Some Thoughts on the <b>Common</b> <b>Toad</b> {{described}} {{the emergence of the}} <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> from hibernation {{as one of the most}} moving signs of spring.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species with}} which the <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> could be {{confused}} include the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) and the European green toad (Bufo viridis). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the <b>common</b> <b>toad.</b> The common frog (Rana temporaria) is also similar in appearance {{but it has a}} less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.|$|E
5|$|The annual {{life cycle}} of the <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> is divided into 3 periods: the winter sleep, the time of mating and feeding period.|$|E
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>toads</b> {{can live}} {{for many years}} and have survived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> are thought to live for about ten to twelve years. Their age can be {{determined}} by counting the number of annual growth rings in the bones of their phalanges.|$|R

40|$|Salmonella {{infections in}} {{amphibians}} are supposedly highly prevalent. Migrating common amphibian species in cultivated {{areas such as}} <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> (Bufo bufo) may thus promote spread and zoonotic transfer of Salmonella to humans, both indirectly by crop and livestock contamination and by direct contact. Between February and April 2011, the intestinal content of 1, 740 samples of road-killed migrating <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> in five Flemish provinces of Belgium was examined {{for the presence of}} Salmonella using bacterial culture and PCR. All the samples were negative. These results suggest that the role of migrating <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> in maintaining the infection cycle of Salmonella in northern European temperate regions is negligible...|$|R
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> {{was first}} given the name Rana bufo by the Swedish {{biologist}} Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. In this work, he placed all the {{frogs and toads}} in the single genus Rana. It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> in the genus Bufo, naming it Bufo bufo. The toads in this genus {{are included in the}} family Bufonidae, the true toads.|$|E
5|$|B. bufo {{is part of}} {{a species}} complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> (B. japonicus). The European <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E
5|$|Brown hares and European otters {{are found}} {{all along the}} north Norfolk coast, but red {{squirrels}} disappeared from the Holkham pines by 1981. The rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham, {{one of only two}} sites along this coast, although the common frog, <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> and common lizard are widespread in appropriate habitats.|$|E
50|$|African <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> {{are popular}} as pets. Keeping 2 or more {{will require a}} minimum of a 20-gallon terrarium.|$|R
50|$|Rhinella granulosa (<b>common</b> names: {{granular}} <b>toad,</b> <b>common</b> lesser <b>toad)</b> is {{a species}} of toad in the family Bufonidae. The species was redelimited in 2009 and is now endemic to Brazil.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} found that urban populations of <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show a lower level of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus {{species are}} {{carnivorous}} and feed mainly on invertebrates. During the land phase, prey include earthworms and other annelids, different insects, woodlice, and snails and slugs. During the breeding season, they prey on various aquatic invertebrates, and also tadpoles of other amphibians {{such as the}} common frog or <b>common</b> <b>toad,</b> and smaller newts. Larvae, depending on their size, eat small invertebrates and tadpoles, and also smaller larvae of their own species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo bufo) and {{the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
40|$|Breeding {{is limited}} by {{energetic}} or environmental constraints and long-lived species sometimes skip breeding opportunities. Environmental conditions may vary considerably across the geographic and elevational range of a species and species that can respond through variation in life history strategies are likely to maintain populations at the extremes of their ranges. The decision to skip breeding enables animals to adjust life history to circumstances, and plasticity in behavior allows implementation of adjustments. Elevational patterns suggest that breeding may be limited physiologically at high elevations (e. g., greater probability of skipped breeding; resources and environmental conditions more variable) in contrast to low elevations (probability of skipping breeding lower; resources and environmental conditions more predictable). We estimated the probabilities of survival and skipped breeding in a high-elevation population of <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> and compared estimates to existing data for <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> at low elevations, and to another toad species inhabiting a similar high elevation environment. Female <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> at high elevations tend to have high probabilities of skipping breeding and survival relative to data for <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> at low elevations, and appear to use a similar strategy of skipping breeding in response to similar environmental constraints as other toads at high elevations. We provide evidence of variability in this aspect of life history for <b>common</b> <b>toads.</b> Understanding variation in life history within widely distributed species is critical. Knowing that certain life history strategies are employed on a continuum informs conservation efforts, especially as impacts of climate change {{are likely to be}} different depending on elevation. © 2013 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan (outside the USA).

25|$|In or near {{fresh water}} there is {{sometimes}} found the Balkan frog (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri) and the European tree frog (Hyla arborea). Near {{or away from}} water there are <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> (Bufo bufo).|$|R
5|$|<b>Common</b> <b>toads</b> {{winter in}} various {{holes in the}} ground, {{sometimes}} in basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the common frogs and green frogs.|$|R
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> reaches {{maturity}} {{at three}} {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{kinds of}} amphibians, which drink no water but absorb it through their {{permeable}} skins, {{have been identified}} in Petrified Forest National Park. Tiger salamanders, found in grassland and near major drainages, are the only salamander species known in Arizona. Woodhouse’s toads, which are seldom seen, are the largest toads in the park. They like grasslands, riparian corridors, and developed areas. Red-spotted toads, most active in the rainy season, July through September, are found in rocky areas near streams and in canyons. The Great Plains toad, the most <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> in the park, prefers grasslands. Resident spadefoot toads include the New Mexico, plains, and Couch's varieties.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the aquatic}} animals {{found in the}} park are sawfish, butter fish, {{electric}} rays, silver carp, starfish, common carp, horseshoe crabs, prawn, shrimps, Gangetic dolphins, skipping frogs, <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> and tree frogs.|$|R
50|$|Carr Forge Dam is a dam {{located in}} {{the centre of the}} reserve. The dam dates back to the Tudor dynasty, and most of the {{brickwork}} still remains. The dam is now mainly used as a wildlife pond, with <b>Common</b> <b>Toads,</b> <b>Common</b> Frogs and other species including the endangered Great Crested Newt breeding in the marshes.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{established}} to promote sustainable gardening and nature study for local schools and community groups. It contains a stag beetle loggery, wildflower borders and a native hedgerow. Wildlife includes <b>common</b> <b>toads,</b> great tits, bees and butterflies.|$|R
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> {{emerges from}} {{hibernation}} {{in spring and}} there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned. They find their way to these mainly by using olfactory and magnetic cues. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices {{have been found to be}} able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a 70–90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. East Anglian sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen at several locations. Both common and grey seals {{can be seen at}} the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches. The common frog, <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> and common lizard all occur in suitable habitats, and the rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham and Holme.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a huge decline in numbers of 70–90%, mainly due to predation by the introduced American mink, but also habitat loss and water pollution. They are still common at Cley, {{which is one of}} a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen, with spraints regularly found at the southern end of East Bank. The common frog, <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> and common lizard all occur on the reserve.|$|E
5000|$|Palmate newts inhabit little Loch Kruse (named {{after the}} Texas botanist,Dale Kruse, who studied its sedges and rushes) {{at the top}} of Gillies Hill and <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> have been found in the {{vicinity}} of Polmaise Castle and its walled garden ...|$|R
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is listed}} as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) as it has pondweed and stonewort, and <b>common</b> <b>toads</b> breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slowworms there.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians {{are common}} in the capital, {{including}} smooth newts living by the Tate Modern, and <b>common</b> frogs, <b>common</b> <b>toads,</b> palmate newts and great crested newts. On the other hand, native reptiles such as slowworms, common lizards, grass snakes and adders, are mostly only seen in Outer London.|$|R
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E
5|$|When attacked, the <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> {{adopts a}} {{characteristic}} stance, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence {{lies in the}} foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called bufagin and is enough to deter many predators although grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal's liver, thus avoiding the toxin. The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range of shapes. The <b>common</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
