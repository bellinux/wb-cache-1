The Task Force developed, tested and refined a self-assessment questionnaire to determine capacity at system, organisation and individual levels; this was made available to and completed by professionals from many countries.

This work (which is described in more detail in Greenway (2009)) led FIG to draw the following broad conclusions: • Cooperation between organisations is a weak point: there is often suspicion rather than cooperation; • The remits and skills of the different organisations involved in administering a land administration system are often not joined up effectively; • The lack of effective working across sectors is a particular issue; • There are skill gaps, particularly in the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> into programmes, the division of labour, and ensuring effective learning and development...|$|E
40|$|Public policy becomes {{managerial}} practice {{through a}} process of implementation. There is an established literature within Implementation Studies which explains the variables and some of the processes involved in implementation, but less attention has been focused upon how public service managers convert new policy initiatives into practice. The research proposes that managers and their organisations have to go {{through a process}} of learning in order to achieve the implementation of public policy. Data was collected over a five year period from four case studies of capital investment appraisal in the British National Health Service. Further data was collected from taped interviews by key actors within the case studies. The findings suggest that managers do learn to implement policy and four factors are important in this learning process. These are; (i) the nature of bureaucratic responsibility; (ii) the motivation of actors towards learning; (iii) the passage of time which allows for the development of competence and (iv) the use of project team structures. The research has demonstrated that the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> into practice occurs through the operationalisation of solutions to policy problems via job tasks. As such it suggests that in understanding how policy is implemented, technical learning is more important than cultural learning, in this context. In conclusion, a "Model of Learned Implementation" is presented, together with a discussion of some of the implications of the research. These are the possible use of more pilot projects for new policy initiatives and the more systematic diffusion of knowledge about implementation solutions...|$|E
40|$|From the introduction]. To {{say that}} Europeanization is an {{overused}} and controversial concept {{would be an}} understatement, yet a recent substantial increase in scholarly publications on the subject {{has done little to}} clarify this term. Scholars differ on the definition of Europeanization, the mechanisms through which it affects member states (and EU candidate countries), their politics, policies or institutions, as well as whether or not Europeanization leads to a <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> outcomes. Especially lacking, in this plethora of research, are cross-national studies which capture Europeanization in a quantifiable way and estimate its impact while taking into account the alternative ways in which Europeanization works. This paper, building {{on a wide range of}} theoretical and case-studies research, represents one such attempt to measure the impact of Europeanization on the economic policy of the now new EU member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). The first section overviews the many definitions of Europeanization and justifies the use of the term to denote change in institutions, policy or preferences as a result of the influence of the European Union. This section also elaborates on why scholars should expect Europeanization to be present in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) even before these countries acceded to the EU. The second section develops a model of Europeanization to be applied to the CEE countries and summarizes seven propositions for how various factors affect the process of Europeanization of public policy in the CEE. The third section examines, by examples and statistical analysis, the extent to which the EU – through various channels of the Europeanization process – affects economic policy in the CEE. The final section concludes...|$|E

That is why Insurance companies want to migrate to modern computer systems. <b>Conversion</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>policies</b> from old mainframe systems to new computer systems is a complicated and long process which contains many things to consider. Actual <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> insurance <b>policies</b> starts from data export from the legacy system to a form that the new system requires. After data export, the policies are validated so that {{the information in the}} policies is correct and in the form that the new system requires. Also, this way the life cycle <b>of</b> the <b>policies</b> in the new system is confirmed. After validation, policies can be converted to the new system. This process also requires lots of specifications before the export <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> for the new system can begin. Also, after the conversion phase, the policies need to be monitored for verifying that they start to live correctly in the new system. In this thesis I shall explain how the conversion process works. Main point of this work is to show how the validation <b>of</b> insurance <b>policies</b> is made. The validation <b>of</b> insurance <b>policies</b> presented in this work is rule-based.

Provision of these services is typically devolved to Local Governments to ensure they correspond to the local needs. In rural India, such a correspondence is sub-optimal, with high local needs and poor provision by the Local Governments (Panchayats). The citizen participation in Panchayat's public deliberative meetings (Grama Sabha) is weak. The community context is characterised by social fragmentation and high socio-economic inequality. This research examined, whether and how better deliberative participation in Panchayat meetings was associated with better provision of these services by the Panchayats. The research used a three-staged systematic sampling method. Using correlational field survey design it gathered primary data from 99 panchayats in Karnataka State, and from 99 villages and 396 individuals within these Panchayats. Factor analytic and multivariate regression techniques were used to analyse the data in the statistical software, StataÂ® v. 13. Results suggest, better Grama Sabha meetings (that were convened more frequently, attended by a higher {{number of people with}} better representativeness, where discussions approximate to the deliberative norms: reciprocal, pro-social and accountable; and decisions taken have a common good orientation) were associated with better provision of {{water and sanitation}} services by the Panchayat. Further analysis suggested two possible explanations for this association: First, the individuals who participated more frequently in deliberative meetings of the Panchayat and where discussions approximated to the deliberative norms; were associated with: · Better information on availability and accessibility to services, · Better external political efficacy, a perception of greater responsiveness of the Panchayat to their needs and their efforts to influence it; and hence engage evenly in discussions · Better sense of community, a greater willingness to cooperate and coordinate, to find mutual needs and seek convergence when they are heterogeneous Above findings suggest, in a participatory setting, these individuals can be associated with better capability to collectively engage; to articulate, communicate and identify the mostii common of their service needs and frame it as a collective demand, through policy objective, for provision by the Panchayats. Second, better Grama Sabha meetings were associated with better rule of law in policy administration at the Panchayat level. This suggests, rule-bound <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> objectives into actual service outputs; a reflection of responsiveness and accountability of the bureaucratic action in achieving administrative commitment to the legislative goals. In conclusion, better deliberative participation can be associated with better capability of the individuals to engage in collective action. This can improve the correspondence between the needs and the provision; by strengthening individuals' collective demand for the services and by improving the responsiveness of the Panchayat in the supply of these services. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{study of the}} {{implementation}} of the Zero-Hunger Programme (PFZ), the Brazilian government’s main development project, in its pilot community, the rural village of Guaribas in Northeast Brazil. It examines the economic, political, and social impact <b>of</b> project <b>policies</b> on local institutions and practices, highlighting the discrepancy between PFZ’s stated goals and its achievements five years after its inception. Despite the conspicuous shortcomings of project initiatives, PFZ intervention has yielded instrumental “side effects” for the Brazilian government, such as the expansion of state capacity and bureaucratic power, and the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> social <b>policy</b> into political capital for propaganda. Recent scholarship on development attributes to these “instrumental effects”, which enhance state jurisdiction and social control, the systematic reproduction of development projects in spite of their perceived failures. Similarly, I argue that PFZ is linked to a specific project of governance whose object is ultimately the shaping of human capacities for the production of cooperative subjects. Through the expansion of public education, the calculated use of mass media artefacts, and workshops in “citizenship education”, self-esteem, beauty, and hygiene, PFZ aims at a major reform of its beneficiaries’ skills, attitudes, aspirations, and psychological dispositions. In this sense, PFZ can be described as the instrument of a civilizing enterprise tied to a project of governance. This thesis contributes to the literature on development, which has typically focused on development projects in South Asia, Africa, and Southeast Asia as vehicles for sociopolitical control, by describing novel strategies of a recent development project in a region understudied by development scholarship...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact on}} Delhi’s air quality of a number <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> measures recently implemented {{in the city to}} curb air pollution using monthly time-series data from 1990 to 2005. The best known of these measures is the court-mandated <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> all commercial passenger vehicles—buses, three-wheelers, and taxis—to compressed natural gas (CNG). Broadly, the results point to the success of a number <b>of</b> <b>policies</b> implemented in Delhi but also to a number of areas of growing concern. For example, the results suggest that the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> buses from diesel to CNG has helped to reduce PM 10, CO, and SO 2 concentrations in the city and has not, contrary to conventional wisdom, led to the recent increase in NO 2. At the same time, however, the <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> three-wheelers from petrol to CNG has not had the same benefit, possibly because of poor technology. Another policy measure that appears to have had a positive impact on air quality is the reduction in the sulfur content of diesel and petrol. This has led to a decrease in SO 2 levels and, because <b>of</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> SO 2 to sulfates (a fine particle), a decrease in PM 10 concentrations. Some of these gains from fuel switching and fuel-quality improvements are, however, being negated by the increase in the proportion of diesel-fueled cars, which is leading to an increase in PM 10 and NO 2 levels, and by the sheer {{increase in the number of}} vehicles. air pollution, compressed natural gas, low-sulfur diesel, diesel-fueled cars, Delhi...|$|R
