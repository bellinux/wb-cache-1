2500|$|Laser cutting {{may be used}} to form {{intricate}} designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a {{very clean}} cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the <b>cut</b> <b>edge,</b> which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable [...] "stress-crazing" [...] at the <b>cut</b> <b>edge</b> and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge. Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} styles of hems of varying complexities. The most common hem folds up a <b>cut</b> <b>edge,</b> folds it up again, and then sew it down. The style of hemming thus completely encloses the <b>cut</b> <b>edge</b> in cloth, so that it cannot unravel. Other hem styles use fewer folds. One of the simplest hems encloses the edge of cloth with a stitch without any folds at all, using a method called an overcast stitch, although an overcast stitch {{may be used to}} finish a folded [...] "plain hem" [...] as well.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> is {{a series}} of {{recordings}} made by the British rock band Delirious?. The songs were originally written for a regular youth event, <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge,</b> in the band's home town of Littlehampton. Through this, the band gained its first name, The <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> Band, which was later changed to Delirious? when the band went full-time in 1996.|$|R
50|$|The {{recordings}} {{were originally}} released in four separate cassette tapes {{to be sold}} at the events. However, the recordings are now sold on compact disc, with the Delirious? branding. In the United Kingdom, the recordings are available on two CDs: <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> 1 and 2 and <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> 3 and Fore. In 2007, they were re-released as a double album, <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge</b> One, Two, Three and Fore. In North America, they were released in 1998 as a single, two-disc album, <b>Cutting</b> <b>Edge.</b> The North American version was certified Gold in Canada by the CRIA and the band's distributor CMC Distribution.|$|R

5000|$|Pleats, Puckers and Spurs - A pleat is a fold in {{the cover}} hook that extends from the <b>cut</b> <b>edge</b> {{downward}} toward the cover hook radius and sometimes below this radius in a sharp vee or spur shape. A pucker is a condition which is intermediate between a reverse wrinkle and a pleat, where the cover hook at the <b>cut</b> <b>edge</b> is locally distorted downward without actually folding. A spur is a localized irregularity characterized by a sharp protrusion {{at the bottom of}} the double seam. It is usually accompanied by a pleat or vee in the cover hook.|$|E

50|$|Bread loafing is {{a common}} method of {{processing}} surgical specimens for histopathology. The process involves cutting the specimen into 3 or more sections.

5000|$|Asterina phylactica is a {{pentagonal}} starfish {{with short}} blunt arms and a flattened shape.

It can be distinguished from the closely related Asterina gibbosa {{by the fact that it}} has fewer plates surrounding its mouth, its smaller size and its characteristic colouring. [...] At one time the two were believed to be the same species but it was realised in 1979 that besides the differences in appearance, the two occupied different ecological niches and had different reproductive methods.|$|E

It has been deposited in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as specimen number CM 54197. A segment of the cylindrical core was cut away before the fossil was discovered, and the fossil is accordingly incomplete: {{the front of the}} carapace extends over the <b>cut</b> <b>edge,</b> and much of the pleon is outside the edge of the core. Most of the carapace is visible, and shows a flattened form, with three distinct longitudinal carinae or ridges. The bases of the antennae are preserved, but no eyes are apparent. A single pereiopod (walking leg) is visible, and it ends without a chela (claw).|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the entire}} length of the tube, a section is made in the top, leaving an open space of about five inches. In each <b>cut</b> <b>edge</b> of the section there is an offset, to catch the edges of a valve which fits down upon it. The valve is made of a piece of sole leather half an inch thick, having plates of iron {{attached}} to it on both the upper and corresponding under side to give it strength ... which are perhaps one-fourth of an inch in thickness ... The plates are about nine inches long, and their ends, above and below, are placed three quarters of an inch apart, forming joints, so as to give the leather valve pliability, and at the same time firmness.|$|E
5000|$|Surgical {{margin in}} a surgery report defines the visible margin or free edge of [...] "normal" [...] tissue {{seen by the}} surgeon with the naked eye. Surgical margin as read in a {{pathology}} report defines the histological measurement of normal or unaffected tissue surrounding the visible tumor under a microscope on a glass mounted histology section. [...] A [...] "narrow" [...] surgical margin implies that the tumor exists {{very close to the}} surgical margin, and a [...] "wide" [...] surgical margin implies the tumor exists far from the <b>cut</b> <b>edge</b> or the surgical margin. Narrow surgical margin using the bread loafing technique suggests that residual cancer might be left due to false negative error. A surgeon often will perform a second surgery if a narrow surgical margin is noted on a pathology report.|$|E
