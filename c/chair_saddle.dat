50|$|Riding-like {{sitting on}} a saddle chair differs from {{sitting on a}} {{conventional}} <b>chair.</b> <b>Saddle</b> chair users sit 20-30 cm higher, which puts the hips and the knees into a 135° angle, compared to the 90° angle typically associated with sitting on a traditional chair.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> {{include not}} only height {{adjustments}} but also a tilt mechanism. There is also a divided <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> model on the market that has an adjustable {{gap between the two}} seat parts. Accessories, such as elbow and wrist supports, are available for <b>saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> to make different work tasks easier.|$|R
50|$|Adapting to a <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> {{takes time}} and {{requires}} {{a new kind of}} attitude towards sitting. The most common reason for using a <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> is that the users feel it is healthier for the back and legs than a standard chair. It was developed by ex-cavalrymen to ease the transition into office life. An intervention study on schoolchildren found that initially <b>saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> were liked better, but the difference leveled off over time.|$|R
50|$|A <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> {{uses the}} same {{principles}} in its design as an equestrian saddle. It {{is equipped with a}} chair base on casters and a gas cylinder for adjusting the correct sitting height. The casters enable moving around and reaching out for objects while sitting. Some <b>saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> have backrests, but most do not.|$|R
50|$|Because the <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> {{is higher}} than a normal office chair, the desk has to be higher as well. For this purpose there are desks that can be {{electronically}} or mechanically adjusted to fit the user. A <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> {{can also be used}} with a normal office desk, but then the desk has to be lifted up with height extension pieces.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} four office chairs on the postural angles of the lumbopelvic and cervical regions. Research question Which chair(s) produce an “ideal” spinal posture? Methods An experimental same subject design was used involving healthy subjects (n = 14) who conducted a typing task whilst sitting on four different office chairs; two “dynamic” chairs (Vari-Kneeler and Swopper), and two static <b>chairs</b> (<b>Saddle</b> and Standard Office with back removed). Data collection was via digital photogrammetry, measuring pelvic and lumbar angles, neck angle and head tilt which were then analysed within MatLab. A repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons was conducted. Results Statistically significant differences were identified for posterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis between the Vari-Kneeler and Swopper chairs (p = 0. 006, p = 0. 001) and the Vari-Kneeler and Standard Office chairs (p = 0. 000, 0. 000); and also for neck angle and head tilt between the Vari-Kneeler and Swopper chairs (p = 0. 000, p = 0. 000), the Vari-Kneeler and <b>Saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> (p = 0. 002, p = 0. 001), the Standard Office and Swopper chairs (p = 0. 000, p = 0. 000), and the Standard Office and <b>Saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> (p = 0. 005, p = 0. 001). This study confirms a within region association between posterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis, and between neck angle and head tilt. It was noted that an ideal lumbopelvic position does not always result in a corresponding ideal cervical position resulting in a spinal alignment mismatch. Conclusion In this study, the most appropriate posture for the lumbopelvic region was produced by the <b>Saddle</b> <b>chair</b> and for the cervical region by both the <b>Saddle</b> and Swopper <b>chairs.</b> No chair consistently produced an ideal posture across all regions, although the <b>Saddle</b> <b>chair</b> created the best posture of those chairs studied. Chair selection {{should be based on}} individual need...|$|R
50|$|A <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> {{provides}} {{another way}} to keep the body from falling forward; this type of seat is generally seen in some sit stand stools, which seek to emulate the straddle riding or saddle position of a horseback rider.|$|R
50|$|The <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> seat {{is either}} solid or divided. A divided seat reduces {{pressure}} on the perineum and lowers {{the temperature in the}} genital area. A divided seat is thought to be healthier, especially for men, than a solid seat.|$|R
5000|$|In middle age, Brooks {{became one}} of the most {{successful}} film directors of the 1970s, with many of his films being among the top 10 moneymakers of the year they were released. His best-known films include The Producers, The Twelve <b>Chairs,</b> Blazing <b>Saddles,</b> Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, History of the World, Part I, Spaceballs and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. [...] A musical adaptation of his first film, The Producers, ran on Broadway, from 2001 to 2007.|$|R
50|$|Brooks {{developed}} a repertory company of sorts for his film work: performers {{with three or}} more of Brooks's films (The Producers, The Twelve <b>Chairs,</b> Blazing <b>Saddles,</b> Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, History of the World: Part I, Spaceballs, Life Stinks, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Dracula: Dead and Loving It) to their credit include Gene Wilder, Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Harvey Korman, Cloris Leachman, Ron Carey, Dick Van Patten, and Andréas Voutsinas. DeLuise appeared in six of Brooks's eleven original films; the only person with more appearances was Brooks himself.|$|R
50|$|The <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> Håg Capisco was {{launched}} in the 1980s and inspired by the horseback rider’s dynamic posture.

60|$|In ten minutes, all {{was ready}} for a start. Walter and the trooper took their places in the <b>saddles,</b> <b>chairs</b> were brought out, and Mrs. Conyers and Claire mounted behind them. Walter had asked Mrs. Conyers to take her seat on the pillion on his horse, but she did not answer, and when Walter turned to see that she was comfortably placed behind him, he found that it was Claire who was seated there.|$|R

50|$|Until 2003, {{the top of}} Chair #1 & Chair #2 was {{the summit}} of the area, at 7800 ft, and the {{vertical}} drop was 1200 ft. When chairlift #3 (Huckleberry) was added on the Montana side in 2002, it lowered the base by 200 vertical feet (60 m). The addition of <b>Chair</b> #4 on <b>Saddle</b> Mountain, which opened in February 2003 after delays, increased the area's vertical drop by 400 ft. The slopes on the mountain are primarily east-facing.|$|R

50|$|Altogether {{the state}} of {{cultivation}} in Qom seems to have resembled {{that of the other}} regions of Persia, although the thirty different crops and plants are only indirectly mentioned in connection with the tax assessments. The soil is reported to have good quality and produced big quantities of food. Little is known about animal husbandry in the region, but the considerable number of fifty-one mills existed, of which a fifth was in decay. Legends speak of mineral deposits and mines of silver, iron, gold and lead, while Kurds seem to have produced salt from a lake nearby (see Qom Lake). The production of <b>chairs,</b> textiles, and <b>saddle</b> equipment indicates craftsmanship.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to invite a changed {{perception}} of active sitting, to introduce a more active way of sitting in office environments and destigmatize an active sitting posture such as straddling by giving active sitting products conscious aesthetics based on environment and positive associations. The goal with this project was an active sitting product for office environments with aesthetics considered encouraging to movement in a relaxed way, regardless of age and gender, and connect to materials and aesthetics related to activity, experience and recreation. Horseback riding, retro style surfing and skateboarding was an entry of investigation. The project was based on existing active sitting products, their function and production techniques. It was {{not a part of}} the project to investigate new models of sitting. This resulted in Pivot, a three legged active <b>saddle</b> <b>chair</b> for office environments with its aesthetic origins in retro style longboarding and horseback riding...|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{prompted}} by the prevalence of back injury and pain in the working population, particularly amongst workers who are increasingly exposed to sedentary work in industrialised countries, and the corresponding limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of seating designs currently used in the workplace. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the differences in comfort, productivity, and posture between the Bambach™ saddle seat and a standard office chair (two chair designs used within the workplace today). Method: A single system, multiple-baseline research design across a sample of four subjects was used. A withdrawal A_ 1 B_ 1 A_ 2 B_ 2 design was utilised, with the ordering of the sequence varying with each subject. 2 ̆ 2 A 2 ̆ 2 represented the standard office chair, and 2 ̆ 2 B 2 ̆ 2 the Bambach™ saddle seat. Results: Discomfort ratings tended to increase over time regardless of the seat being used. However, while the saddle seat provided reduced levels of lower back discomfort, it demonstrated higher discomfort in the lower limbs, particularly the hips and buttocks. There were no significant differences identified in productivity between the two <b>chairs.</b> The <b>saddle</b> seat consistently promoted a greater trunk-to-thigh angle for all subjects, a position associated with optimum sitting posture. Conclusion: This study has implications for the treatment of low back injury and pain at work, as well as other daily activities that involve prolonged static sitting, such as those incorporated in self maintenance, leisure and rest activities. This study provides health professionals with a systematic investigation of the immediate effects of using both the Bambach™ saddle seat and standard office chair in sitting. The findings of this study should be considered in future research...|$|R
40|$|Home blood {{pressure}} monitoring (HBPM) is increasingly commonly performed, but the concordance between patient HBPM measurement technique and prevailing recommendations {{has not been}} well-assessed according to the literature. The authors performed a multicentric survey to evaluate the degree of patients' adherence to current recommendations on HBPM, and investigate potential predictors of a higher-quality self-measurement. A structured questionnaire was administered to 725 Italian outpatient hypertensive patients (mean age, 52. 2 ± 14. 4 years). Overall, ≥ 10 recommended procedures were followed by 52. 8 % of the participants; only 1. 0 % followed all recommendations. A total of 49. 7 % of participants rested for ≥ 5 minutes before the measurement, 36. 8 % recorded BP {{more than once in}} each measurement session, and 34. 3 % used a <b>chair</b> or bed <b>saddle</b> to support their back. Less than 40 % of the patients received some form of training by health professionals. After multivariate analysis, patients receiving/reading instructions showed higher-quality HBPM (P<. 01). The accuracy of HBPM needs to be improved, and more efforts should be devoted to provide patient training on HBPM, especially on the less-frequently followed recommendations...|$|R
30|$|Publications {{dealing with}} the {{ergonomics}} of musical performance frequently discuss the use of chairs with sloping seats (Paull and Harrison 1997; Horvath 2010; Rosset i Llobet and Odam 2007). Diverse opinions on optimal sitting posture have been expressed in various orthopaedics texts (see Claus et al. 2009) though generally without reference to objective evidence, however {{it has been reported}} (Harrison et al. 1999; Keegan 1953) that an angle of 135 ° between the trunk and the thighs reduces the pull of the thigh muscles on the pelvis and allows the lumbar lordosis to assume what was defined as the neutral position (similar to that of standing). This angle would be impractical for musicians on a smooth seat as the buttocks would tend to slide downwards. Several types of ergonomic chair with downward sloping seats are commercially available (e.g. kneeling or <b>saddle</b> <b>chairs).</b> The seats of kneeling chairs may slope by as much as 20 ° (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008) creating an angle between the trunk and thighs of 110 °, while in <b>saddle</b> <b>chairs</b> in which a raised pommel-like central ridge prevents forward slippage of the body, the angle between trunk and thigh may exceed 125 ° (Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). Kneeling chairs do restore a moderate degree of lordosis in comparison to the kyphosis that is a typical consequence of sitting on flat seats, but this remains well below that of erect standing (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008). Musicians sometimes adapt the chairs provided with by placing blocks under the back legs or using a wedge shaped cushion (Paull and Harrison 1997). The cushions typically have a slope of 11 – 22 degrees (representing a trunk to thigh angle of 101 – 112 degrees) but this likely to be reduced by compression when the player sits on them. Alternatively, the player may sit on the front edge of a flat seat, holding the trunk erect and allowing the thighs to slope downward, though the degree to which this is possible will depend on the relationship between seat height and leg length. A number of chairs designed specifically for musicians are also available. In most, the slope of the seat is quite modest though one has a maximum downward slope of about 15 ° (allowing a trunk to thigh angle of 105 °). In chairs with a gentler slope, rounding the front edge of the seat allows the thighs to slope more steeply when the player sits forward. When sitting erect on sloping seats, greater activity is required in the postural muscles of the back and so it make take time to acclimatise and strengthen them, particularly if there is no lumbar support (Claus et al. 2009; Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). The degree of lordosis will depend on how erect the trunk is held by voluntary muscle activity. In orchestras, bands or other ensembles, performers often play sitting for several hours a day but unless they are physically active, core stability (dependent on distal limb and trunk musculature) may be relatively weak (Ackermann et al. 2002; Kava et al. 2010).|$|R
