5000|$|The average Chinese home uses some {{variation}} of the rectangular-bladed knife, usually around 18 cm to 28 cm (7-11 inches) in length. Traditional knives had a simply-forged, carbon steel blade with a long, ground bevel, but the typical Chinese chef's knife is now a stamped blade. The traditional handle is a full-length tang that is only about 1 or 2 cm wide, which is passed through a metal cap, then {{through the center of}} a round, wood dowel, then bent over and hammered into the end of the handle to retain it. Newer models, particularly those made in Japan or Germany, have full-width tangs and riveted or injection-molded handles, but these handles generally retain something of the traditional, round cross-section. The wide blade of Caidao keeps the cook's fingers well off the cutting surface and the round handle gives a nice [...] "pivot point" [...] for the <b>cutting</b> <b>stroke.</b> The blade has a curvature or rocker along its edge that is generally uniform, improving the knife's ability to chop and mince meats and vegetables. The broad rectangular blade also serves to scoop up chopped food for transport to the wok or bowl. Although it may seem unwieldy, skilled practitioners worldwide may be observed using this style of knife for everything — even carving and fine work normally accomplished with a paring knife.|$|E
5000|$|There were a {{wide variety}} and range of weapons used in the wars and battles of times long past {{and while it is}} quite easy to {{identify}} a sword or shield and know what purpose it served, even more information can be gained from knowing where said weapon comes from and what material it is made of. Ancient Greece {{is one of the most}} looked to and studied periods of time in part due the abundance of surviving information and artifacts and this aspect can also be extended to their weaponry and armor. The Mycenaean left behind a great deal of their weapons and armor which was found in their shaft graves, in Arms and Armour of the Greeks the swords found within the Mycenaean tombs are quite similar to rapiers being quite slender and measuring in at over three feet in length. It was due to their length and slim design that they were easily broken if struck hard enough. In addition to the rapier swords, smaller yet more durable blades were found along with a few spearheads which often came in at over two feet in length; however, the spearheads were not quite as abundant as other bladed weapons as Snodgrass states that their value and use in war and hunting was too significant to spare for graves. Prior to the Bronze Age the Mycenaean helmets were constructed from crescent shaped sections of wild boar tusk and arranged in horizontal bands that alternated in direction and attached to a soft material. The soldiers’ shields were around four feet tall, if not more, made of ox hide and supported with some type of metal. As we move into the Bronze Age body armor began to appear as the smiths began working with this new metal, bronze helmets also began to make an appearance though the previous helmets made from boars’ tusks still remained in use. It was during this period that two new types of swords made a debut, they were the horned and cruciform swords. The horned sword was dubbed as such from the horn-like appearance of their hand guards and was the preferred weapon for a <b>cutting</b> <b>stroke.</b> The cruciform sword was derived and enhanced from a Minoan dagger with flanges on the hilt with rounded, right angle hand guards is how it is described within Arms and Armour [...] Spears continued to remain as the preferred means for a thrusting weapon, but it was during the Palace Period that they developed a socketed base. In earlier periods of Greek history, the bow and arrow was not a favored weapon for war but used primarily in hunting though in the Palace Period archery began to prosper- the arrowheads of both time periods were made of flint, bronze, or obsidian- while the bows of the Palace Period were made of goats’ horn is how Snodgrass depicts the use of archery. From the Palace Period, we move into the Late Period of Mycenae where the weapons became shorter and more suited for use in a work environment rather than in battle and the metal plated armor was no longer being put to use.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the cutting efficiency of flake tools increases with increased tool size. Here, we undertook {{to examine the relationship between}} flake size and efficiency parameters using a larger and more variable flake dataset than used in previous analyses. Our analyses were specifically designed to assess whether there is an absolute relationship between ever-increasing flake size and increased efficiency and/or loading potential. An alternative hypothesis is merely that only the smallest flakes are inefficient, and it is this factor which has been driving previous statements linking increasing flake size with increased efficiency. Our first set of analyses, using all experimental flakes, determined that a statistically significant relationship existed between increased flake sizes and increased cutting efficiency, as measured by two different efficiency measures (‘Time taken’ and ‘Number of <b>cutting</b> <b>strokes</b> required’). This analysis also demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between flake size and loading forces. However, our second analysis, which excluded the smallest flakes in our sample, revealed a different pattern. In this second set of analyses, increasing flake size did not indicate a statistically significant relationship with our two measures of cutting efficiency. A statistically significant relationship between increased flake size and increased loading was, however, still evinced. In sum, these results suggest that there is not an unconditional or absolute relationship between increased flake size and increased cutting efficiency in all circumstances. Rather, there is a threshold below which flakes of a certain size will become markedly inefficient. Our results have particular implications relating to flake utility, optimality, and factors potentially influencing flake selection by hominins...|$|R
40|$|Cursive {{handwriting}} {{is writing}} style acquainted by nicely link between adjacent characters. Nowadays, cursive handwriting recognition {{is widely used}} in various applications including bank check processing and automatic address reading. The objective of such handwriting recognition is to realize a machine that is {{able to understand the}} meaning of cursive handwriting. In the literature, cursive handwriting can be recognized based on character or whole-word recognition. Character-based recognition has advantage over whole-word recognition because the vocabulary can be dynamically defined and adjusted without the need of word training. However, the challenge in cursive handwriting segmentation is how to decompose sequence characters which need to be isolated. In addition, segmentation becomes more problematic in touching and overlapping cases. The aim of this research is to design off-line cursive handwriting segmentation using heuristic approach based on contour analysis along with segmentation point validation and touching character segmentation. Prospective segmentation points are determined by considering minimum number of <b>cutting</b> <b>strokes</b> and vertical projection. Heuristic segmentation determines whether the segmentation points are correct or incorrect. Thus, artificial neural network is adopted to validate each segmentation point. In this regard, the neural network is trained with two segmentation point classes i. e. correct and incorrect segmentation points. Afterward, segmentation based on self-organizing map (SOM) is applied to enhance segmentation accuracy. The experimental results show that neural validation and SOM segmentation have improved the segmentation accuracy. This is proven by the average segmentation error rate achieved which is 2. 92 % for the proposed segmentation method and 3. 76 % for the existing method, Enhanced Heuristic Segmentation (EHS) ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of stone}} cutting tools opened a novel {{adaptive}} niche for hominins. Hence, {{it has been}} hypothesised that biomechanical adaptations evolved to maximise efficiency when using such tools. Here, we test experimentally whether biometric variation influences the efficiency of simple cutting tools (n = 60 participants). Grip strength and handsize were measured in each participant. 30 participants used flint flakes, while the other 30 used small (unhafted) steel blades. Variations in basic parameters of tool form (length, width, thickness, cutting edge length) were recorded for the 30 flint flakes. It was ensured that mean handsize and strength in each participant group were not significantly different to investigate the effect of tool variation. The experimental task required cutting through a 10 mm-diameter hessian rope. Cutting efficiency was measured using both ‘Number of <b>cutting</b> <b>strokes</b> required’ and ‘Total time taken’. Results show that both efficiency measures were significantly correlated with handsize using all 60 participants. However, {{no significant differences were found}} between the flake and blade groups in terms of mean efficiency. Nor was any significant relationship found between tool form parameters and efficiency in the flint flake group. We stress that our results do not imply that tool form has no impact on tool efficiency, but rather that – all other things being equal – biometric variation has a statistically significant influence on efficiency variation when using simple cutting tools. These results demonstrate that biomechanical parameters related directly to efficiency of use, may plausibly have been subject to selection in the earliest stone tool-using hominins...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} differences in the energy expenditure and economy of movement of sugarcane cutters with regard to burnt and green cane in situ. The primary objective was to investigate the differences in physiological responses, namely oxygen consumption (VO 2), heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) and the economy of movement with regard to burnt and green sugarcane during a normal working day. The secondary study was to investigate the effect of the long and the short handled curved blade knives on the cutter’s energy expenditure and economy of movement. The average relative VO 2 for cutting burnt cane and the calculated relative EE were both significantly lower than those for green cane. The average HR during work was not significantly different for burnt or green cane, neither was the maximal HR. Rate of productivity for burnt cane was significantly higher than that for green cane. Energy per kilogram required for burnt cut cane was significantly lower than that for green cane. The amount of cane cut per litre of oxygen consumed for burnt cane was significantly higher than that for green cane. The number of cane <b>cutting</b> <b>strokes</b> per minute for green cane was significantly lower than that for burnt cane. The number of stalks cut per stroke of green cane was significantly higher than that for burnt cane. The secondary study produced no significant differences in any of the measured variables for the comparison between the long handled knife and the short handled knife, except for the cane cutter’s perceived exertion (RPE). Results showed that cutting burnt cane surpassed all aspects of harvesting with regard to physiological parameters and economy of movement compared with green cane. The choice of knives depended on the preference of the cane cutter...|$|R

5|$|The {{transition}} from straight jokotō or chokutō to deliberately curved, {{and much more}} refined Japanese swords (nihontō), occurred gradually {{over a long period}} of time, although few extant swords from the transition period exist. Dating to the 8th century, Shōsōin swords and the Kogarasu Maru show a deliberately produced curve. Yasutsuna from Hōki Province forged curved swords that are considered to be of excellent quality. Stylistic change since then is minimal, and his works are considered the beginning of the old sword (kotō) period, which existed until 1596, and produced the best-known Japanese swordsmiths. According to sources Yasutsuna may have lived in the Daidō era (806–809), around 900; or more likely, was a contemporary of Sanjō Munechika and active in the Eien era (987, 988). The change in blade shape increased with the introduction of horses (after 941) into the battlefield, from which sweeping <b>cutting</b> <b>strokes</b> with curved swords were more effective than stabbing lunges required of foot soldiers. Imparting a deliberate curve is a technological challenge requiring the reversal of natural bending that occurred when the sword edge is hammered. The development of a ridge (shinogi) along the blade was essential for construction. Various military conflicts during the Heian period helped to perfect the techniques of swordsmanship, and led to the establishment of swordsmiths around the country. They settled in locations close to administrative centers, where the demand for swords was high, and in areas with easy access to ore, charcoal and water. Originally smiths did not belong to any school or tradition. Around the mid to late-Heian period distinct styles of workmanship developed in certain regional centers. The best known of these schools or traditions are the gokaden (five traditions) with each producing a distinct style of workmanship and associated with the five provinces: Yamashiro, Yamato, Bizen, Sagami/Sōshū and Mino. These five schools produced about 80% of all kotō period swords. Each school consisted of several branches. In the late Heian period Emperor Go-Toba, a sword lover, summoned swordsmiths from the Awataguchi school of Yamashiro, the Ichimonji school of Bizen and the Aoe school of Bitchū Province to forge swords at his palace. These smiths, known as goban kaji　(honorable rotation smiths) are considered to have been the finest swordsmiths of their time. Go-Toba selected from the Awataguchi, Hisakuni and Ichimonji Nobufusa to collaborate on his own tempering. Early Kamakura period tachi had an elaborately finished tang and an elegant dignified overall shape (sugata). Tantō daggers from the same period showed a slight outward curvature.|$|R
