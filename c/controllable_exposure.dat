40|$|Scintillations {{in solid}} {{tantalum}} capacitors are momentarily local breakdowns terminated by a self-healing or conversion to a high-resistive {{state of the}} manganese oxide cathode. This conversion effectively caps the defective area of the tantalum pentoxide dielectric and prevents short-circuit failures. Typically, this type of breakdown has no immediate catastrophic consequences and is often considered as nuisance rather than a failure. Scintillation breakdowns likely do not affect failures of parts under surge current conditions, and so-called "proofing" of tantalum chip capacitors, which is a <b>controllable</b> <b>exposure</b> of the part after soldering to voltages slightly higher than the operating voltage to verify that possible scintillations are self-healed, {{has been shown to}} improve the quality of the parts. However, no in-depth studies of the effect of scintillations on reliability of tantalum capacitors have been performed so far. KEMET is using scintillation breakdown testing as a tool for assessing process improvements and to compare quality of different manufacturing lots. Nevertheless, the relationship between failures and scintillation breakdowns is not clear, and this test is not considered as suitable for lot acceptance testing. In this work, scintillation breakdowns in different military-graded and commercial tantalum capacitors were characterized and related to the rated voltages and to life test failures. A model for assessment of times to failure, based on distributions of breakdown voltages, and accelerating factors of life testing are discussed...|$|E
40|$|High carrier mobility, {{saturation}} {{velocity and}} thermal conductivity make graphene a promising material for high-frequency, analog and communication applications. The ambipolar properties of graphene {{provide opportunities for}} increased functionality in unconventional circuit architectures. In this dissertation, I describe the fabrication process of graphene devices, including the optical and Raman spectroscopic characterization and electron-beam lithography. The different electrical characteristics of the single-layer and bilayer graphene field-effect devices reflect differences in the electron band structures of the two systems. The fabricated graphene transistors {{have been used to}} design and experimentally demonstrate electronic circuits with communication functionalities such as phase-shift keying, frequency-shift keying and phase detection. Compared with conventional semiconductor electronic designs based on multiple unipolar transistors, the demonstrated graphene amplifiers and phase detectors have advantage of a simplified structure. An important issue for high-frequency and analog applications is the low-frequency noise, which up-converts and contributes to the phase noise of the systems. It was found that the low-frequency noise in graphene devices is dominated by 1 /f noise in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 kHz (f is the frequency). The device exposure to different gases results in appearance of characteristic peaks in the noise spectral density. The latter can be utilized for selective gas sensing with graphene. The metal-graphene contact contributions to the 1 /f noise can be strongly reduced via the use of the graded thickness graphene channels in the device structure. I have also investigated a possibility of tuning graphene properties via <b>controllable</b> <b>exposure</b> to the low-energy electron-beam irradiation. It was found that the charge neutrality point and resistivity can be tuned over a wide range of values. The obtained results are important for the proposed applications of graphene in analog electronics, communications and sensors...|$|E

40|$|The ACS CCDs are {{equipped}} with LEDs that can illuminate the chips with a <b>controllable</b> short <b>exposure</b> added to an image. The purpose {{of this is to}} counteract the loss of efficiency due to charge traps which develop from exposure to ionizing radiation causing a readout loss or redistribution of charge in science images. The LED post-flash exposure fills these traps but adds statistical noise. Mainly because of this noise, the mechanism has not been used yet on science data, but might come into play as radiation damage accumulates. Once a year the procedure has been tested to confirm that it is in working order and to measure its stability. Over a four year period the mechanism has continued to function and shows no variation in output...|$|R

40|$|Medical-related {{radiation}} {{is the largest}} source of <b>controllable</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> to humans and it {{accounts for more than}} 95 % of radiation exposure from man-made sources. Its direct benefits in modern day medical practices are beyond doubt but risks-benefits ratios need to be constantly monitored as the use of ionizing {{radiation is}} increasing rapidly. From 1980 to 2006, the per-capita effective dose from diagnostic and interventional medical procedures in the United States increased almost six fold, from 0. 5 to 3. 0 mSv, while contributions from other sources remained static (NCRP report no 160, 2009). This chapter will review radiation exposure from medical imaging initially starting from a historical viewpoint as well as discussing innovative technologies on the horizon. The challenges for the medical community in addressing the increasing trend of radiation usage will be discussed as well as the latest research in dose justification and optimization. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Uncontrollable {{aversive}} {{events are}} associated with feelings of helplessness and cortisol elevation and are suitable {{as a model of}} depression. The high comorbidity of depression and pain symptoms and the importance of controllability in both conditions are clinically well-known but empirical studies are scarce. The study investigated the relationship of pain experience, helplessness, and cortisol secretion after controllable vs. uncontrollable electric skin stimulation in healthy male individuals. Methods Sixty-four male volunteers were randomly assigned to receive 30 controllable (self-administered) or uncontrollable (experimenter-administered) painful electric skin stimuli. Perceived pain intensity (PPI), subjective helplessness ratings, and salivary cortisol concentrations were assessed. PPI was assessed after stress exposure. For salivary cortisol concentrations and subjective helplessness ratings, areas under the response curve (AUC) were calculated. Results After uncontrollable vs. <b>controllable</b> stress <b>exposure</b> significantly higher PPI ratings (P = 0. 023), higher subjective helplessness AUC (P Conclusions The results confirm the impact of uncontrollability on stress responses in humans; the relationship of PPI with subjective helplessness and salivary cortisol suggests a cognitive-affective sensitization of pain perception, particularly under uncontrollable conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Exposing single-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} to {{room temperature}} UV-generated ozone leads to an irreversible increase in their electrical resistance. We demonstrate that the increased resistance is due to ozone oxidation on the sidewalls of the nanotubes {{rather than at the}} end caps. Raman and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show an increase in the defect density due to the oxidation of the nanotubes. Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy we show that these defects represent the removal of pi-conjugated electron states near the Fermi level, leading to the observed increase in electrical resistance. Oxidation of carbon nanotubes is an important first step in many chemical functionalization processes. Since the oxidation rate is <b>controllable</b> with short <b>exposures,</b> UV-generated ozone offers the potential for use as a low-thermal budget processing tool.

40|$|Behaviorally {{controllable}} stressors confer {{protection from}} the neurochemical and behavioral consequences of future uncontrollable stressors, a phenomenon termed behavioral immunization. Recent data implicate neuroplasticity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as critical to behavioral immunization. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed {{to a series of}} controllable tailshocks and one week later to uncontrollable tailshocks, followed 24 h later by social exploration and shuttlebox escape tests. To test the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade in behavioral immunization, either D-AP 5 or the MEK inhibitor U 0126 was injected to the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) mPFC prior to <b>controllable</b> stress <b>exposure.</b> Phosphorylated ERK and P 70 S 6 K, regulators of transcription and translation, were quantified by Western blot or immunohistochemistry after controllable or uncontrollable tailshocks. Prior controllable stress prevented the social exploration and shuttlebox performance deficits caused by the later uncontrollable stressor, and this effect was blocked by injections of D-AP 5 into mPFC. A significant increase in phosphorylated ERK 1 and ERK 2, but not P 70 S 6 K, occurred within the PL and IL in rats exposed to controllable stress, but not to uncontrollable stress. However, U 0126 only prevented behavioral immunization when injected to the PL. We provide evidence that NMDAR and ERK dependent plasticity within the PL region is required for behavioral immunization, a learned form of stressor resistance...|$|R
