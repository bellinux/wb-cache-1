5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello {{and placed it on}} the <b>canvass.</b> He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the <b>canvass,</b> which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|The state Democratic Convention met on February 22, 1867 in Frankfort {{and chose}} Helm and John W. Stevenson as the party's {{candidates}} for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Helm resigned {{his seat in}} the state senate to accept the nomination. Though his health was frail, he determined to <b>canvass</b> the entire state. He continued his call for an end to Civil War bitterness and proscriptions against those who had sided with the Confederacy. He won the general election over Republican Sidney Barnes and a third party candidate, Judge William B. Kinkead.|$|E

In his first address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime. Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, he insisted that the state banks not suspend specie payments. He also strongly believed in the rights of slave owners, and encouraged Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.|$|E

When the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 ended, Ignatios {{was forced to}} resign and leave Bucharest and its main sponsor, the Philological Society, ceased to exist. In an announcement published as an appendix to the issues of 1813 (dated April 1, 1813), Alexandros Vasileiou, a supporter of Korais and influential personality within the Greek community of Vienna, states this fact, as well as that the periodical had too few subscribers. He therefore called on all readers to <b>canvass</b> for new subscribers; moreover he called upon all scholars to send in their contributions.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats recaptured the House {{after the}} 1882 elections, but the {{incoming}} {{majority in the}} 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker {{more in line with}} their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to <b>canvass</b> the incoming representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous <b>canvass</b> of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E

5|$|As the 1880 {{elections}} approached, Randall had two goals: {{to increase}} his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, and to nominate Tilden for president. His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful, but Senator William Wallace's faction was again growing powerful. If he wanted to hold the Speakership, {{as well as to}} wield influence in the next presidential <b>canvass,</b> Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him. To that end, Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880. Some of his allies' enthusiasm backfired against him, however, after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti-Randall meeting in Philadelphia's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to <b>canvass</b> the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E

In 1784, George Washington visited and dined with Jones at his home at Bogota. In 1788, Jones and his brother-in-law Thomas Lewis were elected to represent Rockingham County at the Virginia Ratifying Convention, where both were fervent proponents for {{the adoption of the}} United States Constitution. Archibald Stuart of neighboring Augusta County traveled to Rockingham to <b>canvass</b> for Jones prior to the election, and in return, Jones gifted Stuart a chaise for he and his wife to return home in to Augusta County. Jones was among the first trustees of the Staunton Academy, following its incorporation by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on December 4, 1792.|$|E
50|$|New {{technologies}} changed how <b>canvassing</b> was conducted. Expansive databases of the electorate, {{such as the}} Democrats' NGP VAN, {{pulled together}} <b>canvassing</b> data, consumer information, and demographic profiles to allow precise targeting of voters. No longer would campaigns knock on all the doors in a district, rather voters who would most be persuaded to support the candidate or come out to vote could be targeted. Large campaigns incorporated A/B testing into their <b>canvassing,</b> to further hone and improve its effectiveness.|$|R

Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to <b>canvass</b> for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped <b>canvass</b> Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's {{political}} career {{began in earnest}} with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County.

It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798, or whether he was defeated in that year's <b>canvass.</b> Whatever the case, he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy. He was re-elected to the state House in 1799. In addition to the Committee on Enrollments, he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported {{on the state of the}} Auditor's, Treasurer's, and Registrar's offices.

5|$|Wickliffe {{supported}} the annexation of Texas, {{an issue that}} helped seal Clay's defeat in the 1844 presidential <b>canvass.</b> In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe as an envoy on a secret mission to the Republic of Texas. Originally, his purpose was to quash British and French attempts to forestall the U.S. annexation of Texas, but he later joined Commodore Robert F. Stockton in lobbying leaders of the Republic of Texas to order their military forces across the Rio Grande into Mexico. Stockton and Wickliffe believed that if they could provoke a Texan invasion of Mexico, the United States would have a stronger case for annexing Texas. Ultimately, they failed in convincing the Texans to invade, but succeeded in drumming up support for annexation. Both Wickliffe's position on annexation and his willingness to carry out Polk's assignment further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
25|$|About 1826, White sent Witt to {{work for}} the Cohoes Company in Cohoes, New York. White and others founded the firm in 1826. In 1831, the Cohoes Company built a wooden dam across the Mohawk River above Cohoes Falls and later would {{construct}} six canals to provide hydropower to various mills, factories, and foundries in Cohoes. Witt went to work as paymaster for the Cohoes Company, although the date of his arrival is not known. Some sources claim that Witt helped to construct the dam and the six power canals, as well as platted the emerging village of Cohoes. If he did so, then it was under the supervision of Hugh White, the brother of <b>Canvass</b> (who had assumed construction supervisory duties, as <b>Canvass</b> White was too busy). <b>Canvass</b> White turned over operation of the Cohoes Company to Hugh White in 1830, before work on the dam began. <b>Canvass</b> White died in 1834, before work on the power canals began.|$|E

For the COC from Canada, the Comelec representative explained that the physical COC was only shipped on May 26 and it will take about three to five days before it will be delivered to Congress. However, they have a certified true copy of the COC, which Comelec received via e-mail. This was also the case for the COC from Austria.
