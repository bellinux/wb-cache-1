Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{methods used}} for the {{classification}} of <b>customer</b> requirement <b>information</b> are typically based on specific indicators, hierarchical structures, and data formats and involve a qualitative analysis in terms of stationary patterns. Because these methods neither consider the scalability of classification results nor do they regard subsequent application to product configuration, their classification becomes an isolated operation. However, the transformation of <b>customer</b> requirement <b>information</b> into quantifiable values {{would lead to a}} dynamic classification according to specific conditions and would enable an association with product configuration in an enterprise. This paper introduces a classification analysis based on quantitative standardization, which focuses on (i) expressing <b>customer</b> requirement <b>information</b> mathematically and (ii) classifying <b>customer</b> requirement <b>information</b> for product configuration purposes. Our classification analysis treated <b>customer</b> requirement <b>information</b> as follows: first, it was transformed into standardized values using mathematics, subsequent to which it was classified through calculating the dissimilarity with general <b>customer</b> requirement <b>information</b> related to the product family. Finally, a case study was used to demonstrate and validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the classification analysis...|$|R

The primary principle is that customers of a financial institution are entitled to a high level of privacy for their personal and transaction information. However, complete anonymity poses other community issues, such as combating criminal activity, tax evasion, money laundering, as well as national security issues in order to stop the financing of terrorism. Such community concerns can only override the principle of personal privacy by express law to that effect.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{methods that}} {{are capable of}} {{improving}} the revenue and profitability of a financial services company are presented. Of particular interest is the use of <b>customer</b> specific <b>information</b> for pricing insurance products and segmenting a customer population based on the expected profitability of the customers. A prerequisite is the possibility for customers to have many different financial services products from the same provider. The thesis presents multivariate credibility models for how <b>customer</b> specific <b>information</b> from one (or many) financial services products is related to <b>customer</b> specific <b>information</b> from another financial services product. The models are foremost applied to the context of cross-selling (selling additional products to existing customers) where <b>customer</b> specific <b>information</b> from the offered cross-sale product is not available before the sale. As products are related, it is reasonable to use an appropriate (credible) amount of <b>customer</b> specific <b>information</b> from another product (or products), for estimating the profitability expected to emerge from the offered cross-sale product. In four separate but related articles, it is shown that having appropriate models for pricing and customer segmentation is of great importance for a financial services company aiming at running a profitable and growing business...|$|R

He left everything to Elizabeth: money, personal property, real estate, dozens of municipal utility bonds — and the plants and precious seeds. Elizabeth had first approached both Stanford and Berkeley to have either or both universities take over the experimental farm, but sold to Stark when those proffers didn’t materialize. Mrs. Burbank entered into an agreement with Stark Bro’s on Aug 23, 1927 to take the material they wanted from Burbank’s properties. The contract included ownership of the business name and all of the <b>customer</b> <b>information.</b> A September 6, 1927 contract provided exclusive rights to sell uncompleted experiments with fruits at Sebastopol (except the Royal and Paradox) for 10 years. Stark Bro’s had right of renewal. Tax receipts indicate payments of $27,000 to Mrs. Burbank. Exciting new kinds of fruits and flowers Burbank had developed (but never marketed) included 120 types of plums, 18 peaches, 28 apples, 500 hybrid roses, 30 cherries, 34 pears, 52 gladioli and many more. Stark Bro’s subsequently introduced many of these varieties in their catalog.|$|E

[...] However, Billboard argued that, assuming the ratio of people who paid for the full album was comparable to subscription numbers of Spotify and Pandora Radio, earnings between $1 and 6 million were more likely: [...] "not bad showing for a self-released, direct-to-fan album that allowed Yorke to circumvent major download stores and gather <b>customer</b> <b>information</b> — but it's no Hollywood starring role, either." ...|$|E

Therefore, if marketers want to use consumer information for advertising purposes, they must clearly illustrate {{the ways in which they}} will use the <b>customer's</b> <b>information</b> and present the benefits of this in order to acquire the customer's consent.
