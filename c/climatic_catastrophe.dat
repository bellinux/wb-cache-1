50|$|Keys' book Catastrophe: An Investigation {{into the}} Origins of the Modern World was {{published}} in 2000 by Random House. The book's thesis is that a global <b>climatic</b> <b>catastrophe</b> in AD 535 to 536 -- a massive volcanic eruption sundering Java from Sumatra -- was the decisive factor that transformed the Ancient World into the Medieval Era (and beyond). Ancient chroniclers recorded a disaster in that year that blotted out the Sun for months (possibly years) causing famine, droughts, floods, storms and an epidemic of bubonic plague. Keys uses tree-ring samples, analysis of lake deposits and ice cores, as well as contemporaneous documents to bolster his speculative thesis. In his scenario, the ensuing disasters precipitated {{the disintegration of the}} Byzantine Empire, beset by Avar, Slav, Mongol, and Persian invaders propelled from their disrupted homelands. The 6th-century collapse of Arabian civilization under pressure from floods and crop failure created a religiously apocalyptic atmosphere which {{set the stage for the}} emergence of Islam. In Mexico, the cataclysm supposedly triggered the collapse of Teotihuacán, while in China the ensuing half-century of political and social chaos led to a reunified nation.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} works {{demonstrated that}} the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) hypothesis, embodied {{in a series of}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) global climate models, is erroneous.

In view of these developments, we discuss climate predictions for the XXIst century. Based on the solar activity tendencies, a new Little Ice Age is predicted by the middle of this century, with significantly lower global temperatures. We also show that IPCC climate models can't produce any information regarding future climate, due to essential physical phenomena lacking in those, and that the current budget deficit in many EU countries is mainly caused by the policies promoting renewable energies and other AGW-motivated measures. In absence of any predictable adverse climate consequences of carbon dioxide emissions, and with no predictable shortage of fossil fuels, we argue for recalling of all policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions and usage of expensive renewable energy sources. The concepts of carbon credits, green energy and green fuels should be abandoned in favor of productive, economically viable and morally acceptable solutions. ...|$|E

40|$|Los desastres en Gironda en el siglo XVIII a partir de los registros parroquiales. Bajo el Antiguo Régimen, los registros parroquiales sirven para {{registrar}} bautismos, casamientos y defunciones pero también a veces relatan sucesos importantes que algunos párrocos han tenidos a bien notar en ellos. Aunque sean pocos y distribuidos de modo irregular en el espacio de Girona, la mayoría de esos textos hablan de los «desastres del tiempo presente », tales como podían experimentarlos y sentirlos los vecinos. Lo que se suele mencionar más son las catástrofes climáticas y sus consecuencias (carestía, destrucciones materiales, enfermedades) pero en otros casos se refieren a las guerras (guerra de Sucesión de España en particular) y a los disturbios políticos (el Gran Miedo de 1789). Berichte aus den Pfarrbüchern über Notjahre in der Gironde im 18. Jahrhundert. Während des Ancien Regimes sollten die Pfarrbücher Taufen, Hochzeiten und Bestattungen verzeichnen, doch finden sich dort auch Notizen über Ereignisse, die manchen Pfarrern wichtig genug erschienen, festgehalten zu werden.

Die meisten Notizen betreffen klimatische Katastrophen und ihre Folgen (Teuerung, Zerstörungen, Krankheiten).

40|$|Humans {{have come}} to the {{realization}} that pollution of the atmosphere with gases and particles in the past 50 years is the dominant cause of atmospheric change [Intergovern-mental Panel on Climate Change, 2007]. While land-use change can produce large regional effects, ozone depletion, global warming, and nuclear smoke all are human-driven problems that have actual or poten-tial global adverse impacts on our fragile environment, each with severe conse-quences for humanity. These effects were, or would be, inadvertent and unplanned conse-quences of normal daily activities, the defense policies of many nations, and nuclear proliferation. Thus, we must seek ways of continuing our normal lives while protecting ourselves from environmental catastrophe. Ozone depletion and global warming are already happening, while drastic cooling from smoke from nuclear-generated fires has so far been avoided. However, these three threats to humanity and the environment are interrelated—for example, nuclear energy is seen as an alternative to burning carbon for fuel, but also could potentially provide nations with the means to produce nuclear weapons. Chemicals harmful to ozone pro-duction are no longer used in manufactur-ing, but their replacements are greenhouse gases. These threats have been addressed with quite different policy responses, and with varying degrees of success so far. In this article, we present recent research that models the environmental effects of both small-scale and widespread nuclear weapons discharges, and show how efforts to save the ozone layer, and strategies cur-rently used to reduce greenhouse gas emis-sions, can be paralleled by a global call to avoid <b>climatic</b> <b>catastrophes</b> from the use of nuclear weapons.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a number of}} GIS based landscape analyses that together aim to explore aspects of the social development in Iron Age Västmanland, central Sweden. From a perspective where nature and culture are seen as integrated in the landscape, differences in the relations to the physical landscape are interpreted as reflecting social organisation. Thus, hydrological modelling of watersheds is used for understanding the development of territories and regions that are recognisable in the outlay of the medieval hundare districts. Statistical modelling of burial grounds together with variables describing their situation in the landscape {{is used to calculate}} an estimated chronology for sites that have not yet been excavated. This information is used to analyse differences in how the setting in the landscape can tell of different trends in claims to land and property rights. An extensive renegotiation of property rights is suggested to have taken place after <b>climatic</b> <b>catastrophe</b> in AD 536 and the years after. This is interpreted as having caused a substantial population decline in parts of Scandinavia. The social development after this includes an increasingly stratified social hierarchy in the Late Iron Age, which is reflected in the construction of grave monuments. New GIS methods for analysing how to interpret the perception of different locations of the landscape, in terms of local topography and soil are discussed in relation to this.   How to make the best use of large datasets of archaeological information in combination with other sources of geographical information is a central theme. Geographically Weighted Regression is used to predicting the representativity of the registry of graves for the whole landscape. It is suggested that the increasing availability of archaeological information in digital format, together with new analytical techniques has the potential to introduce fruitful new research perspectives. This will make it increasingly rewarding to work with the large amount of data produced from rescue archaeology, and it is important that this information is managed in a structured manner.

40|$|The {{well-known}} Tunguska- 1908 phenomenon (TP) problems (the fast {{transfer of}} the kinetic energy of the meteoroid W~ 10 - 50 Mt TNT to air, with its heating to T> 10 ^ 4 K {{at an altitude of}} 5 - 10 km, the final turn of the smoothly sloping, ~ 0 - 20 ^o to horizon, trajectory of the body through ~ 10 ^o to the West, the pattern and area of the tree-fall and trees' scorching by heat radiation, etc.) allow a simple solution within the New Explosive Cosmogony (NEC) of minor bodies, as opposed to other approaches. The NEC considers the short-period (SP) comet nuclei, to which the Tunguska body belonged, to be fragments produced in explosions of massive icy envelopes of Ganymede-type bodies saturated by products of bulk electrolysis of ices to the form of a 2 H 2 +O 2 solid solution. The nearly tangent entry into the Earth's atmosphere with V~ 20 km/s of such a nucleus, ~ 200 - 500 m in size and ~(5 - 50) x 10 ^ 12 g in mass, also saturated by 2 H 2 +O 2, initiated detonation of its part of ~ 10 ^ 12 g at an altitude of 5 - 10 km. This resulted in deflection of this fraction trajectory by 5 ^o- 10 ^o, and fast expansion with ~ 2 km/s of its detonation products brought about their fast slowing down by the air, heating of the latter to T> 10 ^ 4 K and a phenomenon of high-altitude explosion.

Cryoletters, 30, (1), 84 - 85. Society for Low Temperature Biology Meetings Abstracts, University of Copenhagen, Denmark 2008. IMPF: 01. 07 RONO: 00 Increasing demand for improved yield, quality and stress and disease resistance in cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) highlight {{the importance of}} securely preserving {{the diversity of the}} species for future breeding goals. Though vital, field collections are prone to losses through <b>climatic</b> <b>catastrophes</b> and the action of pests and diseases and the recalcitrant nature of cocoa seed with regard to storage make the establishment of a cryopreserved collection of key cocoa germplasm a sensible precaution. To this end approximately 600 accessions of cocoa are being cryopreserved at Reading University through the encapsulation-dehydration of floralderived somatic embryos (SEs) and a newly-developed PVS 2 -based approach. These vitrification-based procedures involve the rapid cooling of the prolific secondary SEs obtained from cultured cotyledonary explants of primary SEs. With a view to maintaining the genetic fidelity of cryopreserved plant germplasm, shoot tip culture has become the propagation system of choice. In the case of cocoa in vitro shoot regeneration has proved problematic though rapid clonal multiplication can be achieved via somatic embryos derived from the floral tissues. Primary SEs can be induced from petal bases and staminodes and multiplication rates can be further increased through the production of secondary SEs from cotyledonary explants of primary embryos. Due to concern about somaclonal variation arising through the protracted callus phase involved in the generation of these propagules, their genetic fidelity has been tested and primary SEs have been found to exhibit a significant number of mutations. In this study nuclear microsatellite-based screening has been applied to each of the cocoa linkage groups in SEs sampled from sequential stages of the cryopreservation procedure (i. e. following culture, sucrose pretreatment, dehydration over silica and thawing after storage in liquid nitrogen) and compared with profiles for the donor tree. For all 48 regenerants tested in duplicate none exhibited aberrant profiles with respect to the donor tree for any of the 12 microsatellites screened. Furthermore, the use of microscopy techniques involving only minimal sample preparation (i. e. confocal and environmental scanning EM) have provided convincing evidence that post-cryo? regenerants are derived from epidermal rather than callus cells, minimising any additional mutation risk. We conclude that, within the limits of this test population, no gross chromosomal changes occurred during cryopreservation and given the recent demonstration of virus elimination as a result of somatic embryogenesis, secondary SEs constitute an acceptable target tissue for cocoa germplasm conservation.
