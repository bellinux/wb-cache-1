5|$|The song drew {{accusations of}} racism, which the band has denied. The band members are often {{asked about the}} accusations in interviews, and have stated {{numerous}} times {{that they do not}} <b>condone</b> racism and are merely interested in the subject.|$|E
5|$|Shira and Yochay remain {{distant from}} one another afterwards, and he announces {{that he plans to}} move with Mordechai to marry the widow in Belgium. Shira, {{pressured}} by her family, agrees to go forward with the engagement to Yochay, believing it to be the best scenario for everyone. However, the rabbi realizes that Shira is acting to please her family and refuses to <b>condone</b> the marriage.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, {{when new}} {{evidence}} emerged that the killings of the fatwa of Mardin {{were based on}} a 1909 misprint, that resulted him writing the erroneous translation Le Statut des Moines, he distanced himself from <b>condoning</b> any killings by jihadist groups and denied ever having <b>condoned</b> the actions.|$|R

5|$|Our quarrel is {{not with}} these men, but with those who give them their chance. We {{who believe in the}} study of nature feel that a real {{knowledge}} and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet <b>condone</b> and encourage such untruth.|$|E
5|$|The {{years of}} Mary's reign were {{consistently}} wet. The persistent rain and subsequent flooding led to famine. Another {{problem was the}} decline of the Antwerp cloth trade. Despite Mary's marriage to Philip, England did not benefit from Spain's enormously lucrative trade with the New World. The Spanish guarded their trade routes jealously, and Mary could not <b>condone</b> illicit trade or piracy against her husband. In an attempt to increase trade and rescue the English economy, Mary's counsellors continued Northumberland's policy of seeking out new commercial opportunities. She granted a royal charter to the Muscovy Company, whose first governor was Sebastian Cabot, and commissioned a world atlas from Diogo Homem. Adventurers such as John Lok and William Towerson sailed south in an attempt to develop links with the coast of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Informed of the King's decision, Le Gris {{contacted}} Jean Le Coq, {{widely considered}} the best lawyer {{of the day in}} France. Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of {{the facts of the case}} are known. Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client, whose claims of innocence he considered to be false. Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court, which as a cleric in minor orders was his right. This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not <b>condone</b> trial by combat and thus would also be much safer. Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became angry when challenged on the decision, insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement.|$|E

5|$|Desha {{was drawn}} into the Holley {{controversy}} during the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate achieved {{a majority of the}} electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for John Quincy Adams. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, {{in the aftermath of the}} Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote that he did not know the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to <b>condone</b> its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{rejected}} Batman origin story reboot Joss Whedon {{pitched in}} December 2002, Warner Bros. hired Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer to script Batman Begins. The duo aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being {{the basis of}} the film. The film was primarily shot in the United Kingdom and Chicago, and relied on traditional stunts and scale models with minimal use of computer-generated imagery. Christian Bale starred as Batman, Liam Neeson starred as Ra's al Ghul, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. Katie Holmes also starred in the movie as Bruce's love interest, Rachel Dawes, a role created for the film. Alfred, the ex-British Army SAS member was played by Michael Caine and Jim Gordon was portrayed by Gary Oldman. A new Batmobile (called the Tumbler) and a more mobile Batsuit were both created specifically for the film. The film begins with the death of Bruce's parents and then explores his decision to leave Gotham and his training under the League of Assassins with Ra's al Ghul, before he rebels against the League and adopts the guise of Batman, recognising that he cannot <b>condone</b> their use of lethal force. The League attempt to attack Gotham using Jonathan Crane's weaponised fear toxin, but Batman is able to defeat their plan, with Ra's being apparently killed when a train he is in crashes during a fight with Batman.|$|E
25|$|If {{a formal}} defect has not caused a {{substantial}} injustice, the procedural step {{in question is}} valid. It is said that the court may <b>condone</b> the defect in these circumstances, but this seems incorrect, since section 157 does not confer on the court the power to <b>condone</b> defects.|$|E

25|$|Israel said it {{held the}} Beirut {{government}} {{responsible for the}} attack, but Prime Minister Fuad Siniora denied any knowledge of the raid and stated {{that he did not}} <b>condone</b> it. An emergency meeting of the Lebanese government reaffirmed this position.|$|E
25|$|Rape {{culture is}} a term used within women's studies and feminism, {{describing}} {{a culture in which}} rape and other sexual violence (usually against women) are common and in which prevalent attitudes, norms, practices, and media <b>condone,</b> normalize, excuse, or encourage sexualized violence.|$|E

25|$|People learn crime through association. These acts may <b>condone</b> {{criminal}} conduct, or justify crime under specific circumstances. Interacting with antisocial peers {{is a major}} cause. Reinforcing {{criminal behavior}} makes it chronic. Where there are criminal subcultures, many individuals learn crime, and crime rates swell in those areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of human sacrifice in medieval Buddhist Tibet is less clear. The Lamas, as professing Buddhists, could not <b>condone</b> blood sacrifices, and they replaced the human victims with effigies made from dough. This replacement of human victims with effigies {{is attributed to}} Padmasambhava, a Tibetan saint of the mid-8th century, in Tibetan tradition.|$|E
25|$|Hardalim {{fiercely}} opposed Israel's {{mass expulsion}} of Jews from the Gaza Strip and northern Samaria in 2005. While some Haredim also opposed the retreat {{and destruction of}} the Jewish communities, the Haredi rabbis did not <b>condone</b> active opposition; most (with the notable exception of Chabad Lubavitch) adopted a neutral, passively resisting, or even supportive attitude.|$|E
25|$|Terrorism {{is after}} all, a tactic. The term 'war on terrorism' is thus {{effectively}} nonsensical. As {{there is no}} space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term 'militancy'. This is not an attempt to <b>condone</b> such actions, merely to analyze them in a clearer way.|$|E
