5000|$|The <b>Cyclostyle</b> {{duplicating}} {{process is}} a form of stencil copying. A stencil is cut on wax or glazed paper by using a pen-like object with a small rowel on its tip. A large number of small short lines are cut out in the glazed paper, removing the glaze with the spur-wheel, then ink is applied. It was invented in the later 19th century by David Gestetner, who named it [...] "cyclostyle" [...] after a drawing tool he used. Its name incorporates [...] "stylus", classical Latin word for a pen.|$|E
50|$|In {{defiance}} of these regulations, some banned authors began writing samizdat articles and distributing them secretly in Czechoslovakia and abroad. In {{order to produce}} multiple copies of their works, they used carbon paper to produce up to fifteen copies at once. Other methods of copying included <b>cyclostyle,</b> spirit duplicator, photocopying, and xerography. The materials were secretly distributed among dissidents and sometimes smuggled abroad. All of these actions were very dangerous and those caught faced imprisonment or exile. During this time, Jiří Gruntorád, the current caretaker of the Libri Prohibiti, was imprisoned for four years for distributing samizdat literature.|$|E
50|$|Undeterred by {{the absence}} of even the most {{rudimentary}} printing equipment Fairbridge published the first issue of the Mashonaland Herald and Zambesian Times on 27 June 1891. The publication was a hand-written news sheet that was reproduced by a <b>Cyclostyle,</b> or early stenograph, process. Fairbridge had no ink and so had to make it himself. He also had to source paper for each edition as he had brought no supply of his own. He supported the venture by readers' subscriptions which could {{take the form of a}} pot of marmalade, a box of candles or an old spade.|$|E
50|$|David Gestetner, born in Csorna, Hungary, {{moved to}} London, England, and in 1879 filed his first copying patent.

He also {{established}} the Gestetner Cyclograph Company to produce duplicating machines, stencils, styli, ink rollers and related products the same year. The Gestetner works opened in 1906 at Tottenham Hale, north London, and employed several thousand people until the 1990s and operated in 153 different countries. Gestetner's inventions became an overnight success, and an international chain of branch offices that sold and serviced Gestetner products was established.|$|E

5000|$|... "The <b>cyclostyle,</b> {{which is}} an {{instrument}} used for multiple writing, makes about 140 dots to the inch. The style has a minute spur-wheel or roller, instead of a pen point the writing is made on stencil paper, whose surface {{is covered with a}} brittle glaze. This is perforated by the teeth of the spur-wheel wherever they press against it. The half perforated sheet is then laid on writing paper, and an inked roller is worked over the glaze. The ink passes through the perforations and soaks through them on to the paper below consequently the impression consists entirely of short and irregular cross bars or dots." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{growth of}} {{business}} during {{the industrial revolution}} created {{the need for a}} more efficient means of transcription than hand copying. Carbon paper was first used in the early 19th century. By the late 1840s copying presses were used to copy outgoing correspondence. One by one, other methods appeared. These included the [...] "manifold writer," [...] developed from Christoph Scheiner's pantograph and used by Mark Twain; copying baths; copying books; and roller copiers. Among the most significant of them was the Blue process in the early 1870s, which was mainly used to make blueprints of architectural and engineering drawings. Stencil duplicators (more commonly known as [...] "Mimeograph machines") surfaced in 1874, and the <b>Cyclostyle</b> in 1891. All were manual and most involved messy fluids.|$|E

Since August 2005, the newspaper has been printed on a <b>cyclostyle</b> machine and the size {{has been reduced to}} A4. Several journalists along with the editor Aminath Najeeb have been charged by the government for various news articles published by the paper. With its 200th edition the paper launched its website.

40|$|The {{editorial}} {{sets off}} with {{the importance of this}} periodical for serving as a link to the Maltese graduates who are abroad. In addition, this issue presents remarkable contributions from the best known surgeon in South Africa, besides to other accessions from colleagues in London, Leeds, Oxford, Toronto and Australia. Reference is made to two diseases, namely exotic cholera and Brucellosis, which were of considerable worldwide concern at that time. Malta has luckily been spared from cholera, however Brucellosis, to a considerable extent has been a Maltese problem. To this effect, the activity of the Maltese veterinarians and of the research laboratory under Mr. G. G. Alton, had provided their useful input in controlling the situation. Furthermore, an interesting book review about the “Malta Case Study - A Preliminary Study of the Nutritional Status of the Maltese Islands”,(F. F. Fenech, A. Grech, A. P. Jaccarini, L. Vassallo and P. Vassallo Agius, 21 st October, 1970. <b>Cyclostyle.</b> pp. 43, Royal University of Malta) is outlined, - a study which underlines the problem of excessive alimentation posed by adults. The Malta Study is an excellent piece of field work in the health sector of Maltese social life. A scientific “Publications List” by graduates of the Maltese medical schools is presented. The “Medical News” section opens up with the sad news of Prof Alfred John Craig`s tragic death, also highlighting his outstanding dedication within the medical services. An Index containing an alphabetical list of the authors and the titles of the articles is also included. peer-reviewe...|$|E
