500|$|Gilligan {{reasoned}} that, because Mulder and Scully {{would appear}} on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only [...] "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the 1999 psychological horror film The Blair Witch Project to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. Michael Watkins, who directed the episode, had a good rapport with the Los Angeles police department. As such, he secured real Sheriff's deputies as extras. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed [...] "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of <b>cops</b> <b>on</b> the job." [...] During the crack house scene, real SWAT team members were hired {{to break down the}} doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained that, because there were few cameramen and owing to {{the manner in which the}} episode was filmed, [...] "people just behaved as if we were [...] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up the way they do amongst themselves. It was quite funny".|$|E
500|$|In January, fan {{events in}} New York City and Los Angeles that promised [...] "first look footage" [...] were {{actually}} early screenings of the film. Reynolds attended the New York screening, while Tim Miller attended the Los Angeles screening with Deadpool co-creator Rob Liefeld, Lee, T.J. Miller, Reese, Wernick, and Hildebrand. For Super Bowl L, Fox arranged for Reynolds {{to run a}} taco truck on the Friday before, serving Deadpool's favorite food chimichangas; on the Saturday, a location near the Super Bowl stadium was transformed into the bar from the film, with Reynolds and T.J. Miller present to socialize; and during the game, Fox bought a commercial for the film while Reynolds was given control of the company's Snapchat account. For the week beginning February 8, Fox teamed with Viacom to show Deadpool commercials on five different Viacom networks, covering series targeted at several different demographics, including: Teen Mom and Ridiculousness on MTV; Tosh.0, Workaholics, and @midnight on Comedy Central; Love & Hip Hop on VH1; The Golden Girls on Logo TV; and <b>Cops</b> <b>on</b> Spike. @midnight also featured a segment dedicated to the film.|$|E

2500|$|The second segment {{that was}} cut from the film follows Wayne (Anton Yelchin), a shy {{apprentice}} mortician who is secretly a necrophiliac at the hospital he works at. One night, a body he's having sex with is brought back to life from the pressure of his thrusts. His supervisor Bob (Shane Jacobson) suddenly walks in and mistakenly believes that Wayne has performed a life-saving operation of some kind. The staff {{at the hospital and}} the media congratulate him while a news reporter asks what he did to save her. Unable to conjure an answer, one of the <b>cops</b> <b>on</b> scene tells everyone else they can just watch the security tapes to find out. As they rush to the security room, Wayne is given a personal thanks by the girl (Maria Volk) he revived, upon which he responds with an awkward [...] "Your Welcome". Unlike Find Our Daughter, this segment {{was not included in the}} DVD or Blu-ray release and instead premiered at the 2014 LA Comedy Festival.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{not having}} the Republican nomination, Lindsay {{was still on the}} ballot as the {{candidate}} of the New York Liberal Party. In his campaign he said [...] "mistakes were made" [...] and called being mayor of New York City [...] "the second toughest job in America." [...] Two television advertisements described his position: In one he looked directly into the camera and said, [...] "I guessed wrong on the weather before the city's biggest snowfall last winter. And that was a mistake. But I put 6,000 more <b>cops</b> <b>on</b> the streets. And that was no mistake. The school strike went on too long and we all made some mistakes. But I brought 225,000 more jobs to this town. And that was no mistake... And we did not have a Detroit, a Watts or Newark. And those were no mistakes. The things that go wrong are what make this the second toughest job in America. But the things that go right are those things that make me want it." [...] The second opened with a drive through the Holland Tunnel from lower Manhattan toward New Jersey and suggested that, [...] "Every New Yorker should take this trip at least once before election day..."
