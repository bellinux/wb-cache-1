25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature,</b> which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high expansion ratio {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E

50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are heat engines, {{and as such}} their theoretical efficiency can be approximated by idealized thermodynamic cycles. The thermal efficiency of a theoretical cycle cannot exceed that of the Carnot cycle, whose efficiency {{is determined by the}} difference between the lower and upper operating temperatures of the engine. The upper operating temperature of an engine is limited by two main factors; the thermal operating limits of the materials, and the auto-ignition resistance of the fuel. All metals and alloys have a thermal operating limit, and there is significant research into ceramic materials that can be made with greater thermal stability and desirable structural properties. Higher thermal stability allows for a greater temperature difference between the lower (ambient) and upper operating temperatures, hence greater thermodynamic efficiency. Also, as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature</b> rises, the engine becomes more prone to auto-ignition. This is caused when the <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature</b> nears the flash point of the charge. At this point, ignition can spontaneously occur before the spark plug fires, causing excessive cylinder pressures. Auto-ignition can be mitigated by using fuels with high auto-ignition resistance (octane rating), however it still puts an upper bound on the allowable peak <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, {{exhaust gas recirculation}} (EGR) is a nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions reduction technique used in petrol/gasoline and diesel engines. EGR works by recirculating a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders.

However it also limits efficiency of operation, as the engine cannot run at a higher and more efficient operating temperature.|$|E
50|$|Early {{intake valve}} openingEarly intake valve opening is another {{variation}} that has significant potential to reduce emissions. In a traditional engine, {{a process called}} valve overlap is used to aid in controlling the <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperature.</b> By opening the intake valve early, some of the inert/combusted exhaust gas will back flow out of the cylinder, via the intake valve, where it cools momentarily in the intake manifold. This inert gas then fills the cylinder in the subsequent intake stroke, which aids in controlling {{the temperature of the}} cylinder and nitric oxide emissions. It also improves volumetric efficiency, because there is less exhaust gas to be expelled on the exhaust stroke.|$|E

40|$|The NACA {{injection}} impeller {{was developed}} to improve the mixture distribution of aircraft engines by discharging the fuel from a centrifugal supercharger impeller, thus promoting a thorough mixing of fuel and charge air. Tests with a double-row radial aircraft engine indicated that for the normal range of engine power the NACA injection impeller provided marked improvement in mixture distribution over the standard spray-bar injection system {{used in the same}} engine. The mixture distribution at cruising conditions was excellent; at 1200, 15 OO, and 1700 brake horsepower, the differences between the fuel-air ratios of the richest and the leanest cylinders were reduced to approximately one-third their former values. The maximum <b>cylinder</b> <b>temperatures</b> were reduced about 30 [degrees] F and the temperature distribution was improved by approximately the degree expected from the improvement in mixture distribution.
