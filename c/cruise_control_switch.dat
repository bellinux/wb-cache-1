25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> <b>switch,</b> a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E

The MOMO black leather steering wheel installed on the GT and RS model designations continued, but the style changed from a four spoke design to a three spoke. The previous steering wheel was affixed with six allen head screws to an adapter hub that incorporated the <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> activation <b>switch</b> which was replaced with an integrated hub inside the three spoke steering wheel and is not compatible with the BC-BJ-BF series first generation Legacy <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> arrangement.|$|R
5000|$|Electronic {{throttle}} control (ETC) is an automobile technology which electronically [...] "connects" [...] the accelerator {{pedal to the}} throttle, replacing a mechanical linkage. [...] A typical ETC system consists of three major components: (i) an accelerator pedal module (ideally with two or more independent sensors), (ii) a throttle valve that can be opened and closed by an electric motor (sometimes referred to as an electric or electronic throttle body (ETB)), and (iii) a powertrain or engine control module (PCM or ECM). The ECM {{is a type of}} electronic control unit (ECU), which is an embedded system that employs software to determine the required throttle position by calculations from data measured by other sensors, including the accelerator pedal position sensors, engine speed sensor, vehicle speed sensor, and <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> <b>switches.</b> The electric motor is then used to open the throttle valve to the desired angle via a closed-loop control algorithm within the ECM.|$|R
40|$|Current Full Range Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (FRACC) systems <b>switch</b> between {{separate}} adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> and {{collision avoidance}} systems. This {{can lead to}} jerky responses and discomfort during the transition between the two control modes. We propose a Full Range Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (FRACC) design integrating adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> and collision avoidance into a single non-linear mathematical formulation. The proposed FRACC responds to a velocityerror using a sigmoidal function of forward spacing. Mathematical properties of the controller, in particular string stability, are examined. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the controller yields smooth and safe responses in typical highway scenarios, including hard-braking and cut-in scenarios. Results also show a clear advantage of the proposed controller in string stability performance with reference to a state-of-The-Art controller. </p...|$|R
50|$|The European, British and Australian {{versions}} {{were offered}} with three trim levels; the upscale GX, the more affordable LX in Australia called the GL in Europe and the UK, {{and the very}} basic DL in parts of Europe, with AWD offered as an option on the GX, LX and GL. In Europe and the UK, the GL and DL came with the 1.8-liter engine and the GX came with the larger 2.2-liter engine. For model year 1990, the British-spec. 1.8 GL was equipped with a carburetor and rear drum brakes but were later upgraded to single point fuel injection for model year 1991. The DL wasn't available in the UK or Australia. The British were also given a choice of vehicles equipped with a Catalytic Converter that restricted fuel usage to unleaded fuel only. The Australians could choose between the SOHC 2.2-liter no turbo on the GX and LX or the DOHC 2.0-liter with a turbo on the RS. In 1992, the Australians were offered the Liberty RS turbo as a sedan or extended roof wagon with a manual transmission only. When the Japanese-spec turbo was offered in Europe and Australia, the black leather covered MOMO steering wheel was also offered. The steering wheel was affixed with six allen head screws to an adapter hub that incorporated the <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> activation <b>switch,</b> if <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> was installed. This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and parking brake handle. The main difference from the Japanese market MOMO steering wheel and the European and Australian version was the Japanese version was four spoke.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{assisting}} {{driver in the}} task of longitudinal vehicle control is known as <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> Starting from the <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> devices of the seventies and eighties, now the technology has reached cooperative adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> This paper will address the basic concept of adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> and the requirement to realize its improved versions including stop and go adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> and cooperative adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> The conventional <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> was only capable of maintaining a set speed by accelerating or decelerating the vehicle. Adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> devices are capable of assisting the driver to keep a safe distance from the preceding vehicle by controlling the engine throttle and brake according to the sensor data about the vehicle. Most of the systems use RADAR as the sensor, a few uses LIDAR also.

30|$|Among {{existing}} studies, most of {{the existing}} rule-based adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> strategies are derived based on the human driver models, such as Intelligent Driver Model [15], Full Velocity Difference Model [32] and Optimal Velocity Model [33]. These adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> strategies may inherit the limitation of the human driver models, such as instability [16, 34] and unrealistic behavior [13, 15, 33]. In this paper, we propose a rule-based adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> to improve the stability and behavior of Intelligent Driver Model [15]. The stabilization effect of the proposed adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> on traffic flow is discussed theoretically.

40|$|In this {{literature}} survey little evidence is found of studies primarily investigating the road safety effects of <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> Those effects which were examined (mainly through practical tests {{with and without}} <b>cruise</b> <b>control)</b> showed {{that in addition to}} positive effects governing individual fuel consumption, <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> was also likely to cause positive road safety effects. This was linked to the fact that: (1) drivers would have fewer tasks to perform; (2) they would be driving at lower average speeds; and (3) that the traffic flow would be more `stable'. On theoretical grounds, these studies anticipate a significant road safety effect following the general introduction of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> on motorways in the form of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> on motorways {{in the form of a}} 50 per cent reduction in the number of fatal accidents involving passenger cars. This dramatic effect is linked to the calculation that the widespread introduction of <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> would slightly reduce average speeds and significantly reduce the distribution of speeds on these road types. This would result in fewer changes of lane, less overtaking and less braking, all of which would cause fewer accidents.

50|$|At the Legacy's introduction, the {{top level}} VZ sedan {{interior}} was originally available in blue, gray or a special color combination of pearl white exterior paint with dark red upholstery and brown interior plastic, with the other sedans and wagons offering interior color choices of blue or gray. The VZ wagon that was painted black came with light gray two-tone paint scheme on {{the lower half of}} the vehicle, and both front and rear bumper covers below the bumper rub strip, which was later used when the Outback was introduced with the Second Generation. Blue interior was offered on vehicles with blue exterior paint only. When model year 1990 arrived, however, the interior color choices were reduced to gray for the entire product line, with various types of upholstery selections, including a choice of velour, moquette, or tricot cloth upholstery based on the trim level. Leather was optional on the GT sedan and wagon only. A four spoke, black leather covered MOMO steering wheel also came with the Japanese-spec GT sedan/wagon and the RS sedan, and was affixed with six allen head screws to an adapter hub that incorporated the <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> activation <b>switch.</b> This arrangement allowed the exchange of other aftermarket steering wheels using a six screw installation pattern to suit personal tastes. The black leather steering wheel accompanied matching black leather on the gearshift, center armrest cover, and parking brake handle. The upper half of the dashboard on the 1990 RS was available with an optional blue color, with the rest of the dashboard and interior in gray only. The RS and RS type R interior color was black with black cloth upholstery with matching door panels and extended side bolsters on the front seats, covered in an upholstery pattern insert unique to the RS and RS type R. Japanese models have been known to be exported to countries with right-hand driving requirements, such as the UK, India, Australia and New Zealand.|$|R

40|$|<b>Cruise</b> <b>control</b> {{in motor}} {{vehicles}} enhances safe and efficient driving by maintaining a constant speed at a preset level. Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> (ACC) {{is the latest}} development in <b>cruise</b> <b>control.</b> It controls engine throttle position and braking to maintain a safe distance behind a vehicle in front by responding to the speed of this vehicle, thus providing a safer and more relaxing driving environment. ACC can be further developed by including the look-ahead method of predicting environmental factors such as wind speed and road slope. The conventional analytical control methods for adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> can generate good results; however they are difficult to design and computationally expensive. In order to achieve a robust, less computationally expensive, {{and at the same}} time more natural human-like speed control, intelligent control techniques can be used. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based on ACC systems that reduces the energy consumption of the vehicle and improves its efficiency. The Adaptive <b>Cruise</b> <b>Control</b> Look-Ahead (ACC-LA) system works as follows: It calculates the energy consumption of the vehicle under combined dynamic loads like wind drag, slope, kinetic energy and rolling friction using road data, and it includes a look-ahead strategy to predict the future road slope. The <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> system adaptively controls the vehicle speed based on the preset speed and the predicted future slope information. By using the ANFIS method, the ACC-LA is made adaptive under different road conditions (slope angle and wind direction and speed). The vehicle was tested using the adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> look-ahead energy management system, the results compared with the vehicle running the same test but without the adaptive <b>cruise</b> <b>control</b> look-ahead energy management system.
