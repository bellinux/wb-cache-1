2500|$|In the UK, some carpets {{are still}} {{manufactured}} for pubs and clubs {{in a narrow}} width of [...] and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as 'wall-to-wall', but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting {{is more than just}} a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the <b>carpet</b> <b>backing</b> (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.|$|E
2500|$|Later when bladed wires were {{developed}} the pile loops were severed on {{withdrawal of the}} blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton. after this development the loom {{became known as the}} Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. the methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire ( [...] 2-shot) the Wilton Wilton cut-pile is sometime woven similarly ( [...] 2-shot) but more often with three picks of weft to each wire ( [...] 3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the <b>carpet</b> <b>backing.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of carpet like twists, which is {{commonly referred to as}} a berber. Twist carpeting is composed of multiple twisted fibers set into the <b>carpet</b> <b>backing.</b> It is typically used in low traffic areas. Another type of carpeting is looped carpets, which are composed of looped fibers set into the <b>carpet</b> <b>backing.</b> This type of carpeting is typically used in high traffic areas as it is easy to clean.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} cure time, cure temperature, and air {{circulation}} on {{the release of}} 4 -phenylcyclohexene (4 -PCH) in tufted <b>carpet</b> <b>backed</b> with carboxylated styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex were examined in this research project. 4 -PCH is a suspect cause of certain "building-related" illnesses such as headache, upper respiratory and eye irritation, and fatigue. A standardized method for preparing <b>carpet</b> <b>backed</b> with SBR latex and analyzing its 4 -PCH content was developed. The cure parameters investigated included three cure temperatures (225, 250 and 275 °F), six cure times (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 minutes), and three air circulation rates (zero, three air exchanges per minute, and ten air exchanges per minute with 1500 linear feet per minute airflow). Increased airflow (1500 linear feet per minute) over the carpet surface produced {{the greatest impact on}} 4 -PCH release from carpet. Increasing the cure temperature and cure time also significantly increased the release of 4 -PCH...|$|R

50|$|The {{presence}} of the vinyl group allows styrene to polymerize. Commercially significant products include polystyrene, ABS, styrene-butadiene (SBR) rubber, styrene-butadiene latex, SIS (styrene-isoprene-styrene), S-EB-S (styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene), styrene-divinylbenzene (S-DVB), styrene-acrylonitrile resin (SAN), and unsaturated polyesters used in resins and thermosetting compounds. These materials are used in rubber, plastic, insulation, fiberglass, pipes, automobile and boat parts, food containers, and <b>carpet</b> <b>backing.</b>|$|E

This closed loop recycling prooess was formally announoed In February of 1994 by BASF, as The 6 ix Again Program. The prooess consists of six steps: Collection; Separation; Monomer Recovery; Polymerization; Yarn Spinning and Carpet Manufacture. This paper focuses on the Separation Stage of the 6 IX Again Program that BASF and Shred-Tech jointly developed. This stage encompasses the mechanical reduction, separation and densification of the final product...|$|R
60|$|THE princes {{returned}} to Gluckstein on the carpet, {{and went to}} the best inn, where they dined together and slept. Next morning they, and the ambassador, who had been told all the story, and Lady Rosalind, floated comfortably on the <b>carpet,</b> <b>back</b> to Falkenstein, where the king wept like anything on the shoulders of Alphonso and Enrico. They could not make out why he cried so, nor why Lady Molinda and Lady Kathleena cried; but soon they were all laughing and happy again. But then--would you believe he could be so mean?--he refused to keep his royal promise, and restore Prigio to his crown-princeship! Kings are like that.|$|R

50|$|As {{an input}} to the jute {{manufacturing}} (goods) industry, the supply for jute {{is derived from}} the demand. Nearly 75% of jute goods are used as packaging materials, burlap, gunny cloth, (hessian), and sacks. <b>Carpet</b> <b>Backing</b> Cloth, the third major jute outlet, is fast growing in importance. Currently, it consists of roughly 15% of the world's jute goods consumption. The remaining products are carpet yarn, cordage, felts, padding, twine, ropes, decorative fabrics, and heavy duty miscellaneous items for industrial use.|$|E
50|$|Jute {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of a number of fabrics such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, <b>carpet</b> <b>backing</b> cloth (CBC), and canvas. Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the variety}} in {{polyurethane}} chemistries, {{it is difficult}} to recycle foam materials using a single method. Reusing slab stock foams for <b>carpet</b> <b>backing</b> is how the majority of recycling is done. This method involves shredding the scrap and bonding the small flakes together to form sheets. Other methods involve breaking the foam down into granules and dispersing them into a polyol blend to be molded into the same part as the original. The recycling process is still ever developing for foam rubber and the future will hopefully unveil new and easier ways for recycling.|$|E

50|$|During {{the mid-1990s}} AkzoNobel {{purchased}} back {{a portion of}} the BASF operation and it was named AkzoNobel Nonwovens. It began to produce a nonwoven named Colback which was/is used in <b>carpet</b> <b>backing,</b> automotive and industrial applications and Geosynthetics Products used in the building and environmental markets. After AkzoNobel's acquisition of Britain's Courtaulds Fibers in 1998, a new company was formed in 2000 that combined Courtaulds Fibers and AkzoNobel Nonwovens to successively become Colbond. Actually AkzoNobel divested all of its fibers division in 2000 to form a new company called Acordia based in Spondon, England, but its management was still located in Arnhem, Netherlands, home of AkzoNobel.|$|E
50|$|To {{the south}} of Ponder's End Lock a factory making white lead was built in 1893. Further south of that factory, the Cortecine works {{produced}} floor-cloth and <b>carpet</b> <b>backing.</b> By 1906 over 2000 people were employed in local factories. Another major industry in the latter years of the 19th century was horticulture. Tomatoes and cucumbers were the principal produce but flowers and fruit were also grown in the many orchards and greenhouses {{to the north of}} the locality. During World War I, a huge munitions factory, the Ponders End Shell Works was built in Wharf Road. The factory building was sold after the war. Further factories were built in the 1930s alongside the newly built Great Cambridge Road.|$|E
5000|$|A natural {{behavior}} in cats is to hook their front claws periodically into suitable surfaces and pull backwards. Cats, like humans, keep their muscles trim and their body flexible by stretching. Additionally, such periodic scratching serves {{to clean and}} sharpen their claws. [...] Indoor cats may benefit from being provided with a scratching post {{so that they are}} less likely to use carpet or furniture, which they can easily ruin. However, some cats may simply ignore such a device. Commercial scratching posts typically are covered in carpeting or upholstery. Using a plain wooden surface, or reversing the carpeting on the posts so that the rougher texture of the <b>carpet</b> <b>backing,</b> may be a more attractive alternative to the cat than the floor covering. Scratching posts made of sisal rope or corrugated cardboard are also common.|$|E

50|$|In 1999-2000, {{the mill}} had 1,939 looms for hessian, 1,103 for sacking and 234 for <b>carpet</b> <b>backing</b> cloth (CBC). The looms in {{operation}} were 1085 for hessian, 726 for sacking, and 172 for CBC. Budgeted weaving production was 19,002 ton of hessian, 34,609 ton of sacking and 6,004 ton of CBC for the year. Actual production, {{on the other}} hand, was 10,284 ton of hessian, 21,236 ton of sacking, and 3,254 ton of CBC. The mill had 515 officers, 1,561 support staff and 16,443 workers. Man-days per ton estimated for 1999-2000 were 218 for hessian, 94 for sacking and 131 for CBC, which were 189, 88 and 112 respectively in 1995-1996. The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of hessian, sacking and CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a ton of hessian per ton was 1,672 kg, a ton of sacking 1,494 kg and a ton of CBC 1,813 kg. The comparative figures for 1999-2000 were 1,281 kg for hessian, 1,104 kg for sacking, and 1,447 kg for CBC. A rise in the wage cost per ton from Tk 23,092, 15,780 and 22,248 for hessian, sacking and CBC respectively in 1995-1996 to Tk 27,248, Tk 18,596 and Tk 25,800 respectively in 1999-2000 has, however, offset the economy achieved in use of raw materials.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{experimental}} setup developed to characterize reactions between ozone and building products and document their potential impact on indoor air quality. Preliminary experiments were conducted on four building products: two carpets, a gypsum board and a pine wood board. These preliminary experiments clearly indicate that ozone is significantly removed in contact with the four selected products. Measured ozone removal were around 65 % for the two carpets, 70 % for the gypsum board and 75 % for the pine wood board. In case of exposure to ozone, emissions of building products were modified and reaction products (mainly carbonyl compounds) have been identified. For instance, when exposed to ozone, the <b>carpet</b> with PVC <b>backing</b> shows higher emissions of formaldehyde, the <b>carpet</b> with textile <b>backing</b> emits nonanal and decanal and the pine wood board exhibits increased emissions of hexanal...|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, Zeon Ltd {{released}} {{a replica of}} the original toy. [...] The colour and graphic scheme are based on the U.K. version and all stickers have been redrawn as a direct copy of the original artwork. However, the replica differs in several ways from the original. 1) The circular hatch on the original was removable, to allow access to the 9v battery powering the electronics. On the replica, this hatch is fixed shut as the 9v battery is no longer used. 2) The main electronics circuit board is completely different, with surface-mount components and a different processor chip and software. 3) Motor rotation is detected by rotating magnets fitted to the motors, and hall-effect detectors on the circuit board - the original used optical detectors. 4) The original used an incandescent light bulb; the replica uses an LED. 5) The original used 4 x 'D' cell batteries and a 9v PP3 battery; the replica just uses 3 x 'D' cells. Since the initial release of the replica, a second version has been introduced, the differences being in the test program and the power switch. Version 1 has a single-position power switch, either on or off, whereas version 2 has a 3-position power switch, centre off, forward for use on <b>carpets,</b> <b>back</b> for use on smooth floors. This affects the stall-detection in the electronics, as the original version seems to have been designed to run on smooth floors, and easily stalls when attempting to turn on carpet. The test program for version 1 runs the unit forwards, pauses, then runs backwards; in version 2, the model runs forward, then turns 180 degrees, runs forward again, then backs up a little.|$|R
