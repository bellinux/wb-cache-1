New York has implemented a recycling law for businesses and consumers regarding toner and ink cartridges. In California the Public Contract Code (PCC) section 12156 encourages businesses to purchase recycled ink and toner cartridges.In the UK, large <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge</b> manufacturers have implemented recycling programmes {{in order to receive}} back empty cartridges for refilling of HP, Lexmark, Dell, etc. cartridges, as no compatible version is readily available.|$|E
50|$|Patched ROMs {{are often}} played on emulators, {{however it is}} also {{possible}} to play patched ROMs on the original hardware. The destination cartridge could be the original cartridge from which the initial unpatched ROM was pulled, or another <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge</b> of the same type. This is particularly popular for fan translations, homebrew games, prototypes, or other games for which original cartridges were never produced, or for games which require exact timing or other elements of the original hardware which are not available in emulators.|$|E
50|$|In 1980, the {{original}} Speak & Spell was redesigned {{to give it}} a membrane keyboard in place of raised buttons. This version was nearly identical to the first release and with backward <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge</b> recognition common to all Speak & Spells except the first version of the Super Speak & Spell, the entire library of cartridges from {{the original}} release were available to the 1980 release. Outside of the United States, the 1980 release was marketed in the United Kingdom under the same name, in German as the Buddy (employing an umlaut in place of the Speak & Spell's apostrophe), and in French as La Dictée Magique (lit. The Magical Dictation).|$|E

Many third party newly manufactured cartridges exist, these are named <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridges</b> and refer to any cartridge that is not made by the original manufacturer of the printer. Inkjet cartridges sold as [...] "compatible" [...] are typically newly manufactured <b>cartridges.</b> <b>Compatible</b> and OEM <b>cartridges</b> can be remanufactured and refilled.

5000|$|The [...]375 SOCOM is {{a fairly}} new cartridge, {{designed}} by Tromix in 2013. Taking a [...]458 SOCOM cartridge case and sizing the neck down to [...]375 caliber, resulted in a hard hitting AR-15 <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge,</b> that has a considerable velocity and range advantage over the [...]458 SOCOM {{as well as other}} big bore AR-15 cartridges. Unknown to most, the [...]375 SOCOM has a sizeable case capacity, nearly 60 grains, that is on par with the [...]308 Winchester. Typical [...]375 SOCOM loads will launch a 200 grain bullet 2400 feet per second from an 18" [...] barrel. In a short barrel suppressed subsonic application, the [...]375 SOCOM can be made to easily cycle the AR-15 action, using fairly fast burning propellants such as Trail Boss. This can be problematic with the [...]458 SOCOM when barrels are shortened below 12".|$|E
5000|$|In Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{ruled that}} {{circumvention}} {{of this technique}} does not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The European Commission [...] also ruled this practice anticompetitive: it will disappear in newer models sold in the European Union. [...] While the DMCA case dealt with copyright protection, companies also rely on patent protection to prevent copying and refilling of cartridges. For example, if a company devises all {{of the ways in}} which their microchips can be manipulated and cartridges can be refilled and patents these methods, they can prevent anyone else from refilling their cartridges. Patents protecting the structure of their cartridges prevent the sale of cheaper copies of the cartridges. For some printer models (notably those from Canon) the manufacturer's own microchip can be removed and fitted to a <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge</b> thereby avoiding the need to replicate the microchip (and risk prosecution). Other manufacturers embed their microchips deep within the cartridge in an effort to prevent this approach.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{describe}} consumers behaviour in the market with regards to print cartridges and to recommend the most suitable products {{to them on the}} basis of the established preferences and attributes. I used a questionnaire survey and a calculation of print cartridges parameter weights using the method of multi-criteria decision making. I found from the survey that the respondents mostly own ink multifunction equipment. Among the most commonly used printer makes are Hewlett Packard, Cannon and Epson. However, the proportion of less significant makes has dropped in the last three years. The respondents mostly buy original cartridges in shops and they buy black cartridges more often than colour cartridges. The main criteria for choosing a certain cartridge are price, quality and availability. The obtained information helped me select suitable cartridges for consumers. I found that cartridges are more readily available on the market in comparison to toners. When evaluating measurable attributes (price, quality and environmental friendliness) I calculated that in most cases it pays to buy renovated cartridges, especially for the evaluated cartridge from the makes HP and Canon and for toner makes HP and Epson. Epson cartridges contain a chip which prevents their renovation which is why I would recommend the purchase of a <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge.</b> For the Canon toner I would recommend the purchase of a <b>compatible</b> <b>cartridge</b> too. In summary of my recommendations I would advise consumers to look closely at the price, volume, quality, producer and possibility to renovate when purchasing cartridges. I would further recommend buying ink printers as it is difficult to get cartridges for laser printers. I would point out that in most cases a rule applies: the cheaper the printer the more expensive the cartridge...|$|E

50|$|Ink {{cartridges}} {{are typically}} priced at $13 to $75 per ounce ($1,664 to $9,600 per gallon) of ink, meaning that refill cartridges sometimes cost a substantial {{fraction of the}} cost of the printer. To save money, many people use <b>compatible</b> ink <b>cartridges</b> from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket inks, refilling their own ink cartridges using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer.

40|$|Microfluidic chips {{have gained}} wide {{applications}} in various fields, including medicine, environmental sciences and forensic investigations. They {{are used for}} the separation of proteins, blood, bacterial cell suspensions, antibody solutions, and drugs. Microfluidic chips display significant advantages, which include faster analysis time, reduced amounts of samples and reagents volumes, flexibility in design and increased separation efficiency. Whole column imaging detection (WCID) exhibits significant advantages compared to other detection methods that are widely used for detecting analytes after the separation of these analytes using isoelectric focusing. With these other methods, {{there is a need}} to mobilize the focused sample bands past the detector after separation but with WCID, there is no need for mobilization step. The aim of this research is further development of WCID by characterizing microfluidic chips fabricated for the detection system, to enhance its detection so that high efficiency can be obtained. The chips were fabricated using soft lithography technology at the Microfluidic laboratory, University of Waterloo and they were used to perform isoelectric focusing of various proteins in our laboratory. The fabricated chips with straight channel design were used to carry out isoelectric focusing of some proteins and the results obtained were compared with the results obtained using commercial cartridges. The chips with tapered channel design were used to carry out isoelectric focusing of proteins in which thermally generated pH gradient principle was employed. The samples after separation were sprayed into a mass spectrometer using nano-electrospray interface to obtain their molecular masses. <b>Compatible</b> <b>cartridges</b> for nano-electrospray mass spectrometer were developed and these cartridges were used to carry out capillary isoelectric focusing of low molecular pI markers and proteins.

50|$|The {{original}} Super 8 film {{release was}} a silent system only, but in 1973 a {{sound on film}} version was released. The film with sound had a magnetic soundtrack and came in larger cartridges than the original cartridge {{in order to accommodate}} the sound recording head in the film path. Sound film requires a longer film path (for smoothing the film movement before it reaches the recording head), and a second aperture for the recording head. Sound cameras were <b>compatible</b> with silent <b>cartridges,</b> but not vice versa. Sound film was typically filmed at a speed of 18 or 24 frames per second. Kodak discontinued the production of Super 8 sound film in 1997 citing environmental regulations as the reason. The adhesive used to bond the magnetic track to the film was environmentally hazardous.|$|R
