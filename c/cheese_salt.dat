40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of salt substitution with KCl on chemical, physical, microbiological and sensory properties of selected Mediterranean <b>cheeses.</b> <b>Salt</b> was substituted with KCl at four different levels (only NaCl, 3 NaCl: 1 KCl, 1 NaCl: 1 KCl, and 1 NaCl: 3 KCl). Halloumi, Akawi and Nabulsi cheeses were prepared and brined in the four different salt treatments for 56 days at 4 °C, 30 days at 4 °C, and 5 months at room temperature, respectively. Lowmoisture Mozzarella cheese was also produced and dry-salted and stretched in the four salt treatments and stored for 27 days at 4 °C. Chemical, physical, microbiological and sensory characteristics were examined for all cheeses during storage. <b>Cheeses</b> <b>salted</b> with NaCl/KCl mixtures had similar chemical composition, texture profile, organic acids profile, and microstructure compared with control (made only with NaCl) at the same storage period. Organic acids significantly increased and hardness decreased significantly during storage time at the same salting treatment. The primary proteolysis (measured as water soluble nitrogen: WSN) was insignificantly affected by salt substitution, while the advanced proteolysis (measured as trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen (TCA-SN), and phosphotungistic acid-soluble nitrogen (PTA-SN), and total free amino acids (TFAA) were significantly affected. All proteolysis parameters (WSN, TCA-SN, PTA-SN, and TFAA) increased significantly during storage time. <b>Cheeses</b> <b>salted</b> with NaCl/KCl mixtures at 3 : 1 and 1 : 1 ratios were the most similar to control cheese in term of sensory properties...|$|R

50|$|Salt has {{roles in}} cheese besides adding a salty flavor.

A characteristic opacity transition temperature (TOP) was obtained for each <b>cheese.</b> Both <b>salt</b> content and storage time influenced TOP.

50|$|Many fast {{foods are}} rich in {{calories}} as they include considerable amounts of mayonnaise, <b>cheese,</b> <b>salt,</b> fried meat, and oil, thus containing high fat content (Schlosser). Excessive consumption of fatty ingredients such as these results in unbalanced diet. Proteins and vitamins are generally recommended for daily consumption rather than large quantities of carbohydrates or fat. Due to their fat content, fast foods are implicated in poor health and various serious health issues such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there is strong empirical evidence showing that fast foods are also detrimental to appetite, respiratory system function, and central nervous system function (Schlosser).|$|E

40|$|The partial {{replacement}} of NaCl by KCl is a promising alternative {{to produce a}} cheese with lower sodium content since KCl {{does not change the}} final quality of the cheese product. In order to assure proper salt proportions, mathematical models are employed to control the product process and simulate the multicomponent diffusion during the reduced <b>salt</b> <b>cheese</b> ripening period. The generalized Fick's Second Law is widely accepted as the primary mass transfer model within solid foods. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was used to solve the system of differential equations formed. Therefore, a NaCl and KCl multicomponent diffusion was simulated using a 20 % (w/w) static brine with 70 % NaCl and 30 % KCl during Prato cheese (a Brazilian semi-hard <b>cheese)</b> <b>salting</b> and ripening. The theoretical results were compared with experimental data, and indicated that the deviation was 4. 43 % for NaCl and 4. 72 % for KCl validating the proposed model for the production of good quality, reduced-sodium cheeses...|$|R
