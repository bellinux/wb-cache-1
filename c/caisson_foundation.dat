Existing caissons installed in 1967 were used, along with new ones, to accommodate the building. The 5th floor functioned as a structural diaphragm, providing lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new and old caissons. Above the 7th floor, the building's structure was a typical tube-frame design, with columns in the core and on the perimeter, and lateral loads resisted by perimeter moment frames.|$|E

Winkler model for lateral response of rigid <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> in linear soil. Soil Dyn Earthq Eng; 2005 (submitted companion paper). ], this paper develops a nonlinear Winkler-spring method for the static, cyclic, and dynamic response of <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations.</b> The nonlinear soil reactions along the circumference and on the base of the caisson are modeled realistically by using suitable couple translational and rotational nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, which can realistically (even if approximately) model such effects as separation and slippage at the caisson-soil interface, uplift of the caisson base, radiation damping, stiffness and strength degradation with large number of cycles. The method is implemented in a new finite difference time-domain code, NL-CAISSON. An efficient numerical methodology is also developed for calibrating the model parameters using a variety of experimental and analytical data. The necessity for the proposed model arises from the difficulty to predict the large-amplitude dynamic response of caissons up to failure, statically or dynamically.

40|$|Many {{major river}} bridges were {{constructed}} in highgly active seismic areas of India much before the seismic code development. Bridges are lifelines infrastructure {{and as a}} result, {{it is necessary to}} requalify/reasses these structures {{in the light of the}} new and improved understanding of seismic resistant design philosophies. The aim of the paper is to develop a simplified methodology to carry out scenario based seismic requalification of major river bridges supported on <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> (aslo known as Well Foundation). An example problem of Saraighat Bridge located in high Himalayan seismic zone is considered to demonstrate the application of the methodology. Field investigation and advanced laboratory tests on soil samples from the bridge site were carried out. The test results reveal that the soil is susceptible to liquefaction and as a result, soil structure interaction analyses are carried out. It is shown that good performance of these type of bridges depend on the displacement response of the pier head so as not to cause unseating of the decks. It is concluded, owing to the large stiffness of the foundations, bridges supported on <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> may not adversely affected by liquefaction induced effects...|$|R
40|$|Suction {{caissons}} are a type {{of offshore}} foundation that allow for fast and noise-free installation and decommissioning of offshore structures. They {{have been used for}} 20 years in {{the oil and gas industry}} and are also becoming more common in the offshore wind sector as a promising way to cost reduction. SPT is a leading contractor for the installation of both single anchor piles and <b>foundations</b> on multiple <b>caissons.</b> The suction caissons are installed by applying a differential pressure between the inner and outer sides of the caissons, which pushes the caissons into the soil. When a platform is founded on multiple suction caissons, the way the wind and wave loads are transferred through the structure and various caissons into the soil will depend on the stiffness of both the platform and the caissons. The design of the substructure and suction caissons should thus be combined to include the effects of soil-structure interaction. This is currently done by modelling the suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> as a set of linear-elastic springs attached to the substructure. These springs are however not able to capture the non-linear behaviour that is often characteristic for soils. A method has been developed to model the suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> using non-linear springs. The characteristics of the springs are determined using FEM calculations with a nonlinear soil model in the geotechnical software PLAXIS. The springs are then implemented in a structural model of the substructure and the multiple foundations in the structural software SACS. The resulting loads on and displacements of the suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> for a test load case have been compared to results from a complete FE model and a model that uses linear-elastic springs. The comparison has shown that the developed model gives results that match well with the results from the full FE model. The linear-elastic model on the other hand gives results that deviate significantly for high loads. When the stresses in the soil increase the soil will behave softer, leading to an increase of the displacements of the suction caissons for high loads. The substructure will help decrease large differences between the displacements of the suction caissons, resulting in a more even load distribution over the foundations and thus smaller design loads for the suction caissons. This allows for smaller suction caissons and savings of material and costs. The model with nonlinear springs is able to predict this behaviour of the soil and the substructure accurately and can be used to make a more efficient design of suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{generalized}} spring multi-Winkler {{model is}} {{developed for the}} static and dynamic response of rigid <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> of circular, square, or rectangular plan, embedded in a homogeneous elastic. The model, {{referred to as a}} four-spring Winkler model, uses four types of springs to model the interaction between soil and caisson: Lateral translational springs distributed {{along the length of the}} caisson relating horizontal displacement at a particular depth to lateral soil resistance (resultant of normal and shear tractions on the caisson periphery); similarly distributed rotational springs relating rotation of the caisson to the moment increment developed by the vertical shear tractions on the caisson periphery; and concentrated translational and rotational springs relating, respectively, resultant horizontal shear force with displacement, and overturning moment with rotation, at the base of the caisson. For the dynamic problem each spring is accompanied by an associated dashpot in parallel. Utilising elastodynamic theoretical available in the literature results for rigid embedded foundations, closed-form expressions are derived for the various springs and dashpots of caissons with rectangular and circular plan shape. The response of a caisson to lateral static and dynamic loading at its top, and to kinematically-induced loading arising from vertical seismic shear wave propagation, is then studied parametrically. Comparisons with results from 3 D finite element analysis and other available theoretical methods demonstrate the reliability of the model, the need for which arises from its easy extension to multi-layered and nonlinear inelastic soil.

Despite appearances, no bricks were used in its construction; the inner structure is constructed of six hundred tons of steelbraced frame construction, and a 10 in reinforced concrete wall encircles the structure to the full height of the outermost stone-like walls. All of the steel and concrete works are supported on a concrete drilled <b>caisson</b> <b>foundation.</b> Much less fiberglass is used than is popularly supposed. Rather, most of the exterior is a thick, very hard fiber-reinforced gypsum plaster that is supported by light-gauge metal studs.

They are shingled in {{the same type of}} plastic that computer monitor shells are made from, attached to a cone of light gauge steel sheeting over the steel sub-frame. These towers were lifted by crane, then welded and bolted permanently to the main structure. Contrary to a popular legend, the castle cannot be taken apart or moved in any way {{in the event of a}} hurricane. It would take months to disassemble, it would be too dangerous to operate the 300 ft crane required in windy conditions, and there would have to be a safer building to keep it in. As with every other building at Walt Disney World, it was simpler and safer to design it to handle a hurricane.

The complexity {{give rise to}} both advanced and simplified analytical tools. Today numerical approaches such as the finite element method are most commonly used. Although many analytical and simplified methods have been developed, no standardized approach is established for <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations.</b> At the ISFOG-conference held in Oslo 2015, the Simplified Modal Non-linear Analysis was introduced. The method use springs to represent the subgrade in a two degree of freedom system. Based on force-displacement and moment-rotation relations from external soil-caisson analyses, secant spring stiffness are used. An iterative modal analysis procedure is then conducted, giving non-linear properties to the springs. Relevant accelerations are retrieved from an acceleration response spectrum. Dynamic force and overturning moment are calculated with corresponding lateral displacement and rocking motion. Foundation mass and soil added mass have been neglected in previous studies of the SMNA-method. This work is a parametric study to further develop the method studying inertial effects. Numerical analyses are first conducted in PLAXIS 3 D, which provide indicative results. The simplified model is then calibrated based on consistency with the numerical model. The initial SMNA-results show very low dynamic forces and excessively large moments, when soil added mass are introduced. The divergent tendencies indicate too high ratio of rotation to translation stiffness. In order to achieve compliance in the results a reduction in mass, {{mass moment of inertia}} and soil stiffness are needed...|$|R
