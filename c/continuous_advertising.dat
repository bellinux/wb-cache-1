40|$|A key task of {{advertising}} media planners {{is to determine}} the best media schedule {{of advertising}} exposures for a certain budget. Conceptually, the planner could choose to do <b>continuous</b> <b>advertising</b> (i. e., schedule ad exposures evenly over all weeks) or follow a strategy of pulsing (i. e., advertise in some weeks of the year and not at other times). Previous theoretical analyses have shown that <b>continuous</b> <b>advertising</b> is optimal for nearly all situations. However, pulsing schedules are very common in practice. Either the practice of pulsing is inappropriate or extant models have not adequately conceptualized the effects of advertising spending over time. This paper offers a model that shows pulsing strategies can generate greater total awareness than the <b>continuous</b> <b>advertising</b> when the effectiveness of advertisement (i. e., ad quality) varies over time. Specifically, ad quality declines because of advertising wearout during periods of <b>continuous</b> <b>advertising</b> and it restores, due to forgetting effects, during periods of no advertising. Such dynamics make it worth-while for advertisers to stop advertising when ad quality becomes very low and wait for ad quality to restore before starting the next “burst” again, as is common in practice. Based on the extensive behavioral research on advertising repetition and advertising wearout, we extend the classical Nerlove and Arrow (1962) model by incorporating the notions of repetition wearout, copy wearout, and ad quality restoration. is a result of excessive frequency because ad viewers perceive that there is nothing new to be gained from processing the ad, they withdraw their attention, or they become unmotivated to react to advertising information. refers to the decline in ad quality due to passage of time independent of the level of frequency. is the enhancement of ad quality during media hiatus as a consequence of viewers forgetting the details of the advertised messages, thus making ads appear “like new” when reintroduced later. The proposed model has the property that, when wearout effects are present, a strategy of pulsing is superior to <b>continuous</b> <b>advertising</b> even when the advertising response function is concave. This is illustrated by a numerical example that compares the total awareness generated by a single concentrated pulse of varying duration (blitz schedules) and <b>continuous</b> <b>advertising</b> (the even schedule). This property {{can be explained by the}} tension between the pressure to spend the fixed media budget quickly to avoid copy wearout and the opposing pressure to spread out the media spending over time to mitigate repetition wearout. The proposed model is empirically tested by using brand-level data from two advertising awareness tracking studies that also include the actual spending schedules. The first data set is for a major cereal brand, while the other is for a brand of milk chocolate. Such advertising tracking studies are now a common and popular means for evaluating advertising effectiveness in many markets (e. g., Millward Brown, MarketMind). In the empirical tests, the model parameters are estimated by using the Kalman filter procedure, which is eminently suited for dynamic models because it attends to the intertemporal dependencies in awareness build-up and decay via the use of conditional densities. The estimated parameters are statistically significant, have the expected signs, and are meaningful from both theoretical and managerial viewpoints. The proposed model fits both the data sets rather well and better than several well-known advertising models, namely, the Vidale-Wolfe, Brandaid, Litmus, and Tracker models, but not decisively better than the Nerlove-Arrow model. However, unlike the Nerlove-Arrow model, the proposed model yields different total awareness for different strategies of spending the same fixed budget, thus allowing media planners to discriminate among several media schedules. Given the empirical support for the model, the paper presents an implementable approach for utilizing it to evaluate large numbers of alternative media schedules and determine the best set of media schedules for consideration in media planning. This approach is based on an algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with the Kalman filter procedure. The paper presents the results of applying this approach in the case studies of the cereal and milk chocolate brands. The form of the best advertising spending strategies in each case was a pulsing strategy, and there were many schedules that were an improvement over the media schedule actually used in each campaign.

40|$|AMS subject classification: 90 B 60, 90 B 50, 90 A 80. Strategic {{behaviour}} {{has long}} been a crucial issue for modern corporations. To maximize potential profits and market share, firms are more than willing to invest in sales promotion to boost long term manufacturing output. Knowing that the sales of the firm not only respond to own advertising budgets, but also depend upon rivals’ advertising strategies, oligopolistic firms form part, therefore of a continuous race with reference to non-price competition. Efficient use of investment resources is crucial for business operations and long term strategic success. This paper aims to investigate the key issue of optimization of strategic advertising outlays. By using mathematical modelling techniques, strategic linkages between rival companies are identified and advertising impacts explained. Since advertising influences can persist through time, our discussion extends to explore this fundamental point by constructing a more advanced model to examine into the problems of optimization over time. Empirical data is used to test the predictive power of these models and assess relative efficiencies. All in all, this paper intends to highlight the importance of <b>continuous</b> strategic <b>advertising</b> investment and consequently provides comprehensive insights into the impact of modern advertising functions over time...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{approaches}} integrated advertising as {{a practice}} that is <b>continuous</b> with <b>advertising</b> history, rather than a phenomenon associated with new technologies. Competition for technology-enabled audiences in expanding media and entertainment markets is nonetheless {{an important factor in}} the turn to integrated advertising and marketing strategies in recent years. While integrated advertising provides solutions for advertisers, it is problematic for media consumers because it is not always distinguishable from surrounding program content and clearly identifiable as advertising. It creates opportunities for advertisers to fly below the radar of citizen and consumer awareness of commercial and political influences in media content, and for this reason has been constrained by regulation. Media regulators have come {{to play an important role}} in striking a balance between public and private interests in commercial media by setting and adjudicating the limits of integrated advertising practices. This chapter looks at how broadcasting regulators have responded to the challenges of regulating integrated advertising in commercial radio in three different territories (United States, United Kingdom and Australia). It draws attention to the ways in which integrated advertising simultaneously drives innovation in media genres and forms, as well as de-regulation of the influence exercised by advertisers in commercial media content...|$|R

Also, issues that have the potential to impact on optometric practices were contained in the questionnaire and these include medical aid, <b>advertising,</b> <b>continuous</b> professional development (CPD) and emigration. Of the 117 completed questionnaires, 55 % were from females and 45 % were from male practitioners. The respondents included 55 % Indians, 27 % Whites, 17 % Blacks and 1 % Coloureds. The majority of practices were located in urban areas (90 %) and rural areas (10 %), and were mostly independent (67 %) and franchises (33 %). Only a minority of the practices had major diagnostic equipment such as visual field analysers (33 %) and corneal topographers (7 %). A significant proportion of the practitioners reported not routinely performing non-contact tonometry (45 %) and slit lamp examination (41 %) respectively. The majority (95 %) rated patient’s needs as a very important factor in their decision to prescribe an optical device. A significant proportion (38 %) of the practices had annual patient bases of above 33 000, with 35 % having an average of 51 - 100 new patients per month. A few (5 %) practices reported gross monthly turnovers of above R 400 000, and 27 % reported turnovers of less than R 60 000. Many (89 %) derived 41 % and above of their total revenue from spectacle lens sales and 11 % derived 41 % and above from contact lens sales. The majority (92 %) of practices were contracted to over 60 % of the medical aid schemes. Many (68 %) reported that they were not negatively affected by medical aid fraud committed by their colleagues, however, a significant proportion (32 %) reported the converse.
