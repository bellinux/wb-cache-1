500|$|To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst {{they would}} return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up {{two days later}} without the mules, {{laughing}} at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had {{asked him if he}} had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, [...] "If you ever again follow us as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did, then you will have to fight anyway." [...] This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.|$|E
500|$|Cowboy Frank Patterson [...] "made {{some kind}} of a compromise" [...] with Captain Hurst, who persuaded the posse to withdraw, with the {{understanding}} that the mules would be returned. The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did, then you will have to fight anyway." [...] A month later, Earp ran into Frank and Tom McLaury in Charleston, and they told him if he ever followed them as he had done before, they would kill him.|$|E

2500|$|Time named [...] "Jigsaw Falling into Place" [...] {{the fifth}} best song of 2007.

2500|$|Zanac, in retrospect, {{has been}} {{considered}} a unique shoot 'em up game, combining gameplay elements from games such as Xevious, especially with the extensive power-up system and vertical-scrolling gameplay that features both air and ground targets. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame praised Zanac, calling it an extremely fast-paced shooter in which the player is almost completely surrounded by enemy ships and bullets. He praises the game for its music which seems to flow along with {{the action of the}} game; he calls the music [...] "at least as <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can get to a Zen moment while playing a shooting game on the NES". Frank Provo of GameSpot lauded Zanac for its difficulty level, its ability to handle many sprites on the screen without slowdown or other glitches, and its unique AI, which placed this game in a subgenre of its own. However, criticisms include mediocre and primitive music and sound, a steep learning curve in gameplay and difficulty level, and poor translation in the game itself and in the game's instruction manual. In addition, Weiss says that enemies in Zanac, while fearsome, [...] "don't have much personality".|$|E

This was planned to feature collaborations with former 3 Colours Red guitarist Chris McCormack, Ant's long-time songwriting partner Marco Pirroni, a member of Oasis (later identified as Andy Bell) and Morrissey's writing partner Boz Boorer. According to Ant, the album is a [...] "live record that lends itself to performance" [...] and will feature a [...] "kind of concept. It's a very old fashioned, old school, step-by-step album". In addition, Ant rerecorded a song in tribute to the late Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren, who died earlier that month, and who also once managed Adam & The Ants. Named Who's A Goofy Bunny Then?, the track was only previously available as a demo recorded in the early 1980s, but Ant {{said he wanted to}} release a new version in tribute to the late punk manager. [...] "Malcolm was a sort of mentor in my life" [...] he explained. [...] "As <b>close</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can get to a surrogate father." [...] The song took its name from a term of endearment bestowed upon McLaren by Ant – referring to his [...] "quite prominent teeth".|$|E
