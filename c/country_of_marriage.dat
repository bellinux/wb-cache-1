50|$|Because of how {{the power}} from state or {{territory}} to federal jurisdiction was conferred (see Section 51(xxxvii) of the Australian Constitution), de facto couples outside Australia {{are not covered by}} the Family Law Act. This is because there must be a nexus between the de facto couple and a state or territory, as the law can only be applied within a state or territory. See also R v Thomas.http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VSCA/2006/165.html a de facto couple moves out of an Australian state or territory they do not take the state or territory with them so the law cannot apply to them. The legal status and rights and obligations of the de facto or unmarried couple would then be recognised by the country's laws of where they are ordinarily resident. See the section on Family Court of Australia for further explanation on jurisdiction on de facto relationships.

This practice is virtually unknown in most other <b>countries</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and fortune-telling traditions.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the role of}} kin-networks for the functioning <b>of</b> modern societies: <b>countries</b> with strong extended families as characterized by a high level <b>of</b> cousin <b>marriages</b> exhibit a weak {{rule of law and}} are more likely autocratic. To assess causality, I exploit a quasi-natural experiment. In the early medieval ages the Church started to prohibit kin-marriages. Using the variation in the duration and extent of the Eastern and Western Churches' bans on consanguineous marriages as instrumental variables, reveals highly significant point estimates of the percentage <b>of</b> cousin <b>marriage</b> on an index of democracy. An additional novel instrument, cousin-terms, strengthens this point: the estimates are very similar and do not rest on the European experience alone. Exploiting within <b>country</b> variation <b>of</b> cousin <b>marriages</b> in Italy, as well as within variation <b>of</b> a 'societal <b>marriage</b> pressure' indicator for a larger set <b>of</b> <b>countries</b> support these results. These findings point to a causal effect <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> patterns on the proper functioning of formal institutions and democracy. The study further suggests that the Churches' marriage rules - by destroying extended kin-groups - led Europe on its special path of institutional and democratic development...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} {{problem is}} a subject which may be beyond my capacity {{to deal with in}} any authoritative manner but on account of its very importance the paper presented to the Society this evening may provoke serious attention from others more qualified than I am to interpret the significance of the figures and to suggest solutions to the problem as it affects this country.

40|$|Background : Research {{has shown}} that the {{prevalence}} of unmarried cohabitation has increased in most Latin American countries and that childbearing within consensual union, traditionally confined to low-income groups, is becoming socially acceptable among highly educated women. Objective : We focus on the increasing importance of childbearing within consensual union for overall fertility. We measure the relative contribution <b>of</b> births within <b>marriage</b> and births within consensual union to period fertility as a component of population change for 13 Latin American countries from 1980 to 2010. Methods : We use census data and the own-children method to estimate the contribution <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> and consensual union to age-specific fertility rates, to cumulative fertility, and to the TFR. Results : In most Latin American <b>countries</b> the contribution <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to age-specific fertility rates has decreased over time, whereas the contribution of consensual union has increased steadily. In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico the contribution <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to the TFR is still larger than the contribution of consensual union. In Ecuador and Uruguay they have become roughly similar. In Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela the contribution of consensual union to the TFR is larger than that <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> Conclusions : In Latin America, fertility, as a component of population change, is less and less related to marriage and increasingly linked to consensual union instead. Comments : We found that not only the contribution of births within consensual union, but also the contribution of out-of-union births to overall fertility has been increasing over time. This is a finding worth investigating further...|$|R

The hypothesis proposed here explains the delay, not so much in terms of limited interest of the Italian youth towards this type of union, but with the convenience of the children in the Mediterranean area to avoid choices which are openly clashing with the values of parents. cohabitation, Italy, strong family ties...|$|R
