40|$|In New Zealand the Richardson Report has {{recommended}} to government {{the adoption of}} a form of inflation accounting known as Current Cost Accounting (CCA). This paper reports research carried out to determine which of the traditional historical cost depreciation methods used in farm accounting might be most appropriate when adapted to a current cost basis. The <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> <b>depreciation</b> methods are compared {{on the basis of their}} ability to predict accurately actual replacement values for a survey sample of farm tractors and headers. The resultant measures of depreciation are compared with those currently allowable under New Zealand taxation laws, and the proposition that investment allowances on purchases of new machinery offset the inadequacies of historical cost depreciation is discussed.

40|$|More {{accurate}} {{valuation of}} fixed assets in the Balance Sheet and calculation of depreciation in current cost terms are aims of inflation accounting. This report demonstrates which of the commonly used traditional depreciation methods might best be adapted to measurement of fixed asset values and <b>current</b> <b>cost</b> <b>depreciation</b> under the guidelines established in the Richardson Report. Also, depreciation allowances and book values are compared for the proposed current cost methods and the present historical cost system. The comparison of methods (and rates) of depreciation was made using a cross-section of tractors and headers for which data was collected {{in a recent survey}} of New Zealand wheat growers. The best method and optimum rate of depreciation was defined on the basis of minimum sums of squares of errors (SSE) between assessed values and calculated book values. This approach attempts to reconcile the accounting and economic viewpoints with regard to measurement of depreciation. The use of standard depreciation formulae and indexed historical cost means that the results may be useful for accounting purposes. However, since depreciation is calculated by valuing assets first and then computing the depreciation, the approach conforms to economic theory...|$|E

40|$|Financial, economic, and {{biological}} {{data collected from}} cow-calf producers {{who participated in the}} Illinois and Iowa Standardized Performance Analysis (SPA) programs were used in this study. Data used were collected for the 1996 through 1999 calendar years, with each herd within year representing one observation. This resulted in a final database of 225 observations (117 from Iowa and 108 from Illinois) from commercial herds with a range in size from 20 to 373 cows. Two analyses were conducted, one utilizing financial cost of production data, the other economic cost of production data. Each observation was analyzed as the difference from the mean for that given year. The independent variable utilized in both the financial and economic models as an indicator of profit was return to unpaid labor and management per cow (RLM). Used as dependent variables were the five factors that make up total annual cow cost: feed <b>cost,</b> operating <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost,</b> capital charge, and hired labor, all on an annual cost per cow basis. In the economic analysis, family labor was also included. Production factors evaluated as dependent variables in both models were calf weight, calf price, cull weight, cull price, weaning percentage, and calving distribution. Herd size and investment were also analyzed. All financial factors analyzed were significantly correlated to RLM (P 3 ̆c. 10) except cull weight, and cull price. All economic factors analyzed were significantly correlated to RLM (P 3 ̆c. 10) except calf weight, cull weight and cull price. Results of the financial prediction equation indicate that there are eight measurements capable of explaining over 82 percent of the farm-to-farm variation in RLM. Feed cost is the overriding factor driving RLM in both the financial and economic stepwise regression analyses. In both analyses over 50 percent of the herd-to-herd variation in RLM could be explained by feed cost. Financial feed cost is correlated (P 3 ̆c. 001) to operating <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost,</b> and investment. Economic feed cost is correlated (P 3 ̆c. 001) with investment and operating cost, as well as capital charge. Operating <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation,</b> and capital charge were all negatively correlated (P 3 ̆c. 10) to herd size, and positively correlated (P 3 ̆c. 01) to feed cost in both analyses. Operating costs were positively correlated with capital charge and investment (P 3 ̆c. 01) in both analyses. In the financial regression model, <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost</b> was the second critical factor explaining almost 9 percent of the herd-to-herd variation in RLM followed by operating cost (5 percent). Calf weight had a greater impact than calf price on RLM in both the financial and economic regression models. Calf weight was the fourth indicator of RLM in the financial model and was similar in magnitude to operating cost. Investment was not a significant variable in either regression model; however, it was highly correlated to a number of the significant cost variables including feed <b>cost,</b> <b>depreciation</b> <b>cost,</b> and operating cost (P 3 ̆c. 001, financial; P 3 ̆c. 10, economic). Cost factors were far more influential in driving RLM than production, reproduction, or producer controlled marketing factors. Of these cost factors, feed cost had by far the largest impact. As producers focus attention on factors that affect the profitability of the operation, feed cost is the most critical control point because it was responsible for over 50 percent of the herd-to-herd variation in profit...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} {{analysis suggests}} that {{by reducing the}} real value of depreciation deductions based on historic-cost asset prices, inflation reduces the incentive to purchase depreciable plant and equipment. This analysis also suggests that the negative effects of inflation on investment will be greater for equipment than structure, and will vary according to different initial assumptions about real interest rates and asset purchase prices. Further, previous arguments indicate that increases in inflation uncertainty lead to reductions in business investment, brought about by increased hurdle rates, greater planning costs, and an overall slower rate of economic activity. This research is designed to supply data necessary to evaluate the importance of these factors as determinants of investment demand. From the data provided in this dissertation, four basic conclusions are identified. First, the empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that the decline in {{the real value of}} depreciation deductions brough about by inflation leads to a decline in real business investment. The data suggests that such effects are substantial, and that failure to account for the interaction of inflation and historic <b>cost</b> <b>depreciation</b> leads to incorrect predictions of investment demand. Second, the evidence in this dissertation supports the hypothesis that inflation leads to a much greater decline in equipment than structures investment. This result persists over a wide range of assumed economic conditions, indicating that the recent shift in the composition of business investment toward equipment is not explained by increases in inflation. Third, the data also confirm the hypothesis that the effects of inflation and historic <b>cost</b> <b>depreciation</b> on investment will vary over time. Changes in investment brought about by changes in inflation are jointly determined with real interest rates and asset purchase prices, and proper measurement of such effects is critically dependent on additional economic variables. Finally, the evidence obtained by this research confirms the hypothesis that inflation uncertainty is a significant determinant of investment demand. Although these effects are much smaller than the measured effects of inflation and historic <b>cost</b> <b>depreciation</b> on investment, they are nevertheless significant to the explanation of recent business investment behavior...|$|R

Indeed, the share value per dollar of pretax earnings actually fell from 10. 82 in 1967 to 6. 65 in 1976. The analysis here indicates that this inverse relation between higher inflation and lower share prices during the past decade was not due to chance or to other unrelated economic events. On the contrary, an important adverse effect of increased inflation on share prices results from basic features of the current U.
