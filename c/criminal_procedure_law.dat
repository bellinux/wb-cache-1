25|$|Under the {{provisions}} of Shari’a law as practiced in the country, judges may discount the testimony {{of people who are}} not practicing Muslims or who do not adhere to the official interpretation of Islam. Legal sources report that testimony by Shi’a is often ignored in courts of law or is deemed to have less weight than testimony by Sunnis. Sentencing under the legal system is not uniform. Laws and regulations state that defendants should be treated equally; however, under Shari’a as interpreted and applied in the country, crimes against Muslims may result in harsher penalties than those against non-Muslims. Information regarding government practices was generally incomplete because judicial proceedings usually were not publicized or were closed to the public, despite provisions in the <b>criminal</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>law</b> requiring court proceedings to be open.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to legal scholars, the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China had criticized the system. In {{light of the}} widespread disapproval of the system, HRIC called in 2001 for the system to be abolished entirely. [...] Among its criticisms it cited {{the fact that the}} wording of re-education through labor laws was excessively vague, allowing authorities to manipulate it; the fact that the punishment given in re-education centers was too severe for the crimes committed; the abusive conditions at re-education centers; and the variation of re-education through labor laws from one province to another. The Chinese Ministry of Justice, has also noted that the system violated items in the Chinese constitution. [...] Wang Gongyi, vice-director of the Institute of Justice Research affiliated to the Ministry of Justice, said that the re-education through labor system contradicts several items in the Constitution, the <b>Criminal</b> <b>Procedure</b> <b>Law,</b> and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China signed in 1998.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Lawyer {{profession}} as law enforcer was identical with the client. In doing the profession, lawyer was often having trouble, especially in confiscation by investigation officer which was ruled in Law Act section 19 verse (2) and section 38 verse (1) <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act. Method {{used by the}} writer was juridical normative. In its practice, lawyer rights and duty was often neglected by the other law enforcer that cause conflict between law enforcer, especially between lawyer and investigation officer. Confiscation in <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>procedure</b> was allowed to give a wide authority and make the investigation officer more effective in doing investigation and examination before a case proposed in trial. But in the other side, it was a contradiction with lawyer’s duty which was ruled by Act No. 18 / 2003 about Lawyer. It was also a contradiction with section 28 G Constitution 1945 with section 38 verse (1) <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act. If the section 19 verse (2) <b>Criminal</b> <b>Law</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act couldn’t reveal the conflict between investigation officer and lawyer in client’s document confiscation process, since section 28 G Constitution 1945 ruled the rights of every person to get protection as an individual, things or document from confiscation. But in its practice, lawyer was often faced trouble which {{was caused by the}} conflict with investigation officer which the duty related with <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>procedure</b> act ruled about confiscation in section 38 verse (1). If the section was conflicted, there could be used lex specialis derogate lex generalis principle where there should be a judicial review to <b>criminal</b> <b>law</b> <b>procedure</b> act...|$|R
