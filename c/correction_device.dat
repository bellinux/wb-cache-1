40|$|Adolescent {{idiopathic}} scoliosis is characterised by an S- or C-shaped {{lateral deviation}} of the spine, an axial {{rotation of the}} vertebrae, and a flattening of the sagittal curvature. Present surgical therapy brings several disadvantages like fusion of the involved vertebrae and the necessity to wait with surgery {{until the end of}} the growth of the patient. Therefore, a non-fusion scoliosis <b>correction</b> <b>device</b> is being developed in which the disadvantages of present systems are reduced. Furthermore, this device should correct the deformity in all three anatomical planes and should allow growth of the patient.

40|$|The {{biocompatibility}} and functionality {{of a new}} scoliosis <b>correction</b> <b>device,</b> {{based on}} {{the properties of the}} shape-memory metal nickel-titanium alloy, were studied. With this device, the shape recovery forces of a shape-memory metal rod are used to achieve a gradual three-dimensional scoliosis correction. In the experimental study the action of the now device was inverted: the device was used to induce a scoliotic curve instead of correcting one. Surgical procedures were performed in six pigs. An originally curved squared rod, in the cold condition, was straightened and fixed to the spine with pedicle screws. Peroperatively, the memory effect of the rod was activated by heating the rod to 50 degreesC by a low-voltage, high-frequency current. After 3 and after 6 months the animals were sacrificed. The first radiographs, obtained immediately after surgery, showed in all animals an induced curve of about 40 degrees Cobb angle - the original curve of the rod. This curve remained constant during the follow-up. The postoperative serum nickel measurements were around the detection limit, and were not significantly higher compared to the preoperative nickel concentration. Macroscopic inspection after 3 and 6 months showed that the device was almost overgrown with newly formed bone. Corrosion and fretting processes were not observed. Histologic examination of the sections of the surrounding tissues and sections of the lung, liver, spleen and kidney showed no evidence of a foreign body response. In view of the initiation of the scoliotic deformation, it is expected that the shape-memory metal based scoliosis <b>correction</b> <b>device</b> also has the capacity to correct a scoliotic curve. Moreover, it is expected that the new device will show good biocompatibility in clinical application.

Validation of the computational {{fluid dynamics}} results was done by comparing then with flow parameters measured in a 1 : 5 scale model of the first pass header in the laboratory. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to establish hydrodynamic similarity between the 1 : 5 scale and full scale models of the first pass header. It was found that the erosion-corrosion damage seen at the tubesheet of the first pass header was a consequence of increased levels of turbulence at the tubesheet caused by a rapidly turning flow. A prismatic flow <b>corrections</b> <b>device</b> introduced in the past helped in rectifying the problem at the tubesheet but exaggerated the erosion-corrosion problem at the first pass header shell. A number of alternative flow <b>correction</b> <b>devices</b> were tested using computational fluid dynamics.

Computational fluid dynamics simulations have revealed a smooth orderly low turbulence flow pattern in the second, third and fourth pass as well as the exit headers where no erosion-corrosion was seen in practice. This study has confirmed that near-wall turbulence intensity, which can be successfully predicted by using computational fluid dynamics, is a good hydrodynamic predictor of erosion-corrosion damage in complex geometries.

40|$|Real-time {{detection}} of gait events {{can be applied}} as a reliable input to control drop foot <b>correction</b> <b>devices</b> and lower-limb prostheses. Among the different sensors used to acquire the signals associated with walking for gait event detection, the accelerometer is considered as a preferable sensor due to its convenience of use, small size, low cost, reliability, and low power consumption. Based on the acceleration signals, different algorithms have been proposed to detect toe off (TO) and heel strike (HS) gait events in previous studies. While these algorithms could achieve a relatively reasonable performance in gait event detection, they suffer from limitations such as poor real-time performance and are less reliable {{in the cases of}} up stair and down stair terrains. In this study, a new algorithm is proposed to detect the gait events on three walking terrains in real-time based on the analysis of acceleration jerk signals with a time-frequency method to obtain gait parameters, and then the determination of the peaks of jerk signals using peak heuristics. The performance of the newly proposed algorithm was evaluated with eight healthy subjects when they were walking on level ground, up stairs, and down stairs. Our experimental results showed that the mean F 1 scores of the proposed algorithm were above 0. 98 for HS event detection and 0. 95 for TO event detection on the three terrains. This indicates that the current algorithm would be robust and accurate for gait event detection on different terrains.
