40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{revocable}} and decentralized attribute-based encryption (ABE) system that splits {{the task of}} decryption key generation across multiple attribute authorities (AAs) without requiring any central party such that it achieves attribute revocation by simply stopping updating of the corresponding private key. In our system, a party can easily behave as an AA by creating a public and private key pair without any global communication except the creation for the <b>common</b> <b>system</b> <b>parameters,</b> under which it can periodically issue/update private key components for users that reflect their attributes, and an AA can freely leave the system once its corresponding attribute is revoked without communication with other AAs. In addition, to revoke a user, those AAs that have issued private keys to this user easily cease the key updating process for the user without affecting other AAs 2 ̆ 7 execution. For the construction of our system, the technical barrier is to make private keys collusion resistant. Since in our system each component of a user 2 ̆ 7 s private key at a time period may come from different AAs {{and there is no}} coordination between these AAs, traditional technique of binding together different components (issued by different AAs) of a private key by randomization cannot be employed. To overcome this, we tie the key components together and prevent collusion attacks between different users by embedding distinct identifiers and a commonly shared time attribute in these components...|$|E

We focus on estimates of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the life cycle of electricity generation from conventionally produced natural gas in combustion turbines (NGCT) and combined-cycle (NGCC) systems.

40|$|The use of {{variable}} primary flow pumping in chilled water systems is increasing {{due to its}} perceived potential to reduce energy consumption and initial cost. Neither {{the conditions under which}} significant energy savings are realized nor the likely magnitude of savings are well documented. To address this deficiency, a program of simulations was conducted that compared variable primary flow system energy use with that of other <b>common</b> <b>system</b> types. <b>Parameters</b> varied included load type, number of chillers in the central plant, temperature difference vs. part load characteristics, and climate. Results of these simulations show that for systems without temperature differential problems substantial reductions in chilled water pumping energy are possible. However, this benefit decreases as the number of chillers increases. The reduction in annual pumping energy due to variable primary flow is generally between 25 and 50 percent. Relative to total plant energy use, this is a reduction of 2 to 5 percent...|$|R
40|$|Complete scene {{description}} {{by using}} terrestrial LIDAR systems usually requires multiple scans from different stations. Point cloud of each scan is associated {{to its own}} coordinate system on a station basis. Therefore, before all the scans can be registered onto a <b>common</b> coordinate <b>system,</b> the <b>parameters</b> of transformation between different coordinate systems have to be first established. In this study, the authors investigate the functional and stochastic models of employing point, line, and plane features {{as a means for}} estimating the 3 D spatial similarity transformation parameters. In addition, a feature extractor that collects three types of features, if existing, has been developed and used providing observations for feature matching and transformation parameter estimation among all scans. Depending on the scene geometry, each one of the features can be exclusively used or combined features are involved in estimating transformation parameters. The experiments show that the feature-based approach actually offers high degree of flexibility and renders high accuracy for the task of registering terrestrial LIDAR point clouds...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to provide a}} {{computer}} program that is able to analyze time series of high-resolution spectra of double-lined spectroscopic eclipsing binaries to derive the stellar and <b>system</b> <b>parameters</b> of their components and to apply the program to spectra of oEA stars. We analyzed time-series of high-resolution spectra of the two brightest oEA stars (i. e., Algol-type eclipsing binaries with oscillating primary components) RZCas and TWDra using the KOREL program (orbital solutions + decomposed spectra of the binary components), the SynthV program (spectral analysis of the decomposed spectra), and the newly developed Shellspec 07 _inverse program (optimized stellar parameters from composite line profiles at all orbital phases). The results show {{that it is possible to}} derive the stellar and <b>system</b> <b>parameters</b> of the two target stars spectroscopically with an accuracy that is comparable to that obtained from the light curve analysis. We assume that the secondary of RZCas shows a large dark spot on its surface pointing toward the primary, presumably originating from a cooling mechanism by the enthalpy transport via the inner Lagrangian point. Both stars have been observed during two different epochs. In 2007 and 2008, the TWDra system can be well modeled without including any Algol-typical effects like a gas stream or an accretion annulus into the calculations. We conclude that it was in a quiet state during both years. The same result was obtained for RZCas when observed in 2006. The O-C residuals of our solution based on the spectra from 2001 show a complex distribution of circumbinary matter, however, pointing to the occurrence of an episode of rapid mass transfer. This assumption is supported by the deduced change of the orbital period of RZCas of 2 seconds between the two epochs of observations that can be explained in terms of angular momentum transfer between the accelerated rotation of the outer layers of the primary and the orbit. A first attempt to include the calculation of line profile variations due to non-radial pulsations into Shellspec 07 _inverse gave encouraging results. We could derive some <b>common</b> relationships between <b>system</b> <b>parameters</b> and the pulsation characteristics of the primary and show that the Shellspec 07 _inverse program can be used for a future mode identification based on radial velocity measurements...|$|R

Our algorithm considers the dynamic nature of the environment such as changes on the available energy and adapts <b>system</b> <b>parameters</b> such as the operating voltage, frequency, and the number of processors. In our algorithm, we divide the power management problem into three sub-problems: initial power allocation, <b>system</b> <b>parameter</b> computation based on the allocated power, and dynamic update of the power and <b>system</b> <b>parameters</b> at run time. Initial power allocation minimizes wasted energy by using extra energy for useful work. It also avoids the undersupplied power situation by reducing power usage before such situations happen.
