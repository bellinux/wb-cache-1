40|$|In a {{study of}} groups of {{patients}} with atopic (extrinsic) asthma, non-atopic (intrinsic) asthma, and chronic bronchitis, no difference could be detected in the numbers having precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae compared to suitably matched control subjects. Precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Haemophilus influenzae, demonstrated in this investigation by double diffusion in agar gel, were found much more frequently in patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>mucopurulent</b> or obstructive <b>bronchitis</b> (50 %) than in either asthmatic subjects (6 %) or normal controls (6 %) (P = less than 0. 0005). While the precipitating antibody demonstrated in these patients against the extracts of Str. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus was in the IgG class alone, IgM and IgA antibody were detected against the species specific but not the non-species specific antigens of H. influenzae. These results underline the importance of H. influenzae as an infecting agent in chronic bronchitis and suggest that the finding of precipitins against the species specific H 1 and H 2 antigens of this bacterium denotes infection either concurrently or in the recent past. There {{is no evidence to}} suggest from this study that infection with Staph. aureus, Str. pneumoniae or H. influenzae is any more common in asthmatics as a group compared to controls or between patients with the non-atopic (intrinsic) and atopic (extrinsic) form of the disease...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBronchiolitis obliterans, an {{irreversible}} lung disease, {{was first}} associated with inhalation of butter flavorings (diacetyl) in workers at a microwave popcorn company. Excess rates of lung-function abnormalities {{were related to}} cumulative diacetyl exposure. Because information on potential excess mortality would support development of permissible exposure limits for diacetyl, we investigated respiratory-associated mortality during 200022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2011 among current and former workers at this company who had exposure to flavorings and participated in cross-sectional surveys conducted between 200022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2003. MethodsWe ascertained workers' vital status through a Social Security Administration search. Causes of death were abstracted from death certificates. Because bronchiolitis obliterans is not coded in the International Classification of Disease 10 th revision (ICD- 10), we identified respiratory mortality decedents with ICD- 10 codes J 4022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cJ 44 which encompass bronchitis (J 40), simple and <b>mucopurulent</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>bronchitis</b> (J 41), unspecified chronic bronchitis (J 42), emphysema (J 43), and other {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) (J 44). We calculated expected number of deaths and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) with 95...|$|R
40|$|Mucociliary {{clearance}} {{depends on}} the interaction between cilia and mucus; it is delayed {{in the presence of}} purulent secretions. Nasal mucociliary clearance was examined by the saccharin method and nasal ciliary beat frequency by a photometric technique. Four groups were studied: normal controls, patients with bronchiectasis without nasal symptoms, patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>mucopurulent</b> sinusitis alone, and patients with <b>chronic</b> <b>mucopurulent</b> sinusitis and bronchiectasis. Nasal mucociliary clearance was prolonged in infected patients. Cilia obtained from the site of purulent secretions were found to beat more slowly in vitro (mucopurulent sinusitis 12. 1 Hz, mucopurulent sinusitis and bronchiectasis 11. 6 Hz), than those obtained from normal controls (14. 3 Hz) and from patients with bronchiectasis alone (13. 6 Hz). The cause of the ciliary slowing seemed most likely to be the release of host factors during the inflammatory response, rather than the particular organism isolated. Ciliary slowing may contribute to the observed delay of mucociliary clearance in conditions in which purulent secretions are present...|$|R
40|$|Two {{patients}} are described with clinical and radiographic bronchiectasis which occurred after allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} for haematological malignancy. Both had evidence of chronic graft versus host disease in other organs. Increased immunosuppression with corticosteroids resulted in clinical response, although both patients persisted with <b>chronic</b> <b>mucopurulent</b> sputum production and one had progressive airflow obstruction. Bronchiectasis may be an under-recognised manifestation of chronic graft versus host disease of the lung. ...|$|R
40|$|Aim: There are new {{publications}} {{stating that}} chronic infection may facilitate dysplastic changes and persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) -DNA positivity. Frequency of this coincidence and cervical cytological and pathological examination results were investigated {{in patients with}} chronic vaginal discharge. Methods: One hundred three patients, who were treated at least 3 times for <b>chronic</b> <b>mucopurulent</b> discharge with accessible HPV DNA results, were analyzed retrospectively. Risk factors were identified for HPV DNA positivity. HPV DNA positive-patients {{were divided into two}} groups (positive and negative) according to the presence and absence of HPV DNA. The results of cytopatological and histopathological examinations and risk factors were compared between the two groups. Results: The mean age of the patients was 35 ± 9 years. Sixty-four percent of the patients were positive for HPV DNA. Of the HPV DNA positive patients, 41...|$|R
40|$|A {{five year}} old Swiss Warmblood gelding was {{presented}} with unilateral, <b>chronic,</b> <b>mucopurulent</b> nasal discharge. Clinical, radiographic and computertomographic examinations showed a mass in the ventral meatus of the nasal cavity. The mass had connection {{to the root of}} the fourth premolar tooth. During surgery, the fourth premolar tooth and the mass were completely removed. A rectangular bone flap of the maxillary bone was performed {{to gain access to the}} apex of the tooth. The fourth premolar tooth had to be repelled initially before the neoplasia could be isolated and removed through the surgical approach. The large opening between the oral and the nasal cavities was closed with a silicon-dental packing. The histologic examination of the neoplastic tissue revealed an ostelipoma. Eight weeks later the silicon-plug was removed orally. Four months after the surgery the horse was presented again with an unilateral, purulent nasal discharge. In the mean time a fistula developed between the oral cavity and the maxillary sinus. Clinically as well as radiographically the patient exhibited all the signs of a chronic sinusitis of the maxillary and frontal sinus. In a second surgery the fistula was closed with a methylmethacrylat-plug. After another 2 months the horse {{was presented with}}out any complications. The methylmetacrylat-packing was removed 3 months later...|$|R

40|$|The {{isolation}} and characterization of a mucoid, alginate-producing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from a nonhuman host, namely, in chondroids from an equine guttural pouch, is {{reported for the}} first time. Pure cultures of P. aeruginosa 12534 were isolated from a 17 -month-old pony mare {{with a history of}} <b>chronic</b> bilateral <b>mucopurulent</b> nasal discharge from the right guttural pouch. Transmission electron microscopy of chondroids showed mucoid P. aeruginosa growing as microcolonies within a matrix of extracellular material. On the basis of expression of the mucoid phenotype under different growth conditions, P. aeruginosa 12534 belongs to group 1 and resembles other isolates carrying the muc- 23 mutation. The bulk of the extracellular material was characterized as being alginate by chemical and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, which showed that it had a composition similar to that produced by isolates of P. aeruginosa from human patients with cystic fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Senior seminar (D. V. M.) [...] Cornell University, 2004. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 9). A 10 year old, male castrated mixed {{breed dog}} {{was referred to}} the Medicine Service at Cornell University for <b>chronic</b> unilateral <b>mucopurulent</b> nasal discharge, elevated liver enzymes, and gastrointestinal signs. The dog was being treated by the referring veterinarian with itraconazole for presumptive nasal aspergillosis. The itraconazole was discontinued after liver enzymes {{were found to be}} elevated and when the patient started showing decreased appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. At Cornell University, a computed tomography (CT) scan performed previously by the referring veterinarian was reviewed and rhinoscopy was performed which revealed moderate to severe turbinate loss in the right nasal cavity and many plaques in the right frontal sinus. Culture and histopathology of samples taken during rhinoscopy were diagnostic for nasal aspergillosis. Noninvasive intranasal infusion of clotrimazole was performed which resulted in the resolution of clinical signs. Dr. Richard Goldstein, Dr. Alejandro Aguirr...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{cytology}} {{was performed}} in nasal secretions of normal control (NC), seasonal allergic rhinitis in season (SAR), perennial allergic rhinitis (PAR), chronic sinusitis with mucoid secretion (MS), and <b>chronic</b> sinusitis with <b>mucopurulent</b> secretion (MPS). The majority of inflammatory cells were neutrophils in NC, MS, and MPS; the majority were eosinophils in SAR and PAR. The concomitant appearance of inflammatory cells in nasal secretions was found, i. e., there were significant correlations between neutrophil and eosinophil counts in MPS, and between eosinophil and basophil counts in SAR. The eosinophil/neutrophil ratio was more than 0. 1 in SAR and PAR, but the ratio was less than 0. 1 in all NC, all MPS, and in 93 % of MS; this indicates that 0. 1 in eosinophil/neutrophil ratio is the critical value between allergic and nonallergic nasal diseases...|$|R
40|$|Bronchiectasis is {{a chronic}} lung disease, defined pathologically as {{irreversible}} dilatation of the bronchi. The clinical {{course of the}} disease is chronic and progressive and in most cases, causes lung damage over many years. There is usually an initial event, which causes impairment of mucociliary clearance of the bronchial tree. The respiratory tract becomes colonized by bacteria that inhibit the ciliary function and promote further lung damage. The hallmark of bronchiectasis, is a <b>chronic</b> cough with <b>mucopurulent</b> or purulent sputum, lasting for months to years and may progress to chronic respiratory failure. Diagnosis of bronchiectasis is suspected {{on the basis of}} clinical manifestations. In order to confirm the diagnosis and underlying causes, appropriate investigations must be performed. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, appropriate investigations and management of bronchiectasis...|$|R
40|$|A 13 {{year old}} Thoroughbred mare {{presented}} to the Cornell University Equine Hospital for evaluation of <b>chronic</b> bilateral <b>mucopurulent</b> nasal discharge. She was purchased by the current owner from a sale in 8 months before presentation {{and at that time}} had a unilateral serous nasal discharge. The discharge was responsive to antibiotics but would return after medication was discontinued. The discharge progressed to a mucopurulent discharge that became unresponsive to treatment and also became bilateral. The primary veterinarian performed airway endoscopy and sinus radiography that revealed narrowed airways with a mass like lesion in the sinuses. She was referred to Cornell for repeat endoscopy and a CT scan with possible surgical correction of the chronic sinus disease. Upon presentation she was bright, alert and responsive with vital parameters within normal limits. Physical exam revealed bilateral mucopurulent discharge, facial swelling over the left maxillary sinus and stertor. Airflow was decreased through her nasal passages and the left side appeared to be most severely affected. Airway endoscopy revealed swelling of the sinus that was partially obstructing the nasal passage. Large amounts of mucoid discharge were predominant on the left side. A CT revealed a fluid/soft tissue opacity within all the paranasal sinuses on the left and well as the rostral maxillary, ventral conchal and small amounts in the conchofrontal on the right. This case report will discuss the etiology, treatment and prognosis of mucopurulent bilateral nasal discharge with a bilateral frontal sinusotomy in a 13 year old mare...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{remains a}} major health {{problem in the}} Sudan and {{a leading cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality. Early diagnosis and correct treatment are the mainstay for the control of the disease. The present study aimed to evaluate fluorescence microscopy (FM) in the detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum and to compare the results to light microscopy using ZN stained smear and culture in addition to a serological method (ELISA using 38 kd antigen). Another aim {{of the study was to}} determine the sensitivity and specificity of ELISA and to compare the results with those obtained by direct microscopy (light, and fluorescent). A descriptive study was carried out in 233 patients with clinical features suggestive of TB (fever, <b>chronic</b> cough, <b>mucopurulent</b> sputum, loss of weight, night sweat, and haemoptysis), who reported to Abou-Anja Chest Hospital (Omdurman) between the period from June 2002 up to October 2003, were included. Sputum samples were collected from all the patients and studied by bacteriological methods including FM, ZN and culture. In addition, a venous blood sample (5 ml) was obtained from each patient; serum was separated and tested with ELISA for the detection of IgG antibodies against 38 kd antigen. Blood samples were also collected from healthy controls at the Blood Bank, Khartoum Teaching Hospital. 81 (35 %) cases were positive by ZN method,while the FM method detected 93 (40 %) positive cases. The culture technique showed 75 (32 %) positive cases; in 69 (92 %) of those cases the growth of 6 M. tuberculosis was confirmed by growing the organism on TCH media. In the other 6 (8 %) culture positive samples, growth similar to M. bovis and M. africanum was observed but more investigations were needed to determine the species. As compared to culture and ZN the FM showed a sensitivity of 80. 6 % and 75. 3 %, respectively. Statistical analysis showed that FM was more sensitive than ZN and culture (P= 0. 0001). The ELlSA was positive in 103 (44. 2 %) of the studied cases. The sensitivity of the test - as compared to ZN, FM, and culture -was 48. 5 %, 49. 5 % and 42. 7, respectively. The ELISA was less sensitive than ZN staining method (P= 0. 0001), FM (P= 0. 01) culture (P= 0. 003). The specificity of ELISA was 82 % as compared to apparently health controls. However, in 53 of the ELISA positive cases who were negative by ZN, the culture was positive in 8 cases. In addition, the culture was positive in 5 of the 52 cases, who were ELISA positive but FM negative. In view of the results obtained in the present study it can be concluded that FM is more sensitive than ZN staining method and culture in the detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum samples for the diagnosis of PTB. Accordingly the FM is recommended to be included in the routine diagnosis of PTB in ZN stained smear negative cases. In spite of the low sensitivity of ELISA the test can still be useful in the diagnosis of TB in some cases in whom bacteriological diagnosis can not be confirmed. The test may also be helpful in the diagnosis of the disease in patients in whom sputum sample cannot be obtained...|$|R
