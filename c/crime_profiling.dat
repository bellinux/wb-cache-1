40|$|Abstract- Crimes cause {{terror and}} cost our society dearly in several ways. Data mining {{can be used}} to model <b>crime</b> <b>profiling.</b> Here we look at use of {{clustering}} algorithm for a data mining approach to analyze the crimes patterns. We will look at k-means clustering to aid in the process of <b>crime</b> <b>profiling.</b> We applied these techniques to primary crime data from Delhi police first information report (FIR) records. In this paper, firstly we desire to estimate which type of crime is dominant in Delhi city, India. Accordingly crime is divided into three types heinous crime, non-heinous crime and special & local laws violation. Second estimation is to find which area categories are more sensitive towards, areas categories which are considered are slums, residential, commercial, VIP zones, travel points and markets. Third is to show distributions of each crime type in every area category...|$|E

40|$|With {{the massive}} amount of crime data {{generated}} daily, this has put law enforcement under intensive stress. This means that law enforcement has to compete against the time to solve crime. In addition, the focus of crime investigation has been expanded from the ability to catch the criminals towards the ability to act before a crime happens (i. e pre-crime). Given such situation, creation of crime profiles {{is very important to}} law enforcement, especially in understanding the behaviours of criminals and identifying the characteristics of similar crimes. In fact, crime profiles could be used to solve similar crimes and thus pre-crime action could be conducted. In this paper, a brain inspired conceptual model is proposed and a structurally adaptive neural network is deployed for its implementation. Subsequently, the proposed model is applied for the identification and presentation of multi-view crime patterns. Such multi-view crime patterns could be useful for the construction of crime profiles. Moreover, the suitability of the proposed model in <b>crime</b> <b>profiling</b> is discussed and demonstrated through some experimental results. <br /...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{three main}} areas and develops {{a conceptual framework}} for identity fraud profiling. First, we identify the main contemporary profiling methods that are crime and/or business based. Second, accepting the current information systems (IS) facilitated attack channels and methods used by identity crime perpetrators (Jamieson & Stephens & Winchester 2007), we investigate how to best profile identity crime/fraud perpetrators. Here we are guided by relevant components of current business and <b>crime</b> <b>profiling</b> techniques. Second, analysis of interview data from industry and government agency participants was carried out using a modified grounded theoretical approach and concept mapping. Third, we consider, what identity fraud profiling systems target victim organisations might use and implement. We provide a definition for identity fraud profiling grounded from expert interviews, and based on profiling and identity crime literature. The major contributions of this paper are formation of an identity fraud profiling definition, construction of a profiling classification taxonomy, and development of an identity fraud profiling conceptual framework. This also involves providing {{an understanding of the}} framework's main elements, their relationships and application to identity fraud profiling. This framework will be useful to law enforcement, industry organisations, and government agencies when fighting to deter, detect, and prevent identity crime. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Most {{text mining}} {{techniques}} {{have been proposed}} only for English text, and even here, most {{research has been conducted}} on specific texts related to special contexts within the English language, such as politics, medicine and crime. In contrast, although Arabic is a widely spoken language, few mining tools have been developed to process Arabic text, and some Arabic domains have not been studied at all. In fact, Arabic is a language with a very complex morphology because it is highly inflectional l, and therefore, dealing with texts written in Arabic is highly complicated. This research studies the crime domain in the Arabic language, exploiting unstructured text using text mining techniques. Developing a system for extracting important information from crime reports would be useful for police investigators, for accelerating the investigative process (instead of reading entire reports) as well as for conducting further or wider analyses. We propose the <b>Crime</b> <b>Profiling</b> System (CPS) to extract crime-related information (crime type, crime location and nationality of persons involved in the event), automatically construct dictionaries for the existing information, cluster crime documents based on certain attributes and utilize visualisation techniques to assist in crime data analysis. The proposed information extraction approach is novel, and it relies on computational linguistic techniques to identify the abovementioned information, i. e. without using predefined dictionaries (e. g. lists of location names) and annotated corpus. The language used in crime reporting is studied to identify patterns of interest using a corpus-based approach. Frequency analysis, collocation analysis and concordance analysis are used to perform the syntactic analysis in order to discover the local grammar. Moreover, the Self Organising Map (SOM) approach is adopted in order to perform the clustering and visualisation tasks for crime documents based on crime type, location or nationality. This clustering technique is improved because only refined data containing meaningful keywords extracted through the information extraction process are inputted into it, i. e. the data is cleaned by removing noise. As a result, a huge reduction in the quantity of data fed into the SOM is obtained, consequently, saving memory, data loading time and the execution time needed to perform the clustering. Therefore, the computation of the SOM is accelerated. Finally, the quantization error is reduced, which leads to high quality clustering. The outcome of the clustering stage is also visualised and the system is able to provide statistical information in the form of graphs and tables about crimes committed within certain periods of time and within a particular area.

40|$|Profiling is {{important}} in law enforcement, especially in understanding the behaviours of criminals {{as well as the}} characteristics and similarities in crimes. It could provide insights to law enforcement officers when solving similar crimes and more importantly for pre-crime action, which is to act before crimes happen. Usually a single case captures data from the crime scene, offenders, etc. and therefore could be termed as multi-modality in data sources and subsequently has resulted a complex data fusion problem. Traditional criminal profiling requires experienced and skillful crime analysts or psychologists to laboriously associate and fuse multi-modal crime data. With the ubiquitous usage of digital data in crime and forensic records, law enforcement has also encountered the issue of big data. In addition, law enforcement professionals are always competing against crime in solving crimes and facing constant pressures. Therefore, it is necessary to have a computational approach that could assist in reducing the time and efforts spent for the laborious fusion process in <b>profiling</b> multi-modal <b>crime</b> data. Besides obtaining the demographics, physical characteristics and the behaviours of criminals, a <b>crime</b> <b>profile</b> should also comprise of crime statistics and trends. In fact, <b>crime</b> and criminal <b>profiles</b> are highly interrelated and both are required in order to provide a holistic analysis. In this chapter, our approach proposes the fusion of multiple sources of crime data to populate a holistic <b>crime</b> <b>profile</b> through the use of Growing Self Organising Maps (GSOM) ...|$|R

40|$|Crime is {{distributed}} unevenly, a phenomenon commonplace at both areal and individual (personal or household) level.

This paper describes the <b>crime</b> <b>profile</b> of offenders at the defining moment of their first criminal conviction. Using the six birth cohorts derived from the Offenders Index, changes over time are considered in two ways: changes within a birth cohort and changes between birth cohorts. There are considerable changes in the patterns of offending over time, with important gender differences. Three offence categories of burglary, robbery and violence, and drugs are considered in detail. Burglary has an age effect over time. Robbery and violence seem to have a significant cohort effect, while drugs offences show some evidence of a period effect...|$|R

40|$|As {{the global}} {{population}} continues to grow, {{more and more}} people are moving into urban areas. This rise in urban density is leading to rising crime rates in many of the world’s metropolitan areas, although research shows that there is a high degree of cross-city variance of crime rates across U.

The Boise City-Nampa area has been one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States given the high quality of life and business opportunities that the Treasure Valley has to offer. Even with substantial population growth, the Boise area has seen a decline in crime rates over the past ten years.

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{cybercrime}} is rising up, time and accuracy in digital forensic become more complex to handle.

Existing tools like EnCase or DataAccess could tackle the complexity of new technologies by adding scripts which also allow some automation. But those are not built to face large amount of information in restricted amount of time. During the investigation there is always the same tasks to do. In addition each crime has a pattern. So common pattern where found for the same type of crime. The idea is to build a module that take advantage from the common pattern to automate the analysing process of evidence.

Until now, in Brazil, few studies addressed factors related to mental health in incarcerated women, especially concerning cultural variables such as religion and religiosity. The objective of this study was to verify the mental health profile and the relation between religion and the prevalence of possible mental disorders in a sample of incarcerated women from São Paulo (SP), Brazil. Methods: Three hundred fifty-eight women were interviewed in Penitenciária Feminina da Capital. A questionnaire was used which included demographic, sociocultural, religious (present and before jailing), mental health and <b>crime</b> <b>profile</b> data. For screening possible psychiatric disorders the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) was used. Descriptive and bivaried statistics analysis was accomplished comparing independent variables with the GHQ- 12 scores. Multivariable regression logistic analysis was used to identify variables that would possibly interact with GHQ- 12 scores. Results: Mean age of the sample was 30. 7 ± 8. 5 years. The overall prevalence for possible psychiatric case was 26. 6 %. Conclusions: A higher level of personal religiosity was associated to lower prevalence of possible mental disorders. Associations between crime type and mental health were not found...|$|R
