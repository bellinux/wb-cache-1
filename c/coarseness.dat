As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders {{of this type of}} sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in <b>coarseness</b> between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E

25|$|After its peak, gin {{consumption}} rapidly declined. From eighteen {{million gallons}} in 1743, it dropped {{to just over}} seven million gallons in 1751 and to less than two million by 1758, and generally declined {{to the end of}} the century. A number of factors appear to have converged to discourage consumption of gin. These include the production of higher quality beer of lower price, rising corn prices and taxes which eroded the price advantage of gin, a temporary ban on distilling, an increasing criticism of drunkenness, a newer standard of behavior that criticized <b>coarseness</b> and excess, increased tea and coffee consumption, an increase in piety and increasing industrialization with a consequent emphasis on sobriety and labor efficiency.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} quench rate on the {{microstructural}} and mechanical behaviour is assessed in this paper. Two common commercial aluminium foundry alloys, A 356 and A 354, are investigated.

Measurements of electrical conductivity have been conducted in order to indicate the sequences of precipitation formations. To optimise the precipitation hardening effect, {{it is essential to}} understand the quench sensitivity. It can be concluded that the quench rate significantly influences the mechanical properties; the tensile strength and strength coefficient are enhanced with an increase in quench rate. The ductility instead increases with a reduced quench rate, which might be due to the more ductile α-Al matrix with corresponding coarsening and reduced level of hardening precipitates...|$|R

Though speaking somewhat tongue-in-cheek, Hazlitt rises to Caliban's defence: [...] "Caliban is so far from being a prototype of modern Jacobinism, that he is strictly the legitimate sovereign of the isle". Hazlitt did not necessarily believe that Caliban deserved to supplant Prospero as ruler, but he shows that Caliban's very existence raises questions about the fundamental nature of sovereignty, justice, and society itself. As noted by David Bromwich, Coleridge found reasons to apologise for society as it was. Hazlitt, on the other hand, refused to take sides, leaving as open questions the issues that emerged in the play.

500|$|According to David E. E. Sloane, [...] "most American critics {{found it}} harder to {{overlook}} the <b>coarseness</b> {{of the book and}} its treatment of the labor problem." [...] A reviewer for Literary World in January 1884 called The Bread-Winners a [...] "greasy, slangy, malodorous book... repulsive from the very first step". The Dial, the following month, praised the author's use of language but deemed the book [...] "a preposterous tissue of incidents" [...] populated by two sets of [...] "exaggerated types", one vicious, the other absurd. [...] Continent, also in February 1884, suggested that [...] "the criticisms as a whole are severe, and justly so, the book being, with all its brilliancy, faithless and hopeless." [...] The Springfield Republic suggested that the author had [...] "no sympathies beyond the circles of wealth and refinement", from which [...] "the workingman is either a murderous ruffian, or a senseless dupe, or a stolid, well-meaning drudge, while the man of wealth is, necessarily, a refined, cultivated hero, handsome, stylish, fascinating". A letter in The Century Magazine deemed the novel [...] "a piece of snobbishness imported from England... It is simply untruthful... to continue the assertion that trade unions are mainly controlled and strikes originated by agitators, interested only for what they make out of them".|$|E
500|$|Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting {{progress}} at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 {{of an inch}} wide, directly on to a cylinder (also {{referred to as a}} [...] "drum"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in collodion to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the <b>coarseness</b> of the silver bromide emulsion used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized celluloid sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as Monkeyshines, No. 1, it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.|$|E
60|$|Stiff, quaint, {{and awkward}} sounds old Bokenham's {{translation}} of the 'Golden Legend,' but to Eleanor it had much power. The whole history was new to her, after her life in Scotland, where information had been slow to reach her, and books had been few. The gewgaws spread out before Jean were to her like the gloves, jewels, and braiding of hair with which Martha reproached her sister {{in the days of}} her vanity, and the cloister with its calm services might well seem to her like the better part. These nuns indeed did not strike her as models of devotion, and there was something in the Prioress's easy way of declaring that being safe there might prevent any need of special heed, which rung false on her ear; and then she thought of King Henry, whose rapt countenance had so much struck her, turning aside from enjoyment to seclude himself at the first hint that his pleasure might be a temptation. She recollected too what Lady Drummond had told her of Father Malcolm and Mother Clare, and how each had renounced the world, which had so much to offer them, and chosen the better part! She remembered Father Malcolm's sweet smile and kind words, and Mother Clare's face had impressed her deeply with its lofty peace and sweetness. How much better than all these agitations about princely bridegrooms! and broken lances and queens of beauty seemed to fade into insignificance, or to be only incidents in the tumult of secular life and worldly struggle, and her spirit quailed at the anticipation of the journey she had once desired, the gay court with its follies, empty show, temptations, <b>coarsenesses</b> and cruelties, and the strange land with its new language. The alternative seemed to her from Maudelin in her worldly days to Maudelin at the Saviour's feet, and had Mother Margaret Stafford been one whit more the ideal nun, perhaps every one would have been perplexed by a vehement request to seclude herself at once in the cloister of St. Helen's.|$|R

The pathos of the forlorn sabot laid trustingly by the chimney in expectation of the Santa Claus that was not, takes us fairly by the throat; there is nothing in Shakespeare that touches the heart more nearly. The loves of Cosette and Marius are very pure and pleasant, and we cannot refuse our affection to Gavroche, although we may make a mental reservation of our profound disbelief in his existence. Take it for all in all, there are few books in the world that can be compared with it. There is as much calm and serenity as Hugo has ever attained to; the melodramatic <b>coarsenesses</b> that disfigured [...] "Notre Dame" [...] are no longer present. There is certainly much that is painfully improbable; and again, the story itself is a little too well constructed; it produces on us the effect of a puzzle, and we grow incredulous as we find that every character fits again and again into the plot, and is, like the child's cube, serviceable on six faces; things are not so well arranged in life as all that comes to. Some of the digressions, also, seem out of place, and do nothing but interrupt and irritate. But when all is said, the book remains of masterly conception and of masterly development, full of pathos, full of truth, full of a high eloquence.|$|R

He pierced them with the arches of the triforium, as with hermits' cells. He represented in the horizontal sills of his windows, and in his horizontal string-courses, the horizontal strata of the rocks. He opened the windows into high and lofty glades, broken, as in the forest, by the tracery of stems and boughs, through which was seen, not merely the outer, but the upper world. For he craved, as all true artists crave, for light and colour; and had the sky above been one perpetual blue, {{he might have been}} content with it, and left his glass transparent. But in that dark dank northern clime, rain and snowstorm, black cloud and grey mist, were all that he was like to see outside for nine months in the year.

500|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding street prostitution was {{the foul}} language used, and while generally most {{entries in the}} lists look favourably on those women who refrained from swearing, the views expressed in the 1793 edition of Harris's List tend towards equivocation.

[...] Drinking, intrinsically linked with prostitution, was also frowned on. [...] Mrs William's entry of 1773 is full of remorse, her having returned home [...] "so intoxicated {{so as not to}} be able to stand, to the no small amusement of her neighbors", and Miss Jenny Kirbeard had, in 1788, a [...] "violent attachment to drinking". [...] Not all entries were disapproving though; Mrs Harvey would, in 1793, [...] "often toss off a sparkling bumper," [...] while remaining [...] "a lady of great sensibility... not a little clever in the performance of the act of friction." [...] More generally, most entries are flattering, although some are less than complimentary; the 1773 listing for Miss Berry denounces her as [...] "almost rotten, and her breath cadaverous". [...] Prostitutes may have paid money to appear in the lists, and in Denlinger's view such commentary may indicate a degree of annoyance on the writer's part, the women concerned perhaps having refused to pay. [...] Some listings also imply a degree of dissatisfaction on the part of the customer; in the 1773 edition, Miss Dean exhibited [...] "great indifference" [...] while entertaining her client, busying herself by cracking nuts while he was [...] "acting his joys". [...] Others are scorned for wearing too much makeup, and some for being [...] "lazy bedfellows". [...] A popular view that prostitutes were licentious, hot-blooded and hungry for sex was incompatible with the knowledge that most worked for money, and the lists therefore criticise women whose demands for payment appeared a little too mercenary.|$|E

These solutions work well, but only when the involved color planes are few in number. A common scenario nowadays is the use of six or more primary colors. An alternative solution to avoid periodic interference between conventional clustered-dot screens is to use stochastic clustered-dot screens. A set of stochastic screens can be designed with optimum <b>coarsenesses</b> to be used exclusively or in conjunction with periodic screens to greatly reduce the chances of undesirable interference. ^ In this thesis, we propose a method of stochastic, clustered-dot halftoning and screen design based on Direct Binary Search (DBS). In earlier publications, DBS was shown to generate stochastic, dispersed-dot texture. An analysis of the relationship between halftone changes and the update of filtered-error in DBS lays ground for the development of CLU-DBS which originates as a clustered-dot halftoning variant of DBS. ^ The CLU-DBS procedure evolves from DBS by a simple modification of the filter sizes. CLU-DBS uses the optimization framework of DBS. Like DBS, it first initializes the filtered-error LUT on the basis of an initial random halftone. Subsequently, it iteratively selects pixels for toggle and swap with an objective to minimize the magnitude of the filtered error, and updates the filtered-error. The essential deviation from DBS is the use of different filters in the initialization and update steps. CLU-DBS uses an update filter of larger size than the initialization filter. ^ After proposing an intuitive explanation for the development of stochastic, clustered-dot texture from CLU-DBS optimization, we derive a closed-form expression for the underlying cost function that is being minimized in the course of optimization. Later this cost function is established as the guiding metric for stochastic, clustered-dot halftoning. In other words, CLU-DBS is implemented based on the cost metric. The dual-component cost metric reveals {{a great deal of information}} about the relationship between the input parameters and the output texture. We make use of this information to improve the quality of output texture. This is done by an intelligent selection of input filter sizes, the initial halftone, and the optimization procedure. ^ After developing a procedure for halftoning an image with CLU-DBS, we develop an algorithm for screen design. The screen design is complete after being post-processed for removal of certain defects from the tone reproduction curve. In order to evaluate the quality of halftones resulting from designed screen, we performed psychophysical experiments. The experiments involved comparison of CLU-DBS printed halftones with the halftones resulting from methods developed previously. The results of these experiments indicate subjects 2 ̆ 7 clear preference of the CLU-DBS halftones over other halftones in terms of smoothness of prints. ...|$|R
2500|$|Eucalyptus is {{the most}} common short fibre source for {{pulpwood}} to make pulp. Eucalyptus globulus (in temperate climates) and the hybrid of Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis (in tropical climates) are the most used varieties in papermaking. [...] The fibre length of Eucalyptus is relatively short and uniform with low <b>coarseness</b> compared with other hardwoods commonly used as pulpwood. The fibres are slender, yet relatively thick walled. This gives uniform paper formation and high opacity that are important for all types of fine papers. The low <b>coarseness</b> is important for high quality coated papers. [...] Eucalyptus is suitable for many tissue papers as the short and slender fibres gives a high number of fibres per gram and low <b>coarseness</b> contributes to softness.|$|E
