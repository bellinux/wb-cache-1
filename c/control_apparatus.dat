In 1976, Dugan was granted a patent for an automatic microphone mixing process whereby the total gain of the system remains constant. He began manufacturing his first automixer system, the Model A, based on his two patents. Dugan built 60 units, with the first, hand-assembled one taken to Bell Labs to be installed in their conference room for Harvey Fletcher. The algorithm was simple and effective: Each individual input channel is attenuated by an amount, in dB, equal to the difference, in dB, between that channel’s level and {{the sum of all}} channel levels. Dugan licensed the system to Altec who released several automixer models including the 1674A, -B and -C series and the 1684A, all focusing on speech applications. (The 1684A became an Electrovoice product and is currently administered by their Commercial division.) The earliest Altec product implementation was regarded as inferior within the commercial audio contractor industry, and other manufacturers began to design their own automixer products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Improvements in the {{automation}} {{of transmission}} network voltage control has nowadays becoming a challenging problem. In this framework the paper preliminarily describes the basic {{concepts of the}} Secondary Voltage Regulation (SVR) and the hierarchical control system under application to the overall Italian transmission network, for the voltage and reactive power regulation. At the power plant level this hierarchical control system operates through an innovative, microprocessor based, voltage and reactive power regulator, named REPORT. At the regional load dispatcher level, a Regional Voltage Regulator (RVR) controls in real time and closed-loops through the REPORTs, the voltages of the main EHV busses in the region. Both the REPORT and RVR <b>control</b> <b>apparatuses</b> have been designed and developed by CESI. The Italian Independent System Operator (ISO) has under way the general application of the REPORT apparatuses to all the main power plants, {{a large amount of}} them being already into operation, {{as well as of the}} RVR regulators at the regional dispatchers control rooms. The paper describes the main characteristics and performances of the mentioned <b>control</b> <b>apparatuses,</b> the progress of their application in the field, their impact with the traditional operation, and comparison with alternative voltage control service; significant field test results are also shown. Some considerations about the influence on the voltage service of the power system restructuring process are also given...|$|R
