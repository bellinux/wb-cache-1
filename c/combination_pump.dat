40|$|Abstract. A inducer and {{impeller}} combination aero fuel {{centrifugal pump}} design method was given. Based on empirical coefficient method the preliminary structural {{parameters of the}} combination Centrifugal pump were designed firstly. Then the Centrifugal pump Hybrid Grid model was built with muti-block structure and octree style. The final structure parameters were obtained by CFD numerical simulation optimization. Finally, the flow field of combination Centrifugal pump was analyzed and compared simulation datas with test datas by making the test samples. The relative error of the design point doesn’t exceed 5 %, indicates that the inducer and impeller <b>combination</b> <b>pump</b> meet the design requirements...|$|E
40|$|The {{inverter}} control strategy {{is the key}} to pump energy-saving operation and should be established based on the current system configurations and system requirements, which is not the case in practice. As a result, the characteristics of pump system requirements and a <b>combination</b> <b>pump</b> with inverter were studied, and the mathematical models were established. A new model for an optimal {{inverter control}} strategy based on the current system configurations and system requirements was then established, and a method combining golden section search and genetic algorithm was formulated to solve this optimal model. This model sets up an optimal inverter control strategy to increase the efficiency of pump operation following a process line near the minimum requirements to improve operation conditions. The implementation difficulty of the control law was also reduced. Finally, the optimized model was applied to an industrial circulating pump system, and the result showed that the model can not only determine the optimal inverter control strategy but also evaluate the current operation situation of the pump configuration and determine the energy-saving potential for the current configuration, which can aid in the subsequent energy-saving reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} {{on the performance}} of different arrangements of pumps involving two single pumps operating at different fixed speeds was undertaken. The pressure and flow rate were measured using pressure gauges and calibrated flow meters at strategic locations in various arrangements of piping network. The pump or head drop and system curves were then generated, accounting for the different components of the piping network. The advantages and disadvantages associated with parallel and series <b>combination</b> of <b>pumps</b> of different capacity operating at different specific speeds were established. Furthermore the study did not support the assumption of the same system curve often used in the determination of best efficient point (BEP) for parallel and series <b>combination</b> of <b>pumps</b> in piping networks. This investigation offers the opportunity to establish the optimum solution to operate the pump/pumps in any flow network at or closest to the BEP as well as ascertain the implication of operating away from the BEP. More so, the study will aid in proper selection of <b>pump</b> <b>combinations</b> in any flow network for optimal performance...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis studies the non-uniform blade cascade for centrifugal pumps. Influence of non-uniform blade cascade is investigated on the impeller and diffuser. A non-uniform blading impeller of pumps in this {{doctoral thesis}} was examined {{in terms of}} influence on efficiency characteristic. The idea of using non-uniform blading is to obtain a flat efficiency characteristic. Then the centrifugal pump could be used on larger scale of power with achieving a sufficiently high efficiency. The work is based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations of non-uniform hydraulic pump components. Non-uniform impeller and the diffuser were newly designed for this research. A new measuring track of small submersible pumps was needed to design and build for measurements. Different <b>pump</b> <b>combinations</b> with conventional hydraulics on one working point and hydraulics with non-uniform were measured. All measurements were evaluated and characteristics of efficiency, head and power were obtained for each measured <b>combination.</b> Some of <b>pump</b> <b>combinations</b> (which were measured in experiment) were numerically simulated by program Ansys Fluent. Data needed to evaluate the characteristic of efficiency and specific energy were collected from each numerical simulation. A theoretical consideration concerns the influence of non-uniform blade cascade applied on diffuser. The suggestion how to decrease hydraulic losses in canals was done. The theoretical consideration {{how to make a}} flat efficiency characteristic was made...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} does {{away with}} the necessity of moving parts such as a check valve in a nuclear reactor cooling system. Instead, a jet <b>pump,</b> in <b>combination</b> with a TEMP, is employed to assure safe cooling of a nuclear reactor after shutdown. A main flow exists for a reactor coolant. A point of withdrawal is provided for a secondary flow. A TEMP, responsive to the heat from said coolant in the secondary flow path, automatically pumps said withdrawn coolant to a higher pressure and thus higher velocity compared to the main flow. The high velocity coolant is applied as a driver flow for the jet pump which has a main flow chamber located in the main flow circulation pump. Upon nuclear shutdown and loss of power for the main reactor pumping system, the TEMP/jet <b>pump</b> <b>combination</b> continues to boost the coolant flow in the direction it is already circulating. During the decay time for the nuclear reactor, the jet pump keeps running until the coolant temperature drops to a lower and safe temperature where the heat {{is no longer a}} problem.
