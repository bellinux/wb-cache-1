Ginko faces a Tokoyami-possessed Nui and <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> to the River of Light (or Koumyaku), a stream of glittering Mushi called Kouki—the origin of Mushi life.|$|E
5|$|The goddess <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in her right hand. Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E

5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{is not a}} {{seasonal}} breeder, unlike the pygmy slow loris. Females in an estrous cycle attract males with a loud whistle. Females reproduce every 12–18months and have a six-month gestation. Because they are not seasonal breeders, females could become pregnant when their offspring are approximately 6 months old, making possible for females to produce two offspring per year. Females typically {{give birth to a}} single offspring, although twins rarely occur. This differs from the sympatric pygmy slow loris, which commonly has twins. The mother <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> young about three months before they become independent, although they may be temporarily left on branches while the mother searches for food. Sexual maturity is reached at approximately 20months of age. The species is known to live up to 20years.|$|E

5|$|Once inside, Roy {{is shown}} the true history of The Scouring. The dragons, despite their power, {{were unable to}} {{maintain}} their numbers due to how slowly they reproduced compared to humans. As the war came to a close, the surviving Fire Dragons captured a Divine Dragon named Idunn and sealed away her soul. Enslaved to their will, Idunn reproduced dragons at an incredible rate and {{became known as the}} Demon Dragon, but she was defeated by a warrior wielding the Binding Blade. Her power was locked away until Zephiel, disgusted at humanity's failings, released her out of his insane desire to return Elibe to the dragons. As she has no emotion or free will, Idunn continues to follow Zephiel's orders even after his death and threatens to raise a dragon army that will destroy everything on the continent. On the topmost floor of the temple, the Etrurian Army battles Idunn's endlessly spawning dragons, allowing Roy to deliver the final blow on her with the Binding Blade. This does not kill her, and Roy <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> out as the temple collapses behind him. In the war's wake, Elibe begins to rebuild itself. Guinivere is named the new ruler of Bern, while Elffin returns to Etruria after his long absence. Roy and Lilina become the new marquesses of Pherae and Ostia, while Idunn is taken to Arcadia and lives with Fae as her soul slowly returns to her.|$|E
5|$|When a {{representative}} of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop to evaluate the plant, she announces that Seymour will receive a trophy from them, and that she will return when the plant's buds open. While Seymour is on a date with Audrey, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. does not hurt anyone else. After trading barbs with the plant when Audrey awakens and demands to be fed, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of Kloy Haddock, a robber who pretended to be a customer of the previous day, and believes that the huge crowd he had observed attending the shop indicated the presence of a large amount of money. To save his own life, Mushnick tricks Haddock into thinking that the money is with the plant, which crushes and eats him. Not only does the monstrous plant's growth increase with this latest meal, but its intelligence and abilities do as well. It intimidates Mr. Mushnick, who is now more terrified than ever, but not so much that he will forgo the money the plant is bringing in as an attraction. After he is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant's nature, an angry Seymour confronts the plant asserting he will no longer do its bidding just because it orders him to. The plant then employs hypnosis on the feckless lad and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets aimlessly until pursued by a rather aggressively persistent street walker Leonora Clyde, intent on making a score. Believing him harmless, she flirts with him to no avail until he inadvertently knocks her out with a rock and <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> back to feed Audrey Jr.|$|E

Dorothy's third and final request was to <b>carry</b> <b>her</b> and her company over the rocky mountains that was inhabited by the very unfriendly creatures called Hammer-Heads, who would not let them pass over their turf.|$|R
5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now admit that they are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, they come to the Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents that happened in the past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the Union Cross to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> Chrithy towards the door before they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), the story itself goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E

25|$|A macaque mother {{moves to}} the {{periphery}} of her troop to give birth in a secluded spot, unless the group is moving, when the female must stay with it.

A mother <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> infant on her belly for its first four weeks. After this time, the mother <b>carries</b> <b>her</b> infant on her back, as well. Infants continue to be carried past a year. A mother and her infant tend to avoid other troop members, and the mother may socialize again very slowly. However, alloparenting has been observed, usually by females which have not had infants of their own. Male care of infants occurs in some groups, but not in others; usually, older males protect, groom, and carry an infant as a female would.|$|E
