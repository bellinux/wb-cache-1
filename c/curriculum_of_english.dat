60|$|Sir Allan Beaumerville, Bart., dilettante {{physician}} and man of fashion, was, on the whole, {{one of the}} most popular men in London society. He was rich, of distinguished appearance, had charming manners, and was a bachelor, which combination might possibly account in some measure for the high esteem in which he was held amongst the opposite sex. He had made his début in society quite late in life, for he had succeeded to the baronetcy, which was one of the oldest and richest in the country, unexpectedly; and, as a young man, London--fashionable London, at any rate--had seen or known nothing of him. Nor, indeed, had he at any time had much to say to anyone about the earlier period of his life. It was generally understood that he had lived abroad, and that he had been in some sort of practice, or how else could he have acquired his knowledge of the technical part of his profession? Beyond this, nothing was known; and although he was evidently a traveled man, having much to say at times about all the interesting parts of Southern Europe, no one ever remembered meeting him anywhere. For the rest, he had passed through none of the <b>curriculum</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> youth. No public school had had his name upon its books, nor had he even graduated in his own country. But he had taken a very high degree indeed at Heidelberg, which had won him considerable respect among those who knew anything about such matters, and his diplomas included half the letters of the alphabet, and were undeniable. And so when he had suddenly appeared in London on the death of his uncle and cousin, a middle-aged, distinguished gentleman, with manners a little foreign, but in their way perfect, society had voted him a great improvement on the former baronet, and had taken him by the hand at once. That was a good many years ago, and very soon after his first introduction to the London world he had become a notable figure in it. He had never missed a town season, and at all its chief functions was a well-known and popular figure, always among the best and most exclusive set, and always welcome there. He had a yacht at Cowes, a share in a Scotch moor, a dozen or so hunters at his little place near Melton, a shooting box in Derbyshire, and a fine old mansion and estate in Kent, where everyone liked to be asked; and where he had more than once had the honor of entertaining royalty. There was only one thing in the world wanted to make Sir Allan Beaumerville perfect, women declared, and that one thing was a wife. But although no one appeared to appreciate more highly the charms of feminine society--as he showed in more ways than one, both in St. John's Wood and in Belgravia--he had never shown the least inclination to perform his duty to society in this respect. How he managed to steer clear of the many snares and pitfalls laid for him in the course of his career puzzled a good many men. But he did it, and what was more remarkable still, he made no enemies. He had friendships among the other sex such as no man save he dared have indulged in to a like extent; but with infinite skill he always seemed to be able to drop some delicate insinuation as to the utter absence of any matrimonial intention on his part, which left no room for doubt or hope. He was, in short, possessed of admirable powers of diplomacy which never failed him.|$|E

5000|$|Once freed, Chinese {{women were}} forced to reside at the Presbyterian Home (where they were not allowed outside without an escort) and to convert to Christianity. While some Chinese {{immigrant}} women welcomed conversion and saw Donaldina as a savior, nicknaming her “Lo Mo” (which she translated as [...] "foster mother"), others had mixed feelings about this forced conversion. Often, Donaldina could be very patronizing towards these women, using terms like “waif” and “children” to describe {{the residents of the}} home. Very rarely was Chinese culture integrated into the education of the girls in the home. Instead, there was a strict <b>curriculum</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> Christianity and western housekeeping skills. Finally, the women of the home were only allowed to leave the home if they married a Christian man approved of by Cameron.|$|E

An English teacher at The Kingswood School, Pease {{was known as a}} gifted academician and immediately laid forth a challenging <b>curriculum</b> <b>of</b> <b>English,</b> arithmetic, algebra, history, Latin and French. In an early catalog he wrote, “The School is not progressive. It insists that students work hard at a simplified curriculum as an antidote for the progressive tendency to play at an extremely diversified curriculum. It trains pupils to do hard, or even unpleasant tasks well; it believes that there is no easy road to scholarship, and that a difficulty conquered by perseverance and courage leads to more lasting satisfaction than does an interesting task easily performed.” ...|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>English</b> {{language}} learners continues to grow, educators are seeking effective programs and instructional strategies to serve them. Any center for applied linguistics {{should provide a}} comprehensive range of research-based language and cultural education resources and testing tools. Teachers could adapt best curriculum and instructional strategies for students learning English. They must provide a variety of materials and technology to help English language learners in the classroom. Technology lends itself to exploration. But before technology can be used effectively, exploration must be valued as important to both teaching and learning. Teaching—especially in the humanities—should always strive {{to move beyond the}} simple divulging of facts and knowledge or even the training of certain skills. Learning is, of course, the main purpose of education. It is the goal of every student and the task of every teacher to increase knowledge and understanding in the classroom. The present paper tries to show general frame and importance of technology applied for teaching of language. Then, the role of technology as well as learning will be explained. It is hoped to come to some conclusions by showing some corrections in the strategies and <b>curriculums</b> <b>of</b> <b>English</b> language teaching programs...|$|R
