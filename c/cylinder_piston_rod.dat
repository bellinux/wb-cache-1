30|$|The {{main goal}} of this work {{is to provide a}} deeper {{understanding}} of the WEC structural performance when submitted to simulated wave forces. Through the use of a commercial finite element code it was assessed the influence of buoy geometry and dimensions, as well as submerged conditions and extreme stroke positions of the hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|E
30|$|In Figures  2 and 3, {{the right}} channel which {{consists}} of small servo valve and servo cylinder is the tested HIVC controlled by the force-loop method, while the left channel {{which consists of}} the same type servo valve and servo cylinder is the position simulation part controlled by the position-loop method. The two channels are connected by the <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> and displacement sensor and force sensor are installed in their joint.|$|E
50|$|In-cylinder linear {{displacement}} transducers (LDTs) {{have been}} used with limited success in mobile equipment to achieve these goals. A limitation to most in-cylinder LDTs is that the hydraulic <b>cylinder’s</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> must be bored through its center to accommodate certain elements of the LDT — usually the waveguide tube of a magnetostrictive transducer. The machining and additional production steps associated with “gun drilling” the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> add substantial cost to the finished cylinder. And although magnetostrictive LDTs provide extremely high accuracy, this accuracy usually {{is much greater than}} is needed for most mobile equipment applications.|$|R
50|$|Later developments, also by Watt, {{produced}} a double-acting <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> {{now had to}} transmit a force alternately pushing and pulling. The steam engine's general use of an enclosed cylinder, nearly always double-acting, made it dependent on the stuffing box and so the <b>piston</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R
50|$|Piston {{actuators}} use a piston which {{moves along}} the length of a <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> conveys the force on the piston to the valve stem. Piston actuators allow higher pressures, longer travel ranges, and higher thrust forces than diaphragm actuators.|$|R
30|$|From {{the finite}} element {{analysis}} results and for the sizing WEC components and load level applied {{it can be concluded}} that: (1) for the advanced position of the hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> two critical sections are observed—piston rod and supporting cables, while for the retracted position the highest concentrations are in the supporting cables; (2) the spherical buoy with radius of 100  mm leads to the lowest values of stresses and displacements when compared with the tulip geometry; (3) cylindrical geometry leads to a chaotic scenario due to an extremely high level of stresses and displacements; (4) the partially submerged condition corresponds to the critical buoy position since highest maximum stresses and displacements are reached and (5) the increase in the buoy dimensions leads to plastic deformation of WEC components for the material properties, sizing and load level used in this study.|$|E
30|$|The {{load value}} {{computed}} from the WEC dynamic model equations was very low. As a result, {{regardless of the}} hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> position, buoy geometry and dimensions as well as submerged conditions, no conclusions about the mechanical behaviour of the WEC are drawn. This {{is due to the}} extremely lower stress and displacement values obtained for the considered dimensions of the WEC components. Therefore, a load with a high magnitude was required. This drawback could be avoided if real irregular waves were taken into account instead of regular periodic waves assumed here. The fact that the WEC has currently a very small scale, thus small dimensions of its components, may also contribute to this scenario. The WEC dynamic and finite element models need to be developed and improved. Some work is required to define reasonable load levels that WEC is submitted to.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} analysis of several buoy geometries that may be applied to a near-shore floating point-absorber wave energy converter. After the characterisation of the device, a numerical model and a simulator in the time domain were developed and the structural performance of the wave energy converter evaluated for three different buoy geometries. The influence of the buoy dimensions, different submerged conditions and position of hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> on the structural performance of the wave energy converter is also analysed. The numerical study was conducted using a commercial finite element code. This software needs, among other parameters, {{the magnitude of the}} forces acting upon each buoy. A dynamic model was, therefore, developed assuming that the buoy heave motion is excited by the sea waves. The finite element analysis revealed that a load with a higher magnitude than those computed from the simulator was required. It was shown that, even considering the partially submerged condition, the spherical buoy geometry leads to best structural behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|... 1860: Belgian Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir (1822-1900) {{produced}} a gas-fired {{internal combustion engine}} similar in appearance to a horizontal double-acting steam engine, with <b>cylinders,</b> <b>pistons,</b> connecting <b>rods,</b> and flywheel in which the gas essentially took {{the place of the}} steam. This was the first internal combustion engine to be produced in numbers.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States, popular usage {{refers to}} the whole {{assembly}} of <b>cylinder,</b> <b>piston,</b> and <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> (or more) collectively as a [...] "piston", which is incorrect. Instead, the piston is the short, cylindrical metal component that separates the {{two parts of the}} cylinder barrel internally.|$|R
50|$|The {{widely used}} {{reciprocating}} engine typically {{consisted of a}} cast iron <b>cylinder,</b> <b>piston,</b> connecting <b>rod</b> and beam or a crank and flywheel, and miscellaneous linkages. Steam was alternately supplied and exhausted {{by one or more}} valves. Speed control was either automatic, using a governor, or by a manual valve. The cylinder casting contained steam supply and exhaust ports.|$|R
30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the support oil cushion of the variable hydraulic pressure support structure, oil cushion of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the servo <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> guide sleeve, and piston, as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|E
40|$|Described is a {{fatigue testing}} {{apparatus}} for simultaneously subjecting {{a plurality of}} material test specimens to cyclical tension loading to determine the fatigue strength of the material. The fatigue testing apparatus includes a pulling head having cylinders defined therein which carry reciprocating pistons. The reciprocation of the pistons is determined by cyclical supplies of pressurized fluid to the <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Piston</b> <b>rods</b> extend from the pistons through the pulling head and are attachable to {{one end of the}} test specimens, {{the other end of the}} test specimens being attachable to a fixed base, causing test specimens attached between the <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> and the base to be subjected to cyclical tension loading. Because all the cylinders share a common pressurized fluid supply, the breaking of a test specimen does not substantially affect the pressure of the fluid supplied to the other cylinders nor the tension applied to the other test specimens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the bucket}} teeth load-time courses {{calculation}} model under bucket digging condition, the stresses on the hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> of boom and bucket and the real-time length of bucket hydraulic cylinder were set as measured variables, and a measuring method of the bucket teeth load-time courses was developed {{which had the}} advantages of less measuring points, simplified measurement process and low cost. The bucket teeth load-time courses were calculated by inputting the measuring data into the self-developed Constructing Hydraulic Excavators Load Spectrum software, and its characteristics of each digging step in one excavation cycle at digging macadam were analyzed. Then, using rain-flow counting module in FE-SAFE software, the statistical graphs of bucket teeth load-time courses were acquired which could {{provide the basis for}} hydraulic excavator reliability design and fatigue life prediction...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the forces}} acting on the <b>cylinder,</b> the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is the most {{stressed}} component {{and has to be}} designed to withstand high amounts of bending, tensile and compressive forces. Depending on how long the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> is, stresses can be calculated differently.

50|$|By 1925 the {{vertical}} {{arrangement of the}} engine had been taken advantage of to improve steam porting and access for maintenance. The Super-Sentinel engine used two camshafts: inlet and exhaust, placed near the crankshaft in the crankcase and operating the poppet valves through long pushrods. In the original waggon engine, all four valves were mounted {{at the far end of}} the cylinder from the crankshaft, requiring long narrow ports to the other end of the cylinder. With the locomotives the easily accessed vertical engine allowed a pair of these valves to be moved to the lower end of the cylinder, allowing for a short, efficient port with less 'dead space'. The crankcase of the engine, together with the crosshead trunk guide, was enclosed and provided with oil splash lubrication. A small plenum was left exposed between the <b>cylinder's</b> <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> stuffing box and another gland seal into the crankcase. This allowed any steam that did leak past the seals to be vented to the atmosphere, rather than condensing within the crankcase.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{hydraulic}} cylinders, something {{forces a}} piston {{to move in}} the desired direction. The piston is a disc or <b>cylinder,</b> and the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> transfers the force it develops to the object to be moved. [...] Engineers sometimes prefer to use pneumatics because they are quieter, cleaner, and do not require large amounts of space for fluid storage.|$|R

The SG 543 lacks the integral bipod of the SG 540/542 and the reduced barrel cannot be used to fire rifle grenades.The SG 540 served {{as the basis for the}} SG 541 prototype, which would later become the SG 550 that entered service with the Swiss Armed Forces as the Stgw 90 (Sturmgewehr 90).|$|R
25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, the cylinders are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of the forward cylinder is usually the forward wall of the rear <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the rear cylinder {{is connected to the}} crosshead in the usual way, but the forward cylinder may have its <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> or rods, in either of two forms: either the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> of the rear cylinder is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if the forward cylinder be the low-pressure cylinder (and thus larger in diameter than the high-pressure cylinder behind), it may have two long <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> which pass above and below, or to either side, of the high-pressure cylinder in order to reach the common crosshead.|$|R

5000|$|The trunk {{engine was}} largely {{replaced}} by the double piston-rod engine. [...] This was a return connecting rod engine, with the crankshaft between the crosshead and <b>cylinder.</b> Four <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> were used to pass around the crankshaft, both above and below, and also to {{each side of the}} crank, as the crank throw was wider than the vertical spacing of the <b>piston</b> <b>rods.</b> As most of these engines were parallel compounds, two <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> would be taken from each of the HP and LP pistons. In some engines, double rods were used from the large LP cylinder and a single rod from the HP cylinder, with a yoke to pass around the crankshaft. Double <b>piston</b> <b>rods</b> could also be used from a simple engine, but these required an overhung gudgeon pin on the crosshead, so tended to be limited to smaller engines. An advantage of the double <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> engine over the trunk was that both ends of the connecting rod were accessible for maintenance. One factor learned from naval use of horizontal cylinders was that, despite previous fears, there was little additional wear owing to the piston's weight resting on the cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s Train {{introduced}} {{a series of}} air-cooled, inverted in-line piston engines for light aircraft. The T series all used the same <b>cylinders,</b> <b>pistons,</b> connecting <b>rods,</b> valve trains and ignition system, combined into 2 (2T), 4 (4T), and 6 (6T) cylinder units of the same layout. The number of crankshaft bearings (3, 5 or 7) and throws (2, 4 or 6) naturally depended {{on the number of}} cylinders, as did the number of cams (4, 8 or 12) on the underhead camshaft. Each cylinder had a swept volume of 0.5 L, so the displacements were 1 L, 2 L and 3 L and the rated outputs , [...] and [...] respectively. The Train 6D was a variant of the 6T with increased bore of 85 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Telescoping cylinders, {{also known}} as {{telescopic}} cylinders can be either single or double-acting. The telescoping <b>cylinder</b> incorporates a <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> nested within a series of hollow stages of increasing diameter. Upon actuation, the <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> and each succeeding stage [...] "telescopes" [...] out as a segmented piston. The main benefit of this design is the allowance for a notably longer stroke than would be achieved with a single-stage cylinder of the same collapsed (retracted) length. One cited drawback to telescoping cylinders is the increased potential for piston flexion due to the segmented piston design. Consequently, telescoping cylinders are primarily utilized in applications where the piston bears minimal side loading.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} gas-operated firearms, direct impingement does {{away with}} a separate gas <b>cylinder,</b> <b>piston,</b> and operating <b>rod</b> assembly. High-pressure gas acts directly upon the bolt and carrier thereby saving weight, lowering costs, and reducing {{the mass of the}} operating parts, and thereby the wear on mechanical parts due to movement. By removing the gas piston, the potential amount of moving mass is lowered, thus decreasing the potential for a disrupted sight picture, as caused by the mass of the piston adding to the disruptive mass.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} built with horizontal cylinders driving a crankshaft directly above the rear driving axle, with a common spring supporting both the shaft and axle {{so that they could}} move vertically together. Ross Winans designed a series of 0-8-0 locomotives starting in 1842, launching what became the B&O Mud Digger class of engines. Like the Grasshopper locomotives before them, the crank shafts on these engines were geared to the driven shafts. [...] In his 1843 patent, Winas referred to the crankshaft as a fifth shaft, or axle. [...] In 1880, the Fowler Steam Plough Works of Leeds England received a patent on a similar 0-4-0 locomotive design with vertical side rods between the crankshaft and rear axle.

40|$|Standard {{analytic}} {{linear model}} of hydraulic cylinder usually comes from assumptions of identical action piston areas {{on both sides}} of hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> (double <b>piston</b> <b>rod)</b> and suitable operation point, which is usually chosen in the middle of piston. By reason of that volumes inside of cylinder are than same. Moreover for control of that arrangement of hydraulic cylinder, usually controlled by 4 / 3 servovalve, the same mount of flows comes in and comes out to each of chambers of hydraulic cylinder. Presented paper deal with development of extended form of analytic linear model of single <b>piston</b> <b>rod</b> hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> which respects different action piston areas and volumes inside of chambers of hydraulic cylinder and also two different input flows of hydraulic cylinder. In extended model are also considered possibilities of different dead volumes in hoses and intake parts of hydraulic cylinder. Dead volume has impact on damping of hydraulic cylinder.

25|$|The side-lever was an {{adaptation}} of the earliest form of steam engine, the beam engine. The typical side-lever engine {{had a pair of}} heavy horizontal iron beams, known as side levers, connected in the centre {{to the bottom of the}} engine with a pin; this connection allowed a limited arc in which the levers could pivot. These levers extended, on the cylinder side, to each side of the bottom of the vertical engine <b>cylinder.</b> A <b>piston</b> <b>rod,</b> connected vertically to the piston, extended out of the top of the cylinder. This rod attached to a horizontal crosshead which, at each end, was connected to vertical rods (known as side-rods). These rods connected down to the levers on each side of the cylinder. This formed the connection of the levers to the <b>piston</b> on the <b>cylinder</b> side of the engine. The other side of the levers (the opposite end of the lever pivot to the cylinder) were connected to each other with a horizontal crosstail. This crosstail in turn connected to and operated a single connecting rod, which turned the crankshaft. The rotation of the crankshaft was driven by the levers which, at the cylinder side, were driven by the piston oscillating vertically.|$|R
