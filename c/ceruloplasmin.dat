5|$|The {{combination}} of neurological symptoms, Kayser–Fleischer rings {{and a low}} <b>ceruloplasmin</b> level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is needed}} by the body {{for a number of}} functions, {{predominantly}} as a cofactor for a number of enzymes such as <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase and tyrosinase.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to <b>ceruloplasmin</b> and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by secreting it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; <b>ceruloplasmin</b> is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element in plants and animals, but not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper {{at a level of}} about 1.4 to 2.1mg per kg of body mass. Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver bound to albumin. After processing in the liver, copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves the protein <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> carrying the majority of copper in blood. <b>Ceruloplasmin</b> also carries the copper that is excreted in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper source. Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation (about 5mg a day, vs. about 1mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine.|$|E
5|$|There is no totally {{reliable}} {{test for}} Wilson's disease, but levels of <b>ceruloplasmin</b> and copper in the blood, as {{well of the}} amount of copper excreted in urine during a 24-hour period, are together used to form an impression {{of the amount of}} copper in the body. The gold standard—or most ideal test—is a liver biopsy.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into <b>ceruloplasmin.</b> Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are homozygous for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by <b>ceruloplasmin</b> which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
5|$|Animals {{typically}} use {{the color}} green as camouflage, blending {{in with the}} chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment. Green animals include, especially, amphibians, reptiles, and some fish, birds and insects. Most fish, reptiles, amphibians, and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment. Perception of color can also {{be affected by the}} surrounding environment. For example, broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light. Turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds, especially. Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments, sometimes caused by diet. This can causes their feces to look green as well. Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins (lychochromes) and hemanovadin. Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields. Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one's skin include biliverdin, the green pigment in bile, and <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If a family history of liver disease is present, serum copper and <b>ceruloplasmin</b> levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E
5|$|When {{the amount}} of copper in the liver overwhelms the {{proteins}} that normally bind it, it causes oxidative damage through {{a process known as}} Fenton chemistry; this damage eventually leads to chronic active hepatitis, fibrosis (deposition of connective tissue) and cirrhosis. The liver also releases copper into the bloodstream that is not bound to <b>ceruloplasmin.</b> This free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the kidneys, eyes and brain. In the brain, most copper is deposited in the basal ganglia, particularly in the putamen and globus pallidus (together called the lenticular nucleus); these areas normally participate in the coordination of movement as well as playing a significant role in neurocognitive processes such as the processing of stimuli and mood regulation. Damage to these areas, again by Fenton chemistry, produces the neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in Wilson's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ceruloplasmin</b> is {{the major}} copper-carrying protein in the blood. <b>Ceruloplasmin</b> {{exhibits}} oxidase activity, which is associated with possible oxidation of Fe(II) into Fe(III), therefore assisting in its transport in the blood plasma in association with transferrin, which can carry iron only in the Fe(III) state.|$|E
25|$|Aceruloplasminemia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} (a five-base pair insertion in exon 7) in the CP gene, which provides instructions for making a protein called <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> a protein involved in iron transport and processing. <b>Ceruloplasmin</b> helps move iron from the organs and tissues of the body and prepares it for incorporation into a molecule called transferrin, which transports it to red blood cells to help carry oxygen. The CP gene mutation results in the production of <b>ceruloplasmin</b> protein that is unstable or nonfunctional by altering the open reading frame such that the amino acid ligands in the essential carboxyl terminal region are eliminated. When <b>ceruloplasmin</b> is unavailable, transport of iron out of the body's tissues is impaired. The resulting iron accumulation damages cells in those tissues, leading to neurological dysfunction and other health problems.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's disease. Autosomal {{recessive}} disorder {{characterized by}} low serum <b>ceruloplasmin</b> and increased hepatic copper content on liver biopsy and elevated 24-hour urine copper. May also have Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea and altered mental status.|$|E
25|$|Acquired copper {{deficiency}} {{has recently been}} implicated in adult-onset progressive myeloneuropathy and {{in the development of}} severe blood disorders including myelodysplastic syndrome. Fortunately, {{copper deficiency}} can be confirmed by very low serum metal and <b>ceruloplasmin</b> concentrations in the blood.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of this {{disorder}} depends on blood tests demonstrating {{the absence of}} serum <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> combined with low serum copper concentration, low serum iron concentration, high serum ferritin concentration, or increased hepatic iron concentration. MRI scans can also confirm a diagnosis; abnormal low intensities can indicate iron accumulation in the brain.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{released}} from intestinal cells {{moves to the}} serosal (i.e., thin membrane lining) capillaries where it binds to albumin, glutathione, and amino acids in the portal blood. There is also evidence for a small protein, transcuprein, with a specific role in plasma copper transport Several {{or all of these}} copper-binding molecules may participate in serum copper transport. Copper from portal circulation is primarily taken up by the liver. Once in the liver, copper is either incorporated into copper-requiring proteins, which are subsequently secreted into the blood. Most of the copper (70 – 95%) excreted by the liver is incorporated into <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> the main copper carrier in blood. Copper is transported to extra-hepatic tissues by <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> albumin and amino acids, or excreted into the bile. By regulating copper release, the liver exerts homeostatic control over extrahepatic copper.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} and metabolism of copper in living organisms {{is currently the}} subject of much active research. Copper transport at the cellular level involves the movement of extracellular copper across the cell membrane and into the cell by specialized transporters. In the bloodstream, copper is carried throughout the body by albumin, <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> and other proteins. The majority of blood copper (or serum copper) is bound to <b>ceruloplasmin.</b> The proportion of ceruloplasmin-bound copper can range from 70-95% and differs between individuals, depending, for example, on hormonal cycle, season, and copper status. Intracellular copper is routed to sites of synthesis of copper-requiring enzymes and to organelles by specialized proteins called metallochaperones. Another set of these transporters carries copper into subcellular compartments. Certain mechanisms exist to release copper from the cell. Specialized transporters return excess unstored copper to the liver for additional storage and/or biliary excretion. These mechanisms ensure that free unbound toxic ionic copper is unlikely to exist in {{the majority of the population}} (i.e., those without genetic copper metabolism defects).|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{produced}} by mutational defects of a protein that transports copper from the liver to the bile for excretion. The disease involves poor incorporation of copper into <b>ceruloplasmin</b> and impaired biliary copper excretion and is usually induced by mutations impairing {{the function of the}} Wilson copper ATPase. These genetic mutations produce copper toxicosis due to excess copper accumulation, predominantly in the liver and brain and, to a lesser extent, in kidneys, eyes, and other organs.|$|E
25|$|No {{effects of}} copper supplementation on serum liver enzymes, {{biomarkers}} of oxidative stress, and other biochemical endpoints {{have been observed}} in healthy young human volunteers given daily doses of 6 to 10mg/d of copper for up to 12 weeks. Infants aged 3–12 months who consumed water containing 2mg Cu/L for 9 months {{did not differ from}} a concurrent control group in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) symptoms, growth rate, morbidity, serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels, and other biochemical endpoints.) Serum <b>ceruloplasmin</b> was transiently elevated in the exposed infant group at 9 months and similar to controls at 12 months, suggesting homeostatic adaptation and/or maturation of the homeostatic response.|$|E
25|$|Iron export {{occurs in}} a variety of cell types, {{including}} neurons, erythrocytes, macrophages and enterocytes. The latter two are especially important since systemic iron levels depend upon them. There is only one known iron exporter, ferroportin. It transports ferrous iron out of the cell, generally aided by <b>ceruloplasmin</b> and/or hephaestin (mostly in enterocytes), which oxidize iron to its ferric state so it can bind ferritin in the extracellular medium. Hepcidin causes the internalization of ferroportin, decreasing iron export. Besides, hepcidin seems to downregulate both TFR1 and DMT1 through an unknown mechanism. Another player assisting ferroportin in effecting cellular iron export is GAPDH. A specific post translationally modified isoform of GAPDH is recruited to the surface of iron loaded cells where it recruits apo-transferrin in close proximity to ferroportin so as to rapidly chelate the iron extruded.|$|E
25|$|Copper is {{imported}} into cells through the cell wall by the plasma {{membrane transport protein}} known as Copper Transporter 1, or Ctr1. Ctr1 rapidly binds to intracellular copper chaperone proteins. Atox1 delivers copper to the secretory pathway and docks with either copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B in the liver or ATP7A in other cells. ATP7B directs copper to plasma <b>ceruloplasmin</b> or to biliary excretion in concert with a newly discovered chaperone, Murr1, the protein missing in canine copper toxicosis. ATP7A directs copper within the trans-Golgi network to the proteins dopamine beta-monooxygenase, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, lysyl oxidase, and tyrosinase, depending on the cell type. CCS is the copper chaperone for the Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase that protects cells against reactive oxygen species; it delivers copper in the cytoplasm and intermitochondrial space. Cox17 delivers copper to mitochondria to cytochrome c oxidase via the chaperones Cox11, Sco1, and Sco2. Other copper chaperones may exist and might include metallothionein and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Genetic and nutritional studies have illustrated the essential nature of these copper-binding proteins.|$|E
500|$|Levels of <b>ceruloplasmin</b> are {{abnormally}} low (<0.2 g/L) in 80–95% of cases. [...] It can, however, {{be present}} at normal levels in people with ongoing inflammation as it is an acute phase protein. Low <b>ceruloplasmin</b> {{is also found in}} Menkes disease and aceruloplasminemia, which are related to, but much rarer than Wilson's disease.|$|E
500|$|Severe {{deficiency}} can {{be found}} by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels, low <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels; these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The [...] "cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets" [...] has been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{aspects of}} copper {{homeostasis}} are {{known at the}} molecular level. Copper's essentiality is due to its ability {{to act as an}} electron donor or acceptor as its oxidation state fluxes between Cu1+(cuprous) and Cu2+ (cupric). As a component of about a dozen cuproenzymes, copper is involved in key redox (i.e., oxidation-reduction) reactions in essential metabolic processes such as mitochondrial respiration, synthesis of melanin, and cross-linking of collagen. Copper {{is an integral part of}} the antioxidant enzyme, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), and has a role in iron homeostasis as a cofactor in <b>ceruloplasmin.</b> A list of some key copper-containing enzymes and their functions is summarized below: ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ceruloplasmin</b> is {{an enzyme}} (...) {{synthesized}} {{in the liver}} containing 6 atoms of copper in its structure. <b>Ceruloplasmin</b> carries more than 95% of the total copper in healthy human plasma. The rest is accounted for by macroglobulins. <b>Ceruloplasmin</b> exhibits a copper-dependent oxidase activity, which is associated with possible oxidation of Fe2+ (ferrous iron) into Fe3+ (ferric iron), therefore assisting in its transport in the plasma in association with transferrin, which can carry iron only in the ferric state.

While the structure and kinetic activity of <b>ceruloplasmin</b> have been studied extensively, hephaestin has yet to be investigated at a similar level. Comparative models of hephaestin's structure have been created using established crystallographic data from <b>ceruloplasmin,</b> and these studies suggest that many of the structural features important in the enzymatic function of the latter are also conserved in the former. In particular, these shared features include cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation, histidine residues involved in copper binding, and residues involved in the binding of the iron substrate.|$|E
