40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{injection}} axis switching (IAS) sensorless control scheme using a pulsating high-frequency (HF) signal {{to minimize the}} position detection error and the velocity estimation ripple due to the zero <b>current</b> <b>clamping</b> (ZCC) effect for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). When a pulsating carrier-signal voltage is injected in an estimated synchronous frame, the envelope of the resulting HF current measured in the stationary reference frame follows an amplitude-modulated pattern. Using this information, the IAS technique allows avoiding multiple zero-crossings of HF currents by adjusting the current phase angle according to the load condition. At no-load, the pulsating voltage is injected only on the d-axis while the d-axis current is controlled to a certain nonzero value. Under the loaded condition, the injection voltage is switched to the q-axis and the d-axis current drops back to zero. Thus, the proposed sensorless control enforces a much better estimation performance during ZCC region without a pre-defined offline commissioning test than the standard pulsating injection scheme. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by experimental results.

Additionally, to evoke physiologic unitary-IPSCs at 0. 8 probability-of-release, it was necessary to partially cluster synapses.

40|$|A {{widespread}} {{usage of}} new advanced high strength TWIP steels in {{the automotive industry}} is conditional on proper assembly operations by welding. Therefore, {{the effects of the}} main important process parameters on the mechanical and microstructural properties of resistance spot welded TWIP sheets are examined here. The welding parameters used were welding <b>current,</b> <b>clamping</b> force, and welding time. An L- 9 (33) orthogonally array was used to design the experimental tests. The mechanical response of the welded joints was assessed by tensile shear tests and Vickers microhardness measurements. The effect of the welding parameters on the fracture mode of the tensile shear specimens was also investigated. Some combinations of the welding process parameters guaranteed acceptable tensile shear strengths for the automotive industry. The tensile shear samples mainly failed by interfacial fracture mode, while partial thickness with pull out fractures were observed in the samples welded with the highest welding <b>current</b> and <b>clamping</b> force. Improper clamping force and welding current promoted excessive metal expulsions and, in turn, the formation of welding defects in the weld spot...|$|R
30|$|Cumulative {{probability}} of RESET currents {{for the first}} and second cycles is shown in Fig.  3 b. At a 50  % probability, the RESET currents are found to be 329 and 344  µA for 1 st and 2 nd cycles, respectively. The RESET current is slightly higher (~ 15  %) than current compliance owing to small current overshoot effect, which can be reduced by optimizing operation current. Further study is needed to evaluate this effect. This current overshoot effect is happening during formation or SET of the devices. Therefore, this structure provides good <b>current</b> <b>clamping</b> and minimizes <b>current</b> overshoot effects, even a one-resistor (1 R) configuration.|$|R
