40|$|Research {{universities}} focus significant {{resources on}} identifying and managing faculty {{conflicts of interest}} and commitment in response to increasing federal oversight and concern about declining public confidence. After more than 10 years of federal regulation requiring disclosure of conflicts that could be perceived to influence certain research programs, these universities continue to struggle with finding ways to evaluate {{the success of these}} programs. The literature has extensively examined the effects of conflicts on individual faculty behavior and defined types of relationships that are likely to lead to conflicts. However, little work has explored the extent to which plans for identifying and managing faculty conflicts of interest are effective at managing risks, affect faculty recruiting and retention, and impact faculty and/or administrator attitudes about conducting research. One of the primary challenges in evaluating effectiveness has been the variety of attitudes and perceptions held by individuals involved in the <b>conflicts</b> <b>management</b> process. The research analyzes the attitudes of faculty and administrators involved in the <b>conflicts</b> <b>management</b> process at three large, private research universities through the use of qualitative interviews. The interviews are supplemented by a brief survey of the characteristics of <b>conflicts</b> <b>management</b> programs at public and private research universities. Rather than suggesting a complete prohibition of relationships between faculty and private industry, the framework suggests that the <b>conflicts</b> <b>management</b> process consider seven core values that help balance individual and institutional considerations. The research further suggests that research institutions open a dialogue with research faculty to help educate faculty {{about the importance of the}} <b>conflicts</b> <b>management</b> process in protecting the researcher from allegations of bias and in supporting fundamental academic values. ...|$|R

25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should {{reflect on the}} process and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience. They also must address and repair any hurt feelings and damaged relationships {{that may not have}} been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of human interactions, people cannot avoid Conflicts in the workplace. Conflict {{is not related to}} the notion of positive or negative rather it is merely unavoided facts that {{we have to deal with}} in the workplaces. Therefore, the most important thing to do is not avoiding conflict but setting the strategy in managing conflict. Resolving conflicts is not similar to repressing conflict, it emphases on the right ways in managing conflicts for getting the positive impacts of conflicts.

25|$|Agreeableness is of {{fundamental}} importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and {{good relations with}} others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this {{it has also been}} implicated in outcomes to <b>conflict</b> <b>management</b> skills, school adjustment, peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness {{has been found to be}} a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} context of {{organizational}} {{changes and the}} inevitable conflicts coming with these changes, worker representatives are confronted with new challenges in negotiation. Worker representatives act as mediator in organizational <b>conflicts</b> between <b>management</b> and employees. New and complex issues and growing diversity in constituents can increase stress of worker representatives. On the basis of models of interpersonal conflict at work (e. g. Frone, 2000), we analyze the relation between frequency and severity of <b>conflict</b> with <b>management</b> and co-workers, and burnout. Thus, we hypothesize that: a.) frequency and intensity of <b>conflict</b> with <b>management</b> and with co-workers are positively related with burn out; b) This effect is stronger for conflict with co-workers (in-group), compared with <b>conflict</b> with <b>management</b> (out-group); c.) <b>conflict</b> with co-workers plays a moderator effect in the relation between <b>conflict</b> with <b>management</b> and burnout. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 719 Spanish worker representatives using multiple regression analysis. Results confirm our three main hypotheses and show that conflict with the constituency affects more strongly the perceived burnout by worker representatives. Based on organizational psychology and sociological theories we discuss different reasons that justify these results. Studying predictors from burnout in worker representatives contribute to promote the well-being {{in the practice of}} their role. We put into practice improvement strategies through knowledge transfer and action plans which can help to improve the role of worker representatives in the new industrial relations context. status: publishe...|$|R

Therefore, to improve the work of such organizations, {{it is necessary to}} study and understand the dynamics of information sharing and international cooperation among these geographically separated VTs. There are many researchers who talk about VTs, but they do not go into deep details about the importance of leadership, <b>conflicting</b> <b>management,</b> and communication tools. We start this research from the points of view of the people who play different roles in VTs. In order to get more realistic results, all the given suggestions and solutions must be more practical and meaningful. Our paper focuses on the factors that should be taken into consideration to get a dynamic VT. As a result, we come up with some advices and recommendations to lead VTs to become as successful as possible based on using communication tools, <b>conflicting</b> <b>management,</b> and leadership skills...|$|R
