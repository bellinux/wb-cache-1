50|$|Sweet corn (Zea mays convar. saccharata var. rugosa; {{also called}} sugar corn and pole corn) is {{a variety of}} maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn {{is the result of}} a {{naturally}} occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet <b>corn</b> is <b>picked</b> when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy.|$|R

40|$|Before the {{invention}} of a combine harvester, <b>corn</b> was <b>picked</b> on the ear and threshed later. This led to an availability of corn cobs and many uses were found. A renewed interest in the heat/energy value of the cob has increased the focus on harvesting corn cobs. A corn cob separation system was developed and installed on a single pass biomass harvesting combine. The system included a blower and two fans and the combine was capable of harvesting grain only, grain and stover, and grain and cobs. The cob separation system was evaluated using a stationary test with earcorn and stover bales with minimal field testing to validate the lab tests. The stationary tests evaluated 5 different separation zone configurations, 2 blower speeds, and 2 fan speeds. Cob purity averaged 71 % and the collection efficiency averaged 84 % with fan power consumption of 20 and 36 kW and blower power consumption of 3. 1 and 5. 3 kW.

40|$|A common {{technique}} in cold climates to speed maturity in sweet corn {{is to start}} the corn under plastic or floating row cover. Once the corn is from one to two feet tall, the plastic or row cover is removed. Because {{it is so much}} farther advanced than sweet corn planted on bare ground the crop attracts early season european corn borer (ECB). Scouting for insect damage is difficult or impossible because the larvae are deep in the plant. Over the last 3 - 4 years, working with two large-scale growers of row cover sweet corn, a successful technique for insect control was identified. Pheromone traps next to the fields are used to monitor early season flight patterns. At flight peaks, the grower waits 3 to 4 days, than applies an insecticide spray. After another 3 - 4 days, a second insecticide application, if needed, is made. No further applications are necessary. During the summer of 2004, we attempted to duplicate previous work with the two growers. Monitoring the pheromone traps, we kept waiting for a peak. The peak never came and we therefore never sprayed the row cover corm. Prior to harvest, an evaluation for insect infestation was carried out and we found very low levels of infestation, 5 - 6 %. Both growers found this level of infestation acceptable. These growers direct market their corn and basically screen out bad <b>corn</b> when hand <b>picking</b> and when they put the corn out for purchase.

30|$|This way, by {{encouraging}} farmers to grow biomass crops {{together with their}} food crops, they would become the drivers of socially responsible development. As a matter of fact, the local production of energy from the processing of renewable resources, will gradually replace imported conventional fossil fuels (i.e. kerosene). The introduction of the gasification system in the village economy would allow to integrate the ongoing projects on agricultural development with energy production, thus leading to a closed productive cycle. The improvement of the corn agriculture provided by other development projects will allow the increasing of food products on the local market. Overall, the production of energy through the gasification process would have many positive externalizations. For example, increase in agricultural production will lead to an improvement of the employment rates, especially in rural areas such as Fongo Tongo, where the per capita agricultural growth and the rising farm incomes are the real drivers of economic development. Moreover, increase in food production will lead to energy production so that rising farm incomes can be coupled with other economic activities in the medium to long term. In fact productive uses of energy are directly connected to agriculture, small industry, commercial services, and social services like drinking water, education, and health care. These activities will in turn increase incomes and, as incomes increase, rural populations {{are better able to}} afford greater levels of energy service, which can allow even greater use of renewable energy. Energy could also empower education, as the School of Fongo Tongo would not be subject to energy cuts, rather, it would benefit from constant energy supply. Finally, social inclusion would be fostered, as women would play a fundamental role in working together to cultivate <b>corn</b> and <b>picking</b> it up. Their role is then very important as they would be actor of all the agricultural activities leading to increase food production and collecting and processing corn cobs. Their direct involvement together with their role within their households and for children’s education, would make women a knowledge hub with regard to sustainable development issues. This would eventually increase the awareness towards environmental issues and amplify the resonance of the whole project. Of course, such externalizations cannot be the result of only one gasifier. The idea behind this study is that energy demand will increase over time. However, this increase, if addressed following the principles of sustainable development, will take into account both the needs of the population and the problems that energy may cause in the long run.|$|R

On Sundays {{many people in the}} country go to church and afterward prepare a variety of foods at home. Dinner on Sundays is often eaten earlier (around 2:00 pm) because people are often off from work on Sundays. Dinners may include pork, baked chicken, stewed lamb, or turkey, alongside rice (prepared in a variety of ways), macaroni pie, salads, and a local drink. Dessert may be ice cream and cake or an apple pie (mango and pineapple pie in their season) or Jello. Antiguan Butter Bread is also a main stable of Antiguan cuisine, a soft buttery loaf of bread that needs no butter added once baked. Many locals enjoy fresh baked butter bread and cheese for breakfast and throughout the day. There are many homes in neighborhoods all over Antigua that have small bakeries built on to them, where locals can go and purchase these fresh baked loaves. They are coupled with cheese, sardines, and a bright red sausage that locals sometimes call salami, and many other foods. They also have what is called provisions with most meals. Provisions are foods that are usually a root or starch like potatoes, yams, sweet potatoes, eddo, etc. During Carnival time souse a type of soup made very spicy with pigs feet, knuckles, and tails with lots of onions is a popular snack, sold by vendors {{on the side of the}} road.

Antes da colheita do milho, colheram-se manualmente as espigas de trÃs fileiras de milho em quatro metros, onde avaliaram-se o nÃmero de fileira de grÃos, nÃmero de grÃos por fileira, diÃmetro de espiga, comprimento de espiga, posterior a essas avaliaÃÃes, foi realizada a trilhagem das espigas para mensuraÃÃo dos dados de produtividade. Os resultados encontrados no primeiro estudo demonstram que a aveia tem sua produÃÃo de matÃria seca reduzida quando em associaÃÃo com o cornichÃo, mas a produÃÃo total (aveia+cornichÃo) iguala-se aos demais tratamentos. No primeiro ano a produÃÃo de matÃria seca da aveia preta foi superior quando associada com cornichÃo no segundo corte (3750 kg ha- 1) em comparaÃÃo ao obtido no sistema de plantio direto da aveia preta (2599 kg ha- 1). No segundo ano, a maior produÃÃo de matÃria seca da aveia preta ocorreu antes do segundo pastejo sob sistema de plantio direto (4451, 98 kg ha- 1). A aveia eleva o meristema apical com a sucessÃo de pastejos ou cortes. A aveia preta apresenta antes dos primeiros pastejos, elevado valor nutricional, com altos teores mÃdios de proteÃna (22, 25 %) em todos os tratamentos. Entretanto, no final do seu ciclo a associaÃÃo do cornichÃo com a aveia, contribuiu para elevar os teores de proteÃna bruta da forragem visto que esta encontra-se em estÃgio final do seu ciclo. A digestibilidade {{in vitro}} da MS foi elevada tanto para aveia preta cultivada sob sistema de plantio convencional (73, 04 %) e direto (77, 05 %), quanto para o cornichÃo (78, 37 %), decrescendo com o final do ciclo da aveia. NÃo foi verificado benefÃcios para o cultivo do milho em sucessÃo a leguminosa, devendo realizados novos ensaios avaliando possÃveis causas, entre elas efeito alelopÃtico e competiÃÃo entre plantasWere conducted for two years, with two studies {{to evaluate the}} use of oat long cycle Iapar 61 single or grown in association with legumes birdsfoot trefoil, with planting of corn in succession as a summer crop. The first study evaluated the structural, production characteristics, nutritional value of oat (Avena strigosa Iapar 61) grown single or associated with birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus cv. St. Gabriel). The second experiment was conducted in two years with the aim to evaluate the structural, production characteristics, gas exchange IRGA (Infra Red Gas Analyser, Li - 6400 XT, Licor, Lincoln, Nebraska) and chlorophyll content (SPAD index) of maize grown in succession to winter crops mentioned above. In the first experiment, two courts of oats in the first year and grazing periods in the second year, with average intervals of 30 days. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with split plot, with the first year: two cropping systems: single or intercropped with birdsfoot trefoil with two periods of four replicates and oats oatmeal. In the second year, four tillage systems: conventional tillage oats, oat stubble tillage on corn, oats overseeded area of birdsfoot trefoil and single, with three cycles of growth and four replications. In the second study with corn, the experimental design used in the first and second year was a randomized split plot with blocks respectively. The following winter crops Corn was studied in succession: oat conventional tillage, no-till oats, oats in combination with birdsfoot trefoil, birdsfoot single, oats associated with nitrogen fertilization on ryegrass and oats associated with ryegrass nitrogen fertilization, with four replications. After planting corn the second year, we assessed the structural features for 70 days. Before the <b>corn</b> harvest, were <b>picked</b> manually ears of corn in three rows of four meters, which evaluated the number of grain rows, number of kernels per row, ear diameter, ear length, subsequent to these reviews, was made the threshing of grain for measurement of productivity data. The findings of the first study show that oats have reduced their production when combined with birdsfoot dry matter, but the total production (oat + birdsfoot trefoil) equates to the other treatments. In the first year dry matter yield of oats was higher when associated with birdsfoot the second cut (3750 kg ha - 1) compared to that obtained in the tillage of oat (2599 kg ha - 1). In the second year, the highest dry matter production of oat occurred before the second grazing under no-tillage (4451. 98 kg ha - 1). Oats elevates the apical meristem with the succession of grazing or cutting. The oat presents before the first grazing, high nutritional value, with high average levels of protein (22. 25 %) for all treatments. However, {{at the end of its}} cycle the association of birdsfoot trefoil with oats, helped to raise the crude protein content of forage as this is in the final stage of its cycle. In vitro digestibility of DM was high for both oat grown under conventional tillage (73. 04 %) and direct (77. 05 %), and for birdsfoot trefoil (78. 37 %), but decreased at the end of the cycle oat. There was no benefit to the cultivation of corn grown after legume and should performed new tests assessing possible causes, including allelopathic effect and competition among plant...|$|R
