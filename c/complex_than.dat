5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum {{that are more}} <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> sponges, about as complex as ctenophores (comb jellies), and less <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are more <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores form {{an animal}} phylum {{that is more}} <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> sponges, about as complex as cnidarians (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), and less <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> bilaterians (which include almost all other animals). Unlike sponges, both ctenophores and cnidarians have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.|$|E

Cultures exposed to drug concentrations near the blood therapeutic level phagocytize and digest more immune <b>complexes</b> <b>than</b> control cultures.

5|$|Fauré did {{not intend}} the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His {{publisher}} collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as 8 pièces brèves, allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.|$|E
5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

Although the game's core gameplay mechanics, story and narrative are unchanged in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 ports, some features (such as the Nemesis system) are less <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. According to the game's developer, the Nemesis system was too large for older consoles.|$|E

5|$|Sonatas and Interludes is a {{collection}} of twenty pieces for prepared piano by American avant-garde composer John Cage (1912–1992). It was composed in 1946–48, shortly after Cage's introduction to Indian philosophy and the teachings of art historian Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, both of which became major influences on the composer's later work. Significantly more <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> his other works for prepared piano, Sonatas and Interludes is generally recognized as one of Cage's finest achievements.|$|E
5|$|The classic view {{describes}} a solitary hunter, ranging the oceans {{in search of}} food. However, this applies to only a few species. Most live far more social, sedentary, benthic lives, and appear likely {{to have their own}} distinct personalities. Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds, which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year. Shark migration patterns may be even more <b>complex</b> <b>than</b> in birds, with many sharks covering entire ocean basins.|$|E
