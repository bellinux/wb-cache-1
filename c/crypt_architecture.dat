25|$|Biopsies of the mucosa {{are taken}} to {{definitively}} diagnose UC and differentiate it from Crohn's disease, which is managed differently clinically. Microbiological samples are typically taken {{at the time of}} endoscopy. The pathology in ulcerative colitis typically involves distortion of <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture,</b> inflammation of crypts (cryptitis), frank crypt abscesses, and hemorrhage or inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. In cases where the clinical picture is unclear, the histomorphologic analysis often plays a pivotal role in determining the diagnosis and thus the management. By contrast, a biopsy analysis may be indeterminate, and thus the clinical progression of the disease must inform its treatment.|$|E

40|$|Histopathology {{can play}} an {{important}} role in diagnosing infictious colitis for several reasons. First, colonic mucosal biopsy can often reliably differentiate acute self limited colitis (ASLC). or infectious type colitis, from idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In ASLC, <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> is normal and the inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria predominantly acute, ie, polymorphonuclear cells. In IBD, in contrast, <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> is often abnormal nd the inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria in both acute and chronic, ie, polymorphonuclear cells, plasma cells,and lymphocyte are present in increased numbers. Second, biopsy may give a clue to the specific infection. Biopsy may reveal the presence of specific parasites such as Entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidia or schistosomiasis. Viral inclusions are seen when cytomegalovirus or herpes simplex type II virus infect the colon. Granulomas usually indicate Crohn's disease but can he seen with infections due to Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Both chlamydial and syphilitic proctitis are rare and usually seen in homosexually active men. Finally, pseudomembranes, when present, suggest pseudomembranous colitis due to an overgrowth of toxigenic Clostridium difficile. In summary, mucosal biopsy is helpful in differentiating ASLC from IBD in most cases. Sometimes, it provides a clue to the specific infection...|$|E
40|$|AIMS To {{investigate}} whether drugs others than mycophenolic acid and ipilimumab might cause graft-versus-host-like apoptotic enteropathy, the clinicopathological findings in four patients were examined who had developed watery diarrhoea and apoptotic enteropathy (three cases from colon and one case from ileal pouch) after intake of antimetabolites (methotrexate and capecitabine) and/or tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors (etanercept and infliximab). METHODS The clinical charts, endoscopy reports and intestinal biopsies from all endoscopies were reviewed for all patients. Biopsies were evaluated semiquantitatively for apoptosis of basal crypts, dilated damaged crypts, defined as cystically dilated crypts with flattened degenerated epithelium containing apoptotic debris and few neutrophils, and mucosal architecture. Further, {{the presence of}} intraepithelial lymphocytes, chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria and mucosal ulcerations was recorded and immunohistochemical analysis for human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus was performed. RESULTS Endoscopic examination revealed normal mucosa in two patients, whereas the other two showed focal ulcerations. Histological changes included increased apoptosis of basal crypts, the presence of dilated damaged <b>crypts</b> and <b>architecture</b> distortion. In all cases, a temporal association between drug intake and/or dose increase, and onset of diarrhoea, was observed, and no convincing evidence of other potentially underlying causes of colitis/enteritis was found, including infections. CONCLUSIONS Pathologists {{should be aware of}} the expanding spectrum of drugs that can cause apoptotic enteropathy, including antimetabolites and tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid {{has shown}} promise in {{attenuation}} of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the protective effects of ascorbic acid on intestinal morphology during IR injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined morphological changes in the small intestine of Wistar rats after (i) 40 minutes of ischemia (I), (ii) ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion (IR), (iii) ischemia with ascorbic acid (IA), (iv) ischemia followed by reperfusion and ascorbic acid (IRA) and (v) in a sham group (S). We used morphometry to evaluate the amount of villous <b>architecture,</b> <b>crypts,</b> necrosis, hemorrhagic infarcts and inflammatory cells at the mesenteric and antimesenteric borders of the small intestine. RESULTS: Ascorbic acid caused a significant reduction of antimesenteric villous hemorrhagic infarction (p< 0. 05) of the small intestine after ischemia followed by reperfusion as well as villous necrosis reduction at both borders after ischemia (p< 0. 05). The lesions found in the small intestine were more prominent along the antimesenteric margin.

We examined the role of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) in mesenchymal organization and the mechanisms by which perturbations in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions affect ISC fate. METHODS: We generated mice with intestinal epithelial-specific disruption of Ihh. Gross and microscopic anatomical changes were determined using histologic, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization analyses. Molecular mechanisms were elucidated by expression profiling and in vitro analyses. RESULTS: Deletion of intestinal epithelial Ihh disrupted the intestinal mesenchymal architecture, demonstrated by loss of the muscularis mucosae, deterioration of the extracellular matrix, and reductions in numbers of crypt myofibroblasts. Concurrently, the epithelial compartment had increased Wnt signaling, disturbed <b>crypt</b> polarity and <b>architecture,</b> defective enterocyte differentiation, and increased and ectopic proliferation that was accompanied by increased numbers of ISCs. Mechanistic studies revealed that Hh inhibition deregulates bone morphogenetic protein signaling, increases matrix metalloproteinase levels, and disrupts extracellular matrix proteins, fostering a proliferative environment for ISCs and progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Ihh regulates ISC self-renewal and differentiation. Intestinal epithelial Ihh signals to the mesenchymal compartment to regulate formation and proliferation of mesenchymal cells, which in turn affect epithelial proliferation and differentiation. These findings {{provide a basis for}} analyses {{of the role of the}} muscularis mucosae in ISC regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: A {{recently}} developed probe-based, confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) system provides images of surface colonic epithelium in vivo during any endoscopy. Our {{objective was to}} assess interobserver agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy in the diagnosis of neoplasia using pCLE. Patients and methods: 53 patients undergoing surveillance and screening colonoscopies were enrolled. A total of 75 lesions, were detected and all were inspected by pCLE prior to sampling or polypectomy. Intravenous fluorescein was used to optimize tissue contrast. Three pCLE users, blinded to histopathologic and endoscopic findings, reviewed the set of video sequences for <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture,</b> vessel architecture, and colorectal neoplasia diagnosis. Histopathologic diagnosis from the corresponding biopsies was the reference gold standard. Results: Of the 75 colorectal lesions, 50 were neoplastic and 25 non-neoplastic. Interobserver agreement was moderate to good for the classification of neoplasia (kappa 0. 55, 78 % pairwise agreement), and moderate for vessel architecture (kappa 0. 41, 67 % pairwise agreement) and <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> (kappa 0. 49, 69 % pairwise agreement). In distinguishing between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 76 %, 72 % and 75 %, respectively. When videos of good or excellent quality only were considered, interobserver agreement for classification of neoplasia was higher (kappa 0. 83, 92 % pairwise agreement), as were sensitivity (88 %), specificity (89 %), and accuracy (88 %).

40|$|Forming tissues in the {{laboratory}} to replace diseased or dysfunctional tissue or act as models for drug treatment {{is the goal of}} tissue engineering. The large intestine epithelium (colon surface) is a tissue which could benefit from both diseased and non-diseased models for the purpose of tackling colon cancer causes and treatments. Scaffolds (cell supports) are a pivotal part in many tissue engineering strategies. This thesis describes the design and production of two separate scaffolds based on the degradable polymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). The first was a two dimensional scaffold to mimic the intestinal basement membrane which was modified with an oxygen plasma. The changes to the surface due to plasma and the degradation properties of the scaffold were extensively studied with SEM, XPS, AFM and GPC. The data showed that the oxygen plasma induced surface porosity and associated changes to surface roughness. The surface chemistry as detected by XPS was unchanged by both plasma treatment and degradation in buffered solution. The plasma treatment did lead to a dramatic loss in molecular weight but the degradation profile of both the untreated and etched films was similar. Extensive cell studies with SEM, live/dead, alamarBlue and Hoechst DNA assays showed that intestinal cells on the plasma treated scaffold was enhanced in terms of morphology, metabolic activity and proliferation. Finally, a two dimensional co-culture model using epithelial and myofibroblasts cell lines on the modified PLGA scaffold was achieved. The second scaffold was a three dimensional scaffold bearing the <b>crypt</b> like <b>architecture</b> of the colon. An accurate mould produced through electron beam lithography using dimensions measured from mouse histological sections. PLGA particles were used to fill the mould and sintered to produce the scaffold. A unique cell seeding approach using cell sheets was used. The cell sheets were produced on plasma polymers of acrylic acid and the discharge power was shown to affect surface wettability, chemistry and cell viability. The cell sheet approach proved to enhance cell attachment to the scaffold compared to individual cell seeding. Finally, a bilayer scaffold with model protein to mimic Wnt protein presence in {{the lower half of the}} crypt was studied with ToF-SIMS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Guanylate Cyclase C (GC-C; Gucy 2 c) is a transmembrane {{receptor}} {{expressed in}} intestinal epithelial cells. Activation of GC-C by its secreted ligand guanylin stimulates intestinal fluid secretion. Familial mutations in GC-C cause chronic diarrheal disease or constipation and {{are associated with}} intestinal inflammation and infection. Here, we investigated the impact of GC-C activity on mucosal immune responses. Methods: We utilized intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide to elicit a systemic cytokine challenge and then measured pro-inflammatory gene expression in colonic mucosa. GC-C+/+ and GC-C 2 / 2 mice were bred with interleukin (IL) - 10 deficient animals and colonic inflammation were assessed. Immune cell influx and cytokine/chemokine expression was measured in the colon of wildtype, IL- 102 / 2, GC-C+/+IL- 102 / 2 and GC-C 2 / 2 IL- 102 / 2 mice. GC-C and guanylin production were examined in the colon of these animals and in a cytokine-treated colon epithelial cell line. Results: Relative to GC-C+/+ animals, intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide injection into GC-C 2 / 2 mice increased proinflammatory gene expression in both whole colon tissue and in partially purified colonocyte isolations. Spontaneous colitis in GC-C 2 / 2 IL- 102 / 2 animals was significantly more severe relative to GC-C+/+IL- 102 / 2 mice.

40|$|Colonic crypts are stereotypical {{structures}} with distinct stem cell, proliferating, and differentiating compartments. Colorectal cancers {{derive from}} colonic crypt epithelia but, in contrast, form morphologically disarrayed glands.

A subset of colon cancers showed crypt-like compartments with high WNT activity and nuclear b-Catenin at the leading tumor edge, adjacent proliferation, and enhanced Cytokeratin 20 expression in most differentiated tumor epithelia of the tumor center. This architecture strongly depended on growth conditions, and was fully reproducible in mouse xenografts of cultured and primary colon cancer cells. Full crypt-like organization was associated with low tumor grade and was an independent prognostic marker of better survival {{in a collection of}} 221 colorectal cancers.

40|$|The {{colorectal}} carcinoma {{represents one}} of the most common and aggressive malignancies, still characterized by an unacceptable mortality rate, mainly due to the high metastatic potential and to a late diagnosis.

Several studies proposed aberrant colonic crypt foci as the earliest recognizable step of transformation in colonic multiphase carcinogenesis. We previously demonstrated the clinical applicability and predictive power of probe-based confocal laser endoscopy (pCLE) in superficial colorectal neoplastic lesions and also characterized in vivo a case of dysplasia-associated lesional mass (DALM) in ulcerative colitis. Now, we aim to evaluate the accuracy of pCLE in the detection of ACF comparing in double-blind manner the microendoscopic and histopathological features resulting from colonic biopsy.

40|$|Perfect human {{stem cell}} genetic {{fidelity}} would prevent aging and cancer. However, perfection {{would be difficult}} to achieve, and aging is universal and cancers common. A hypothesis is that because mutations are inevitable over a human lifetime, downstream mechanisms have evolved to manage the deleterious effects of beneficial and lethal mutations. In the colon, a <b>crypt</b> stem cell <b>architecture</b> reduces the number of mitotic cells at risk for mutation accumulation, and multiple niche stem cells ensure that a lethal mutation within any single stem cell does not lead to crypt death. In addition, the architecture of the colon crypt stem cell niche may harness probability or chance to randomly discard many beneficial mutations that might lead to cancer. An analysis of somatic chromosome copy number alterations (CNAs) reveals a lack of perfect fidelity in individual normal human crypts, with age-related increases and higher frequencies in ulcerative colitis, a proliferative, inflammatory disease. The age-related increase in somatic CNAs appears consistent with relatively normal replication error and cell division rates. Surprisingly, and similar to point mutations in cancer genomes, the types of crypt mutations were more consistent with random fixation rather than selection. In theory, a simple non-Darwinian way to nullify selection is {{to reduce the size of}} the reproducing population. Fates are more determined by chance rather than selection in very small populations, and therefore selection may be minimized within small crypt niches. The desired effect is that many beneficial mutations that might lead to cancer are randomly lost by drift rather than fixed by selection. The subdivision of the colon into multiple very small stem cell niches may trade Darwinian evolution for non-Darwinian somatic cell evolution, capitulating to aging but reducing cancer risks...|$|R

Acetic acid produced an acute inflammatory response in the colon, associated with a markedly raised inflammation score (15. 8 vs. < 0. 5), based on a seven-scaled scoring system which includes observation of haemorrhage, submucosal oedema, cellular infiltration, goblet cell depletion, loss of <b>architecture,</b> <b>crypt</b> abscesses and serosal involvement, of which every item was subdivided as mild, moderate and severe. Incubation of colonic mucosa from rats treated with arachidonic acid and stimulated with A 23187 showed an increase of the cyclooxygenase product 12 -hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and the 12 - 1 ipoxygenase product (12 -HETE) and a decrease in the formation of 6 -keto-prostaglandin FI(6 kPGFI) in comparison with normal rat mucosa. Malotilate, ZY 16268 and ZY 16369 all resulted in a decrease in HHT, leukotriene B (LTB 4) -like compounds and 12 -hydroxyeicosaenoic acid (12 -HETE) production. None of the tested compounds significantly reduced the colonic damage by acetic acid although the formation of 12 -HETE was proportional to the histologically obtained inflammation score. There were marked differences in eicosanoid formation patterns between rat and human mucosa, both normal and inflamed. In view of the hyperacute nature of the mucosal damage and the marked differences in eicosanoid production, acetic acid induced colitis in rats is probably not a suitable model of ulcerative colitis in humans.

40|$|A novel spatial {{multiscale}} {{model of}} a colonic crypt is described, which couples the cell cycle (including cell division) with the mechanics of cell movement. The model is used to investigate the process of monoclonal conversion under two hypotheses concerning stem cell behavior. Under the first hypothesis, ‘stem-ness’ is an intrinsic cell property, and the stem cell population is maintained through asymmetric division. Under the second hypothesis, the proliferative behavior of each cell is governed by its microenvironment through a biochemical signalling cue, and all cell division is symmetric. Under each hypothesis, the model is used to run virtual experiments, in which a harmless labeling mutation is bestowed upon a single cell in the crypt and the mutant clonal population is tracked over time to check {{if and when the}} crypt becomes monoclonal. It is shown that under the first hypothesis, a stable structured cell population is not possible without some form of population-dependent feedback; in contrast, under the second hypothesis, a stable <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> arises naturally.

Nevertheless, we previously showed that germline CSF- 1 receptor (Csf 1 r) knock out (KO) or Csf 1 mutation is associated with an absence of mature PC, reduced crypt proliferation and lowered stem cell gene, Lgr 5 expression.

The induction of GI-specific Csf 1 r deletion in young adult mice also led to PC loss over a period of weeks, in accord with the anticipated long life span of PC, changed distribution of proliferating cells and this was with a commensurate loss of Lgr 5 and other stem cell marker gene expression. By culturing SI organoids, we further show that the Csf 1 r−/− defect in PC production is intrinsic to epithelial cells as well as definitively affecting stem cell activity.

In non-neoplastic UC epithelium, p 16 was expressed in 33 % of crypts (the proliferative compartment) compared to< 1 % of normal controls. p 16 expression did not correlate with degree of inflammation but did correlate with the degree of <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> distortion (P =. 002) —a reflection of epithelial regeneration. In coimmunofluorescence studies with Ki 67, p 16 expression was associated with cell cycle arrest (P<. 001). Both UC and normal crypts displayed evidence for the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, and p 16 was induced in primary cultures of normal epithelial cells by ionizing irradiation (IR). However, induction by IR displayed delayed kinetics, implying that p 16 is not an immediate target of the checkpoint pathway. These findings support a model in which p 16 is induced as an “emergency brake” in cells experiencing sustained replicative stress...|$|E
40|$|There are {{no reports}} {{on the degree of}} {{inflammation}} in the residual rectal mucosa in asymptomatic UC patients after an operation for ileal pouch anal canal anastomosis（ IACA）. Methods: We studied the residual rectal mucosal biopsies and rectal mucosa from the surgical specimens of 12 asymptomatic postoperative UC cases. We analyzed the degree of inflammation, including <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> and mucus content in the rectal mucosa. Results: Two pathological active cases （ 16. 7 %）, four resolving cases （ 33. 3 %）, and six remission cases （ 50 %） were observed in the residual rectal mucosa. In terms of the degree of pathological inflammation in the residual rectal mucosa, one case （ 1 / 12, 8. 3 %） was upregulated, seven cases （ 7 / 12, 58. 3 %） were stable, and four cases （ 4 / 12, 33. 3 %） were downregulated compared with the rectal mucosa of the surgical specimens. Conclusions: We determined the natural history of the degree of inflammation on the residual rectal mucosa in postoperative UC patients. Eight cases （ 8 / 12, 66. 6 %） of asymptomatic UC patients were associated with prolonged inflammation after an IACA operation in the residual rectal mucosa compared with that in the rectal mucosa of the surgical specimens. Therefore, we could identify patients with prolonged inflammation in asymptomatic UC cases by a residual rectal mucosal biopsy...|$|E
40|$|Probe-based {{confocal}} laser endomicroscopy (pCLE; Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) enables in vivo histology during colonoscopy and {{may allow}} endoscopists to make real-time diagnoses. A collaboration of five experts proposed a new pCLE classification for colonic use. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess interobserver agreement and accuracy of the new pCLE classification in the colon. Eligible patients were prospectively investigated by pCLE. A subset of 13  pCLE video sequences was reviewed post hoc for the establishment of a new classification, which comprised three vessel categories and seven crypt categories. All five blinded observers then scored another set of 102 video sequences, using the new classification. Histopathology was used as a reference standard. The interobserver agreements on vessel and <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> were 'fair' with kappa values of 0. 29 and 0. 27, respectively. When the classification was reduced to neoplasia vs. non-neoplasia (i. e. vessel or crypt type 3), overall agreement became 'moderate' (κ = 0. 56). Overall sensitivity and specificity for predicting neoplasia was 66 % and 83 %, respectively. When all observers agreed (69 % of videos), the corresponding figures became 80 % and 95 %. A new classification for pCLE in the colon had a 'moderate' interobserver agreement for differentiating neoplasia from non-neoplastic tissue in the colon. The overall accuracy (81 %) for predicting neoplasia was acceptable and became excellent (94 %) when all five observers agreed. Future research should focus on refinement and validation of the classificatio...|$|E
40|$|Dextran {{sodium sulfate}} (DSS) -induced colitis in mice is {{characterized}} by polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration into the colonic mucosa and lumen. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. To {{begin to understand the}} mechanism, we determined the role of the PMN chemokine receptor, CXCR 2, in DSS-induced colitis by using CXCR 2 (-/-) mice or by neutralizing CXCR 2. DSS was administered through drinking water to CXCR 2 (-/-) and BALB/c mice for 5 days followed by regular water for 1 day. In the neutralization study, mice were injected with control serum or goat anti-CXCR 2 antiserum. BALB/c mice receiving DSS and control serum-injected mice receiving DSS lost weight and showed considerable clinical illness. Histological observation revealed submucosal edema, PMN infiltration into the submucosa and mucosa, extensive crypt damage with abscesses, and ulceration. In contrast, both the CXCR 2 (-/-) and anti-CXCR 2 antiserum-treated mice gained weight and had significantly lower symptom scores. Histology of these mice showed submucosal edema but relatively intact <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> and very few ulcers. Significantly fewer PMNs were found in the mucosa in anti-CXCR 2 antiserum compared with control serum-injected inflamed mice, but no significant difference in eosinophil infiltration was observed between the groups. Our experiments identify a role for CXCR 2 in DSS-induced colitis and suggest that antagonizing CXCR 2 provides some therapeutic efficacy, possibly by impeding PMN recruitment into the mucosa. Antagonizing CXCR 2 may form the basis for therapeutic drugs directed at controlling colitis...|$|E
40|$|To {{measure the}} effects of defunction in the anorectum, 12 {{patients}} (seven men and five women aged 59 (44 - 81) years) were studied after the Hartmann operation. The operation was for septic complications of diverticular disease in nine and sigmoid carcinoma in three patients. Physiology studies were undertaken 1 and 3 months after surgery, and diversion colitis was assessed endoscopically and by mucosal biopsy at 3 months. There was no change in anal sphincter function by three months. Proctometrogram studies, however, showed an appreciable decrease in rectal volume in all cases, by a mean of 35 % of the 1 month volume. The maximum tolerable volume at 1 month was 157 (111 - 210) ml and at 3 months 87 (71 - 145) ml; p < 0. 01. There was no change in rectal sensation or compliance. Erythema and granularity without gross erosions or ulceration were found at endoscopy. Histology showed abnormalities in all cases by 3 months. The characteristic features were of a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with surface exudate, microscopic erosions, and lymphoid follicular hyperplasia. Crypt abscesses were not a feature at this stage {{and there was no}} distortion of <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture.</b> After defunction the previously normal rectum is affected by diversion colitis which, at 3 months, is mild but has characteristics that distinguish the changes from those of inflammatory bowel disease. It is associated with progressive rectal stump involution...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of a Citrobacter rodentium infection {{was evaluated}} in mice fed diets {{with a single}} deficiency in either selenium or vitamin E or with a double deficiency in both selenium and vitamin E compared to mice on nutritionally adequate diets. Mice fed the selenium- and vitamin E-deficient diet for 6 weeks had increased loads of C. rodentium in the colon and spleen, which were not observed in mice fed either of the singly deficient diets or the adequate diet. Infected mice fed the doubly deficient diet had increased colon crypt hyperplasia and an influx of infiltrating cells along with gross changes to <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture,</b> including ulceration and denuding of the epithelial layer. Cytokine and chemokine mRNA levels in the colon were measured by real-time PCR. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines was upregulated on day 12 after infection with C. rodentium in mice fed the doubly deficient diet compared to mice fed the control diet. Heme oxygenase 1, an enzyme upregulated by oxidative stress, also was more highly induced in infected mice fed the doubly deficient diet. Production of C. rodentium antigen-specific IgM and IgG antibodies was not affected by feeding the doubly deficient diet. The results indicated that selenium and vitamin E {{play an important role}} in host resistance and in the pathology induced by C. rodentium, an infection that mimics disease caused by common food-borne bacterial pathogens in humans...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Barrett's {{oesophagus}} shows appearances {{described as}} ‘intestinal metaplasia’, in structures called ‘crypts’ {{but do not}} typically display <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture.</b> Here, we investigate their relationship to gastric glands. Methods: Cell proliferation and migration within Barrett's glands was assessed by Ki 67 and iododeoxyuridine (IdU) labelling. Expression of mucin core proteins (MUC), trefoil family factor (TFF) peptides and LGR 5 mRNA was determined by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridisation, and clonality was elucidated using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations combined with mucin histochemistry. Results: Proliferation predominantly occurs {{in the middle of}} Barrett's glands, diminishing towards the surface and the base: IdU dynamics demonstrate bidirectional migration, similar to gastric glands. Distribution of MUC 5 AC, TFF 1, MUC 6 and TFF 2 in Barrett's mirrors pyloric glands and is preserved in Barrett's dysplasia. MUC 2 -positive goblet cells are localised above the neck in Barrett's glands, and TFF 3 is concentrated in the same region.

40|$|Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as {{ulcerative}} colitis, cause significant {{morbidity and}} decreased quality of life. The currently available treatments are not effective in all patients, {{can be expensive}} and have potential to cause severe side effects. This prompts {{the need for new}} treatment modalities. Enoxaparin, a widely used antithrombotic agent, is reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties and therefore we evaluated its therapeutic potential in a mouse model of colitis. Acute colitis was induced in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice by administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Mice were treated once daily with enoxaparin via oral or intraperitoneal administration and monitored for colitis activities. On termination (day 8), colons were collected for macroscopic evaluation and cytokine measurement, and processed for histology and immunohistochemistry. Oral but not intraperitoneal administration of enoxaparin significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis. Oral enoxaparin-treated mice retained their body weight and displayed less diarrhea and fecal blood loss compared to the untreated colitis group. Colon weight in enoxaparin-treated mice was significantly lower, indicating reduced inflammation and edema. Histological examination of untreated colitis mice showed a massive loss of <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> and goblet cells, infiltration of immune cells and the presence of edema, while all aspects of this pathology were alleviated by oral enoxaparin. Reduced number of macrophages in the colon of oral enoxaparin-treated mice was accompanied by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oral enoxaparin significantly reduces the inflammatory pathology associated with DSS-induced colitis in mice and could therefore represent a novel therapeutic option for the management of ulcerative colitis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMethotrexate (MTX), a {{folic acid}} {{antagonist}} agent, is mainly used in treatment of malignant tumors and autoimmune diseases. Vitamin A is essential for normal growth and differentiation of epithelial tissues. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of methotrexate on the histological structure of jejunal mucosa and to assess the possible protective role of vitamin A. Fifty adult male albino rats divided into three groups; a control, vit A and experimental group subdivided into two groups (B and C), experimental group (B) received 4 mg of methotrexate intraperitoneally as a single dose, and experimental group (C) received methotrexate and 1000 IU of vitamin A given three days before MTX administration and continued until the rats were sacrificed. The specimens were prepared for histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructure examination. Morphometric study was also done and statistical results were analyzed. Light and electron microscopic studies revealed structural alterations in group (B) in the form of disturbance of villus and <b>crypt</b> <b>architecture.</b> Dilatation of RER cisternae, swollen mitochondria with destroyed cristae vacuolation of the cytoplasm and lipid droplets in some cells were observed with widening of the intercellular space. Corrugation and indentation of the nuclear membrane and exfoliation of epithelial cells. PCNA showed a significant decrease in the number of PCNA-positive nuclei in the crypts of group B. Co-administration of vitamin A with methotrexate (group C) ameliorated these histological changes and there was a increase in the number of PCNA positive nuclei in the crypts. Methotrexate caused mucosal damage improved with vitamin A co-administration...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAlthough the {{existence}} of the limbal stem cell (LSC) niche is accepted, precise knowledge of its three-dimensional (3 D) architecture remains incomplete. The LSC niche was explored on freshly excised and organ-cultured corneoscleral rims from human donors (n = 47), pigs (n = 15) and mice (n = 27) with full-field optical coherence microscopy (FFOCM). Limbal crypt features were detected in 90 % of organ-cultured human corneoscleral rims, extending between the palisades of Vogt as radially oriented rectangular (74 % of eyes) and/or rounded (23 % of eyes) forms, often branching off to, or becoming interconnected by, sub-scleral radially or circumferentially oriented crypts (in 56 % of eyes). Mean crypt volume represented 16 % of sampled limbal volume on the vertical axis and 8 % on the horizontal axis. In pigs, palisades were finer and crypts wider with relatively uniform distribution around the eye, and radial orientation, connecting to numerous narrow criss-crossing invaginations beneath the scleral surface. In mice, only a circumferential limbal trough was detected. Mean crypt volume represented 13 % of sampled limbal volume in humans and 9 % in pigs. FFOCM combined with fluorescence, and confocal fluorescence microscopy, showed presence of p 63 -α+ cells and cytokeratin- 3 + cells in the limbal crypts. To assess colony forming efficiency (CFE), limbal epithelial cells were cultured at low density with mitomycin-arrested 3 T 3 feeders. CFE increased with limbal crypt volume and was not significantly decreased in organ-cultured cornea, despite degradation of the epithelial roof, suggesting that stem cells remain protected at the base of crypts during organ culture. CFE in human samples was significantly greater than in pig, and CFE in mouse was zero. <b>Crypt</b> <b>architecture</b> in the three species appears associated with eye exposure to light.
