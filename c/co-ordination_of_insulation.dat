40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{rationale}} for <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> macroeconomic policies in the euro area. It makes clear what co-ordination can do and what it cannot do in European practice. It concludes that with the Pact for Stability and Growth, the framework for <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> fiscal policies has by and large been completed. As regards <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> structural policies the implementation and review process should be strengthened. The optimal form <b>of</b> policy <b>co-ordination</b> in this field will differ from case to case. With regard to the policy mix, only an exchange of information and analyses will improve policy-making, as more far-reaching forms <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> will annul the benefits of functional separation.

40|$|Recent {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) results for (Na 2 O) (x) (SiO 2) (1 -x) and (CaO) (x) (SiO 2) (1 -x) glasses show that <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> bridging oxygen (O-b) by modifiers (M) {{is a normal}} structural feature. This can be explained {{as a consequence of}} the limitation on oxygen co-ordination in network oxides, a common rule of thumb being that total <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> oxygen by (Si + M) is mv, then there is bonding Of Ob to modifiers, i. e. N-ObM > 0. This is the case in alkali and alkaline earth silicate crystals (apart from Be and Mg), and is predicted to be a feature of glasses in these systems. An illustration of the influence <b>of</b> oxygen <b>co-ordination</b> is given from MD models of (CaO) (0. 33) (SiO 2) (0. 67) glass at pressures of 5 and 10 GPa. The main effect of densification is to increase the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> Ca by O-b. This can be understood because at 0 GPa the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>Of</b> O b by Ca is already high, with N-OnbCa similar to 2. 7, but the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> O-b by Ca is less high, with N-ObCa similar to 1, and so can more easily increase...|$|R

40|$|Quality of life {{of nursing}} home {{residents}} is a critical consideration in international health care policies and health care decisions. Yet, there is little relevant research to support decisions about client-tailored and effective nursing care for this population. Because of the permanency of their stay, the care received affects the quality of daily life. This study investigated the quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care {{and the way it}} is related to gaps between needs and care supply, the quality of life and health status of residents living in Dutch nursing homes. To assess the perceived quality of life and experienced discrepancies between needs and care supply, 337 residents of 10 different nursing homes were interviewed. The quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> nursing care was assessed by judgements of the residents and nurses and by analysing the care documents. The results showed a relation between the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care and care discrepancies; the higher the quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care, the fewer the gaps between residents' needs and the care they received. The psycho-social aspects in particular showed a gap between the needs and care supply. As regards the relation between <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care and quality of life, the strongest positive relations were found between taking case histories, patient allocation and dimensions of quality of life. No direct relations were found between the <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care and care discrepancies {{on the one hand and}} the health status of the residents on the other. In conclusion, this study showed that the quality <b>of</b> <b>co-ordination</b> <b>of</b> care can affect the perceived quality {{of life of}} nursing home residents. To meet the residents' needs it is important to assess their physical and psycho-social needs accurately. More research focusing on this assessment is needed in order to improve the quality of life of nursing home residents. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
