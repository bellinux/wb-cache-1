5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{official}} NASA flight {{plan called for}} a <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> period before extra-vehicular activity, Armstrong requested that the EVA be moved to earlier in the evening, Houston time. Once Armstrong and Aldrin were ready to go outside, Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened and Armstrong {{made his way down}} the ladder first.|$|E
25|$|The {{redesigned}} 747-400 interior features new cabin sidewalls, heat-resistant phenolic glass, {{carbon composite}} paneling, and larger storage bins. An enhanced in-flight entertainment framework, called the Advanced Cabin Entertainment/Service System (ACESS), debuted on 747-400, which integrates 18-channel audio capability, four passenger intercom announcement zones, inter-cabin telephones, and passenger lighting into a central system. An eight-bunk overhead <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> is installed above the aft cabin, while a second <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> area {{is located on}} the upper deck behind the cockpit for flight crew use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Crew</b> <b>rests</b> {{compartments}} may {{not normally}} be used during taxi, takeoff, or landing maneuvers (TT&L). In flight <b>crew</b> <b>rests</b> that contain standard seats, an exception {{may be made}} to allow seated crew during TT&L.|$|R
500|$|When {{the protagonist}} reaches his grave, a black screen evokes his {{symbolic}} death, but the finality of this ending is {{undermined by the}} video sequences that follow, which show the actor playing Mr. Badiei lighting a cigarette and the film <b>crew</b> <b>resting.</b> Again, life goes on, but in an off-screen elsewhere.|$|R
3000|$|Overall, {{the results}} show no {{systematic}} relation between the total restoration time and the event scale or number of outages. The well-defined steps or periodic plateau visible in the data are at precisely daily intervals. The restoration probability (or outage number) only slightly changed overnight, presumably as repair <b>crews</b> <b>rested,</b> and these microtrends further show the unavoidable human involvement. 29 [...]...|$|R
25|$|The {{flight crew}} was five (two pilots, navigator, and radio {{operator}} with the flight engineer {{in a separate}} compartment behind the flight deck opposite <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> berths) {{and there were two}} stewards to attend to the passengers.|$|E
25|$|Out of the 297 passengers, {{there were}} 168 adult males, 118 adult females, 8 {{children}} and 3 infants. Among them, 3 passengers were seated in crew seats, {{one in the}} third occupant seat of the flight deck and two in the flight <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> area. The passengers consisted of businesspersons, vacationers and students.|$|E
25|$|At 12:14 PM EST on 2 October, Flagship New England {{departed}} New York-LaGuardia Airport for a transatlantic commercial {{flight to}} Berlin, with stops in Gander, Newfoundland and Shannon, Ireland. However, poor weather conditions at Gander forced {{the flight crew}} to land at Stephenville Air Base in Newfoundland instead. In order to let the <b>crew</b> <b>rest,</b> the flight stopped at Stephenville for the next twelve hours.|$|E
25|$|In early 1695, the Fancy finally {{rounded the}} Cape of Good Hope, {{stopping}} in Madagascar where the crew restocked supplies, {{likely in the}} area of St. Augustine's Bay. The Fancy next stopped at the island of Johanna in the Comoros Islands. Here Every's <b>crew</b> <b>rested</b> and took on provisions, later capturing a passing French pirate ship, looting the vessel and recruiting some forty of the crew to join his own company. His total strength was now about 150 men.|$|R
50|$|The {{activities}} of the Soyuz 30 crew, however, were severely curtailed {{so as not to}} interfere with the Soyuz 29 crew. On the Soyuz 29 <b>crew's</b> <b>rest</b> day, the international crew had to stay in their Soyuz to perform their experiments. Nevertheless, Hermaszewski conducted many experiments. One was crystallization experiments which produced 47 grams of cadmium tellurium mercury semiconductors for use by infra-red detectors on board the station. The yield was far greater - 50% compared to 15% - than ground-based experiments.|$|R

After a {{vigorous}} training cycle, Tautog sailed west once more {{in support of the}} Seventh Fleet in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. She became the first nuclear submarine to transit the Malacca Straits, surfaced and visited Singapore, the Philippines, Australia, Diego Garcia and Japan. Later in 1982 Tautog earned her third consecutive Engineering [...] "E" [...] and a Damage Control [...] "DC" [...] for excellence in Engineering and Damage Control.|$|R
25|$|The XWB's {{nose section}} will adopt a {{configuration}} {{derived from the}} A380 with a forward-mounted nosegear bay and a six-panel flightdeck windscreen. This differs substantially from the four-window arrangement in the original design. The new nose will improve aerodynamics and enable overhead <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> areas to be installed further forward and eliminate any encroachment in the passenger cabin. The new windscreen has been revised to improve vision by reducing {{the width of the}} centre post. The upper shell radius of the nose section has been increased. The nose is likely to be constructed from aluminium but Airbus is currently running trade-off studies considering a one-piece carbon fibre structure. According to Gordon McConnell, A350 Chief Engineer, a carbon fibre structure would need titanium reinforcements for birdstrike protection, thus the aluminium structure is the best cost-wise.|$|E
25|$|Because C-47s and C-46s which {{landed in}} China were {{temporarily}} beyond ATC control, they were constantly being diverted for local emergencies by Chennault's and China Theater commander Lt. Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer's forces, disrupting the flight <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> and aircraft maintenance schedules {{necessary to maintain}} tonnage. To alleviate the situation and also provide the additional support needed by the combat forces, 50 C-47s and 20 C46s were permanently based Chinaside after October 1944 for internal movement of cargo and to assist the India-China airlift when gaps in local scheduling permitted. Most of the remaining C-47s were eventually sent to bases in Burma and continued India-China missions over the lower routes. They proved their continuing usefulness by playing prominent roles in various support missions within China in 1944 and 1945.|$|E
25|$|Tactically, a Marine {{aircraft}} squadron is task-organized for {{a specific}} mission that may call for from one aircraft to the entire squadron. This tactical organization is temporary and fluid and rarely lasts with the same aircraft/aircrews {{for more than one}} mission. This continual reorganization occurs as aircraft and aircrews are rotated onto the flight schedule per aircraft availability, <b>crew</b> <b>rest,</b> and other considerations. A general tactical organizational scheme is: sortie - one aircraft on one mission, under the command of a designated aircraft commander (multi-pilot/crew aircraft only); section - two or three aircraft, under the command of a designated section leader; division - two or three sections under the command of a designated division leader, squadron - two or three divisions, under the command of the squadron commander or his designated representative (e.g., executive officer, operations officer, etc.). Traditionally, the lead aircraft belongs to the commanding officer.|$|E
5000|$|The base {{airframe}} for E-767 {{is that of}} a 767-200ER, Boeing designation 767-27C. (The [...] "7C" [...] designation is the Boeing {{customer code}} for the JASDF). The 767 airframe offers about 50 percent more floor space and nearly twice the volume of the 707 on which the E-3 is based. [...] The mission electronics equipment are installed in forward cabin to balance the weight with the rotodome mounted above the aft fuselage. The aft cabin contains the <b>crew's</b> <b>rest</b> area, galley, and lavatory.|$|R
60|$|For {{two hours}} the tired <b>crew</b> <b>rested</b> while the water sank and the steamer resumed her awkward list. Then the boats {{came back and}} the men crawled languidly about the slanted deck, until Adam went among them with bitter words. The sea breeze was blowing outside, but no wind could enter {{the gap in the}} trees, and foul exhalations from warm mud and slime {{poisoned}} the stagnant air. Kit's head ached, his eyes hurt, and his joints were sore; he felt strangely limp and it cost him an effort to get about.|$|R
60|$|It was, I dare say, a {{delusion}} of mine; but I thought I {{had never}} seen the moon shine so white and ghastly anywhere, either on sea or on land, as she shone that night while we were approaching our companions in misery. When there was {{not much more than a}} boat's length between us, and the white light streamed cold and clear over all our faces, both <b>crews</b> <b>rested</b> on their oars with one great shudder, and stared over the gunwale of either boat, panic-stricken at the first sight of each other.|$|R
25|$|There are {{currently}} four organizations {{at the airport}} that offer fixed based operator services for general aviation users. One name familiar to the area we live in also resides in Kalamazoo. Duncan Aviation, which {{is located on the}} west side of the airfield, offers a large variety of services as it is the only full-service fixed based operator on the field. Duncan handles the traditional FBO services such as fueling. Maintenance, hangaring, aircraft movement, and many other ground services while also providing weather equipment and <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> areas for pilots. They also offer passenger service such as rental and courtesy cars, restrooms vending, and a lobby area. The Duncan facility is the terminal for entrance to the general aviation side of the airport. Kalamazoo Aircraft is another major fixed based operator at the airport that offers maintenance services to smaller general aviation aircraft; they offer inspections, maintenance, repairs, and alterations. The third FBO on the field is the Kalamazoo Pilots Association which operates a self-service fueling pump in the hangar area. The last fixed based operator is Aviation Assets which conducts a flight training school on the north side of the airport.|$|E
500|$|The E-3 Sentry's {{airframe}} is {{a modified}} Boeing 707-320B Advanced model. USAF and NATO E-3s have an unrefueled range of some [...] or {{eight hours of}} flying. The newer E-3 versions bought by France, Saudi Arabia, and the UK are equipped with newer CFM56-2 turbofan engines, and these can fly for about 11 hours or about [...] The Sentry's range and on-station time can be increased through air-to-air refueling and the crews can work in shifts {{by the use of}} an on-board <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> and meals area.|$|E
500|$|During early operations, the Tu-142 {{revealed}} several shortcomings. The aircraft's rough-field capability {{was found}} to be of limited use, so the two six-wheel bogies used on the first 12 of 36 aircraft were replaced with four-wheel reinforced bogies from the Tu-114 airliner; consequently, the wheel-wells in the engine nacelle were made slimmer. These changes, along with the deletion of the thermal imaging system and parts of the electronic countermeasure (ECM) equipment, reduced the empty weight by [...] The modified aircraft also introduced a <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> area for long-duration missions, and was assigned the codename ("Bear F" [...] Mod 1); from 1968 to 1972 the Kuibyshev Plant produced a total of 18 Tu-142s.|$|E

50|$|Dewdney {{headed north}} of Christina Lake with five men, walking over the Rossland Mountains farther north to emerge on the Lower Arrow Lake where they {{acquired}} a canoe and paddled down {{to rejoin the}} main party at Shepherd on May 27, 1865. While the <b>crew</b> <b>rested,</b> Dewdney {{and a couple of}} volunteers paddled back up the Columbia and up the Lower Kootenay River, portaging 14 times to get to the West Arm of Kootenay Lake. After exploring other possible options, Dewdney concluded that Kootenay Lake was too big a barrier to make it a viable route, so he returned to Fort Shepherd.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ultimate}} aim of a crew is {{to become}} [...] "Head of the River" [...] (top of the first division) and stay there. This entitles the winning crew to commission trophy oars in their college colours with the names and weights of the successful crew on them — commonly called [...] "winning blades". As this is only possible for crews already {{near the top of}} division one, another way to win blades is to bump on each day of the competition. As the responsibility for awarding blades to <b>crews</b> <b>rests</b> with the individual colleges concerned, there are slight differences in the criteria required.|$|R
2500|$|OPBH: On 11 March 2014, Sikorsky {{successfully}} {{conducted the}} first flight demonstration of their Optionally Piloted Black Hawk (OPBH), a milestone part of the company's Manned/Unmanned Resupply Aerial Lifter (MURAL) program to provide autonomous cargo delivery for the U.S. Army. [...] The helicopter used the company's Matrix technology (software to improve features of autonomous, optionally-piloted VTOL aircraft) to perform autonomous hover and flight operations {{under the control of}} an operator using a man-portable Ground Control Station (GCS). [...] The MURAL program is a cooperative effort between Sikorsky, the US Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD), and the US Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UH PO). [...] The purpose of creating an optionally-manned Black Hawk is to make the aircraft autonomously carry out resupply missions and expeditionary operations, while increasing sorties and maintaining <b>crew</b> <b>rest</b> requirements and leaving pilots to focus more on sensitive operations.|$|E
2500|$|The 169th Fighter Wing, South Carolina Air National Guard, was {{the first}} ANG fighter unit to deploy to Southwest Asia in direct support of the air war over Afghanistan. It sent over 200 {{personnel}} and six F-16CJs in January 2002 to Al Udeid Air Base in Doha, Qatar, to assist air combat operations over Afghanistan. In particular, they provided Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) against Taliban and al Qaeda positions, the only Air Force fighter unit in the theater to do so. F-16s sometimes were also configured for Cluster Bomb Units (CBUw). [...] In addition, F-16 pilots sometimes fired their 20mm gun against ground targets. Missions could last up to 10 hours with multiple air refuelings. After so many hours strapped in their seats, pilots generally received one to three days of <b>crew</b> <b>rest.</b> The unit returned to South Carolina on 3 April 2002.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{terrorist}} attacks on 9/11 and weeks before the first U.S. bomb was dropped over Afghanistan, the Air Force established air bridges to help funnel material and personnel overseas to support multiple operations in conjunction with Enduring Freedom. Air National Guard tanker units received orders by 20 September 2001, to be in their deployed locations before the start of their air bridge operations. Some ANG tanker units also flew humanitarian support missions. By using European bases, the Air Force could transfer cargo from the larger aircraft to smaller planes, refuel aircraft on the ground, exchange flight <b>crews,</b> give <b>crews</b> <b>rest</b> opportunities, and repair broken aircraft.|$|R

25|$|Classical sources {{indicate}} that the trireme was capable of sustained speeds of ca. 6 knots at a relatively leisurely pace. There is also a reference by Xenophon of a single day's voyage from Byzantium to Heraclea Pontica, which translates as an average speed of 7.37 knots. These figures seem to be corroborated by the tests conducted with the reconstructed Olympias: a maximum speed of 8 knots and a steady speed of 4 knots could be maintained, with half the <b>crew</b> <b>resting</b> at a time. Given the imperfect nature of the reconstructed ship {{as well as the}} fact that it was manned by totally untrained modern men and women, it is reasonable to suggest that ancient triremes, expertly built and navigated by trained men, would attain higher speeds.|$|R
