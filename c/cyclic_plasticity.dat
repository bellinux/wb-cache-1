In the event of uniaxial cyclic experiments, the yield-point phenomenon is visible only in the first cycle. However, {{the authors of this}} paper have proven that the yield-point phenomenon affects the stress-strain response during the entire lifetime of structural elements which are subject to <b>cyclic</b> <b>plasticity.</b> Taking account of the yield-point phenomenon in constitutive models of <b>cyclic</b> <b>plasticity</b> significantly improves the forecast of the stress-strain response and the lifetime of structural elements. For constitutive models of <b>cyclic</b> <b>plasticity,</b> a description and benefit of the yield-point phenomenon during the development of the stress-strain state of a cyclically loaded structural element are presented by comparing experiment and numerical simulation results. In the paper, the emphasis is placed on detailed determination of the benefit as well as the functionality and necessity of taking account of the yield-point phenomenon in constitutive models of <b>cyclic</b> <b>plasticity...</b>|$|E

In order to understand material's <b>cyclic</b> <b>plasticity</b> and fatigue-ratcheting behaviour, systematic experimental and analytical investigations {{have been carried out}} on specimens of SA 333 Gr. 6 carbon steel and SS 304 LN stainless steel. The material specification of SA 333 Gr. 6 is same as used in Primary Heat Transport (PHT) piping of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and material specification of SS 304 LN steel is same as proposed for Indian Advance Heavy Water Reactor's (AHWR's) Main Heat Transport (MHT) piping.

Here, a simple analogous model is used instead of finite-element (FE) simulations. This approach has been applied for two different integration time steps in order to evaluate their influence on the fit and the accuracy of the integration. It is shown that good accuracy can be obtained for the <b>cyclic</b> <b>plasticity</b> parameters. For FE simulations using larger integration time steps, large deviations have been noted.

40|$|Brain plasticity, {{the ability}} of the nervous system to encode experience, is a modulatory process leading to {{long-lasting}} structural and functional changes. Salient experiences induce plastic changes in neurons of the hippocampus, the basis of memory formation and recall. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian (~ 24 -h) clock, experience with light at night induces changes in neuronal state, leading to circadian plasticity. The SCN’s endogenous ~ 24 -h time-generator comprises a dynamic series of functional states, which gate plastic responses. This restricts light-induced alteration in SCN state-dynamics and outputs to the nighttime. Endogenously generated circadian oscillators coordinate the cyclic states of excitability and intracellular signaling molecules that prime SCN receptivity to plasticity signals, generating nightly windows of susceptibility. We propose that this constitutes a paradigm of ~ 24 -hour iterative metaplasticity, the repeated, patterned occurrence of susceptibility to induction of neuronal plasticity. We detail effectors permissive for the <b>cyclic</b> susceptibility to <b>plasticity.</b> We consider similarities of intracellular and membrane mechanisms underlying plasticity in SCN circadian plasticity and in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). The emerging prominence of the hippocampal circadian clock points to iterative metaplasticity in that tissue as well.

40|$|In diverse {{neuronal}} processes {{ranging from}} neuronal survival to synaptic <b>plasticity</b> <b>cyclic</b> adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) -dependent signaling is tightly {{connected with the}} protein kinase B (PKB) /Akt pathway but the precise nature of this connection remains unknown. In the current study we investigated the effect of two mainstream pathways initiated by cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac 1 and Epac 2) on PKB/Akt phosphorylation in primary cortical neurons and HT- 4 cells. We demonstrate that PKA activation leads to a reduction of PKB/Akt phosphorylation, whereas activation of Epac has the opposite effect. This effect of Epac on PKB/Akt phosphorylation was mediated by Rap activation. The increase in PKB/Akt phosphorylation after Epac activation could be blocked by pretreatment with Epac 2 siRNA and to a somewhat smaller extent by Epac 1 siRNA. PKA, PKB/Akt and Epac were all shown to establish complexes with neuronal A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP 150). Interestingly, activation of Epac increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt complexed to AKAP 150. From experiments using PKA-binding deficient AKAP 150 and peptides disrupting PKA anchoring to AKAPs, we conclude that AKAP 150 acts as a key regulator in the two cAMP pathways to control PKB/Akt phosphorylation.

40|$|Carbide-rich {{tool steel}} is most {{commonly}} used not in the tooling industry, but also in engine parts, e. g. springs, bearings, diesel injections, connecting rods etc [...] Components made from this kind of material are often subjected to cyclic mechanical stresses. Fatigue is important as it occupies the largest cause of failure in metal, aproximately estimated 90 % of all metallic failures, tool steels are also susceptible {{to this type of}} failure. Fatigue resistance of this material strongly depends on the microstructural features including shapes, shape ratio, volume fractions, and distributions of primary and eutectic carbides. Thus, besides loading condition microstructural features are considered as the main factor which influences lifetime of tool components. It is known that the lifetime prediction of carbide-rich tool steel in alternating applied stress is not an easy task to perform. Therefore, gaining knowledge about the effects of microstructural features on the fatigue behavior of this material is necessary. Subsequently, the main objective of this research is to develop a simple model as well asa computational framework to quantify the influence of these microstructural features on the fatigue behavior of the material in the high cycle fatigue (HCF) regime. In general, fatigue crack mechanisms can be divided into 3 stages: initial crack formation (crack incubation or nucleation), short crack and long crack growth, which have successfully been established by McDowell, in a so-called multistage fatigue model (MSF). To model fatigue behavior of carbide rich tool steel, McDowell’s model was modified and developed at three length-scale levels, resulting in amulti-scale fatigue model. For fatigue crack formation and early growth, a hierarchical approach was used, and lifetime of this stage was estimated based on local <b>cyclic</b> micro <b>plasticity</b> within a representative volume element (RVE). The short crack stage consists of microstructurally short crack (MSC) and physically short crack (PSC) growth in which short crack drivingforce was determined from the process zone at the crack tip, so-called cyclic crack tip opening displacement (CTOD). From this relation, the effects of microstructural features on the cyclic short crack growth were explicitly identified. For long crack growth, an accumulated fatigue damage concept was implemented to calculate the lifetime of this stage. Based on that relation, the long crack growth rate was easily derived from low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties because it is believed that LCF test is easy to calibrate and it may be interpolated from monotonic tensile test, which results in saving time and cost for fatigue prediction. The most important contributions of this study are to simulate and model the influence of carbides on three different length scales of fatigue crack mechanisms in tool steels. The proposed model is considered as a powerful tool for lifetime prediction not only in tool steels, but also in particle reinforced composites and other heterogeneous materials. Moreover, optimization process on microstructural features can be done basedon the results of this study. Consequently, the in-service life of materials may be improved...|$|R
