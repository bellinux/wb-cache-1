50|$|Despite {{this lack}} of success at Wolves, he {{caught the eye of}} Coventry City manager Jimmy Hill who paid £1,500 for the 18-year-old {{at the start of the}} 1964-65 season. Clements made a fine start to his City career, scoring on his debut on 23 January 1965 against Northampton Town and netting eight times in his first ten matches. Two months later on 17 March 1965, aged just 19, he earned the first of his 48 caps for the Northern Ireland {{national}} team against the Netherlands. Clements was an integral part of the Coventry side which won the Second Division championship in the 1966-67 season and then did well in the top flight. He played as an outside left for much of his time at Coventry for whom he made 228 league appearances (255 including cup games) and scored 30 goals in total over a period of seven seasons. Throughout his time at Highfield Road he continued to be a regular for the Northern Ireland team, earning 21 caps in total while with the Midlands team. His most famous moment as an international player came in October 1967 when he scored the winning goal in a Euro 68 qualifier against Scotland at Windsor Park. Coventry manager Noel Cantwell surprisingly agreed to let Clements move on after six-years at the club and after rejecting a move to Hull City in February 1971, he moved to Sheffield Wednesday in August of the same year as part of a <b>combined</b> <b>deal</b> that also included Brian Joicey and cost the Yorkshire club £100,000.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} {{determined}} by two elements, (a) by the available quantities of goods {{that can be used}} in the productive process and (b) by the adroitness with which these available factors of production are <b>combined.</b> <b>Dealing</b> with element (b), Randall G. Holcombe 1 has recently emphasized the importance of entrepreneurial activity with a valid and interesting observation. Unfortunately, he does not pursue this observation to the conclusion to which it naturally leads (and which I will therefore have to spell out in what follows), but instead tries to relate it to Israel Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurship. This makes Holcombe’s analysis deficient in several respects, with the result that potentially disastrous policy recommendations might be derived from it. The valid and interesting observation that I have in mind can be grasped from the following example given in Holcombe’s article: Somebody had the idea that if a computer mouse communicated with the computer via an infrared connection, the mouse could be used without a cord [...] The profit opportunity arose solely because of a previously nonexistent market niche, and onc...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} this {{particular}} Sura was chosen due {{to a number of}} reasons, which we will list in detail in the forward sections and remaining chapters. In addition to the linguistic and artistic characteristics, the most important characteristic of Surat Al-Rahman lies in its structure and internal division. I found out {{that it was possible to}} break up this Sura into dramatic divisions that build up with events. Therefore, I innovatively distributed the verses into specific sections leading to the division of this study into four chapters besides the Introduction, Preface and the Epilogue. These four chapters walk hand-in-hand with the chronological order of the verses. Each chapter contains a period from the history of the creation. The first chapter discusses the period of pre-physical creation as known. The second chapter deals with the period of existence of the Universe and in particular the earth, which was prepared to be the dwelling for human beings. This period ends with the end of the world. The third and fourth chapters <b>combined</b> <b>deal</b> with the period of resurrection and judgment. The former deals with the state of the disobedient and the latter deals with the state of paradise and its dwellers. Those two chapters were supposed to be combined into one chapter from the drama point of view because they deal with one period. However, necessity dictated having two chapters due to the portion of the Sura dedicated to this period and the number of verses covered. The other reason is the internal artistic division of this Sura, which was marked with clear distinctions between the two kinds of people, the obedient and the disobedient. This study will try to explore the miraculous and the inimitability of the Qur'an, and in particular Surat Al-Rahman...|$|E

[...] According to the Zenit website, Denisov's current contract runs to 2015 and that he is one of the highest earners in all of the Russian Premier League.
