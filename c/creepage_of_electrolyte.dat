Many {{researchers}} applied creepage to calculating creep force, and {{relation between}} creepage and creep force are very complex {{and it has}} been a major problem for solving rolling contact theory. The paper established the finite element model of wheel-rail rolling contact based on ALE method (Arbitrary Lagrange-Euler method) in ABAQUS, and research impact of lateral motion <b>of</b> wheelset on <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> wheel-rail contact. Results show in the lateral movement value difference between their longitudinal creepage is small, and maximum error is less than 20 %, there is more distinct change trend about lateral creepage in left contact area than one in right contact area, and spin <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> left wheel drop down in 4 mm lateral displacement...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{numerical}} models of railway wheel noise occurring in narrow curves. Curve squeal {{is presumed to}} issue from a lateral <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> the wheels on the rail head. The frequency range is from around 400 to almost 8000 Hz, with noise levels up to 120 dB close to the wheel. Lateral friction forces are induced on the wheel–rail contact area (typically stick-slip forces). Due to nonlinearities of friction forces, a transient analysis <b>of</b> the lateral <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> the wheel is performed by using an axi-harmonic model. Results give a reduced number of excited modes. It is shown that squealing modes have 3, 4 and 5 nodal diameters. These results agree with experimental investigations of squeal noise measurements. An extension of the transient model is finally discussed. It consists to study the efficiency of a noise attenuation system made of a metallic ring inserted into grooves machined into the wheel...|$|R
40|$|Utilization in the {{development}} of multi-kW low orbit power systems is discussed. The following technological developments of alkaline water electrolysis cells for space power application were demonstrated: (1) four 92. 9 cm 2 single water electrolysis cells, two using LST's advanced anodes and two using LST's super anodes; (2) four single cell endurance test stands for life testing <b>of</b> alkaline water <b>electrolyte</b> cells; (3) the solid performance of the advanced electrode and 355 K; (4) the breakthrough performance of the super electrode; (5) the four single cells for over 5, 000 hours each significant cell deterioration or cell failure. It is concluded that the static feed water electrolysis concept is reliable and due to the inherent simplicity of the passive water feed mechanism coupled with the use <b>of</b> alkaline <b>electrolyte</b> has greater potential for regenerative fuel cell system applications than alternative electrolyzers. A rise in cell voltage occur after 2, 000 - 3, 000 hours which was attributed to deflection of the polysulfone end plates due to <b>creepage</b> <b>of</b> the thermoplastic.

The significant acceleration of bentonite particle sedimentation by the presence <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> NaCl and CaCl 2 was found out.

In the absence <b>of</b> <b>electrolyte</b> the flocculating action of cationic flocculants FO 41159 H, Z 89 and FO 4800 SH is intensified with charge density increase. It is caused by formation of large floccules. The mixture <b>of</b> <b>electrolyte</b> and flocculant has more intensive flocculating action than the individual components.

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the Raton of SN 1 {{reactions}} {{was attributed}} by the Hughes-Ingold electrostatic theory to {{their effect on}} {{the stability of the}} transition state, their effect on the initial state being considered as negligibly small. More recently Grumwald put forward a theory in which the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the initial as well as the transition state was considered to be important. Experimental support for the latter theory was rather weak as it consisted solely of results obtained using different organic compounds for the solubility and rate determinations (the solubility data showing the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the initial state). It was therefore thought desirable to study the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the solubility and on the rate of hydrolysis of the same organic compound (p-nitrobenzhydrylchloride). The results show that the effect <b>of</b> <b>electrolytes</b> on the solubility of the initial state is certainly not negligibly small, and that the requirements of Grumwald’s quantitative treatment are obeyed for many <b>of</b> the <b>electrolytes</b> studied. However factors not taken into account by this treatment appear to be of importance for some <b>of</b> the <b>electrolytes</b> employed (e. g. NaC 10 (_ 4), HC 10 (_ 4)).
