5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came {{shortly after}} the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71–11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E

25|$|Citing his {{potential}} views {{on abortion and}} the environment, Cantwell was one of 22 senators to vote against United States Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> John Roberts. In January 2006, after publicly announcing her opposition to Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> Samuel Alito, Cantwell, along with 18 other Democrats and all 53 present Republicans, voted for the cloture motion. The success of this motion ended an unlikely attempt to filibuster the confirmation of Judge Alito that was being led by Senator John Kerry and Senator Ted Kennedy. Alito was confirmed the next day {{by a vote of}} 58–42, with most Democrats, including Cantwell, voting against the confirmation.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{procedural}} {{differences between the}} committee's investigations of Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees</b> and those of lower courts, notably that investigations of Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees</b> are conducted after the president has submitted a nomination. Also, there is added scrutiny with Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees,</b> such as teams of law professors examining the legal writings of the prospective justice.|$|R

25|$|Lugar {{believes}} that judicial confirmation decisions {{should not be}} purely partisan. His view is if an appointee is properly qualified for the position by their education, integrity, and other similar factors, {{that they should be}} confirmed by the Senate. Lugar introduced President GeorgeW. Bush's appointee, now Chief Justice John Roberts, to the Senate at the beginning of Roberts' confirmation process and was instrumental in securing votes to confirm Roberts for the Supreme Court. Lugar was the first Republican senator to announce his support for President Barack Obama's first Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Sonia Sotomayor and also voted in favor of his second Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> Solicitor General Elena Kagan.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 Friedan led other feminists in derailing the {{nomination}} of Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> G.

Friedan's impassioned testimony before the Senate helped sink Carswell's nomination.|$|E

In 1976, Oaks was listed by U.S. attorney general Edward H. Levi among potential Gerald Ford Supreme Court candidates.

25|$|On July 1, 1991, President George H. W. Bush {{nominated}} Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court of the United States {{to replace}} Thurgood Marshall, who had announced his retirement. The nomination proceedings were contentious from the start, especially {{over the issue}} of abortion, and many women's groups and civil rights groups opposed Thomas {{on the basis of his}} conservative political views, as they had also opposed Bush's Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> from the previous year, David Souter.|$|E
25|$|But {{to placate}} the Radical {{wing of the}} party, Lincoln {{mentioned}} Chase as a potential Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee.</b> When Chief Justice RogerB. Taney died in October 1864, Lincoln named Chase to replace him. Lincoln issued the nomination on December 6, 1864. Chase was confirmed by the Senate that very day, and immediately received his commission, holding the office from 1864 until his own death in 1873. Chase was a complete change from the pro-slavery Taney; one of Chase's first acts as Chief Justice was to admit John Rock as the first African-American attorney to argue cases before the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of July 19, 2005, Bush {{announced}} his first Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee,</b> John G. Roberts, Jr., a highly regarded former Supreme Court litigator and conservative judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. During the day {{leading up to the}} announcement, there had been much media speculation that one of either two female judges on the Fifth Circuit would get the nod: moderate Edith Brown Clement or conservative Edith H. Jones. Clement was considered the frontrunner. About an hour before the televised announcement, however, information was leaked to the press concerning the choice of Roberts.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, {{it was assumed that}} the Democrats would {{filibuster}} any Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> who would change the ideological composition of the court. Initially, this conjecture seemed to be borne out when conservative jurist John Roberts was renominated to replace conservative Chief Justice Rehnquist. The confirmation process went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Later, however, the hypothesis was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative appellate judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked on his nomination. Very soon afterward, he was successfully confirmed.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 back then, with Friedan {{leading the}} cause, was {{instrumental}} in the U.S. Senate's rejection of President Richard M. Nixon's Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> G. Harrold Carswell, who had opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act granting (among other things) women workplace equality with men. On August 26, 1970, the 50th anniversary of the Women's Suffrage Amendment to the Constitution, Friedan organized the national Women's Strike for Equality, and led a march of an estimated 20,000 women in New York City. While the march's primary objective was promoting equal opportunities for women in jobs and education, protestors and organizers of the event also demanded abortion rights and the establishment of child-care centers.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a suit over reverse {{discrimination}} brought by 20 white and Hispanic firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced {{that no one would}} be promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the firefighters, agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race. The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, became highly publicized and brought national attention to New Haven politics due to the involvement of then-Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> (and Yale Law School graduate) Sonia Sotomayor in a lower court decision.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{relationship}} between state-level public opinion and the roll call votes of senators on Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees.</b> Applying recent advances in multilevel modeling, we use national polls on nine recent Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees</b> to produce state-of-theart estimates of {{public support for the}} confirmation of each nominee in all 50 states. We show that greater public support strongly increases the probability that a senator will vote to approve a nominee, even after controlling for standard predictors of roll call voting. We also find that the impact of opinion varies with context: it has a greater effect on opposition party senators, on ideologically opposed senators, and for generally weak nominees. These results establish a systematic and powerful link between constituency opinion and voting on Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees...</b>|$|R

2500|$|On November 21, 2013, the Democratic {{controlled}} Senate voted 52 to 48 {{to require}} only {{a majority vote}} to end a filibuster of all executive and judicial <b>nominees,</b> excluding Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees,</b> rather than the 3/5 of votes previously required. [...] On April 6, 2017, the Republican controlled Senate voted 52 to 48 to require only a majority vote to end a filibuster of Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominees.</b> [...] A 3/5 supermajority is still required to end filibusters on legislation.|$|R
25|$|Not every Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> has {{received}} a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because {{it is clear that}} the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with the nomination of Harriet Miers in 2006. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November, 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, as previously noted, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later filled by President Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch.|$|E
25|$|Although Senate {{rules do}} not {{necessarily}} allow a negative vote in committee to block a nomination, prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full Senate. President Lyndon Johnson's nomination of sitting Associate Justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee.</b> It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, however, only Democratic Senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy. This led the Republican majority {{to change the rules}} and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.|$|E
25|$|Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss were {{founders of}} the movement. The {{magazines}} Commentary and Public Interest were their key outlets, as well as op-ed articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks.

Prominent spokesmen include Gertrude Himmelfarb, Bill Kristol, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Pipes, David Horowitz, Charles Krauthammer, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, Elliott Abrams and Ben Wattenberg. Meanwhile, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was highly sympathetic but remained a Democrat. Some of Strauss' influential neoconservative disciples included Supreme <b>Court</b> <b>nominee</b> Robert Bork, Paul Wolfowitz (who became Deputy Secretary of Defense), Alan Keyes (who became Assistant Secretary of State), William Bennett (who became Secretary of Education), Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, political philosopher Allan Bloom, writer John Podhoretz, college president John Agresto, political scientist Harry V.

5|$|Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.

Clinton appointed the first African American judges to the Fourth Circuit (Roger Gregory) and the Seventh Circuit (Ann Claire Williams). Clinton also appointed the nation's first openly gay or lesbian federal judge when he named Deborah Batts to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
