50|$|CLaCS (Cryo-Laser and Cryo-Sclerotherapy) {{is a way}} {{to treat}} leg vein lesions by {{combining}} transdermal laser effect and injection sclerotherapy, all under skin cooling (Cryo - <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> onto the skin at -20C). The laser causes a selective photothermolysis damaging the vein wall. The vein's lumen gets smaller. On a second procedure, sclerosing agent is injected where the vein is still open. This combination allows to treat veins that could be treated by phleboectomy or foam sclerotherapy - more invasive options. To improve results, CLaCS can be guided by Augmented Reality (near-infrared vein finder).|$|R

5000|$|The JT15D is rare among modern turbofans {{in that it}} uses a {{centrifugal}} compressor as its main high-pressure system. This was a common feature of early jet engines, but was quickly replaced by axial compressors in most roles due to its large frontal size.

50|$|Note: Due to Morocco's {{proximity}} to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7-8 degrees Celsius when sirocco blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7-8 degrees Celsius when <b>cold</b> damp <b>air</b> <b>blows</b> from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell.

5000|$|A local weather {{phenomenon}} that occurs mainly {{in late summer}} is colloquially known as [...] "Morgan's Cloud". On otherwise fair, hot summer days with light southwesterly winds, convective clouds can develop {{along the length of}} the island and blow to the northeast growing. In extreme cases, this cloud formation can develop into heavy showers and thunderstorms and it has been known to produce funnel clouds and waterspouts in the eastern parishes. This phenomenon also occurs in the less common northeasterly wind regime ("reverse" [...] Morgan's Cloud) but its effects are felt in the western parishes. The key to Morgan's Cloud forming is light winds blowing {{along the length of the}} island which is often warmer than the surrounding waters on hot summer days. This organizes upward motions allowing this cloud formation to occur. Similar localized cloud development is observed in linear tropical and subtropical islands globally. Furthermore, showers following strong cold fronts in wintertime form in a similar manner to lake-effect snow. <b>Cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> over warm water decreases atmospheric stability, allowing convection to form and grow into showers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a modified electrospinning system for biomedical wound-healing applications. The conventional electrospinning process requires a grounded electrode on which highly charged electrospun ultrafine fibers are deposited. Biomedical wound-healing membranes, however, require {{a very low}} charge and {{a low level of}} remnant solvent on the electrospun membrane, which the conventional process cannot provide. An electrohydrody-namic process complemented with field-controllable electrodes (an auxiliary electrode and guiding electrodes) and an <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> was used to produce a membrane, with a considerably reduced charge and low remnant sol-vent concentration compared to one fabricated using the conventional method. The membrane had a small average pore size (102 nm) and high porosity (85. 1 %) for prevention of bacterial contamination. In vivo tests on rats showed that these directly electrospun fibrous membranes produced using the modified electrospinning process supported the good healing of skin burns...|$|R
5000|$|The Pierson Limestone was {{deposited}} {{during the}} Mississippian. Later in the Paleozoic the Ozark Uplift brought the rock above sea level, allowing fresh water to begin dissolving away the limestone {{to form the}} cave. Further uplift brought the cave above the water table and allowed abundant speleothems to form. The cave was accessed during Archaic times by Native Americans. At some point after the Archaic and before modern times the cave was sealed off by collapse. In 1925 Arthur Browning was exploring his land, checking traps, and discovered a small hole with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> out along a bluff. He soon {{enlisted the help of}} two surveyors employed by the highway department, Bob Ford and Bryan Gilmore, to excavate the rocks and debris blocking the entrance. During excavation, substantial artifacts were discovered, including arrowheads, grinding stones, tools made of bone and skeletal remains of the early native American inhabitants, that date back to as early as 5000 B.C. Arthur opened the cave to the public for tours in 1927. It is still owned and operated by the same family today, currently the 3rd generation, after 90 years of being open.|$|R
40|$|The {{use of an}} air jet {{to clean}} the {{products}} during the manufacturing is usual in an industrial environment. In this paper {{the problem of the}} removal, from the inner of the tube, of the waste arising from the cutting operation by means of an <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> is analysed. In order to obtain indications about the real importance of the involved parameters and their effects, a numerical procedure, based on CFD analysis trough the code STAR CCM+, has been settled. The effects of the different parameters were highlighted. The results are congruent with the experience, indicating that the adopted solution is not suitable for the small tubes. Therefore, a different blowing solution is investigated, with the object to improve the cleaning capabilities of the system. The results for the new blowing solution provide a significant improvement of the capability to remove the waste aris- ing from the cutting operation can be expected...|$|R
40|$|What is the "New Jazz Studies?" Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere {{contain a}} {{diverse array of}} {{scholarship}} that approaches the broad fields of jazz studies and musical improvisation through various perspectives and methodologies. Krin Gabbard's two volume collection, Representing Jazz and Jazz Among the Discourses, is the clear precedent for these new anthologies. Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere continue this trajectory by moving away from jazz as a static object to be stylistically described, explained, and celebrated through the heroic and larger-than-life individual towards an understanding of jazz as a music in continual dialogue with the historical, social, political, racial, and gendered processes governing its creation. Ultimately, there are multiple ways of thinking and writing about music. However, both of these texts ignite important and much-needed debates {{over the future of}} this decidedly interdisciplinary field. Gabbard's aggressive programmatic statement from Jazz Among the Discourses still holds true for these two volumes: "jazz scholarship now faces two significant choices: it may continue developing and protecting its canon, or it may take the consequences of letting in some fresh, if chilling, air. " Uptown Conversations and The Other Side of Nowhere together will no doubt keep that fresh, <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing...</b>|$|R

50|$|Western New York has a humid {{continental}} climate {{heavily influenced by}} both Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Winters are long and cold, often lasting from around mid-November to early April. There are often snows before and after that period, as well. Western New York {{is known for its}} lake effect snows, which can result in highly localized, sometimes intense and even historic snow events. Lake effect storms are a result of <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> over warm lake waters. Lake effect snows are usually most active between November and February and typically diminish when Lake Erie freezes over. Generally, the heaviest amount of snow in Western New York during the winter falls near the southern end of Erie County. Spring and fall in Western New York are usually short and changeable. The presence of the lakes allows for fruit growing and wine production along areas adjacent to both lakes which retard the development of damaging spring and fall frost, thereby extending the growing season. Lost in its famed winters, Western New York summers are among the sunniest in the Northeast and are generally very pleasant. Thanks in part to breezes blowing over Lakes Erie and Ontario (which are usually cooler than the air temperature in the summer), most of Western New York enjoy generally cooler and more comfortable summers than other regions in the same climatic zone.|$|R

40|$|Compost teas are {{fermented}} extracts of composted {{materials that}} are used to control plant diseases. A compost extractor in liquid phase, with forced <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> and assembled using farmer facilities, was used to produce “on farm” aerated compost teas (CTs) from five types of compost, in a 14 -day fermentation cycle. Solid feed stocks, including one biowaste compost and four composted tomato residues, were extracted in water (waCTs) and whey (whCTs), separately. The ten teas showed high biological control ability, both in vitro and in vivo, against three tomato pathogens: Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea and Pyrenochaeta lycopersici. In in vitro trials, the suppressive ability of raw CTs was lost with sterilization, suggesting an antibiotic-like antagonism effect due to active microorganisms in suspension. Direct application of teas on tomato plants significantly reduced disease symptoms caused by tested pathogens. In vivo suppressiveness was more significant using the liquid phase fermentation (whey or water) than the compost. Whey could be considered a viable extractant for suppressive compost-tea production, although further dilution in dechlorinated water at a ratio of at least 1 : 5 proved a necessary method to avoid occurrence of root or foliar phytotoxicity, probably due to high salt concentrations and sub-acid pH of the relative teas...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{attempts}} to find a theoretical solution to prevent tube explosion of the tubes placed in the superheater region of the Bisotoun Power Plant boiler, Iran. The boiler has three types of tube and the tube failure was occurred in the long length type of these tubes. A three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling was carried out for this purpose. The result of modeling of the boiler shows that the long tubes are working in a temperature higher than the designed value. In the present work in order to solve this problem, two different ways was proposed and theoretically investigated. Using of a tube insert in the tube for heat transfer enhancement which increases the cooling performance of the steam inside the tube was the first one. The ability of the tube insert to increasing the heat transfer coefficient and reducing the tube wall temperature was observed from the CFD modeling. However, this way was not accepted due to probability of separating {{a part of the}} welded parts and the consequent danger of the steam turbine placed after the boiler in the plant layout. Using the <b>air</b> <b>blowing</b> <b>system</b> which locally cools the tube in the placed of explosion was also studied. The results show that by this method it is possible to reduce the tube wall temperature to a safe value for the tube. The relation between the air mass flow rate and the temperature at place of damage is also predicted in this study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{investigations of}} the performance of vertical refrigerated display cabinets. Such cabinets are in widespread use and account for a considerable proportion of the energy used in shops. The open front is important for the shop-owner, who wants the chilled items in the cabinet to be well exposed and easily accessible. The purpose of the work has been to analyse the energy flows in display cabinets and subsequently analysing the possibilities to reducing the cabinets' energy requirements while retaining or improving their performance. The work has involved controlled investigations in a climate chamber in order to determine how the ambient climatic conditions and other factors affect energy use. The results show that the energy requirement of a display cabinet is linearly proportional to the difference in specific enthalpy between that of the ambient air and that of the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> in the cabinet. This means that the cooling power requirement for any arbitrary climate can be determined from measurements of the energy requirements of two different ambient climates. An analysis of energy flows shows that infiltration provides the greatest inward heat leakage in a display cabinet. Radiation and illumination also have a relatively substantial effect in comparison with other possible heat inputs, as they act on the most poorly cooled products in the cabinet. The overall energy requirement of a display cabinet is determined by the ambient climate and the temperature of the warmest item in the cabinet, which therefore in turn determines the mean temperature level in the entire cabinet. Results from experimental measurements and CFD calculations show that the performance of an open vertical display cabinet with <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> <b>blown</b> in through the back is affected by how it is loaded and by how the perforations in the back-plate are arranged. The conclusion is that <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> input through the back-plate is not the best method of cooling the foodstuff packages, as the <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is supplied where the need for cooling is least. The air curtain is required to provide good enclosure, and also to cool the foodstuffs {{at the front of the}} shelves, all with the least input of energy. The results from the modelling show that it is not possible to achieve the same efficiency and function with air curtains having the same height/width ratio but with different heights. If the air curtain is to cool items at the front of shelves, while at the same time being stable, a shorter air curtain is more efficient than a longer air curtain for the same height/width ratio. The overall conclusion is therefore that a single long air curtain should be replaced by a number of shorter air curtains, and that a thick air curtain is more efficient than a thin air curtain...|$|R

5000|$|The {{end of the}} 19th century saw the {{introduction}} of powered cleaners, although early types used some variation of <b>blowing</b> <b>air</b> to clean instead of suction.

5000|$|Early systems used rotary coolers, {{which were}} {{rotating}} cylinders {{similar to the}} kiln, into which the hot clinker dropped. [...] The combustion air was drawn up through the cooler as the clinker moved down, cascading through the air stream. In the 1920s, satellite coolers became common and remained in use until recently. These consist of a set (typically 7-9) of tubes attached to the kiln tube. They have the advantage that they are sealed to the kiln, and require no separate drive. From about 1930, the grate cooler was developed. This consists of a perforated grate through which <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> is <b>blown,</b> enclosed in a rectangular chamber. A bed of clinker up to 0.5 m deep moves along the grate. These coolers have two main advantages: they cool the clinker rapidly, which is desirable from a quality point of view (to avoid that alite, thermodynamically unstable below 1250 °C, revert to belite and free CaO on slow cooling), and, {{because they do not}} rotate, hot air can be ducted out of them for use in fuel drying, or for use as precalciner combustion air. The latter advantage means that they have become the only type used in modern systems [...]|$|R

2500|$|The A-type was the {{original}} wing design, with eight [...]303 calibre Browning machine guns, with 300 rounds per gun (rpg). The basic structure of the wing was unchanged until the C type in 1942. The one major alteration made to this wing, soon after production started, was the incorporation of a heating system for the gun bays, to prevent the guns from freezing up at high altitudes. To achieve this, open structures, such as wing ribs, surrounding the gun-bays were closed off, forming closed bays for each gun. Ducting was added, which drew heated air from the engine radiator and transferred it into the now-closed weapon-bays. Underwing vents, covered by streamlined triangular blisters just inboard of the wingtips, extracted the air, creating a negative pressure differential, and caused more heated air to be drawn in, ensuring {{a steady supply of}} heated air without any need for a mechanical blower. To keep <b>cold</b> <b>air</b> from <b>blowing</b> in via the muzzle openings in the leading edge, they were sealed with red fabric adhesive tape by ground crew while loading the ammunition trays. The guns fired through the tape, so they were no longer sealed after combat. Towards the end of 1940, the fabric covered ailerons were replaced by ones covered in light alloy. The A-type wing was only compatible with the 8 × [...]303 Browning machine gun armament suite.|$|R
