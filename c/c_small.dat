50|$|A forged deed {{was made}} at the order of James Fleming (probably James Fleming, 7th Baron Slane (d. 1491-92)) on 16 January 1471/72, but back-dated to 20 July 1460, which purported to show that David Fleming had settled his lands on feoffees {{for the use of}} Sir James Fleming. The drafter confessed in {{dramatic}} circumstances to the forgery in a deed dated 24 March 1483/84:Exemplification, by Richard Mapowe, doctor of letters, president of the Consistory Court of Exeter Diocese, of a sworn confession by Richard Hey, late of Dublin, and formerly a servant of James Fleming, knight, that James Fleming, Richard Hey, and Richard Dexter of Slane, gent., did forge a charter and a power of attorney, in the house of Richard Dexter at Carek Carrick, on 16 January 1472/73 (1471/2), 11 Edward IV. Recites that Richard Hey was travelling from Ireland by ship, with the forged documents, but was caught by a tempest in the Severn Sea, and he, being then in great peril, was induced to confess by a certain cleric of Bridgwater. The ship was driven into Ilfracombe, and Richard Hey now places his confession on record. The forged charter is recited. It purports to be a grant from David Flemyng, Baron of Slane, to Richard Begg, priest, Robert Rochefort, priest and Christopher White, yeoman, of the manors of Croyde Georgeham, Bratton Fleming, Highbray, Alverdiscott, Ash Rogus, South Molton, Haxton, and Licheton, dated 20 July 1460. The exemplification is a notarial instrument, bearing the notarial sign of Thomas Gill, clerk, papal and imperial notary. At the foot of the document is a note that John Atwell, Mayor of Exeter, has for further confirmation of the exemplification, and at the special request of Richard Hey, affixed his seal. Attached are the following seals: (a) a fragment of a vesica shaped seal, probably that of the Exeter Consistory Court.(b) Seal of the Moyaralty of Exeter (damaged).Also the following 4 seals depicting a bird, probably those of witnesses: (<b>c)</b> <b>Small</b> circular seal depicting a bird, probably a pelican.
