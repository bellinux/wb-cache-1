40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of learning journals maintained by 27 Graduate Diploma in Education students while undertaking a 1 -year course of study in a subject in human development and learning. The learning journals yielded four types of information: (1) students' perceptions of the subject (its structure, style, assessment); (2) students' understandings of and reflections on the theoretical content presented in the subject (informed knowledge); (3) students' connection of theory with practical teaching experiences; and (4) indications of their development as learners and teachers. Analysis of this information indicated students' movement from naive to informed views on teaching and learning through declarative (knowing what) and procedural (knowing how) knowledge about teaching and learning in the early parts of the subject to conditional knowledge (knowing when and why) through {{the remainder of the}} subject. Students tended to see theory as being unrelated to practice until the first practice teaching session when many students' journal entries exhibited evidence of theory and practice becoming <b>connected.</b> <b>Journal</b> entries during the second practice teaching experience provided extensive evidence of the development of conditional knowledge.

40|$|Contemporary design {{solutions}} {{in the engine}} engineering are aimed at raising a great many technical and economic performances, and enhancing manufacturability. When producing the V-shaped six-cylinder engines, the camber angle is often taken to be equal to 90 °, which is technologically advantageous {{in the production of}} V 8 engines. However, this solution leads to the engine instability and deteriorates mass-dimension and vibration performances of the engine. A crankshaft with the offset <b>connecting</b> rod <b>journals</b> is the solution to which Western and Russian power plant developers have increasingly taken recourse. However, introducing such a shaft entails a number of difficulties, and what is the most important requires special methods of calculation. There are no direct analytical methods to calculate this type of crankshafts. The article describes a technique to estimate endurance using a software complex "KVAL", developed at the BMSTU Department "Piston engines". This software disables direct examination of the crankshaft of this type, however, in conjunction with other calculations enables estimating endurance. The main point of the technique is a two-staged calculation. The original crankshaft is represented at first as a crankshaft with the connecting rods, sitting side-by-side. The article studies its endurance in the fillets of the rod bearing journal transition to the cheek and also at the outlets of two oil-feed holes. The second stage presumes that the shaft has an articulated rod and using the same type of calculations studies the fillet transition of the rod bearing journals to the intermediate cheek by its representation as an oil hole. Each of the stages refines theoretical coefficients of stress concentration through numerical simulation in the software package "ANSYS", thereby making calculation more stringent. The results obtained are very evident and representative, but also allow us to suggest a number of hypotheses for further research. The proposed technique enables us to study endurance of the crankshafts with offset <b>connecting</b> rod <b>journals,</b> as well as the Napoleone crankshafts of opposed reciprocating engines. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we use {{research}} chains {{across the}} citation graph {{as the basis}} for journal impact analysis. While some existing measures take into account research chains that end in a given journal, we calculate the proportion of research chains that include a journal, obtaining a new index of journal impact, Outerfactor, that is directly related to Pagerank (Brin and Page, 1998), Eigenfactor (Bergstrom, 2007) and the Invariant Method (Pinsky and Narin, 1976). In this way, the Outerfactor score obtained by each journal is independent on its own citation pattern and its article share. To our knowledge, this is the fi�rst measure that satis�fes these invariance properties whilst accounting for both direct and indirect impact. Based on research chains that <b>connect</b> two <b>journals,</b> we also construct new measures for analyzing cross-impact. This cross-impact analysis results in a two-fold view of Outerfactor in terms of a journal�'s infl�uence (impact) on other journals, or a journal�'s contribution to all journals' �impact scores. Finally, we provide an illustration with 60 economics journals, showing how Outerfactor performs compared to other measures: apart from its cardinal invariance, Outerfactor behaves more robustly to ordinal manipulation than other eigenvector-based measures. ...|$|R
