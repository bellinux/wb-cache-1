50|$|Coining: {{is similar}} to forming with the main {{difference}} being that a <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> may form completely different features on either face of the blank, these features being transferred {{from the face of}} the punch or die respectively. The <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> and punch flow the metal by squeezing the blank within a confined area, instead of bending the blank. For example: an Olympic medal that was formed from a <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> may have a flat surface on the back and a raised feature on the front. If the medal was formed (or embossed), the surface on the back would be the reverse image of the front.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{requirements}} on tools {{used in the}} production of coins include high quality and reliability, dependent on the materials from which they are made, on manufacturing technology, heat treatment and final operations achieving functional area modification. Properties of the material of coins vary during their production and there is the so-called operational degradation that can be caused by an inappropriate technology of manufacturing. The quality of coining dies is expressed as their service life which ranges from approximately one hundred thousand to one million pieces of coins produced. Therefore, it is necessary to pay enough attention to the service life of coining dies. Surface treatment {{in the form of the}} application of hard PVD coatings is one of the ways of increasing the durability of <b>coining</b> <b>die.</b> In the present study, we analysed and tested three types of coatings deposited onto coining dies made of tool steel...|$|E

It is also subbmitting a design solution to functional parts for blanking the “windows” and coining the “locks”. The cage will be made from sheet steel 11 300. 29. This cage should replace the current one machined from the brass Ms 58 Al. According to the literary research and development experiences of the company ZKL Brno, a. s., two pairs of tools were designed. First one for blanking the “windows” {{and second one for}} coining the “locks”. Blanking punch, blanking die and coining punch will be made from the steel 19436, <b>coining</b> <b>die</b> will be made from the steel 19312. Heat-treating process will be accomplished according to the enclosed drawings. Both pairs of tools will be mounted in the press LENR 63 AU (manufactured by the company ŠMERAL Trnava), with nominal force 630 kN...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> are consumables, most of mints {{have adopted}} the hard surface coating on <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> in order to {{increase}} the wear resistance of them. Even though <b>coining</b> <b>dies</b> for “proof coins” are coated by Cr-plating, they have especially short life time. Instead of Cr-plating, we tried to apply Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) film for proof coins. In order to examine the effect of the DLC films, proof coins were actually produced with the DLC coated dies. In consequence, the die life using DLC coating is estimated to be more than twice as long as that for Cr-plating...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1870s, the United States Mint in Philadelphia {{commissioned}} him {{to carve}} <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> for U.S. Trade Dollars [...] - [...] coins {{with a higher}} silver content than regular U.S. silver dollars for use in international trade, especially with China, Japan and Korea.

2500|$|Variety collections: Because mints {{generally}} issue thousands or {{millions of}} any given coin, they use multiple sets of <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> to produce the same <b>coin.</b> Occasionally these <b>dies</b> have slight differences.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of medieval coins were cold struck; the planchets were not heated. While medieval <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> were largely made of iron, some dies have been discovered with a small region at {{the face of the}} die which is made of steel. As technology and the economy changed {{over the course of the}} Middle Ages, so did the techniques used to create <b>coin</b> <b>dies.</b> While most ancient <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> used engraving very heavily, early medieval coinage was dominated by dies created mostly from punches, which displace the metal of the die instead of removing it. There is evidence of medieval die cutters using engraving tools to lay out designs, and to create detailed punches. However, engraving on the face of the die did not become commonplace until the early Renaissance.|$|R

Because of the high relief of the <b>coin</b> <b>die,</b> a test striking was made to see if coins would release from the Confederate die. The die was made by a printing plate engraver (A.H.M. Peterson) in New Orleans who was unfamiliar with techniques required to engrave <b>coining</b> <b>dies.</b> These <b>coins</b> were struck using a U.S. obverse die (Seated Liberty) and the Confederate die made by Peterson.

50|$|A <b>coin</b> <b>die</b> {{is one of}} the two {{metallic}} {{pieces that}} are used to strike a coin, one per each side of the <b>coin.</b> A <b>die</b> contains an inverse version of the image to be struck on the coin. Striking a coin refers to pressing an image into the blank metal disc, or planchet, and is a term descended from the days when the dies were struck with hammers to deform the metal into the image of the dies.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} mints {{correlates}} {{closely with the}} history of coins. In the beginning, hammered coinage or cast coinage were the chief means of coin minting, with resulting production runs numbering as little as the hundreds or thousands. In modern mints, <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> are manufactured in large numbers and planchets are made into milled coins by the billions.|$|R

50|$|In 1852, the Royal Mint {{started to}} strike the second issue, but due to a heavy {{schedule}} and time pressure, the <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> and planchets were transferred to Heaton's Mint. There is {{a way that the}} strikings can be distinguished. The Royal Mint issue has the dies in medallic alignment, whereas, the Heaton's Mint issue has the <b>dies</b> in <b>coin</b> alignment.|$|R
50|$|The {{preparation}} of the flan or planchet has varied over the years. In ancient times, the flan was heated before striking because the metal that the <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> were made of was not as hard as dies today, and the dies would have worn faster and broken sooner had the flan not been heated to a high temperature to soften it.|$|R

According to Spindel, many dies were hastily and carelessly produced, producing numerous minor varieties.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{differences}} in individual dies used in the <b>coin</b> <b>dies</b> used to produce these coins, there are over one hundred known varieties from each year.

50|$|A die clash {{occurs when}} a {{planchet}} is not fed into the collar that holds the coin {{in place for the}} minting process. The two dies meet and each carries away part of the design embedded on the <b>die.</b> <b>Coins</b> minted using these <b>dies</b> cause <b>coins</b> to be minted with parts of the reverse design on the obverse or parts of the obverse on the reverse of the <b>coin.</b> <b>Die</b> rotations cause <b>coins</b> to be minted with the reverse or obverse of the coin partially or fully rotated. A die rotation occurs when the dies become loose and they then turn.|$|R
