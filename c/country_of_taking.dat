The authors provide explanations about the push and pull factors of return migration among Turkish immigrants in the Netherlands. The factors inﬂuencing return to one’s <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin are, for example, the social and political climate, labour market participation and social integration in the host society, including discrimination and carrier prospects.

40|$|Excerpt] This {{report is}} based on the {{findings}} of research conducted in Belgium, France, Italy and Spain, as part of project on “integration of migrant domestic workers in Europe”, implemented by the ILO and its partners with the financial support of the European Union. Data suggest that women migrants are often facing the greatest integration challenges, but the specific situation of migrant domestic workers in Europe remains often under- researched and little understood. Evidence-based, action-oriented research is key to producing policies that will address the needs of European labour markets, and critical to expanding the opportunities for successful integration of this important and growing segment of the population. In light of this, the current research aims: (a) to explore social, economic, and institutional factors affecting life and working conditions of migrant domestic workers in Europe; and (b) to identify challenges and practical ways public services, trade unions, employers and other social actors can support their improvement. The ambition is to better understand integration dynamics by analysing the experiences and activities of migrant domestic workers themselves in <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> destination, <b>taking</b> into account their voices and experiences as a main source of information...|$|R

How far are they shaped by local and international politics, migration histories, particular religious traditions, multi-cultural interfaces and transnational links? To what extent do developments in Islamic fashion transcend local differences and encourage new forms of cosmopolitan communication and exchange? How do such developments pose a challenge to conventional understandings of fashion both in the popular media and fashion scholarship?

Frequently cited economic reasons for returning include (1) higher returns in home countries to human capital accumulated in host countries (Dustmann, Fadlon and Weiss, 2007, 2011); (2) higher returns to self-employment activities in home countries relative to host countries (Dustmann and Kirchkamp 2002); (3) higher preferences for consumption in home countries (Dustmann and Weiss 2007); (4) a high purchasing power in home countries relative to host countries (Dustmann and Weiss 2007); (5) an increase in wage differentials between host and home countries (Dustmann 2003); (6) a fulfilment of a saving target that allows migrants to become entrepreneurs in home countries (McCormick and Wahba 2001; Wahba 2015; Mesnard 2004); and (7) worsening economic outlook in host countries relative to home countries. Non-financial factors such as personal preferences, social ties, and lifestyles are also found to be strong determinants of return migration (Gibson and McKenzie 2011).|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the level of Earnings Opacity and a company’s informational environment, specifically considering accounting standards and the legal origins of the system. Design/methodology/approach – The sample consisted of publicly traded companies from 20 countries classified as emerging, based on agency Standard & Poor’s index. The sample included data from 2004 to 2013. In order to compare the indicators among the group <b>of</b> <b>countries,</b> <b>taking</b> into account their institutional characteristics, the Mann-Whitney test and the Kruskal-Wallis test were performed. Findings – The assessment of the informational environment measures’ behavior in emerging countries revealed that these measures were correlated, suggesting that, despite different behaviors, opacity proxies share information. The fact that earnings opacity was lower in countries that had already adopted international standards during the analyzed period was also observed. In the same sense, a higher level of income smoothing was detected in <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> French code law origins. Originality/value – This article contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the characteristics of an accounting informational environment and the levels of opacity of the information emitted by accounting. Thus, this article has helped managers, investors and regulators to understand users’ needs and how country-specific characteristics change their perspectives...|$|R
