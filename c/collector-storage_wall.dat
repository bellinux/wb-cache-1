40|$|A <b>collector-storage</b> <b>wall</b> (CSW) is an {{effective}} system for solar energy utilization in buildings. The CSW is usually combined with fenestration to form a south-facing facÌ§ade, which has an important effect on the indoor environment. This thesis presents a numerical model to analyze the thermal performance of the CSWs, and simulations based on this model are carried out for the following cases: a traditional heat storage wall with natural convective flow, integrated photovoltaic (PV) CSWs with forced convective flow, a wall with controlled blinds, and several cases with a phase change material (PCM). For the traditional masonry CSW, simulation results indicate that optimal room temperature occurs when {{the thickness of the}} heat storage wall is 0. 35 { 598 } 0. 40 m and the width of the air gap in the cavity is 0. 20 { 598 } 0. 25 m. The blinds used in CSWs can reduce direct solar gain and enhance room comfort by lowering the temperature swing by up to 2 { 493 }C. Experiments are performed to determine the thermal properties of the PCM gypsum board, to verify the simulation results and to evaluate the energy performance of the CSWs for the different cases...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe monthly-average {{auxiliary}} energy {{requirement of}} a building with a sunspace is estimated using the unutilizability method. Two theoritical limits to a sunspace system performance are defined considering the system to have either zero thermal capacity of infinite thermal capacity. With zero thermal capacity, all solar gain {{in excess of the}} load has to be dumped and is calculated using the unutilizability factor. With infinite thermal capacity, all solar gains in excess of the load is stored and reused at a later time. To evaluate the auxiliary energy needed by a finite thermal capacity house, the correlation developped for <b>collector-storage</b> <b>walls</b> using the unutilizability concept is applied. Results from the correlation are compared to yearly TRNSYS simulation results {{for a wide variety of}} systems types and locations and shows a good agreement (3. 4 GJ on a scale from 0 to 160 GJ). This method is general as it allows changes in the sunspace geometry, nature of materials and type of utilization...|$|R
