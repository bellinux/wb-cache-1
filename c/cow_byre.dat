5|$|The {{site was}} {{refurbished}} {{with funding from}} the Heritage Lottery Fund in April 2007 with the work completed in June the following year. This included the renovation of the Grade II listed Manor Farm library {{as part of a}} borough-wide programme by the London Borough of Hillingdon. The Duck Pond Market began in the Great Barn in December 2008, following the refurbishment, and runs twice a month. Winston Churchill Theatre, not included in the original restoration work, received a £370,000 grant from Hillingdon Council in March 2011 to enable its refurbishment. The other buildings on the site are used as an Exhibition venue (the <b>Cow</b> <b>Byre</b> Gallery), community spaces (The Stables and the Manor Farm Community Hut) and as a small interpretation centre and base of the Hillingdon Music Service (Manor Farm House).|$|E
25|$|The Reverend Donald Nicolson of Scorrybreac, head of {{the clan}} {{at the end of}} the 17th century, is reputed to have had 23 children, through whom he is a common {{ancestor}} of many Skye families. Donald's attachment to the Episcopalian faith, and refusal to swear allegiance to William III after 1689 seems to have resulted in his being driven from his parish as a Non-juror and Jacobite some time after 1696. The MacDonalds of Sleat avoided action in the 1745 rebellion, and the Nicolsons did not rise as a clan for Charles Edward Stuart, but tradition maintains that a band of Nicolsons fought at Culloden in the Jacobite ranks. As a cousin of the intensely Jacobite MacLeods of Rassay, the chief, John Nicolson, appears to have assisted in the concealment of Charles Edward in a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> on his estates: John's descendants preserved a lock of the prince's hair, and the cup out of which he drank on his night on Scorrybreac lands. Another man of the clan, Donald Nicolson from Raasay, also helped to protect the Young Pretender during his flight after the defeat, and was recorded by Bishop Robert Forbes in The Lyon in Mourning as suffering torture for his refusal to reveal the whereabouts of the prince after arrest by government troops. Alexander Mackenzie, in his history of Clan Mackenzie, claims that Angus Nicolson of Stornoway raised 300 men from the island of Lewis for Jacobite service, only to be ordered back by a furious Earl of Seaforth when they landed on the mainland.|$|E

50|$|The Victorian house {{between the}} {{courtyard}} and Pannal Cricket Ground is Bridge House, which was once the farm house of Thomas Hudson, who owned much of the local land {{to the south of}} Crimple Beck. His barn stands {{on the other side of}} the cricket ground, and is now converted to housing. The barn had <b>cow</b> <b>byres</b> and stables behind. The attached semicircular gin gang, where a horse turned the grinding mill for the corn, existed until the winter of 2010-2011, when it was demolished to be rebuilt as domestic accommodation.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the first}} three series, up until the two Christmas {{specials}} of 1983 and 1985, most interior scenes were recorded on video at Pebble Mill and edited together with exterior shots. This provided hardships in December 1977, when filming briefly returned to the Dales, after a block of studio recording, to capture the look of winter. The temperatures dropped well below freezing. [...] "The snow was high and the ice was solid," [...] explained Robert Hardy in 2003. [...] "I remember two occasions when we were so cold, from the wind on the tops, that we couldn't speak. We had to stop." [...] Peter Davison recalled: [...] "People would hand me {{a cup of tea}} and I would stick my hand in it, rather than drink it, because my fingers were so cold." [...] For the final four series, much of the filming other than at Skeldale House was done wholly on location at the farms. [...] "Studios aren't really like <b>cow</b> <b>byres</b> or horse stables or country farm houses," [...] explained Hardy, [...] "so one had to make believe a great deal in those early episodes. I mean, they made good sets, but it was better later when we stopped using the studio and did all the filming in real locations in Yorkshire. That was when it really started coming alive, because the cameras were in real situations." ...|$|R
50|$|Between 1793 and 1799 Beddoes had {{a clinic}} at Hope Square, Hotwells in Bristol where he treated {{patients}} with tuberculosis. On {{the principle that}} butchers seemed to suffer less from tuberculosis than others, he kept <b>cows</b> in a <b>byre</b> alongside the building and encouraged them to breathe on his patients. This became the source of local ridicule, amongst claims that animals were kept in the clinic's bedrooms, against the protests of landlords.|$|R
5000|$|The name New Cowper {{originally}} {{comes from}} the Old English [...] "cu-byre", meaning a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> or cowshed. Hence, [...] "New Cowper" [...] means a new cowshed. It has previously been spelled New Couper, and even simply as Cowper or Couper, without the [...] "New" [...] prefix.|$|E
5000|$|Portbraddon or Portbraddan (...) is a hamlet in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The hamlet has {{an ancient}} salmon fishing station. A local myth states that Portbraddon {{contains}} the smallest church in Ireland, {{and the building}} in question was constructed in the 1950s as a <b>cow</b> <b>byre,</b> which the government listed without prior research.|$|E
5000|$|Ardestie earthhouse was {{discovered}} in the 1940s {{to the north of}} Mains of Ardestie farm. It was excavated in 1949-1950 by F.T. Wainwright, who first suggested that the function of the souterrain was as an underground <b>cow</b> <b>byre,</b> although grain storage and ritual use have also been suggested. Incorporated into the structure are recycled stones with neolithic/Bronze Age cup and ring marks ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{he pressed}} his face close {{to the window and}} watched the fire on the hearth. He saw the husbandman's wife get up and feed it in the night with black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white and cold, he saw the man's child pick up a wicker pot {{plastered}} inside with earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his blanket, and go out to tend the <b>cows</b> in the <b>byre.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dairying is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few <b>cows</b> in a <b>byre</b> {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|R
60|$|For {{a haunted}} house, Wodrow {{provides}} us with that of Johnstone of Mellantae, in Annandale (1707). The authority is Mr. Cowan, who had it from Mr. Murray, minister of St. Mungo's, who got it from Mellantae himself, the worthy gentleman weeping as he described his misfortunes. His daughter, Miss Johnstone, was milking a <b>cow</b> in the <b>byre,</b> by daylight, when she saw a tall man, almost naked, probably a tramp, who frightened her into a swoon. The house was then 'troubled and disturbed' by flights of stones, and disappearance of objects. Young Dornock, after a visit to Mellantae, {{came back with a}} story that loud knockings were heard on the beds, and sounds of pewter vessels being thrown about, though, in the morning, all were found in their places. The ghost used also to pull the medium, Miss Johnstone, by the foot, and toss her bed-clothes about.|$|R
50|$|Three large blocks {{comprised}} The Rhea in 1838, the {{forerunner of}} a much larger complex in the late 20th century. In 1851 Thomas Gardiner farmed the land of 220 acres with 7 labourers. A brick house was built in 1900, with several 19th century workers stone cottages. A timber-framed stone barn was erected in the 18th century for a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> and stone stables.|$|E
50|$|The Byre Theatre's {{first home}} was a disused <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> which the group cleaned out and ran as the St. Andrews Play Club, giving {{performances}} to audiences who sat on cushions on the floor. The first performance was Murder Trial by Sydney Box in 1935. Within a couple of years, the Byre Theatre had established a considerable reputation running a programme of performances which attracted audiences the theatre was barely able to hold.|$|E

He specialised in landscapes and still lifes but also frequently painted portraits and subjects from life. He was regularly {{featured in the}} local press. Paintings by him are in various private collections {{in this country and}} abroad.|$|E

5000|$|Aged 20, O'Hanlon {{was killed}} along with Seán South while {{taking part in}} {{an attack on the}} Royal Ulster Constabulary (R.U.C.) barracks in Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, during the Border Campaign. Several other IRA members were wounded in the botched attack. The IRA fled the scene in a dumper truck. They {{abandoned}} it near the border. They left South and O'Hanlon, both then unconscious, in a <b>cow</b> <b>byre,</b> and crossed into the Republic of Ireland on foot for help for their comrades. The wounded IRA men were treated as [...] "car crash victims" [...] by sympathetic staff in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Dublin.The events and personalities are sympathetically recalled in Dominic Behan's ballad The Patriot Game.|$|E
50|$|During the War of Independence the Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{burned the}} Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) barracks {{located on the}} Mullingar Road. The RIC then moved to the courthouse. In 1921, the IRA began a wave of burnings which {{targeted}} government offices throughout Ireland. This was {{a concerted effort to}} cripple the UK civil service in its day-to-day administration of the country. The Market House was also torched. Two sitting magistrates were kidnapped by the IRA {{on their way to the}} court. The men were held hostage locally, reportedly in a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> on the Hill of Moal. They were later released unharmed after forty eight hours, and the village was spared reprisals. The Market House was rebuilt in 1926, and serves as the Town Fire Station.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, {{he married}} Madge Cox, his {{sweetheart}} {{from the next}} road in his native Rushden. They moved {{to the village of}} Little Chart in Kent and bought an old granary and this together with an acre of garden they converted into a home. Bates was a keen and knowledgeable gardener and wrote many books on flowers. The Granary remained their home for the whole of their married life. After Bates' death Madge moved to a bungalow, which had originally been a <b>cow</b> <b>byre,</b> next to the Granary. She died in 2004 at the age of 95. They raised two sons and two daughters. Their younger son, Jonathan, was nominated for an Academy Award for his sound work on the 1982 film Gandhi.|$|E

50|$|Grange is {{situated}} {{a mile or}} so from Carrick Castle and is a late 15th-century (1460) tower house built by the Bermingham family. The tower was embellished with ornate Jacobean chimneys and battlements in the early 17th century. In 1735 Walter Bermingham sold Grange to Thomas Tyrrell in whose family it remained until in 1988. The late Robert Tyrrell transferred ownership of the tower to Dúchas, the then Office of Public Works. The remaining buildings and grounds were handed down to Hugh Tyrrell who lives in England and from whom they are leased by The Tyrrell Trust Ltd.From 1460 onwards successive generations have added to or changed the character of Grange, with the building of a great hall now fully restored and named as Fallon Hall, with a walled garden, a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> and various stables and courtyards which have yet to be restored. Although the grounds are now overgrown, Grange's architecture is a beautiful example of its era.|$|E
50|$|According to Dean Donald Munro in his 1549 {{work about}} the Western Isles, {{the church was}} built for the Chiefs of the MacLeods of Harris, who lived in Dunvegan Castle in Skye, {{probably}} from about 1520, and is not considered the first church on the site {{although there is no}} clear evidence of an older Celtic church. Munro described the church as a monastery, but as there is no evidence hinting to a monastic community, this expression is believed to refer to a minister, and with it to an important parish church. It was a Catholic church before falling into disuse shortly after its completion around 1560 {{as a consequence of the}} reformation, but the churchyard continued to be used as a MacLeod burial site. The church's decayed roof was renewed in 1784 by Captain Alexander MacLeod of Berneray, but burned down shortly after and had to be rebuilt once again in 1787. In the 19th century it was used as a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> before being restored by Catherine Herbert Countess of Dunmore in 1873, and in 1913, the tower was rebuilt after being damaged by a lightning stroke six years earlier. Today, the church is under the care of Historic Scotland.Notable 17th-century poet Mary Macleod (Mairi Nighean Alasdair Ruaidh) is said to be buried here.|$|E
5000|$|Larnach Castle {{was built}} as the private {{residence}} of William James Mudie Larnach. Land {{for the construction}} of Larnach Castle was purchased in 1870, and prominent Dunedin architect R.A. Lawson was selected to design the Gothic Revival mansion. The site was clear-felled and levelled, allowing construction to begin in 1871. Approximately 200 workmen were used to complete the main structure, using imported materials from around the world. [...] Much of the stone used for the Castle came from a basalt quarry nearby. Other materials included yellow brick, Glasgow brick, Oamaru stone, Port Chalmers basalt, Cornwall blackstone, Italian marble, Marseilles cobbles, Catlins timber, North Island Kauri and local Caversham sandstone for the ballroom. The Godfrey family carved many of the building's intricate ceilings; a single ceiling in the main foyer took six and half years to complete. In 1875, twenty tonne of glass was imported from Venice, in an effort to enclose exposed verandahs unsuitable for Dunedin winters. The addition of the 3000 square foot ballroom was made in 1887; a 21st birthday present for Larnach's eldest daughter Kate. The resulting complex eventually contained 43 rooms and required a staff of 46 servants. The complex included 35 acres reserved for grounds, including a vinery, and a home farm of 300 acres with its own farmstead including a <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> for 300 cows, stables, and quarters for farm workers.|$|E

50|$|A {{good example}} of a long house is Cilewent Farmhouse from Llansanffraid Cwmteuddwr, nr Rhayader, Radnorshire which has been reconstructed at St Fagans. This is a long-house, with cattle being {{accommodated}} {{at one end and}} humans at the other, with a passageway between the two parts. This type of farmhouse was once common in mid- and south Wales. This cruck and timber-framed house was originally built about 1470 as an open hall house. The original timber walls were rebuilt in stone in 1734, with the date being carved on the head of the entrance door frame. All that remains of the original house are the two cruck trusses in the cow house and the timber-framed partition between the cow house and the dwelling. Another re-construction at St Fagans is Hendre'r-ywydd Uchaf Farmhouse from Llangynhafal in Denbighshire. This a cruck-framed hall-house dendrochronologically dated to 1508 and typical of the better class of Welsh farmhouse in the late Middle Ages. The building is divided into five bays, the lower two used for housing for cattle and horses, the centre bay serving as a work-room and the upper two comprising the open hall and a bedroom. The outside walls are timber-framed, the panels being in-filled with wattle and daubed with clay. Both the daubed panels and the timber work are limewashed as was common in the Middle Ages. The open hearth is placed in the centre of the hall, smoke from the fire escaping through the roof and the unglazed windows. Excavations in 2003 by Bill Britnell at Tŷ Draw at Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr in north Powys have done much to elucidate the relationship of the cow house with the hall of a longhouse. This is a classic three unit hall house of longhouse type. It has an open hall of two bays set between inner and outer rooms, the outer room acting as an <b>cow</b> <b>byre.</b> Dendrochrononology on the roof purlins suggest that Tŷ Draw was completed shortly after 1479/80 and it has been possible to suggest from this dating that the house was built by Hywel ap Rees. In the byre area, which was accessed by door, a series of small post holes were noted, that have been interpreted as wickerwork hurdles. These would have provided stalls for cattle which were overwintered from November to March each year. Similar evidence for stalls for cattle have been found at Tŷ Mawr and Tyddyn Llwydion in Montgomeryshire.|$|E
40|$|Mull Theatre is a {{professional}} touring theatre company based on a small island off {{the west coast of}} Scotland. In 2008 the company relocated from a small converted <b>cow</b> <b>byre</b> which seated 42 people to a new purpose-built venue –Druimfin - on {{a different part of the}} island. The move was made possible through a grant from the Scottish Arts Council in 2006, which was awarded on the expectation that the new building would be a ‘production centre’ as opposed to a theatre. That is to say the emphasis in the design of the new space was to be placed on the production rather than the reception of the theatrical event. This stands in contrast to the expectation of many theatre attendees that the new space would continue as it had been – as a place to go and see a theatre production - but that it would do so out of a much larger, more comfortable and better equipped venue. Building Theatres/Theatre Buildings stems from a three year Collaborative Doctoral Award between Mull Theatre and the University of Glasgow, which was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). Using the partnership that emerged from this award, the thesis explores what was potentially lost and gained in the move in order to draw conclusions about the wider relationship between spaces of performance and the creation of theatrical meaning in relation to small and medium scale touring theatre. It also uses the company’s dual identity as a touring company with its own permanent building to extend the discussion and to examine the wide range of venues which currently form the rural touring circuit in Scotland. By bringing together primary fieldwork from a pivotal moment in the company’s identity alongside current dialogues regarding theatre space and touring theatre, this research provides new knowledge about this often overlooked theatre company, its buildings and its role within contemporary Scottish theatre and small scale rural touring...|$|E
