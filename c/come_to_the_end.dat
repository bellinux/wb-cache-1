25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage that has occurred.|$|E

Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely {{time to take a}} break. There was still a desire amongst us to make music, but also a realisation that other aspects of our lives were being neglected.

She also deemed Pompeo's performance in the episode [...] "exceptional", describing what she regarded an [...] "exceptional moment" [...] which sees Meredith stand up to her mother. In response to the scene that sees Ellis interacting with Webber, Rater wrote that it is the first time she lets her guard down, exposing the previously hidden vulnerability, which allows her express the desire to be as happy and ordinary as her daughter.
