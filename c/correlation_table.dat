From {{the right side of}} the character table, the non-vibrational degrees of freedom, rotational (Rx and Ry) and translational (x, y, and z), are subtracted: Γvib = Γ3N - Γrot - Γtrans. This yields the Γvib, which is used to find the correct normal modes from the original symmetry, which is either C∞v or D∞h, using the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> above.

40|$|Data {{prefetching}} is {{a popular}} technique for tolerating long memory access latencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel type of prefetching: memory-side correlation prefetching implemented in a user-level thread. The prefetching thread runs on a general-purpose processor embedded in the main memory. By allocating the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> in main memory, we can afford the large space required by the table. In addition, the scheme can be supported with few modifications to the L 2 cache and no modification to the main processor core. We introduce a new organization of the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> and a new prefetching algorithm that enable fast and accurate farahead prefetching with high coverage. Overall, our evaluation shows that the algorithm effectively prefetches irregular applications, speeding up three applications {{by an average of}} 1. 28. Furthermore, our scheme can work synergistically with a conventional processor-side prefetcher to deliver an average speedup of 1. 36. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes using a User-Level Memory Thread (ULMT) for {{correlation}} prefetching. In this approach, a user thread runs on a general-purpose processor in main memory, {{either in}} the memory controller chip or in a DRAM chip. The thread performs correlation prefetching in software, sending the prefetched data into the L 2 cache of the main processor. This approach requires minimal hardware beyond the memory processor: The <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> is a software data structure that resides in main memory, while the main processor only needs a few modifications to its L 2 cache {{so that it can}} accept incoming prefetches. In addition, the approach has wide applicability, as it can effectively prefetch even for irregular applications. Finally, it is very flexible, as the prefetching algorithm can be customized by the user on an application basis. Our simulation results show that, through a new design of the <b>correlation</b> <b>table</b> and prefetching algorithm, our scheme delivers good results. Specifically, nine mostly-irregular applications show an average speedup of 1. 32. Furthermore, our scheme works well in combination with a conventional processor-side sequential prefetcher, in which case the average speedup increases to 1. 46. Finally, by exploiting the customization of the prefetching algorithm, we increase the average speedup to 1. 53...|$|E

30|$|Note {{that some}} of the {{stimulus}} sets contain only monophonic sounds, whereas others contain only stereophonic sounds, and, although the acoustic features are calculated on both channels in the latter case, the salience of an indicator in one channel compared to the other depends on the recording context. For example, if a car interior sound has been recorded from the driver's seat, the most relevant channel for a given sound feature will probably not be the same {{as if it had been}} recorded from the passenger's seat. Accordingly, the features in the <b>correlation</b> <b>tables</b> can be either from the left or the right channel, or from the mean of both channels.|$|R
40|$|A non-post-interrogation {{method of}} {{reducing}} sub-pixel bias errors and eliminating spurious vectors from particle image velocimetry (PIV) results is presented.

Anomalies are removed from the data set through direct element-by-element comparison of the <b>correlation</b> <b>tables</b> calculated from adjacent regions.

30|$|We {{took several}} steps {{to check for}} {{possible}} violations of the assumptions underlying path analyses. First, an examination of CR indicated satisfactory levels of internal consistency reliability among the multi-item scales. Second, we checked the matrix of <b>correlation</b> in <b>Table</b> 3 for evidence of multi-collinearity among the independent variables. Since all the correlations are below 0.50, multi-collinearity {{is not a problem}} (Billings and Wroten 1978) and factor analysis confirmed the existence of five distinct measures. Third, we also checked variance inflation factor values for all the constructs, and the results were less than 2.2 which was below the rule-of-thumb cut-off of 10 (Neter et al. 1990), suggesting that multi-collinearity is not a serious issue in this study. Furthermore, multi-collinearity is examined by using squared correlations. The squared correlations between constructs in the <b>correlation</b> matrix <b>Table</b> 3 are not above 0.8, suggesting that the multi-collinearity does not cause a serious problem (Zhou et al. 2014).|$|R

The net MN deposition of 2.07  g[*]N/kg that occurred 3  years after reforestation commenced, compared with 1.19  g[*]N/kg soil in 6  yr-RR- 1 and 1.24  g[*]N/kg soil in 6  yr-RR- 2, suggest the longer temporal influence at the latter two sites was probably masked by the unfavourable site-specific conditions overriding the temporal influence. Significant TN deposition seems to have occurred down to 0.4  m depth in 3  yr-RR- 2 and 6  yr-RR- 2 plots compared with 0.2  m in the 6  yr-RR- 1 plot.
