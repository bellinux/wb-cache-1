40|$|A {{study of}} {{environmental}} chloride and groundwater balance {{has been carried}} out in order to estimate their relative value for measuring average groundwater recharge under a humid <b>climatic</b> <b>environment</b> with a relatively shallow water table. The hybrid water fluctuation method allowed the split of the hydrologic year into two seasons of recharge (wet season) and no recharge (dry season) to appraise specific yield during the dry season and, second, to estimate recharge from the water table rise during the wet season. This well elaborated and suitable method has then been used as a standard to assess the effectiveness of the chloride method under forest humid <b>climatic</b> <b>environment.</b> Effective specific yield of 0. 08 was obtained for the study area. It reflects an effective basin-wide process and is insensitive to local heterogeneities in the aquifer system. The hybrid water fluctuation method gives an average recharge value of 87. 14 mm/year at the basin scale, which represents 5. 7 % of the annual rainfall. Recharge value estimated based on the chloride method varies between 16. 24 and 236. 95 mm/year with an average value of 108. 45 mm/year. It represents 7 % of the mean annual precipitation. The discrepancy observed between recharge value estimated by the hybrid water fluctuation and the chloride mass balance methods appears to be very important, which could imply the ineffectiveness of the chloride mass balance method for this present humid environment...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that the application of the old concepts of pasture management developed in Europe and the USA have been unsuccessful in the Tropics. In some areas under-utilization has resulted in poor animal output and low economic returns, whereas in other areas overgrazing has resulted in soil erosion and weeds. Tropical pasture utilization examines the problems involved and explains how pastures may be managed to meet the requirements of both plants and animals for growth and replacement. The author, Professor L R Humphreys, has been involved for many years in extensive research of Tropical and Subtropical pastures. Following an overview of the livestock systems of the Tropics, the effects of grazing animals on the edaphic, biotic and <b>climatic</b> <b>environment</b> of the pasture are described. The response of the animals to the available pasture are discussed in terms of pasture attributes of nutritive value and sward structure, selectivity and grazing behaviour. Methods for attaining continuity of forage supply are also described. The distinctive pasture characteristics of the Tropics, together with features of the <b>climatic</b> <b>environment,</b> lead to options for management whose emphases are different from those encountered in the management of temperate pasture and these are developed in this book.
