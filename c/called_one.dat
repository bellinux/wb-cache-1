5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of the parkway proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was <b>called</b> <b>one</b> of the deadliest roads {{in the world at}} the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of the parkway.|$|E

5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The Times of London <b>called</b> <b>one</b> of {{the most}} loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler.
