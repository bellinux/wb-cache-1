40|$|Formation {{movement}} {{is a type}} of coordinated movement that keeps virtual agents in a strict, prespecified shape. This thesis deals with creating a ro- bust, parametrized <b>group</b> <b>navigator,</b> that is capable of navigating a group of distributed agents through a 3 D environment of a computer game Unreal Tour- nament 2004. The navigator is capable of maintaining the formation in spite of environmental obstacles and a corridor width. Before writing this thesis, {{there was no way to}} control and navigate virtual agents as a group. This gives users of Pogamut, a platform that allows creating and controlling virtual agents, to operate this navigator for team tasks or experiment with this technology fur- ther.

40|$|The {{protective}} effects of erythropoietin on {{spinal cord injury}} have not been well described. Here, the eukaryotic expression plasmid pcDNA 3. 1 human erythropoietin was transfected into rat neural stem cells cultured in vitro. A rat model of spinal cord injury was established using a free falling object. In the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group,</b> transfected neural stem cells were injected into the rat subarachnoid cavity, while the neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group</b> was injected with non-transfected neural stem cells. Dulbecco′s modified Eagle′s medium/F 12 medium was injected into the rats in the spinal cord injury group as a control. At 1 - 4 weeks post injury, the motor function in the rat lower limbs was best in the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group,</b> followed by the neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group,</b> and lastly the spinal cord injury group. At 72 hours, compared with the spinal cord injury group, the apoptotic index and Caspase- 3 gene and protein expressions were apparently decreased, and the bcl- 2 gene and protein expressions were noticeably increased, in the tissues surrounding the injured region in the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group.</b> At 4 weeks, the cavities were clearly smaller and the motor and somatosensory evoked potential latencies were remarkably shorter in the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group</b> and neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group</b> {{than those in the}} spinal cord injury group. These differences were particularly obvious in the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group.</b> More CM-Dil-positive <b>cells</b> and horseradish peroxidase-positive nerve fibers and larger amplitude motor and somatosensory evoked potentials were found in the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group</b> and neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group</b> than in the spinal cord injury group. Again, these differences were particularly obvious in the human erythropoietin-neural stem <b>cells</b> <b>group.</b> These data indicate that transplantation of erythropoietin gene-modified neural stem cells into the subarachnoid cavity to help repair spinal cord injury and promote the recovery of spinal cord function better than neural stem cell transplantation alone. These findings may lead to significant improvements in the clinical treatment of spinal cord injuries...|$|R

40|$|This licentiate {{thesis is}} written at the multi-disciplinary {{research}} school Identity and Pluralism−and also within {{the subject of}} Church History−at the Department of Culture and Communication, University of Linkoping, Sweden. In the thesis {{the rise of the}} <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church is explained. Further the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church is analyzed with help of questions regarding identity and pluralism. The author conceives a basis of identity, an approach to define cell-structured churches. This basis can in turn constitute a premise for continued research. Furthermore adequate criteria to evaluate the movement are put forth. The dissertation poses three main questions. How was the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church formed? Is it possible to identify the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church with help of identity markers? What criteria are appropriate to use for an evaluation of the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church? The concept of the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church was coined by Dr. Ralph W. Neighbour and it is he and his book ‘Where Do We Go From Here?’ which are the eye-catchers in this thesis. In what way might Neighbour’s own personal development have affected the design? The intention is not to make a psychological study of Neighbour’s persona, but to weigh in some decisive events that are found in Neighbour’s own biography and that might have affected the design of the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church. But influence also has occurred from the outside. What has happened when the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church has met the congregations of reality in Korea, Singapore, The Ivory Coast and Columbia? What has Neighbour modified and what in the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church has endured? Within the given frame, 1965 - 2006, there has been an interaction going on between Neighbour and his personal development on the one side and his encounters with reality on the other. In this tension a process of reform is growing. The author will highlight what is lasting in this process, what stands for continuity, and what means a change of identity. The method is to begin with historically descriptive but devolves into being analytical. This thesis contributes to the basic research in the field of the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church. The movement of the Cell Church is a part of a forceful global course of events within Christianity. There are historians of religion and sociologists of religion who mean that a new kind of Christianity is forming in our times. The manner in which the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church relates to its contemporary period is interesting both from international as well as Swedish conditions. Is the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church an alternative that will replace the churches of old? Can the <b>Cell</b> <b>Group</b> Church contribute to the survival of the churches of old...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{telencephalon}} of ray-finned fishes has garnered {{considerable attention}} from comparative neuroanatomists, {{detailed descriptions of}} telencephalic organization are available {{for only a few}} species. This necessarily limits our understanding of telencephalic evolution, particularly in light of the extraordinary diversity of ray-finned fishes. Thus, we have charted the cyctoarchitecture of the telencephalon of the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia (Haplochromis) burtoni. We examined tissue sectioned in the transverse plane, and categorized <b>cell</b> <b>groups</b> based on size, shape, and staining intensity of cells, the density and distribution of cells, cell-poor zones, and relationship of <b>cell</b> <b>groups</b> to the anterior commissure and external sulci. In addition, to facilitate visualization of the transitions among <b>cell</b> <b>groups,</b> we aligned and animated a series of 100 sequential brain sections. We found that the A. burtoni telencephalon was similar to other percomorphs in being highly elaborated with many distinct <b>cell</b> <b>groups.</b> In the pallium, Dm, Dl, and Dc had a large number of <b>cell</b> <b>groups,</b> whereas Dd and Dp were more uniform. Although we recognized many similarities between the pallium of A. burtoni and other teleosts, we also recognized two <b>cell</b> <b>groups</b> (Dl-g and Dm- 2) that might represent specializations of cichlids. We found that the subpallium had a similar organization to that of other ray-finned fishes...|$|R
