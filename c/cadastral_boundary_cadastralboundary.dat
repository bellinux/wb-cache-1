It seeks to support delivery of more rapid and low-cost <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> mapping – and ultimately more widespread land tenure security.

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAV) are evolving as {{an alternative}} tool to acquire land tenure data. UAVs can capture geospatial data at high quality and resolution in a cost-effective, transparent and flexible manner, from which visible land parcel <b>boundaries,</b> i. e., <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> are delineable. This delineation is to no extent automated, even though physical objects automatically retrievable through image analysis methods mark {{a large portion of}} <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> This study proposes (i) a workflow that automatically extracts candidate <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> from UAV orthoimages and (ii) a tool for their semi-automatic processing to delineate final <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> The workflow consists of two state-of-the-art computer vision methods, namely gPb contour detection and SLIC superpixels that are transferred to remote sensing in this study. The tool combines the two methods, allows a semi-automatic final delineation and is implemented as a publicly available QGIS plugin. The approach does not yet aim to provide a comparable alternative to manual cadastral mapping procedures. However, the methodological development of the tool towards this goal is developed in this paper. A study with 13 volunteers investigates the design and implementation of the approach and gathers initial qualitative as well as quantitate results. The study revealed points for improvement, which are prioritized based on the study results and which will be addressed in future work.

40|$|In 1995, {{the concept}} of a dynamic cadastre, based on a dynamic {{geodetic}} datum, was proposed for New Zealand to recognize that all <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> in New Zealand are in some form of motion - relative to each other and relative to the geodetic datum which is also in motion. Subsequently New Zealand implemented a semi-dynamic geodetic datum which is accompanied by a deformation model. Later, a survey conversion project resulted in the boundaries of 70 % of the land parcels in New Zealand being coordinated to survey accuracy in terms of the semi-dynamic datum. These boundaries continue to be adjusted by least squares as new cadastral survey observations and geodetic control stations are integrated into the network. However the deformation model has not, in practice, been routinely applied to <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In 2010 and 2011, the Canterbury region in the South Island of New Zealand was subjected to a sequence of earthquakes that caused widespread damage and resulted in some boundaries being ruptured by up to 4 metres.

40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} cadastre is {{the goal}} of most countries today. Cadastral information is also a key layer in most multi-purpose geographic information systems (GIS), and these systems, in turn, are included within the broader Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). The utility of spatial data is greatly improved if it is accurate and consistent between layers, especially given the advent of inexpensive GPS devices. This paper introduces an approach to improve and maintain spatial accuracy of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary</b> geometry, and concurrently improve geometry of other layers constructed with reference to the <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> This approach has been used in Australia for several years, while the full integration with a commercial GIS is currently under development. In the described system, cadastral geometry provides a network of boundaries defined by their dimensions and connectivity, thus making use of pre-existing survey information. Least squares analysis is applied to the network using survey accuracy as a means to weight the network elements. As many cadastres have used a digitizing process to create their digital maps, the system is designed to begin with such data and incrementally improve accuracy as more survey information is added. Adjustments to the cadastral geometry create a field o...|$|R
40|$|Many {{developing}} countries {{have witnessed the}} urgent need of accelerating cadastral surveying processes. Previous studies found that large portions of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> coincide with visible physical objects, namely roads, fences, and building walls. This research explores the application of airborne laser scanning (ALS) techniques on cadastral surveys. A semi-automated workflow is developed to extract <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> from an ALS point clouds. Firstly, a two-phased workflow was developed that focused on extracting digital representations of physical objects. In the automated extraction phase, after classifying points into semantic components, the outline of planar objects such as building roofs and road surfaces were generated by an α-shape algorithm, whilst the centerlines delineatiation approach was fitted into the lineate object—a fence. Afterwards, the extracted vector lines were edited and refined during the post-refinement phase. Secondly, we quantitatively evaluated the workflow performance by comparing results against an exiting cadastral map as reference. It {{was found that the}} workflow achieved promising results: around 80 % completeness and 60 % correctness on average, although the spatial accuracy is still modest. It is argued that the semi-automated extraction workflow could effectively speed up cadastral surveying, with both human resources and equipment costs being reduce...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to propose a new {{redefinition}} of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> using GNSS equipment and cadastral maps. These maps are the ‘original' maps of the Italian Land Cadastre, the first cartographic support built directly from measures carried out by technicians during implantation of the Italian land cadastre. They are called ‘originali di impianto' - ‘originals of implantation' or ‘implant maps'. As such, these maps are valuable and are kept with great care. Recently, the Italian cadastre has carried out an accurate digitisation of these maps in a raster format at a high resolution. In this work, the authors propose {{the use of these}} digital maps for the recovery of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundary.</b> The original <b>cadastral</b> map, one of the primary sources relied upon in defining legal boundaries, generally uses the Bessel ellipsoid localised in Genova and the Cassini-Soldner projection; the GNSS equipment, on the other hand, uses the geocentric ellipsoid with global or continental realisations. After an RTK positioning, the receivers usually provide the cartographic coordinates in a Gauss projection. However, our study deals with the problem of using different projections and reference systems within the limits of a map. In this context, the transition between systems and projections can be made through a conformal transformation with deformations slighter than graphical errors in the map. The difficulty of finding identifiable points in both reference systems is partially solved through a new way of carrying out the redefinition of boundaries by exploiting geometric informatio...|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{analytical}} cadastre; photogrammetry; restoring land boundaries; GIS/LIS. The modern {{replacement for}} the traditional form of cadastral information is the cadastral database. The definition and compilation of an accurate cadastral is based on analytic reconstruction of <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries.</b> In the mid 1990 ’s, an analytical restoring process, which analytically imitates the traditional field-based process, was developed in Israel for urban areas, relying on precise field location of building corners.

The potential of high-resolution UAV imagery to create and update cadastral maps is being increasingly investigated. Existing procedures generally involve substantial fieldwork and many manual processes. Arguably, multiple parts of UAV-based cadastral mapping workflows could be automated. Specifically, as many <b>cadastral</b> <b>boundaries</b> coincide with visible boundaries, they could be extracted automatically using image analysis methods. This study investigates the transferability of gPb contour detection, a state-of-the-art computer vision method, to remotely sensed UAV images and UAV-based cadastral mapping. Results show that the approach is transferable to UAV data and automated cadastral mapping: object contours are comprehensively detected at completeness and correctness rates of up to 80 %. The detection quality is optimal when the entire scene is covered with one orthoimage, due to the global optimization of gPb contour detection. However, a balance between high completeness and correctness is hard to achieve, so a combination with area-based segmentation and further object knowledge is proposed.
