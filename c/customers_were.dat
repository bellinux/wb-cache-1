5|$|Customers' {{reactions}} to the merger varied. Most of the public understood {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both operating in a very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> upset because the last long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; they said they would never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Trondheim–Bodø {{service was}} again {{operated}} by Di 4 locomotive-hauled trains. This {{is the longest}} rail service in the country, and <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> dissatisfied with {{the comfort of the}} Class 93, despite the higher permitted speeds.|$|E
30|$|The fourth rule {{states that}} if “income” for a <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> between 42.937 and 49.5 {{and age of}} the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> above 55, then this <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> likely to be Attractive.|$|R
30|$|The fifth rule {{states that}} if “age” of the <b>{{customer}}</b> <b>is</b> greater than 62, “income” for a <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> less than 55 and customer has a diploma degree then this <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> {{likely to be}} Non-Churner.|$|R

5|$|In September 2012, zoo <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> herded indoors when a Heck bull {{escaped from}} its enclosure. The 600kg animal with three feet long horns was loose for over 40 minutes, until zoo workers and vets managed to {{restrain}} him by using tranquilliser darts.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 2009, at 4:27am, two trains {{collided}} at the West Falls Church train yard. One train {{pulled in}} and collided {{into the back}} of the other train. No <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> aboard, and only minor injuries to the operators and cleaning staff were reported. However, three cars (1106, 1171, and 3216) were believed to be damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln {{was seized by}} the FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> left with worthless bonds. Many investors, often ones living in California retirement communities, lost their life savings, and felt emotional damage for having been duped {{on top of their}} financial devastation. The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million. The federal government was eventually liable for $3.4 billion to cover Lincoln's losses when it seized the institution.|$|E

5|$|Export <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> {{sought after}} West Germany withdrew its {{objections}} to exporting the aircraft; Saudi Arabia {{was the only}} export customer of the Tornado. The agreement to purchase the Tornado {{was part of the}} controversial Al-Yamamah arms deal between BAE Systems and the Saudi government. Oman had committed to purchasing Tornados and the equipment to operate them for a total value of £250million in the late 1980s, but cancelled the order in 1990 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Hardware stores {{experienced}} great {{demand for}} portable generators, chain saws, dehumidifiers, and air movers following {{the passage of}} the hurricane. Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, attracting new <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> {{more expensive}} than retaining the existing customers. Therefore, companies should {{have a plan to}} retain their existing <b>customers.</b> <b>Customers,</b> who <b>are</b> placed in high attractive cell, are more important for the company. Retention of high attractive <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> significantly important.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit to}} the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> that if a worker takes longer than this, the cost does not rise.The {{downfall}} to the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> that {{this can lead to}} overpaying in some cases.|$|R
50|$|The {{interaction}} between service employees and <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> considered {{an essential part}} of both customers' assessments of service quality and their relationship with the service provider. Positive affective displays in service interactions are positively associated with important customer outcomes, such as intention to return and to recommend the store to a friend. It is the interest of organizations that their <b>customers</b> <b>be</b> happy, since a happy <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> a satisfied one. Research has shown that the emotional state of the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> directly influenced by the emotions displayed by the employee/service provider via emotional contagion. But, this influence is dependent on the degree of authenticity of the employee's emotional display, such that if the employee is only surface-acting, the contagion of the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> poor, in which case the beneficial effects stated above will not occur.|$|R
5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have to buy in France.|$|E
5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed {{these issues in}} two patches. The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD; <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> given the option of downloading the patch or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second patch on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second patch did not contain the first's fixes.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia moved {{extremely}} {{slowly in}} and around North Carolina, causing the storm to drop more than 10inches (254mm) of rain on many coastal areas. The highest amount measured was from Oak Island, where 17.5inches (445mm) was registered. In addition, storm surges of 7–12feet (2–4m) were recorded, particularly in low-lying inlets of Pamlico Sound. At the storm's peak, over 240,000 <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> without power in coastal North Carolina. One indirect fatality was reported due to a traffic accident related to Ophelia, although no direct deaths were recorded.|$|E

5000|$|In general, {{as in most}} countries, {{etiquette}} {{dictates that}} the <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> treated with reverence. In Japan this means that employees speak in a humble and deferential manner and use respectful forms of language that elevate the <b>customer.</b> Thus, <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> typically addressed with the title -sama (roughly equivalent to [...] "sir" [...] or [...] "madam" [...] in English). A <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> not expected to reciprocate this level of politeness to a server.|$|R
5|$|September 21, 2003— Hurricane Isabel {{affects the}} state with high winds and flooding. Damage in New York totals to $90million (2003USD, $98million 2006USD). In and around New York City, about 1.1million <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> left without power, though most outages were fixed by {{the day after the}} {{hurricane}} passed through the region. Offshore of Long Beach, rough waves killed a man while bodysurfing.|$|E
5|$|The first {{deliveries}} of the Chevrolet Volt in Europe {{took place}} on November 30, 2011, to the U.S. Embassy in France. Distribution of the Opel Ampera to dealerships began in December 2011, but deliveries to <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> delayed until February 2012 because Opel decided {{to wait until the}} NHTSA completed its investigation of the Volt's battery fire risk after a crash. Since May 2012 the Vauxhall Ampera is available through the Zipcar carsharing club in London, Bristol, Cambridge and Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Airline <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> {{uninterested in}} the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider {{fuselage}} cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, {{adding to the}} heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.|$|E

5000|$|Simply stated, {{these are}} the {{requirements}} that the <b>customers</b> expect and <b>are</b> taken for granted. When done well, <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> just neutral, but when done poorly, <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> very dissatisfied.

40|$|In {{the vehicle}} routing problem (VRP) the {{objective}} is to construct a minimum cost set of routes serving all customers where the demand of each <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> {{less than or equal to}} the vehicle capacity and where each <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> visited once. In the split delivery {{vehicle routing problem}} (SDVRP) the restriction that each <b>customer</b> <b>is</b> visited once is removed.

5|$|Braathens Helikopter A/S was a Norwegian {{helicopter}} airline {{based at}} Stavanger Airport, Sola, and Bergen Airport, Flesland. It used {{a fleet of}} seven Aérospatiale Super Pumas to serve offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. The <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> Phillips Petroleum, Norsk Hydro, Statoil, Amoco and British Petroleum, serving their oil fields Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks, Veslefrikk, Valhall, Ula and Gyda. Braathens Helikopter operated from 1989 to 1993, after which it was sold to and merged with the main competitor, Helikopter Service. Braathens Helikopter was owned by Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and was a sister company of the airline Braathens SAFE.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because <b>customers</b> <b>were</b> {{willing to pay more}} for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. <b>Customers</b> <b>were</b> given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E
30|$|The first factor, {{geographical}} {{spread of}} the <b>customers,</b> <b>is</b> statistically significant. For clustered customers, the total costs increase with 11 % on average when allowing customers to select a delivery time window. The percentage of total costs increase is calculated by dividing the additional costs of allowing customers to choose a delivery time window by the total costs of the basic scenario. For randomly spread customers, the total costs increase with 24 % on average. When <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> clustered the increase in costs is less than when <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> randomly spread because when <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> spread more randomly probably more distance is needed to travel to another customer with a close delivery time window.|$|R
30|$|To {{take into}} account {{practical}} aspects, buffers of finite size for both two classes of <b>customers</b> <b>are</b> assumed in this paper. Furthermore, a proposed queue includes a congestion control mechanism. Once the number of low-priority customers in the system reaches the first control threshold, the arrival rate of low-priority <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> reduced to a guarantee arrival rate. If the number of low-priority <b>customers</b> <b>is</b> above the second control threshold, each arriving batch of low-priority <b>customers</b> will <b>be</b> discarded with a certain probability. Therefore, the proposed queue {{can be used to}} model Differentiated Service Architecture [14] in IP networks.|$|R
