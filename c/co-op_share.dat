Nevertheless, not all students choose to participate in co-ops. Through empirical data collection undertaken at two universities, this article explores the reasons why some students did not participate in an optional co-op program and the perceptions students have about the co-op program. Because students’ backgrounds may play a role in their choice, demographic data were also considered. The 408 participants were in one of three groups: A) co-op participants, B) interested applicants and non-applicants, or C) those not interested and/or did not apply. Using Rational Choice Theory as an interpretive framework, a mixed methods approach including quantitative and qualitative analysis of surveys and interviews was used to compare and contrast experiences, approaches, motivations and attitudes across student groups in the United States and the United Kingdom. Results show that US and UK students who identified as not being interested in <b>co-op</b> <b>shared</b> similar perceptions, including the perceived cost of additional time to graduation. Students also expressed concern that taking time away from campus to complete a co-op would affect social interactions with their peers. The results of this work can be used to inform co-op program processes and policies, highlighting ways in which programs can increase participation. The study also shows how key stakeholders can learn cross-cultural ‘best practices’ to make co-op education accessible and effective...|$|R

Fourteen <b>co-op</b> residents <b>share</b> the house and everything in it, including cooking and labor responsibilities. A critical part of co-op ideology is the building of community. At Sassafras, food {{plays an important role}} in the creation of community through its designation as a vegetarian space,shared cooking and food purchasing, and a shared daily meal. Food is central to my project because it is the object which initially attracted me to Sassafras. I immediately identified with Sassafras' foodways, and this has evoked memories and previous knowledges that are a source of pleasure but that also mediate my experience and analyses. Looking at food provides a window through which one can identify how the connections between individual members' sense of ???being in the world??? and Sassafras ideology are lived out in daily life at the co-op. Egalitarianism, re-use of resources, vegetarianism, conservation, anti-capitalism, and a general rebuilding of community all play into what I call Sassafras ideology. Broadly speaking, this project speaks to the ways in which individuals come together to consciously negotiate their understandings of the complex processes of the world. unpublishe...|$|R
40|$|Each year, {{students}} who are newly enrolled in the University of Ottawa Cooperative Education Programs prepare for their first co-op work terms. In this period of pre-employment, students ask themselves important questions like, “What do I {{have to do to}} get a job?” and “What do I want to be?” As a co-op practitioner I am exposed to students’ experiences and the dilemmas they face but I still wondered what was hidden from my view and outside of my understanding. Thus, during one-on-one interviews that occurred prior to their first co-op work terms, six <b>co-op</b> students <b>shared</b> the photographs and stories of their co-op experiences with me and I shared my photographs and stories with them. Goffman’s (1959) theory of dramaturgy provided the theoretical framework to present, interpret, and understand the words and pictures that emerged from these interviews. What resulted were dramas, narratives, and allegories: six participant descriptions written as mini-biographies, verbatim transcripts prepared as a reader’s theatre script, and a set of five themes composed with vivid symbolism. The five metaphoric themes of co-op student experience are (a) journey, (b) circus, (c) metamorphosing, (d) anglers at sea, and (e) warriors. Taken together, what emerged was a deeper seeing and a richer understanding of what’s “really going on” in the time prior to students’ first co-op work terms (Goffman, 1974, p. 8) particularly with regards to legitimate peripheral participation, reflection, and experiential learning...|$|R
40|$|The current {{landscape}} of audience fragmentation, Internet advertising, and required accountability for advertising expenditures is exerting great {{pressure on the}} ability of main-stream, ad-supported media to survive. How can established media such as printed magazines, newspapers, and printed inserts survive? We start our examination of the topic by reviewing the media usage patterns of U. S. adults and advertising expenditure data from 2004. The average American adult over the age of 18 consumed a total of 9 hours, 35 minutes of media per day (Lindsay, 2006) : 44. 5 % of media time was spent with TV; 27. 8 % with radio; 5 % each with Internet, newspaper and recorded music; and 6 % with magazines and books combined. The amount of advertising dollars spent on newspapers, consumer magazines, and business papers ads (including business magazines) accounts for approximately 40 % of all media advertising expenditures in 2004 (Veronis Suhler Stevenson, 2004). Broadcast and cable TV and radio represent an additional 44 % of the media advertising dollars spent. Although the Internet advertising category (including search and display advertising) was significantly smaller, it grew at a faster rate than all other media. The desire for advertising accountability starts with this question: Does advertising affect consumer buying behavior? The impact of advertising has been measured on a variety of outcome measures such as aggregate sales for a brand, individual brand choice behavior, and the intermediate effects of awareness, beliefs and attitudes towards the advertised brand. The relatively few research studies that have examined the impact of advertising in different media show that print advertising performs well compared with other media. For example: * In a study of the top 100 advertisers, higher correlations were found between a firm’s sales and the amount of print advertising it bought vs. sales and the amount it spent on broadcast advertising. * Magazine advertising was more effective than network TV advertising for promoting SUV brands over a 10 -year period. * People who were exposed to printed newspaper advertising had a higher recognition of ad content than those who received an online version of the same advertising message. * For a food franchiser, the best sales resulted from advertising media spent concurrently on primary direct mail and national TV advertising. * In a Doubleclick study, the most influential sources of information affecting purchase decisions, overall, were word-of-mouth and salesperson sources. For individual product categories, printed advertising was the most influential source of information for consumers who purchased personal care / home care products, and the second most influential source for those purchasing consumer electronics and home improvement products. * In a study of newspaper readers, 78 % reported that they used newspaper inserts to plan shopping, and 76 % said that inserts helped them save money. * Dimensional mail yielded a 5. 4 % lead generation rate (vs. email at 3. 27 %), and <b>co-op</b> <b>shared</b> mail produced a 5. 47 % direct order rate vs. 4. 16 % for Internet banner ads. While these research studies show the effectiveness of printed advertising, more robust methodologies must be developed in this new era of accountability. Two new audience response metrics are discussed that may deliver on this promise: single source databases and experimental designs. Single source databases such as the Apollo Project provide precise data to advertisers about the impact of exposure to a variety of advertising media on a participant’s response of buying certain products and brands. An example of an experimental design methodology is presented in the book “What Sticks” by Briggs and Stuart (2006). The process begins with the specification of communication objectives at the outset of a campaign to define the use of appropriate metrics. The media mix optimization can be assessed when the outcome data (e. g., change in awareness) are gauged against the cost per response (CPR) for each ad medium. The Briggs and Stuart method may be a good model for all print media owners, publishers, and print services providers who need to prove, with every campaign, that print advertising delivers an acceptable return on the advertiser’s investment...|$|R
40|$|This book {{is about}} the history of the Brussels {{shopping}} landscape during the nineteenth century. Although the increasing commercialization of the nineteenth-century urban landscape has long been a topos in historiography, the entirety and diversity of shopping spaces has not yet been the object of thorough research. For decades, historians of retail and shopping have mostly been concerned with rsquo; forms of retail, such as the cooperation, the multiple and – especially – the department store, which, so it was argued, gave rise to the birth of a modern culture of leisurely shopping. These institutes were most often studied in isolation, rather than in relation to each other and to the broader context of less spectacular shopping spaces. When more recent research turned the focus to the resilience of more ‘traditional’ retail forms – such as the market, ambulant trade and the small shop – scholars have been especially interested in the conflict between tradition and modernity. Again, only rarely did historians include more than two commercial circuits into their scope. Although historians have tended to single out specific shopping sites, this isolation was nevertheless not a characteristic of historic reality. Markets, market halls, shops, department stores, arcades, auction houses, bazaars, branches of multiples and <b>co-ops</b> <b>shared</b> customers, streets and pavements with each other. Therefore, this book takes the shopping landscape as its object of study, with Brussels as its case-study. The history of shopping and shopping culture in the nineteenth-century city is re-evaluated from a spatial perspective. This reevaluation aims to engage with findings in research on early-modern retailing and shopping. Whereas historians studying the nineteenth century have long claimed the century’s modernity, scholars studying the early-modern period have demonstrated that many so-called rsquo; shopping- and business practices dated from before the nineteenth century and its department stores. Turning away from the traditional quest for modernity, this study searches for elements of continuity and discontinuity in both the shopping landscape and the culture of shopping that was engrained in it throughout the nineteenth century. It demonstrates the necessity of understanding the variety of shopping places in relation to one another, and the added value of tracing evolutions in shopping by examining the shopping scene as a whole. This dissertation scrutinizes the development of the shopping landscape in nineteenth-century Brussels. It examines the different types of sites for shopping and their relation to each other and the evolving shopping culture throughout the century. The central question of this research centers on how these developments translated qualitatively in a shopping culture. In this dissertation it is argued that the heart of the Brussels shopping landscape densified intensively throughout the nineteenth century. Never were there more shops in the center of Brussels than during the beginning of the twentieth century. Rather than revolutionary new types of shopping sites, the century of ‘modernity’ brought Brussels a growing variety in the number of sites for shopping. Shopping in these sites increasingly and pre-eminently became an activity for pedestrians. Shopping and strolling in the city center molded into one activity. Window-shopping turned into an independent and indispensable part of rsquo;. Shopkeepers capitalized upon that fact by increasing the size of shop windows and creating spectacular designs and displays. The surroundings of the street too were increasingly fitted out to facilitate the practice of shopping for leisure. Sidewalks were constructed and possible obstructions were banned from the streets, including rsquo; commercial practices, such as street markets, displays of itinerant traders and so on. As such, the development of the shopping landscape was reflective of the ambitions of the bourgeois liberal city council for a ‘modern city’, and it added to the realization of these ambitions as well. The evolutions in shopping were indeed strongly intertwined with the council’s projects of beautification, sanitization and rationalization, while equally demonstrating the limitations of the council’s policy. This book demonstrates that shopping cultures (and –subcultures) were linked to the type of goods on sale and the locations in the city rather than to the type of retail oulet. The growing array of ‘sites for shopping’ contributed to the evolution in the Brussels shopping culture. Although no traces could be found of a retail or shopping revolution, the practices and contours of shopping in Brussels did evolve as the nineteenth century progressed. This book demonstrates that the development of the shopping landscape and its culture presented a complex process that ran back and forth, now coincidentally and then in a more orchestrated manner past the newer and older places of the nineteenth century. The eye-catching institutions – including arcades, market halls, auction houses and department stores – took on the role of a catalyst agent in a dynamic shopping landscape. These new sites for shopping and the broader shopping landscape they were engrained in were characterized by a search for splendor – even if that search did not always lead to the desired results. nbsp; This {{book is about}} the history of the Brussels shopping landscape during the nineteenth century.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that by 2030 {{the number of people who}} are wealthy enough to be considered as middle class consumers will have tripled. This will have a dramatic impact on the demands for primary materials and energy. Much work has been carried out on sustainable ways of meeting the World’s energy demands and some work has been carried out on the sustainable production and consumption of goods. It {{has been estimated}} that with improvements in design and manufacturing it is possible to reduce the primary material requirements by 30 % to produce the current demand for goods. Whilst this is a crucial step on the production side, there will still be a doubling of primary material requirements by the end of the century because of an absolute rise in demand for goods and services. It is therefore clear that the consumption of products must also be explored. This is a key areas of research for the UK INDEMAND centre, which is investigating ways of reducing the UK’s industrial energy demand and demand for energy intensive materials. Our ongoing work shows that two strategies would result in considerable reductions in the demand for primary materials: product longevity and using goods more intensively (which may requires increased durability). Product longevity and durability are not new ideas, but ones that can be applied across a raft of goods as methods of reducing the consumption of materials. With long life products there is a potential risk of outdated design and obsolescence, consequently there is a need to ensure upgradability and adaptability are incorporated at the design stage. If products last longer, then the production of new products can be diverted to emerging markets rather than the market for replacement goods. There are many goods which are only used occasionally, these goods do not normally wear out. The total demand for such could be drastically reduced if they were shared with other people. Sharing of goods has traditionally been conducted between friends or by hiring equipment. The use of modern communication systems and social media could enable the development of <b>sharing</b> <b>co-ops</b> and swap spaces that will increase the utilisation of goods and hence reduce the demand for new goods. This could also increase access to a range of goods for those on low incomes. From a series of workshops it has been found that the principal challenges are sociological rather than technological. This paper contains a discussion of these challenges and explores possible futures where these two strategies have been adopted. In addition, the barriers and opportunities that these strategies offer for consumers and businesses are identified, and areas where government policy could be instigated to bring about change are highlighted...|$|R
