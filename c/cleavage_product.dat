2500|$|DNA glycosylases are {{responsible}} for initial recognition of the lesion. [...] They flip the damaged base out of the double helix, as pictured, and cleave the N-glycosidic bond of the damaged base, leaving an AP site. [...] There are two categories of glycosylases: monofunctional and bifunctional. [...] Monofunctional glycosylases have only glycosylase activity, whereas bifunctional glycosylases also possess AP lyase activity. [...] Therefore, bifunctional glycosylases can convert a base lesion into a single-strand break {{without the need for}} an AP endonuclease. [...] β-Elimination of an AP site by a glycosylase-lyase yields a 3' α,β-unsaturated aldehyde adjacent to a 5' phosphate, which differs from the AP endonuclease <b>cleavage</b> <b>product.</b> [...] Some glycosylase-lyases can further perform δ-elimination, which converts the 3' aldehyde to a 3' phosphate. [...] A wide variety of glycosylases have evolved to recognize different damaged bases. [...] Examples of DNA glycosylases include Ogg1, which recognizes 8-oxoguanine, Mag1, which recognizes 3-methyladenine, and UNG, which removes uracil from DNA.|$|E

40|$|The {{damage to}} DNA by the hepatocarcinogen {{aflatoxin}} B 1 was investigated. A DNA fragment of known {{sequence of the}} lactose promoter-operator region {{was used as a}} substrate for modification by aflatoxin B 1. The DNA was incubated with aflatoxin B 1 in crude mammalian liver extracts or with purified microsomes. Treatment of the DNA incubated in the complete system with either 1 M piperidine or 0. 1 M NaOH at 90 degrees revealed alkali-labile lesions in the DNA. The exact location of the cleavage site was determined by comparison of the length of the <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> with the known sequence on polyacrylamide gels. The lengths of the <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> were the same as those produced by alkali-induced breakage of the same sequence of DNA that had been modified with dimethyl sulfate. The major <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> of the aflatoxin B 1 -modified DNA were at positions of guanine and the minor <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> were at positions of adenine.

40|$|The α-, β-, and γ-protocadherins (Pcdhα, Pcdhβ, and Pcdhγ) {{comprise}} {{a large family}} of single-pass transmembrane proteins predominantly expressed in the nervous system. These proteins contain six cadherin-like extracellular domains, and proteolysis of Pcdhα and Pcdhγ by the γ-secretase complex releases their intracellular domains into the cytoplasm where they may function locally and/or enter the nucleus and affect gene expression. Thus, cleavage of Pcdhs may function to link intercellular contacts and intracellular signaling. Here we report that shedding of the Pcdhα extracellular domain and subsequent processing by γ-secretase require endocytosis and that Pcdhs interact with the regulator of vesicular sorting ESCRT- 0 in undifferentiated cells. We also find that the accumulation of Pcdh <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> is regulated during development. Differentiation leads {{to an increase in}} the interactions between Pcdh proteins and a decrease in the accumulation of <b>cleavage</b> <b>products.</b> We conclude that Pcdh processing requires endocytosis and that the level of <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> is regulated during neuronal differentiation...|$|R

Therefore, possible regulatory mechanisms in vascular biology controlled by different <b>cleavage</b> <b>products</b> of basement membrane proteins (e. g. endostatin and tumstatin, endorepellin), their activation by proteases and inhibitors, such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), cathepsins, tissue inhibitors of MMPs and cystatin, will be reviewed.

We will therefore discuss physical exercise and its effects on the mentioned molecules regarding angiogenic inductions.
