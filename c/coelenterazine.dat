5|$|In some species, the {{luciferase}} requires other cofactors such as calcium or magnesium ions, {{and sometimes}} also the energy-carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In evolution, luciferins vary little: one in particular, <b>coelenterazine,</b> {{is found in}} eleven different animal (phyla), though in some of these, the animals obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferases vary widely between different species, and consequently bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E
500|$|E. N. Harvey (1932) {{was among}} the first to propose how {{bioluminescence}} could have evolved. In this early paper, he suggested that proto-bioluminescence could have arisen from respiratory chain proteins that hold fluorescent groups. This hypothesis has since been disproven, but it did lead to considerable interest in the origins of the phenomenon. Today, the two prevailing hypotheses (both concerning marine bioluminescence) are the ones put forth by Seliger (1993) and Rees et al. (1998). Seliger's theory identifies luciferase enzymes as the catalyst for the evolution of bioluminescent systems. It suggests that the original purpose of luciferases was as mixed-function oxygenases. As the early ancestors of many species moved into deeper and darker waters natural selection applied forces that favored the development of increased eye sensitivity and enhanced visual signals. If selection were to favor a mutation in the oxygenase enzyme required for the breakdown of pigment molecules (molecules often associated with spots used to attract a mate or distract a predator) it could have eventually resulted in external luminescence in tissues. Rees et al. (1998) uses evidence gathered from the marine luciferin <b>coelenterazine</b> to suggest that selection acting on luciferins may have arisen from pressures to protect oceanic organisms from potentially deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. H2O2 and O2âˆ’ [...] ). The functional shift from antioxidation to bioluminescence probably occurred when the strength of selection for antioxidation defense decreased as early species moved further down the water column. At greater depths exposure to ROS is significantly lower, as is the endogenous production of ROS through metabolism. Seliger's theory, while popular at first, has been challenged particularly by the biochemical and genetic evidence that Rees examines. What remains clear, however, is that bioluminescence has evolved independently at least 40 times. Bioluminescence in fish began at least by the Cretaceous period. About 1,500 fish species are known to be bioluminescent; the capability evolved independently at least 27 times. Of these 27 occasions, 17 involved the taking up of bioluminous bacteria from the surrounding water while in the others, the intrinsic light evolved through chemical synthesis. These fish have become surprisingly diverse in the deep ocean and control their light with the help of their nervous system, using it not just to lure prey or hide from predators, but also for communication.|$|E

50|$|Halocypridae is {{a family}} of ostracods in the {{suborder}} Halocypridina. This family contains bioluminescent members such as Conchoecia pseudodiscophora, which are believed to use <b>coelenterazine</b> and a <b>coelenterazine</b> luciferase rather than vargulin.|$|E
50|$|Renilla {{luciferase}} (from the Sea pansy) requires its substrate, <b>coelenterazine,</b> to be injected as well. As {{opposed to}} luciferin, <b>coelenterazine</b> {{has a lower}} bioavailability (likely due to MDR1 transporting it out of mammalian cells).

50|$|Aequorin is also {{a useful}} tool to {{indicate}} calcium level inside cells; however, it has some limitations, primarily is that its prosthetic group <b>coelenterazine</b> is consumed irreversibly when emits light, thus requires continuous addition of <b>coelenterazine</b> into the media.

50|$|Aequorin is a holoprotein {{composed}} of two distinct units, the apoprotein that is called apoaequorin, which has an approximate molecular weight of 21 kDa, and the prosthetic group <b>coelenterazine,</b> the luciferin. This is to say, apoaequorin is the enzyme produced in the photocytes of the animal, and <b>coelenterazine</b> is the substrate whose oxidation the enzyme catalyzes. When <b>coelenterazine</b> is bound, it is called aequorin. Notably, the protein contains three EF hand motifs that function as binding sites for Ca2+ ions. The protein {{is a member of}} the superfamily of the calcium-binding proteins of which there are some 66 subfamilies.|$|E

50|$|In the membrane-bound {{intracellular}} structure containing RLuc, the apoenzyme RrLBP, and {{the green}} fluorescent protein RrGFP, a Ca2+ ion first interacts with RrLBP, causing it to release its cofactor <b>coelenterazine.</b> <b>Coelenterazine</b> is then catalyzed by RLuc into coelenteramide, releasing a single photon of blue light (480 nm) in the process. This photon is captured by the adjacent (RrGFP), releasing a photon of green light. This pathway is summarized below.|$|E

50|$|Aequorin has {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over other Ca2+ indicators: because the protein is large, it has a low leakage rate from cells compared to lipophilic dyes such as DiI. It lacks phenomena of intracellular compartmentalization or sequestration as is often seen for Voltage-sensitive dyes, and does not disrupt cell functions or embryo development. Moreover, the light emitted by the oxidation of <b>coelenterazine</b> does not depend on any optical excitation, so problems with auto-fluorescence are eliminated. The primary limitation of aequorin is that the prosthetic group <b>coelenterazine</b> is irreversibly consumed to produce light, and requires continuous addition of <b>coelenterazine</b> into the media. Such issues led to developments of other genetically encoded calcium sensors including the calmodulin-based sensor cameleon, developed by Roger Tsien and the troponin-based sensor, TN-XXL, developed by Oliver Griesbeck.|$|E

50|$|Cultured cells {{expressing the}} aequorin gene can {{effectively}} synthesize apoaequorin: however, recombinant expression yields only the apoprotein, {{therefore it is}} necessary to add <b>coelenterazine</b> into the culture medium of the cells to obtain a functional protein and thus use its blue light emission to measure Ca2+ concentration. <b>Coelenterazine</b> is a hydrophobic molecule, and therefore is easily taken up across plant and fungal cell walls, as well as the plasma membrane of higher eukaryotes, making aequorin suitable as a (Ca2+ reporter) in plants, fungi, and mammalian cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coelenterazine</b> was {{simultaneously}} {{isolated and}} characterized by two groups studying the luminescent organisms sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) and the coelenterate Aequorea victoria, respectively. Both groups unknowingly {{discovered that the}} same compound was used in both luminescent systems, however {{the name of the}} molecule was given after the coelenterate. Likewise, the two main metabolites - coelenteramide and coelenteramine - were named after their respective functional groups. Despite being first discovered in Aequorea victoria, it was later shown that they do not synthesize <b>coelenterazine,</b> rather they obtain it through their diet, largely from crustaceans and copepods.|$|E
50|$|It is {{reported}} in literature {{that during the}} synthesis of a <b>Coelenterazine</b> derivative, a non-radical hydrogen abstraction was observed on a substituted aminoimidazole in a typical Sandmayer hyroxilation condition.|$|E
50|$|Vargulin {{is found}} in certain ostracods and deep-sea fish, to be specific, Poricthys. Like the {{compound}} <b>coelenterazine,</b> it is an imidazopyrazinone and emits primarily blue light in the animals.|$|E
50|$|Early {{studies of}} the {{bioluminescence}} of Aequorea by E. Newton Harvey had noted that the bioluminescence appears as a ring around the bell, and occurs {{even in the absence}} of air. This was remarkable because most bioluminescence reactions appeared to require oxygen, and led to the idea that the animals somehow store oxygen. It was later discovered that the apoprotein can stably bind <b>coelenterazine</b> and oxygen is required for the regeneration to the active form of aequorin. However, in the presence of calcium ions, the protein undergoes a conformational change and through oxidation converts its prosthetic group, <b>coelenterazine,</b> into excited coelenteramide and CO2. As the excited coelenteramide relaxes to the ground state, blue light (wavelength of 465 nm) is emitted. Before coelenteramide is exchanged out, the entire protein is still fluorescent blue. Because of the connection between bioluminescence and fluorescence, this property was ultimately important in the discovery of the luciferin <b>coelenterazine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Coelenterazine</b> {{is found}} in radiolarians, ctenophores, cnidarians, squid, brittle stars, copepods, chaetognaths, fish, and shrimp. It is the {{prosthetic}} group in the protein aequorin responsible for the blue light emission.|$|E
50|$|Coelenteramine is a {{metabolic}} {{product of}} the bioluminescent reactions in organisms that utilize <b>coelenterazine.</b> It was first isolated from Aequorea victoria along with coelenteramide after coelenterates were stimulated to emit light.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coelenterazine</b> is the luciferin, the {{light-emitting}} molecule, {{found in}} many aquatic organisms across seven phyla. It is the substrate of many luciferases such as Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc), Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), and photoproteins, including aequorin, and obelin.|$|E
50|$|Vargulin is {{oxidized}} by the Vargula luciferase, a 62kDa enzyme, {{to produce}} blue light at 462 nm (max emission, detected with a 425 to 525 nm filter). The vargulin does not cross react with luciferases using <b>Coelenterazine</b> or Firefly luciferin.|$|E
50|$|Coelenteramide is the {{oxidized}} product, or oxyluciferin, of the bioluminescent {{reactions in}} many marine organisms that use <b>coelenterazine.</b> It was first isolated as a blue fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria after {{the animals were}} stimulated to emit light. Under basic conditions, the compound will break down further into coelenteramine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Coelenterazine</b> can be {{crystallized}} into orange-yellow crystals. The molecule absorbs {{light in}} the ultraviolet and visible spectrum, with peak absorption at 435 nm in methanol, giving the molecule a yellow color. The molecule spontaneously oxidizes in aerobic conditions or in some organic solvents such as dimethylformamide and DMSO and is preferentially stored in methanol or with an inert gas.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{arrangement}} is {{one or two}} rows of photophores on the ventral aspect of the body. The rows run from the head down {{to the tip of}} the tail. Photophores are also present in chin barbels of the family Stomiidae. The light produced in these glandular organs is the product of an enzymatic reaction, a catylization of <b>coelenterazine</b> by calcium ions.|$|E

50|$|The crystal {{structure}} revealed that aequorin binds <b>coelenterazine</b> and {{oxygen in the}} form of a peroxide, coelenterazine-2-hydroperoxide. The binding site for the first two calcium atoms show a 20X greater affinity for calcium than the third site. However, earlier claims that only two EF-hands bind calcium, were questioned when later structures indicated that all three site indeed can bind calcium. Thus, titration studies show that all three calcium-binding sites are active but only two ions are needed to trigger the enzymatic reaction.|$|E
50|$|The RLuc {{mediated}} {{chemical reaction}} involves the catalytic degradation of <b>coelenterazine,</b> and proceeds through a 1,2-dioxetane (also called dioxetanone or cyclic peroxide) intermediate. Based on studies using radioactively labelled oxygen species within the RLuc complex, {{it has been}} determined that the luciferin carbonyl oxygen is exchanged rapidly with oxygen from water prior to incorporation of an oxygen atom from O2 via a dioxetane intermediate. The resultant CO2 also rapidly exchanges its oxygens with those from the surrounding water. The general mechanism is depicted below.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Shimomura and Johnson {{isolated}} the protein aequorin, and its small molecule cofactor, <b>coelenterazine,</b> from {{large numbers of}} Aequorea jellyfish at Friday Harbor Laboratories. They discovered, after initially finding bright luminescence on adding seawater to a purified sample, that calcium ions (Ca2+) were required to trigger bioluminescence. This research also {{marked the beginning of}} research into green fluorescent protein which was summarized by Shimomura. In 1967, Ridgeway and Ashley microinjected aequorin into single muscle fibers of barnacles, and observed transient calcium ion-dependent signals during muscle contraction.|$|E
50|$|Aequorin is a calcium binding protein (CaBP) {{isolated}} from the coelenterate Aequorea victoria. Aequorin belongs to the EF-hand family of CaBPs, with EF-hand loops that {{are closely related to}} CaBPs in mammals. In addition, aequorin has been used for years as an indicator of Ca2+ and {{has been shown to be}} safe and well tolerated by cells. Aequorin is made up of two components - the calcium binding component apoaequorin (AQ) and the chemiluminescent molecule <b>coelenterazine.</b> The AQ portion of this protein contains the EF-hand calcium binding domains.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are the luciferin, <b>Coelenterazine</b> and O2, whereas its 3 {{products are}} the oxyluciferin, Coelenteramide, CO2, and light.This enzyme {{belongs to the}} family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O with incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases o internal mixed-function oxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is Oplophorus-luciferin:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). This enzyme is also called Oplophorus luciferase.|$|E
