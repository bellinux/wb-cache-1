5|$|During the 19th century, a {{significant}} part of the world's production of cobalt blue (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and smalt (cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket. The first mines for the production of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of <b>cobalt</b> <b>ore</b> in New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the Katanga Province in the Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again. When the Shaba conflict started in 1978, the copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production. The impact on the world cobalt economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic, and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases, industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.|$|E

Moreover, the blue substrate glaze was revealed to be an alkali glaze coloured by cobalt. Further, the colouring agent of the blue glaze was probably supplied from the Qamsar <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores.</b> These <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores,</b> which were either cobaltite or erythrite, are probably fused with borax {{to be used in}} the composition of the blue glaze. Moreover, the white glaze showed to be a lead-alkali glaze opacified with tin oxide with a relatively high ratio of Pb/Sn which is unusual in the context of Persian glaze technology.|$|R

50|$|The mining {{activities}} in Cobalt {{have left a}} significant environmental legacy. Millions of tons of mine waste rock and mill tailings were dumped on the land and in local lakes.

5000|$|From the 13th {{century and}} {{possibly}} considerably earlier, cobalt was mined near Qamsar.

[...] In 1301 Abū'l-Qāsim, who came from a family of tilemakers based in Kashan, wrote a treatise on the manufacture of fritware ceramics in which he mentions the village as a source of <b>cobalt</b> <b>ore.</b> Albert Houtum-Schindler visited the village {{at the end of the}} 19th century when Qamsar was [...] "a large and flourishing village of about three hundred houses with extensive gardens with fine roses used for the manufacture of rosewater."

30|$|As {{far as the}} {{chemical}} composition of the blue glaze is concerned, it was an alkali glaze in which cobalt had yielded a dark blue colour (Table  1). On the other hand, 4.29  wt% and 0.37  wt% of potassium and magnesium respectively showed {{that the source of}} alkali in the blue glaze was most probably plant ash. Plant ash has been reported to be the most common fluxing agent used in Persian archaeological vitreous materials [12, 13]. More interestingly, {{the chemical}} composition of the blue glaze was interestingly associated with arsenic (Table  1). As it is generally well-known, the <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores</b> of Qamsar, near Kashsn in central Iran, have always been noted to be the source of supplying cobalt for achieving deep blue colours in glassy materials. These ores have been reported to be cobaltite (CoAsS) and erythrite (Co 3 (AsO 4) 2 · 8 H 2 O), which are As-bearing <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores</b> [7, 14]. Thus, the detected arsenic in the composition of the blue glaze can be derived from these sources showing a Persian provenance for the blue colouring agent of the glaze. On the other hand, the absence of bismuth in the composition of the blue glaze can be considered as another evidence of the local provenance as bismuth is reported {{to be associated with the}} blue Co-bearing pigments found in Europe and India [15].|$|R

5|$|Several methods {{exist for}} the {{separation}} of cobalt from copper and nickel. They depend on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used ore. One separation step involves froth flotation, in which surfactants bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores.</b> Subsequent roasting converts the <b>ores</b> to the <b>cobalt</b> sulfate, whereas the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. Leaching with water extracts the sulfate together with the arsenates. The residues are further leached with sulfuric acid, yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the slag of copper smelting.|$|R
50|$|Even <b>cobalt</b> <b>ore</b> was a raw {{material}} for a new branch of industry. Peter Weidkammer, a man from Franconia, succeeded in 1520 in making a dye out of it. However, {{it was only after}} about 100 years that the Saxon Elector Johann Georg I allowed the founding of several “dyemills”. Erasmus Schindler secured approval in 1649 to build one of the five great dyeworks in the Ore Mountains.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} the 17th century the Knochen was opened up by {{numerous}} pits. Among the most important mines were the Gottes Seegen, St. Paulus and Drei Brüder pits, {{as well as the}} Allerheiligen-Fundgrube, from which silver, bismuth and <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores</b> were extracted in 1713. Besides the mines, {{in the middle of the}} 18th century a vitriol and sulphur works was established. From 1818 it also extracted arsenic using 5 furnaces, which was sold to paint factories in Hamburg, France and Austria. After the Allerheiligen works in Raschau was closed in the face of state competition from Freiberg in 1871, it was re-opened at Beierfeld in 1876.|$|R
40|$|The German word 'Kobold' is {{the term}} for gnomes and goblins. It {{appeared}} {{for the first time}} in connection with minerals in Agricola's Bermannus (1530). The first practical use was in the form of zaffer or cobalt-blue. Zaffer will not melt alone, but accompanied by vitreous substances it melts into an azure colour and so used as 'Smalte' for glazed earthenware, for glass and china. Since 1470 the Saxony ore mountains, especially the Schneeberg district, was the most important supplier of <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores.</b> Main products of the 'Blaufarbenwerke' were zaffers (Safflor) cobaltoxides of different colours and smalte (Smalte) a mixture of cobaltoxides with quartz. The Electoral-Saxon blue colour was greatly appreciated. The Dutch managed in their country eight colour-mills and received the <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores</b> from Schneeberg; perhaps in the beginning of the 17 th century no mills existed in Saxony. The first mill in Saxony was in 1635 in Pfannenstiel (Schneeberg district). The cobalt-resources were so profitable that the Elector of Saxony privileged the trade and imposed taxes. Private export was strongly prohibited. Cobalt-thiefs were hanged from the gallows. In 1654, 34 mines produced 264. 6 t cobalt-ore with a value of 20, 513 Dutch florins. Holland was the greatest trade partner. In the last years of the 18 th century, the colour-industry in Saxony and Holland received from the districts of Annaberg and Schneeberg 300 - 400 tons cobalt-colour per year. Since the middle of the 19 th century Saxony imported cobalt-ores from Norway, Italy and Hungary...|$|R
30|$|Another {{interesting}} {{point in the}} quantitative EPMA data is that the actual total of the quantified elements of the blue glaze does not sum up to 100  wt% and is significantly low (86.26  wt%) (Table  1). This {{could be related to}} the manufacturing process of the blue glaze. According to the descriptions provided by Rochechouart [16], Ali Mohamed [11], Olmer [17] and Schindler [18], 19 th century Persian glaze-makers used to make a concentrated Co-bearing pigment from the <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores</b> of Qamsar by mixing and smelting the <b>cobalt</b> <b>ores</b> and borax. A tiny amount of this concentrated pigment was then added to an alkali frit to achieve a deep blue colour. Moreover, the analytical data provided on the raw materials used by Ali Mohamed (preserved at the Edinburg Museum of Science) confirm the presence of borax in the composition of Persian blue glazes in the 19 th century [18]. However, as boron cannot be measured with EPMA due to its low atomic weight, this can provide an explanation for the loss of total amount of composing elements of the blue glaze. However, this hypothesis needs to be proved with more relevant analytical approaches. Due {{to the fact that the}} blue glaze was diffused in the white glaze and its thickness was very small (Figure  2 b), it was not practically possible to remove any sample from the blue glaze without contaminating the sample with the white substrate glaze. Thus, the most appropriate technique, which could quantitatively measure boron from one hand and, on the other hand, did not require removing the blue glaze, was laser ablation-induced coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), which we did not have access to.|$|R
