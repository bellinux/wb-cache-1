50|$|The Security Council passed another {{resolution}} on 30 July 2003, {{on the recommendation}} of Secretary-General Kofi Annan, authorizing for a <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> <b>component</b> of 20 officers be added to UNOMIG, in order to strengthen its capacity to carry out its mandate and assist in the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.|$|E
50|$|The {{resolution}} {{approved the}} Secretary-General's revised {{concept of operations}} for MONUC, which included {{the creation of a}} <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> <b>component.</b> It noted the need to improve the public information capacity through the establishment of United Nations radio stations. Finally, the parties were called upon to co-operate fully with the UNMOC mission and ensure the safety of United Nations personnel.|$|E
5000|$|The 1st Brigade of {{the same}} [...] "Divisione Unità Mobili Carabinieri", {{organized}} on 11 Mobile battalions and 1 Cavalry Regiment, does contribute to form the same Military <b>Police</b> <b>components</b> as the 1st Brigade, but is mostly tasked to riot control <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> duties. It is worth to note that inside each of its battalions there is usually a small Mechanized company, so in case of war {{they are likely to}} be mobilized for combat duties (as happened during both World Wars).|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of a multidimensional African Standby Force (ASF) and the African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises (ACIRC) is uncertain. This is despite {{the existence of}} a policy framework initiating the ASF and regional mechanisms (RMs). The policy was adopted and adapted to assume a multidimensional configuration, in May 2003 and in 2004 respectively. More than ten years after its establishment, there exist an unconcluded debate on whether the ASF and the regional mechanisms have achieved the multidimensional status-military, <b>civilians</b> and <b>police</b> <b>components.</b> It is in this sense that reference to civil-military relations (CMRs) has become almost a cliché of debates in the African Union’s (AU) peacekeeping space. Indeed, the sour relationship between the military and civilians {{has been described as a}} ‘hindrance’ to the attainment of full operation capability by ASF structures earmarked for 2015. Whilst, the realities of conflict in most parts of Africa is that militants have changed tact, rendering pure military operation ineffective, the most effective response is for peace support operation (PSO) actors to develop balanced structures to respond to these multifaceted peace and security threats facing the continent. In this article, the significance of both structural and institutional constraints are considered. The conclusion points to the need to adapt the ASF structures to the African PSO realities, but more critically, improve its configuration and design in the light of the lessons learnt since its establishment more than a decade ago...|$|R
50|$|The {{most senior}} {{officers}} {{of all the}} <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> forces also form part of the Police Service, which is {{a component of the}} civil service of Pakistan. Namely, there are four provincial police service including the Punjab Police, Sindh Police, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police, and the Balochistan Police; all headed by the appointed senior Inspector-Generals. The ICT has its own <b>police</b> <b>component,</b> the Capital <b>Police,</b> to maintain law and order in the capital. The CID bureaus are the crime investigation unit and forms a vital part in each provincial police service.|$|R
50|$|At many installations, Department of Army <b>Civilian</b> <b>Police</b> {{officers}} augment {{military police}} personnel. Some smaller installations have only <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> present. The officer {{can expect to}} perform a variety of law enforcement roles.|$|R
40|$|Police at {{this time}} not only have the duty as a “crime hunter” and “law enforcement”, but they are {{required}} to act as a “problem solving oriented team, maintaining order officers, public servant, public observer and chief executive officer” who are solid in pluralism and social problems in the community. That is part of the efforts to change the old culture of police officers and build <b>civilian</b> character of <b>police.</b> Building a new culture can be started by setting up Police Academy officer with civilian character. Departing from the strategic issues, empirical research on the Police Academy Tarun and devices that {{contribute to the development of}} <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> as the educational system, training and care at the Police Academy are required. Problems discussed in this research are: (1) How far the Police Academy Taruna has an understanding on <b>civilian</b> <b>police?</b> (2) how much education / teaching contributed to the development of <b>civilian</b> <b>police?</b> (3) How much training gave effect on the development of <b>civilian</b> <b>police?</b> (4) how parenting affects the development of the <b>civilian</b> <b>police?</b> The purpose of this study are: (1) Knowing the understanding of the Police Academy Taruna on Civilian Police; (2) Knowing that education / teaching contributed to the development of <b>civilian</b> <b>police,</b> (3) Knowing that training influence on the development of <b>civilian</b> <b>police,</b> (4) Knowing that parenting influence the development of <b>civilian</b> <b>police.</b> This study uses a quantitative approach. Target of the research is the Police Academy Taruna level II and III. Samples of the research is conducted by using stratified proportional random sampling. The independent variablecomprised three variables, namely Education / Teaching, training, and parenting. Dependent variable is the <b>Civilian</b> <b>Police.</b> The data collection wa done by using a questionnaire, collecting the relevant documents and interviews. Data were analyzed with regression techniques. Results showed that education / teaching, training and parenting together contribute positively to the development of the <b>Civilian</b> <b>Police</b> with significance level 0. 05 with F = 23. 916 count is greater than the F table = 3. 943. It can be concluded that the education / teaching, training and parenting give a positive contribution to the process of building a <b>civilian</b> character to <b>Police</b> Academy Taruna. Based on the results of these studies, it is suggested that in order to support the development of <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> to the Police Academy Taruna in Indonesia, it is required a process of education / teaching, training and nurturing that consistently have to really put forward the principles that form a picture of <b>civilian</b> <b>police,</b> so that in the future, these three things can be a guidance / reference in creating the Police Academy Tarun with <b>police</b> <b>civilian</b> character...|$|R

50|$|The {{military}} police has jurisdiction over military personnel, military areas, installations and exercise areas. However, a {{military police}} patrol may stop {{a crime that}} it witnesses in process in a civilian area. Additionally if a military police unit is near to a serious crime taking place, such as a robbery or an assault, and the <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> are delayed, a military police unit that is near to the scene can offer to handle the situation until the <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> arrive. As with some other Finnish Defence Forces units, the military police {{can be used to}} provide assistance to the <b>civilian</b> <b>police</b> when they are undermanned or lack special resources. In such case, the military police may take measures deemed necessary by the <b>civilian</b> <b>police.</b> For example, during the 2005 Helsinki World Athletic Championship Games, military police conscripts and career personnel were placed along the marathon route to prevent the large numbers of spectators from obstructing the runners.|$|R

They also provide a state with flexibility in policing, as the military regulations of a gendarmerie may exempt it from certain gaps in service affecting the <b>civilian</b> <b>police,</b> for example regarding the right to strike.|$|R
