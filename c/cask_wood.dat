40|$|Oak casks {{are used}} for the {{maturation}} {{of a wide variety}} of alcoholic beverages including Scotch whisky. The process of maturation has a profound but variable effect on the colour and flavour of the whisky, with <b>cask</b> <b>wood</b> playing an important role, particularly through the release of extractives to the distillate. This thesis examines variation in European oak wood (Quercus petraea Matt. Liebl. and Q. robur L.) of ellagitannins, oak lactones and other extractives, and physical wood properties. Investigations particularly sought to establish whether the properties and their effects on flavour can be predicted from either the species, the various forest origins, or identifiable wood or tree characters. The treatment of wood after felling, through seasoning and particularly the toasting or charring of casks, has a major effect on the levels of many extractives. Heating reduces the concentrations of ellagitannins and increases levels of lignin-derived extractives. However, the effects are not such as to render variation in untreated wood inconsequential. Within trees, the concentration of soluble ellagitannins declines and the composition changes with heartwood age. When heartwood of a similar age is compared concentrations vary by up to ten times between different trees, making up to 14 % of the heartwood dry weight. Concentrations of oak lactones appear to increase with heartwood age and are also very variable between trees. Wood samples were taken from two different forests, corresponding to opposing types of French oak used for cooperage. Over 70 % of the total variation of soluble tannins in the wood occurred between the forests. A difference between the two forests in the rate of tree growth and the heartwood age of samples could not explain all of the difference in the amounts of soluble tannins. After heating the wood, the concentrations of other extractives and the flavour and colour imparted to solutions, also varied significantly between the two forests and between trees within each site. Studies on clonal, progeny and provenance material concluded that the concentration of ellagitannins, oak lactones and many physical properties of heartwood are under strong genetic control. However, a large proportion of this variation is attributable to variation between the two species Q. robur and Q. petraea. Q. robur is characterised by high concentrations of tannins and, after heating, of lignin-derived products, but low or negligible levels of oak lactones. Q. petraea has opposing extractive properties and after heating, imparts a more pleasant and complex flavour. Although there is large variation between trees within each species, this difference between the species is proposed as the main factor explaining the different flavour and extractive properties found in European oak wood from different origins. </p...|$|E

30|$|Polyelectrolyte {{titration}} using {{a fluorescent}} indicator {{was applied to}} determine the electrolytic charges in 10 whiskies at various pH levels. Tannic acid was also titrated to compare the relation between pH and charge because the polyelectrolytes in whisky were postulated to be polyphenols, mainly tannic acid, which are gradually extracted from a <b>wood</b> <b>cask</b> over the years. Below pH 7, the pH-charge curves for whisky were analogous to those for tannic acid, indicating that carboxyl groups in tannic acid were fairly stable on maturation of the whisky. The charge of the tannic acid increased with increasing pH, whereas that of whisky {{had a tendency to}} level off. The degree of leveling off was higher for whiskies with longer maturation. These phenomena are believed to be due to the oxidation of pyrogallol and catechol moieties in tannic acid, which occurs during storage of the whisky. There was a clear tendency for the whiskies with higher prices to have higher charges, that is, a higher tannic acid content.|$|R
5000|$|The Château-Chalon AOC is {{dedicated}} {{exclusively to the}} production of vin jaune wine. There are other appellations within Jura that are permitted to produce AOC vin jaune, most notably the Côtes du Jura AOC, but Château-Chalon has specific regulations that are unique to this AOC. To begin with, the grapes must be harvested at brix levels that allow for a potential alcohol content of at least 12% in the finished wine; other regions will allow a minimum of 11.5%. While the grapes are harvested late, they are never botrytized, unlike other well known late harvest French wines such as Sauternes. After fermentation the wine must be stored for at least six years and three months prior to bottling. The majority of time is spent in <b>wood</b> <b>casks</b> that are only partially filled, allowing for a film of yeast, known as the voile or [...] "veil", to develop across the surface. This voile yeast is similar to the benevolent flor yeast that is used in sherry production, and vin jaune shares some similarities in styles to sherry, though vin jaune is not fortified.|$|R
40|$|Madeira wine is a {{fortified}} wine with {{impact in the}} Madeira Island’s economy. Similarly to other wines, its acidity should be well controlled {{in order to ensure}} Madeira wine quality, mostly the volatile acidity. Due to Madeira wine complex flavour, it is crucial to get a better knowledge about the volatile acidity impact in its features, namely determine the perception limit of acetic acid and ethyl acetate, as both are the main contributors for volatile acidity. Firstly, the olfactory perception threshold of volatile acidity was assessed by a trained and an untrained panel, using 5 and 10 years-old Sercial and Malvasia wines. Moreover, the current work also presents the evolution of organic acids, acetic acid and ethyl acetate during 540 days of ageing of Madeira wines (Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho and Sercial), comparing the same wines aged by both traditional ageing processes: canteiro and estufagem. Other wine samples, aged in <b>wood</b> <b>casks</b> (canteiro) for at least 5 years, were also evaluated. HS-SPME followed by GC-MS analysis was used to determine ethyl acetate concentration and IEC-HPLC-DAD was used for the organic acids determination, including acetic acid. The results indicated that acetic acid and ethyl acetate olfactory perception threshold depends essentially on wine’s age. Concerning acetic acid, the untrained panel was in average 5. 45 g/L (5 years-old) and 6. 22 g/L (10 years-old). Training the expert panel to recognize acetic acid odour, the values decreased for 1. 44 g/L (5 years-old) and 1. 87 g/L (10 years-old), but still remained higher than the established volatile acidity legal limits. Ethyl acetate threshold was similar for both panels (in average 327. 97 mg/L). Both compounds tend to increase exponentially with age, being more evident in sweet wines. Organic acids in young Madeira wines depend mostly on the nature of grape varieties, but this difference is minimized with wine ageing...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho determinou aspectos da composição química e aceitação sensorial da aguardente de cana-de-açúcar envelhecida por 3 anos em tonéis de diferentes madeiras (amendoim, araruva, cabreúva, carvalho, cerejeira, grápia, ipê-roxo, jequitibá e pereira). O destilado alcoólico simples que originou a aguardente foi produzido na Destilaria Piloto da ESALQ/USP. Após envelhecimento, as aguardentes foram avaliadas quanto ao grau alcoólico, acidez volátil, furfural, aldeídos, ésteres, álcoois superiores, álcool metílico, cobre, compostos fenólicos totais, cor e aceitação sensorial. Independentemente da madeira com que o tonel foi construído, a aguardente envelhecida apresentou coloração mais escura e maior concentração de acidez volátil, de furfural, de ésteres, de álcoois superiores, de congêneres e de compostos fenólicos totais que o destilado alcoólico simples. Por outro lado, a aguardente envelhecida apresentou menor concentração de aldeídos, de metanol e de cobre que o destilado alcoólico simples. A análise estatística geral, considerando a composição físico-química global das aguardentes envelhecidas nos tonéis das diferentes madeiras indicou similaridades entre as aguardentes envelhecidas nos tonéis de amendoim, araruva e jequitibá; entre as aguardentes envelhecidas nos tonéis de cabreúva e pereira; e entre as aguardentes envelhecidas nos tonéis de carvalho, cerejeira, grápia e ipê-roxo. A aguardente envelhecida nos tonéis das diferentes madeiras manteve-se dentro de todos os padrões de qualidade estabelecidos pela legislação nacional em vigor. A aguardente envelhecida na madeira carvalho foi a que apresentou a melhor aceitação sensorial. Dentre as madeiras nacionais, ipê-roxo, amendoim, cabreúva, cerejeira e pereira foram aquelas que propiciaram as melhores qualidades sensoriais à aguardente. This study {{evaluated}} {{some aspects}} of the chemical composition and sensorial acceptance of sugar cane spirit aged for 3 years in casks of different types of wood (peanut wood, araruva or striped wood, red cabreuva, oak, cherrywood, Brazilian gold wood, purple tabebuia, cariniana legalis, and pear tree). The simple alcoholic distillate which originated the sugar cane spirit was produced at the Distillery of ESALQ/USP. After aging, the sugar cane spirits were analyzed in terms of ethanol concentrations o, volatile acidity, furfural, aldehydes, esters, higher alcohols, methanol, copper, total phenolic compounds, color, and sensorial acceptance. Regardless the type of <b>wood</b> the <b>casks</b> were made of, the aged sugar cane spirits became darker and presented higher concentrations of volatile acidity, furfural, esters, higher alcohols, congeners, and total phenolic compounds than the simple alcoholic distillate. On the other hand, the aged sugar cane spirits presented lower concentrations of aldehydes, methanol, and copper than the simple alcoholic distillate. The statistical analysis, considering the global physicochemical composition of the sugar cane spirits aged in the casks made of different types of wood, showed similarities among the sugar cane spirits aged in the <b>casks</b> of peanut <b>wood,</b> araruva or striped wood, and cariniana legalis. It also indicates similarities among the sugar cane spirits aged in the casks of red cabreuva and pear tree and among the sugar cane spirits aged in the casks of oak, cherrywood, Brazilian gold wood, and purple tabebuia. The sugar cane spirits aged in the casks of the different types of wood were in accordance with the composition and quality standards established by the Brazilian laws. The sugar cane spirit aged in oak presented the best sensorial acceptance. Among the Brazilian woods, purple tabebuia, peanut wood, red cabreuva, cherrywood and pear tree were those that produced sugar cane spirits with better sensorial qualities...|$|R
