50|$|This {{station was}} {{built as a}} sister to Barony Power Station on the West Coast of Scotland, in Ayrshire. Although the design of Methil was based on that of Barony, it {{incorporated}} many improvements. As the Scottish coalfields were exhausted or abandoned in the mid-1980s, waste accumulated in <b>coal</b> <b>tips,</b> and this waste {{was used as a}} fuel in the Methil and Barony power stations. However, as the tips were cleared, operations at the two stations ceased due to lack of coal-slurry fuel and the uneconomical operation of such small facilities.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936-8, Lydney Rural District built council {{houses on}} Stockwell Lane and in 1944, the almshouses were sold and demolished. In 1949, Aylburton School became state {{controlled}} and in 1950-1, Lydney Rural District Council built Milling Crescent. Mains water {{did not reach}} Aylburton until the 1950s. A reservoir was built near Lodge Farm, but {{was replaced by the}} one on Chapel Hill in 1956. [...] "The Hare and Hounds" [...] inn was demolished in the mid 20th C. The <b>coal</b> <b>tips</b> and their railways were finally closed in 1960. In 1974, Lydney Rural District became part of the new Forest of Dean District.|$|R
50|$|The WDA {{contributed to}} the {{building}} of the Millennium Stadium and the walk way for the 1999 Rugby World Cup and the Millennium Centre. It assisted in the establishment of the National Botanic Garden for Wales and the Llanelli Coastal Path. It removed contaminated land and reclaimed and removed <b>coal</b> <b>tips</b> in South Wales through the world leader in the field, Gwyn Griffiths OBE. Success included partnerships with newly created 22 local authorities in the mid 1990s on urban regeneration and Town Improvement Grants. It worked in the EU with an Office in Brussels namely the Wales European Centre ensuring it gained European funding with the Welsh Office.|$|R
50|$|The disused {{coal mine}} at Hafod is {{situated}} {{to the east}} of the village and the mine's former <b>coal</b> <b>tip</b> has now been converted to a country park, Bonc yr Hafod.

50|$|The {{foundations}} of Tower 25B {{were discovered in}} 1880 during {{the building of a}} coke oven. The building measured 4 metres square (internally), with walls around 1 metre wide. There was a clay covered cobbled floor, on which pottery fragments was found. The site now lies beneath a reclaimed <b>coal</b> <b>tip</b> which is grassed over. The tower is the final one known in the Cumbrian frontier system.|$|E
50|$|The {{countryside}} is {{very different}} from many Welsh coal mining villages, and is much prettier now that the <b>coal</b> <b>tips</b> to the south of the village have been removed, and those at Treforgan are now hidden under silver birch (although this site is now a haven for motor cross and quad bikes, much to the consternation of the people living nearby). Both sides of the village used to be covered by farmed conifer forests, but these have been removed by the Forestry Commission in order for native trees to grow. As this will be a slow process the hills now look quite bleak in places.|$|R
40|$|The BGS has a 175 -year {{history of}} mapping and {{recording}} geology including unstable land. However, {{public awareness of}} such potential problems was not awakened until the Aberfan disaster, 44 years ago, when a school was buried by a landslide from a <b>coal</b> spoil <b>tip</b> killing 144 people, including 116 children. Since that event BGS research into landslides and unstable land has increased and new techniques {{have been developed to}} measure, monitor and model them...|$|R
50|$|With an {{original}} name of Thomastown, it was mainly built by William James Thomas, a {{co-owner of the}} Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company, (also of mines in Aberdare in the Cynon Valley). Most of the earlier parts of Trethomas were built in and around 1900 - 1913, when the mine was developing and {{at the apex of}} coal production in the South Wales coalfield. The terraced streets of Trethomas were appropriately named, some were named after members of William Thomas's family, hence the names: William, James, Thomas, and Mary. Others involved association with local areas, such as Navigation Street (associated with the Bedwas Navigation Colliery Company), Coronation St (for obvious reasons), Redbrook House which once stood on the left of the road entering the village from Machen(opposite the Chequered Flag petrol station but was demolished in late 1950s. It was named after the brook that ran nearby and coloured red with rust from the old drift mine that was situated at Glyn Gwyn - now redeveloped as Addison Way leading up to Graig-Y-Rhacca. The bridge over the now demolished railway line on Addison Way was built on the remains of the <b>coal</b> <b>tipping</b> from that mine.|$|R
50|$|Aberfan: The Merthyr Vale {{colliery}} {{began to}} produce coal in 1875. Spoil from the mine workings was piled {{on the hills}} close to the village which grew nearby. Tipping went on until the 1960s. The industry was by then nationalised, but even the National Coal Board failed to appreciate the danger they created. In October 1966, heavy rain made the giant <b>coal</b> <b>tip</b> unstable. The recent dumping of small particles of coal and ash known as 'tailings' {{seems to have been}} partly responsible. A 30 ft black wave tore downhill across the Glamorganshire Canal and swept away houses on its path towards the village school. 114 children and 28 adults were killed.|$|E
50|$|Bryn Navigation Collieries Co. began sinking this {{colliery}} in the mid-1890s. The <b>coal</b> <b>tip</b> above Meadow row {{was called}} 'Amy', some say its named after 'Amy Johnson' {{the first women}} aviator to fly solo from England to Australia others say its named {{after one of the}} machines there. Later the owners were listed as Messrs Baldwin's Ltd. then Thomas Richard & Baldwin's Ltd. In 1908 there were 380 men employed, producing House and Manufacturing coal. By 1918 the workforce had grown to 650. From a list 1923 there were 683 men employed, producing from the Middle and Lower seams. Later a drift was driven to become the main conveyance. In 1945 there were 615 men employed here. At its peak annual production was 96,000 tons. It closed in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|Under the Transport Act 1947 the British Transport Commission was created, {{taking over}} all the railways, buses, canals and port {{facilities}} in Britain.The Geest company used the docks to import West Indian bananas from 1959 until the 1980s.After they ended this operation, the port continued to decline.The British Transport Docks Board (BTDB) was created under the Transport Act 1962, assuming control of the ports including Barry.In September 1962 the passenger railway service from Barry to Pontypridd was terminated. Goods service at stations was cancelled in April 1964. but the through line was officially closed in July 1963 following the devastating fire at Tynycaeau Junction signal box in March 1963.Shipments of coal from the port ceased in 1976, and in November 1981 the last <b>coal</b> <b>tip</b> was taken down.In 1981 Associated British Ports (ABP) {{took control of the}} 19 ports that BTDB still owned, under the Transport Act 1981 [...]ABP is a statutory corporation controlled by a company named Associated British Ports Holdings Plc, and is the largest single port operator in Britain. As of 2013 it owned 22 ports including Barry.|$|E
50|$|Once {{raised up}} the shaft, the coal was yarded or emptied into wagons; each of 1 t capacity. Loaded wagons were run in pairs down a {{self-acting}} inclined plane railway (two loaded wagons going down hauled another two emptied ones up). They were then pushed by hand, assisted by gravity, along a graded wooden trestle. It crossed a sandy area, now occupied by Hunter Street and the Great Northern Railway, to a loading staith at which small ships could berth while <b>coal</b> was <b>tipped</b> into their holds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A new lipolytic {{strain of}} Bacillus sp. was {{isolated}} from oil contaminated soil sample. On measurement of biochemical parameters and 16 S rDNA sequence information the strain {{was identified as}} Bacillus pumilus RK 31 (NCBI accession no GQ 463238). The lipase purification steps involved, 60 % ammonium sulphate saturation, gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G 200 and ion exchange chromatography with DEAE cellulose. A purification fold of 186 was achieved following only three step purification process with specific activity of 3525. 6 U/mg to apparent homogeneity as evident by a single band of 62. 2 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse phase HPLC chromatogram. The purified enzyme 1 1 1 exhibited optimum activity at temperature 60 °C, pH 6. 0, Km of 1. 83 mM l and the Vmax of 10. 0 mM l min. EDTA-K almost completely inhibited the lipase activity.

25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} occurs naturally within some environments {{as part of}} {{the rock}} weathering process but is exacerbated by large-scale earth disturbances characteristic of mining and other large construction activities, usually within rocks containing an abundance of sulfide minerals. Areas where the earth has been disturbed (e.g. construction sites, subdivisions, and transportation corridors) may create acid rock drainage. In many localities, the liquid that drains from coal stocks, coal handling facilities, coal washeries, and <b>coal</b> waste <b>tips</b> can be highly acidic, and in such cases it is treated as acid rock drainage.|$|R
