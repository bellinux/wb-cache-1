[...] The radar has separate transmitting and receiving array antennas mounted side-by-side on the sloping face of its transmitter building, pointing south at an elevation angle of 45° (modern phased array radars use a single antenna array for both transmitting and receiving, {{but at the time}} it was built this was the simplest design). The transmitting antenna (on the left in the pictures) was a square 72x72 array of 5,184 <b>crossed</b> <b>dipole</b> antenna elements spaced 0.55 wavelength (37 cm) apart, which was later upgraded to 5928 elements.

40|$|Oblique {{incidence}} {{performance of}} a novel two-layer absorb/transmit frequency selective surface (FSS) is investigated. The FSS has good frequency stability for both horizontally and vertically polarized waves incident normally or at oblique angles. Due to its transmission for 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz mobile bands and good absorption for 5 GHz waves, {{it has the potential}} as a security wall or isolator for 5 GHz WLAN systems. The absorption in the stop band helps reduce additional WLAN multipath fading caused by conventional reflecting FSS designs. The first layer of the FSS consists of conventional conducting <b>cross</b> <b>dipoles</b> having a circular aperture in the centre, while the second layer uses resistive <b>cross</b> <b>dipoles.</b> Moreover, the conducting <b>cross</b> <b>dipoles</b> have been sandwiched between two dielectric sheets to achieve a stable response for different angles of incidence. The periodicity of both FSS layers is the same while the distance between the two layers is reduced to one eighth of the free-space wavelength. This reduction leads to a more compact design compared to the conventional Salisbury screen, while still achieving acceptable absorption in the stopband. Both theoretical and experimental results are presented to confirm the performance of the absorb/transmit FSS. 4 page(s...|$|R

The distance between the <b>crossed</b> <b>dipole</b> antenna elements in the subarray is 3.75 m, the suspension height is 1.6 m. The subarray design provides a wide frequency coverage from 8 to 80 MHz, high sensitivity (the galactic background level exceeds their self-noise by more than 7 dB), and high RFI immunity (achieved due to high dynamic range of the dipole amplifier: input IP3 is 30 dBm). The effective area at the central frequency is about 350 m². The HPBW of a single subarray beam at 40 MHz is about 20.4°. The estimate {{is consistent with the}} direct measurements that give 22±2°. The GURT subarray geometry provides a high filling factor that is important for a number of research tasks.
