25|$|The {{dialogue}} between the handset and the <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the mobile phone operator has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM, CDMA and TDMA.|$|E

In the course of our investigations, we recognized that Voronoi diagrams work best in urban areas, which naturally feature a high density of <b>cell</b> <b>sites.</b> In semi-rural regions, where less <b>cell</b> <b>sites</b> usually cover larger areas, the emerging Voronoi diagrams become fairly large, since their extent is only limited by the surrounding <b>cell</b> <b>sites,</b> which can lead to certain HO positions being estimated very inaccurately.|$|R
500|$|The Supreme Court remanded {{the case}} to the {{district}} court. During the investigation, the government obtained <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> location data with a 2703(d) order under the Stored Communications Act. In light of the Supreme Court's decision, the government sought to use this data instead of the GPS data it had collected. Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ruled in December 2012 that the government could use the <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> data against Jones. A new trial began in January 2013 after Mr Jones rejected 2 plea offers of 15 to 22 years with credit for time served. In March 2013, a mistrial was declared with the jury evenly split. Mr. Jones had represented himself at trial. [...] The Government planned for a fourth trial but in May 2013 Jones accepted a plea bargain of 15 years with credit for time served.|$|E

2500|$|A 30-page {{report from}} 2016 {{written by the}} {{experienced}} telecommunication engineer Halvard Sivertsen, confirmed the measurements presented in the trials as correct, but described Teleplan's note {{that there was a}} small possibility of Kristiansen's <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> to cover the crime area as unfounded. Sivertsen also described how the report from Teleplan was presented in court and how it could have been misinterpreted there. The report from Sivertsen concluded by saying that [...] "the cell phone data seems to give Kristansen a clear alibi for the timeframe of the murders".|$|E

When sources in the police spread the word that [...] "a new report had destroyed Kristiansen's cell pone alibi", Telenor decided to perform additional measurements, but they got the same results as they got the first time.|$|E
2500|$|Mobile phones {{send and}} receive radio signals with any number of <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> base {{stations}} fitted with microwave antennas. These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power transceiver that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away. [...] In areas of low coverage, a cellular repeater may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain dish antenna or yagi antenna to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Kims had a {{cellular}} phone with them, their remote location in the mountains was {{out of range of}} the cellular network, rendering the phone unusable for voice calls. [...] Despite being unusable for voice calls, their cell phone would {{play a key role in}} their rescue. [...] Cell phone text messages may go through even when there appears to be no signal, in part because text messaging is a store-and-forward service. [...] Two Edge Wireless engineers, Eric Fuqua and Noah Pugsley, contacted search and rescue authorities offering their help in the search. On Saturday, December 2, they began searching through the data logs of cell sites, trying to find records of repeaters to which the Kims' cellphone may have connected. They discovered that on November 26, 2006 at around 1:30a.m., the Kims' cellphone made a brief automatic connection to a <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> near Glendale, Oregon, and retrieved two text messages. Temporary atmospheric conditions, such as tropospheric ducting, can briefly allow radio communications over larger distances than normal. Through the data logs, the engineers determined that the cell phone was in a specific area west of the cellular tower. They then used a computer program to determine which areas in the mountains were within a line-of-sight to the cellular tower. This narrowed the search area tremendously, and finally focused rescue efforts on Bear Camp Road.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court {{struck down}} even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still {{not engage in}} {{meaningful}} judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, [...] "extreme and overly broad," [...] affirming that [...] "courts consistent with the First Amendment, simple accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk." [...] He {{also found that the}} FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill [...] "implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people." [...] Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action, but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed {{for the first time the}} extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of a NSL, it can obtain <b>cell</b> <b>site</b> location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information.|$|E
