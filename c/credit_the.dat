Roosevelt would later publicly <b>credit</b> <b>the</b> pair with being {{the two men who}} had done the most to secure his election.|$|E

5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank <b>credit.</b> <b>The</b> total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E

5|$|When a {{defensive}} player has {{the ball and}} can end the play by preventing further advance, but fails to do so because of a mental mistake (not an error) and a runner subsequently scores, the official scorer must decide whether to <b>credit</b> <b>the</b> batter with a run batted in (RBI). If the runner recognized the mistake after slowing or pausing his advance, an RBI is not credited. If the runner was oblivious to the mistake or runs home without slowing, the batter is credited with an RBI.|$|E
5|$|After {{the public}} and press {{interest}} garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, Crocodiles, the band released the Shine So Hard EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, Heaven Up Here. Following musical differences between the band and Crocodiles producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones {{was brought in to}} produce Heaven Up Here. Jones had previously engineered Crocodiles and co-produced Shine So Hard with Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album Siberia. The band were also given an additional producer <b>credit.</b> <b>The</b> album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981.|$|E
5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists <b>credit</b> <b>the</b> high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual relationships that tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
50|$|Dastar {{might have}} been able to avoid this legal attack entirely if it had <b>credited</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} authors. However, as Scalia noted in the opinion, that would have put them in a bind: <b>crediting</b> <b>the</b> original authors might have implied their sponsorship or approval, which could have exposed Dastar to other lawsuits unless <b>the</b> <b>credit</b> had been carefully worded.|$|R

5|$|Apart from Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, Krishnasastri's script {{also took}} {{inspiration}} from Devan Sharar's short story, The Emperor and the Slave Girl, {{which was published}} in the now defunct magazine, The Illustrated Weekly of India. It was Narasimha Reddy's practice to <b>credit</b> <b>the</b> authors of works from which he borrowed the basic premise for a film, but in this film, that was not the case. Krishnasastry revealed the fact in an interview with Vijayachitra magazine after Narasimha Reddy's death in 1977. However, in the film's opening credits, Buchibabu was listed as the film's writer along with Krishnasastri. Adi M. Irani and B.N. Konda Reddy were the film's cinematographers; S. Rajeswara Rao and Addepalli Ramarao composed the film's music; H.R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film. A.K. Shekhar was the film's production designer and Thota Tharani father Thota Venkateswara Rao assisted him.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's {{presentation of}} a woman's view on life and love, along with her artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly <b>credit</b> <b>the</b> group on the album; {{a lawsuit filed by}} the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it {{as one of the greatest}} albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.|$|E

5|$|Detractors {{have raised}} {{concerns}} over Lichtenstein's appropriation, {{in that he}} directly references imagery from other sources in Whaam! and other works of the period. Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways. In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for copyright infringement, and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s. Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to <b>credit</b> <b>the</b> original artists of his sources; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals {{in the case of}} Whaam!, as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.|$|E
5|$|Development of Ant-Man {{began in}} April 2006, with {{the hiring of}} Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had {{completed}} three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete The World's End. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project, citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish, {{as well as an}} executive producer <b>credit.</b> <b>The</b> following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Principal photography took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and Metro Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Fox, who had {{projected}} {{the budget}} at $75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated {{would have cost}} $5 million more. Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room had to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X-Men. Fox head Thomas Rothman argued that this would enhance the story, and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey. Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from The Usual Suspects, and together did another rewrite. David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story <b>credit.</b> <b>The</b> WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was {{more in line with}} Hayter's script than his.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Credits</b> - <b>The</b> opening <b>credits</b> show <b>the</b> five {{starring}} {{members of}} the show, but through that there are images of notable politicians and celebrities which are targeted in the titles.
