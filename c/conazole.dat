In this study, the potential (anti-) androgenic effects of ten conazoles were assessed and mutually compared with existing data. Effects of cyproconazole (CYPRO), fluconazole (FLUC), flusilazole (FLUS), hexaconazole (HEXA), myconazole (MYC), penconazole (PEN), prochloraz (PRO), tebuconazole (TEBU), triadimefon (TRIA), and triticonazole (TRIT) were examined using murine Leydig (MA- 10) cells and human T 47 D-ARE cells stably transfected with an androgen responsive element and a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Six conazoles caused a decrease in basal testosterone (T) secretion by MA- 10 cells varying from 61 % up to 12 % compared to vehicle-treated control. T secretion was concentration-dependently inhibited after exposure of MA- 10 cells to several concentrations of FLUS (IC 50 = 12. 4 μM) or TEBU (IC 50 = 2. 4 μM) in combination with LH. The expression of steroidogenic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes was not changed by <b>conazole</b> exposure. Also, there were no changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation that could explain the altered T secretion after exposure to conazoles. Nine conazoles decreased T-induced AR activation (IC 50 s ranging from 10. 7 to 71. 5 μM) and effect potencies (REPs) were calculated relative to the known AR antagonist flutamide (FLUT). FLUC {{had no effect on}} AR activation by T. FLUS was the most potent (REP = 3. 61) and MYC the least potent (REP = 0. 03) AR antagonist.

Our results show distinct in vitro anti-androgenic effects of several <b>conazole</b> fungicides arising from two mechanisms: inhibition of T secretion and AR antagonism, suggesting potential testicular toxic effects.

40|$|Starting {{our search}} for in vitro {{alternative}} methods to screen for steroidogenesis toxicity, we focused {{on the effects of}} (suggested) endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) on cytochrome P 450 17 (CYP 17) enzyme activity. CYP 17 is responsible for conversion of progestagens to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the main precursor for androgens and estrogens, important for (fetal) sexual functioning and development. We developed a new assay to screen for effects on CYP 17 activity using porcine adrenal cortex microsomes (PACMs) and compared this with the well-known H 295 R steroidogenesis assay. Also, effects of selected compounds on CYP 19 (aromatase) activity in the H 295 R assay as well as human placental microsomes were assessed. 28 (suggested) EDCs were screened. The PACM assay showed to be an effective, rapid tool for screening of direct interaction of EDCs with CYP 17. Furthermore, we discovered that CYP 17 activity is regulated differently from CYP 19. The addition of a specific and validated CYP 17 assay to an EDC screening battery would be of added value on top of the existing steroidogenesis assays that mainly consider effects on the CYP 19 enzyme. We further investigated a specific class of suggested EDCs: the <b>conazole</b> fungicide, some of which have been shown to affect male fertility parameters in vitro and in vivo. Ten <b>conazole</b> fungicides were selected and tested for potential in vitro (anti-) androgenic effects using the murine MA- 10 cell line as well as an androgen receptor (AR) activity reporter assay. Exposure of MA- 10 cells to six of these conazoles resulted in a decrease in basal testosterone (T) secretion. Nine of the tested <b>conazole</b> fungicides showed an inhibition of T-induced AR activation. Thus, several of the tested <b>conazole</b> fungicides showed distinct in vitro anti-androgenic effects in the performed assays. These effects are a result of two mechanisms, i. e. inhibition of T secretion and AR antagonism, suggesting that these compounds are potential testicular toxicants in vivo. Subsequently, the effects of two bisphenol analogues, two perfluorinated compounds, and two phthalates on ABC efflux transporters in the blood-testis barrier (BTB) were studied. Bisphenol A (BPA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), as well as perfluorooctane-sulfonic acid (PFOS) inhibited breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) activity. BPA and PFOA showed to be substrates for BCRP. TBBPA, PFOA, and PFOS also showed inhibition of multidrug resistance proteins 1 and 4 (MRP 1 / 4) and P-glycoprotein. In MA- 10 cells, BPA and TBBPA concentration-dependently increased T secretion. For TBBPA, this could be blocked by inhibition of MRPs, generating the hypothesis that transporter-mediated efflux of T precursors is inhibited by TBBPA resulting in a higher availability of precursors for T production. This research indicates that, in EDC risk assessment, ABC efflux transporters present in the BTB are of toxicological and clinical relevance for testicular toxicity and should be taken into account. Next, effects of these several (structural) bisphenol analogues on AR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity modulation were tested, as well as testicular steroidogenesis in MA- 10 cells. BPA, bisphenol F (BPF), and TBBPA, but not bisphenol S (BPS) showed differential inhibition of AR as well as GR activity. BPF and BPS exposure of MA- 10 cells mainly resulted in higher levels of progestagens that are formed {{at the beginning of the}} steroidogenic pathway, whereas TBBPA shows a distinct profile more directed towards the endpoint of testicular steroidogenesis, i. e. T and other androgens production. Furthermore, full steroid profiling of the in vitro MA- 10 cell model shows the presence of a more fetal-like, testicular-specific steroidogenesis pathway. This so-called “backdoor pathway” renders the MA- 10 assay added value on top of the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay for tissue-specific questions related to EDC screening...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the water concentrations of pollutants from accumulated amounts in the sampler, laboratory or in situ calibration data are required in order {{to estimate the}} sampling rate (Rs) for each compound. The sampling rate of passive samplers depends on the physicochemical properties of the chemicals (ex. molecular weight, structure and hydrophobicity) and the environmental conditions, such as temperature, water flow rate/turbulences and dissolved organic carbon. The challenge is to obtain TWA concentrations which are sufficiently representative of the real pollution levels in the aquatic medium. This goal is mainly dependent on the calibration of the passive sampler, generally conducted under controlled conditions at laboratory scale. However, as field environment is very different from laboratory conditions, use of inappropriate laboratory derived sampling rates for calculating TWA concentrations from passive samplers exposed in situ could lead to an inaccurate result of the real pollution levels. In order to obtain representative concentrations from passive sampler, it is necessary to correct laboratory sampling rates (Lab-Rs) in order {{to take into account the}} exposure conditions. The approach based on the use of performance reference compound (PRC,) can be used to determine in-situ sampling rates more specific to a field conditions, allowing to calculate TWA concentrations with an acceptable trueness The aims of the present work were to study the uptake kinetics in surface water of a range of polar pesticides and metabolites by pharmaceutical POCIS samplers in order to determine sampling rates by in-situ calibration, to compare results with those obtained under laboratory conditions in order to assess the impact of environmental conditions on POCIS field performances. Finally, the objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of POCIS to determine TWA concentrations in the aquatic medium in comparison with the classical spot sampling methodology. The in situ experiment was conducted with samplers deployed in channel pilot system, an artificial irrigation canal bringing water from the Rhône River. Beside the numerous targeted pesticides, 13 compounds were detected in water samples including triazines (atrazine, simazine, terbuthylazine), phenylureas (isoproturon, IPU; diuron, chlortoluron), <b>conazoles</b> (tebuconazole, propiconazole), chloroacetanilides (metolachlor), phenylamides (metalaxyl) and triazines metabolites (deethylatrazine, DEA; deisopropylatrazine, DIA; deethylterbuthylazine, DET), allowing the comparison between lab and in situ experiments. For most of the compounds, the in-situ sampling rates were significantly lower by a factor of 3 - 5 than those from laboratory experiment, considering that field measured water velocity was 4 time lower than laboratory, the main effect of flow velocity on accumulation capability of POCIS is highlighted.

While considered "rare" (but likely underreported) the high mortality rate and lack of established success in treatment makes PAM a particularly devastating infection. In the absence of economic inducements to invest in development of anti-PAM drugs by the pharmaceutical industry, anti-PAM drug discovery largely relies on drug 'repurposing'-a cost effective strategy to apply known drugs for treatment of rare or neglected diseases. Similar to fungi, N. fowleri has an essential requirement for ergosterol, a building block of plasma and cell membranes. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated interventional strategy against fungal pathogens of medical and agricultural importance. The N. fowleri genome encodes the sterol 14 -demethylase (CYP 51) target sharing ~ 35 % sequence identity to fungal orthologues.

Mice were administered diets containing PB (850 ppm), Pro (2500 ppm), or Tri (1800 ppm) for 4 and 30 days. Targeted transcriptomic analyses were conducted at the gene level examining differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and subsets of DEGs: cell cycle genes, and transcription factors. Analyses were also conducted on function, pathway and network levels examining Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tox Lists and Canonical Pathways, and Gene-Go MetaCore dynamic networks and their central hubs. Genes expressed by PB or the two conazoles were also compared with those genes associated with human hepato-cellular cancer. The results from these analyses indicated greater differences between PB and the two conazoles than similarities. Significant commonalities between the two <b>conazole</b> treatments were also noted.

The risk of pesticides use in the Mekong delta was addressed in three stages: (1) investigating current pesticide use status in the Mekong delta; (2) modelling pesticide loss and accumulation; (3) classifying pesticide risk areas for aquaculture of target cultured species. A survey of 334 farms covering a total area of 20, 000 km 2 in the Mekong delta took place between 2008 and 2009. Information on pesticide types and quantities was recorded using questionnaires, and it was found that 96 pesticides in 23 groups were popularly used for agricultural purposes. Dicarboximide, Carbamate and <b>Conazole</b> had the highest use at 3000, 2000 and 2000 g/ha/year respectively. The survey revealed an increase in pesticide use per hectare since previous surveys in the Mekong delta in 1994, 2000, and 2004. However, the highly persistent compounds (WHO classification classes II, III and IV) appeared to have reduced in use. Insecticides previously represented > 50...|$|E
40|$|The 21 st century {{vision for}} {{toxicity}} testing and risk assessment {{is to become}} more efficient at evaluating {{a broader range of}} chemicals with minimal animal testing. The objective of this research was to determine if short-term global gene expression profiling can be used to inform potency and chemical mode of action (MOA) determinations and thus collectively serve as a strategy to prioritize future or data-poor chemicals for further evaluation. Dose-response modeling was used to estimate low-dose potency for activation or repression of key genes and pathways, and these transcriptional benchmark dose (BMD T) estimates were compared to benchmark dose estimates for more traditional toxicological (i. e., apical) responses (BMD A) at the cellular or tissue level which were observed after the same exposure duration. These BMD T and BMD A were also compared to BMD A for the ultimate adverse outcome that might traditionally serve as the basis of quantitative risk assessment. The case studies included (1) liver gene expression at 30 days for <b>conazole</b> antifungal agents, some of which are hepatocarcinogens in mice, (2) liver gene expression at 2 and 7 days for phenobarbital, a prototype nongenotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogen that activates the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and (3) urinary bladder gene expression at 7 days and 20 weeks for diuron, a substituted urea pesticide associated with urinary bladder cytotoxicity and tumorigenesis in rats. BMD T and BMD A estimates are particularly useful in informing threshold dose-response and risk assessment approaches for nongenotoxic carcinogens. Our studies showed that BMD T estimates for key genes and pathways were highly concordant and thus phenotypically anchored to BMD A for target tissue responses observed after the same exposure duration. Our short-term BMD T were also consistent with potency estimates for the tumorigenic outcome or precursor key events such as hyperplasia. In conclusion, this research demonstrated the utility of short-term global gene expression profiling for informing potency with respect to MOA determinations and quantitative risk assessment of long-term exposures. Further, these case studies encompassed multiple rodent species, target tissues, MOA, and exposure durations ranging from 2 days to 20 weeks, thus demonstrating the potential utility of this approach as a chemical testing and prioritization strateg...|$|E
