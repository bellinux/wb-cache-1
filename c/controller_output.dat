25|$|The {{contribution}} from the integral term {{is proportional to}} both {{the magnitude of the}} error and the duration of the error. The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously. The accumulated error is then multiplied by the integral gain (Ki) and added to the <b>controller</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the <b>controller</b> <b>output.</b> The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system to oscillate, thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E

2500|$|From about 1932 onwards, {{the use of}} {{wideband}} pneumatic controllers increased {{rapidly in}} a variety of control applications. Compressed air was used both for generating the <b>controller</b> <b>output,</b> and for powering the process modulating device; such as a diaphragm operated control valve. [...] They were simple low maintenance devices which operate well in a harsh industrial environment, and did not present an explosion risk in hazardous locations. They were the industry standard for many decades until the advent of discrete electronic controllers and distributed control systems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} PID controller {{is the ability to}} use the three control terms of proportional, integral and derivative influence on the <b>controller</b> <b>output</b> to apply accurate and optimal control. The block diagram on the right shows the principles of how these terms are generated and applied. It shows a PID controller which continuously calculates an error value [...] as the difference between a desired setpoint SP= and a measured process variable PV=, and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. The controller attempts to minimize the error over time by adjustment of a control variable , such as the opening of a control valve, to a new value determined by a weighted sum of the control terms.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new idea, shaping the control signal, and generalizes the time-delay-filter-based deadbeat control for {{processes}} with dead time to two-level control {{so that the}} controller saturation is avoided. The controller mimics experienced manual operations to provide a two-level control signal. At first, the <b>controller</b> <b>outputs</b> a value close to the maximal value and then the <b>controller</b> <b>outputs</b> a smaller value to maintain the steady-state output at the set point. The system output reaches the steady state in finite time, which is explicitly determined by the upper bound of the control output and is independent of the controller and (almost) of the sampling period. The disturbance response can be freely tuned according to the desired phase or gain margin. Three examples are given to show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed controller.

40|$|An {{implementation}} of the IEEE 1149. 1 standard (JTAG) is presented in this paper. Rules are given for removing gated clocks, registering of all the TAP <b>controller</b> <b>outputs,</b> and daisy-chaining the boundary-scan cell clocks, resets, and control signals in a direction opposite to that of TDI to TDO signal. Several major advantages are obtained {{as a result of}} these implementation rules. Timing issues that occur while shifting between the boundary cells when the design is in layout are eliminated. During EXTEST instruction execution, skew is introduced between the toggling pad outputs to minimize damaging power spikes. Due to the elimination of the gated clocks, scan can be inserted without additional DFT logic. A method for inserting scan is given which mostly eliminates timing issues during shifting. Since the TAP <b>controller</b> <b>outputs</b> are fully registered and the gated clocks are recommended to be enables, more observe and control locations are available for an ATPG tool to easily create a high fault coverage pattern for the JTAG logic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a new scheduling and allocation algorithm which optimizes a datapath-controller system for clock cycle time. The cycle {{time of a}} VLSI system depends {{not only on the}} characteristics of the datapath and controller in isolation but also on the interactions between them. A datapath may impose both arrival time constraints on controller inputs and departure time constraints on <b>controller</b> <b>outputs.</b> Late-arriving <b>controller</b> inputs may be generated by complex datapath functions, such as ALU carry-out, while early-departure <b>controller</b> <b>outputs</b> may be required to control slow datapath units. If the controller is not designed taking into account arrival and departure times, it may unnecessarily put control logic on the critical timing path. Our synthesis heuristic, which can be used in conjunction with other scheduling heuristics, identifies critical interactions between datapath and controller and reallocates/reschedules them to reduce system cycle time during high-level synthesis. Experimental results show that a unifiable scheduling and allocation (USA) can substantially improve system cycle time with only small area penalties.

2500|$|In {{closed loop}} control, the control {{action from the}} {{controller}} is dependent on feed back from the process {{in the form of}} the value of the process variable (PV). In the case of the boiler analogy, a closed loop would include a thermostat to compare the building temperature (PV) with the temperature set on the thermostat (the set point - SP). This generates a <b>controller</b> <b>output</b> to maintain the building at the desired temperature by switching the boiler on and off. A closed loop controller, therefore, has a feedback loop which ensures the controller exerts a control action to manipulate the process variable to be the same as the [...] "Reference input" [...] or [...] "set point". For this reason, closed loop controllers are also called feedback controllers.|$|E
2500|$|Control action - The {{mathematical}} model and practical loop above both use a [...] "direct" [...] control action {{for all the}} terms, which means an increasing positive error results in an increasing positive control output for the summed terms to apply correction. However, the output is called [...] "reverse" [...] acting if it's necessary to apply negative corrective action. For instance, if the valve in the flow loop was 100-0% valve opening for 0-100% control output - meaning the controller action has to be reversed. Some process control schemes and final control elements require this reverse action. An example would be a valve for cooling water, where the fail safe mode, {{in the case of}} loss of signal, would be 100% opening of the valve; therefore 0% <b>controller</b> <b>output</b> needs to cause 100% valve opening.|$|E
2500|$|The wide use of {{feedback}} controllers {{did not become}} feasible until the development of wide band high-gain amplifiers to use the concept of negative feedback. This had been developed in telephone engineering electronics by Harold Black in the late 1920s, but not published until 1934. Independently, Clesson E Mason of the Foxboro Company in 1930 invented a wide-band pneumatic controller by combining the nozzle and flapper high-gain pneumatic amplifier, which had been invented in 1914, with negative feedback from the <b>controller</b> <b>output.</b> This dramatically increased the linear range of operation of the nozzle and flapper amplifier, and integral control could also be added {{by the use of}} a precision bleed valve and a bellows generating the Integral term. The result was the [...] "Stabilog" [...] controller which gave both proportional and integral functions using feedback bellows. Later the derivative term was added by a further bellows and adjustable orifice.|$|E

40|$|Vector {{control is}} one of the {{standard}} techniques used for the control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The outer speed loop in vector controlled PMSM drive greatly affects the drive performance. In order to combine the advantages of proportional plus integral (PI) and fuzzy controllers, hybrid fuzzy-PI controllers are used in which the output can either be the outputs of the two, i. e. the PI or fuzzy units being switched as per the predetermined speed errors or be {{a combination of the two}} outputs with separate weights assigned to them with online calculations for the weights from the speed errors. The former method based on switching often causes chattering effects, and later method demands larger execution time because of inclusion of separate switching algorithms.
