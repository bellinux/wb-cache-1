40|$|The {{construction}} sector {{is a vital}} part of the economy in most country, yet it is usually considered to be dirty, dangerous, unreliable, and hard. Construction and noise is very synonym together and it often cause people to make a complaint. As a developing country, Malaysia actively carrying out various construction activities such as construction of roads, administrative buildings, and also residential projects and an increase in activity can affect the safety and health of the parties involved. Although some steps have been taken to reduce the noise level at the area of the local community, but there are still a complained made by the community. The aim of this research is to find out the types of construction works that contribute to noise pollution and the objectives of the study are to identify the level of noise at the construction site, to identify the types of construction works that contribute to certain level of noise, and to identify whether noise from the construction works affects the people staying near the <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> <b>Noise</b> pollution from construction sites is one of the major sources of noise pollution other than noise pollution from vehicles. High noise levels can lead to discomfort and negative effects to surrounding people. Therefore, a study was conducted to analyze the level of noise generated from the case study area. There are two methods used in this study, first the noise measurement conducted in three residential areas in Shah Alam which is near to the construction site by using Sound Level Meter (SLM) and the second method is in form of questionnaire to determine the level of noise exposure of the case study area to residents living near the construction site. The highest reading noise level using Sound Level Meter (SLM) among the 3 case study is at 10. 30 am with 079 dB which is at iCity, followed by at 9. 15 am with 078 dB also at iCity and the lowest noise level is at 9. 30 am and 5. 45 pm with 045 dB at Desa Ala...|$|E

The noise from the construction activities could potentially have a negative impact to the construction workers and publics. The negative effect can also be seen in terms of the cost to be borne by the workers and publics. The cost is known as external cost or externality cost. The costs are the result of the actions from economic actors that can influence the well-being of others that has nothing to do with the activity. This study was carried out to examine and evaluate the external costs borne by the affected <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> workers due to the <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> <b>noise</b> generated from the use of equipments and machineries. Impact Pathway Approach (IPA) was used in this study.

This study is to compare the noise exposure level among workers in four <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> In addition, the research also was conducted to assess the noise exposure level produced from <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> activities and to explore the effect of noise exposure to the workers. Furthermore, the workers’ level of awareness regarding noise exposure is being studied. Moreover, the perceptions of workers on noise exposure also were tested.

40|$|Because the {{acoustic}} environments of <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> include multiple <b>noise</b> sources from various construction machines, {{it is necessary}} to consider the influence of combined noise on annoyance. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine the effects of {{the acoustic}} characteristics of combined construction noise on annoyance. Six construction machines, including machines for foundation work (pile drivers, earth augers, and payloaders) and demolition work (breakers, bulldozers, and excavators) were selected as <b>noise</b> sources in <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> and auditory experiments were designed to quantify the annoyance caused by the machines individual and combined noise. The results show that both individual and combined noise correlate well with the equivalent sound level (L-Aeq), but that the annoyance caused by combined noise is significantly higher than the annoyance caused by individual noise when L-Aeq increases over 65 dBA. Among the psychoacoustic measures, loudness is the most important in determining the annoyance caused by individual noise, whereas both loudness and roughness significantly impact the annoyance caused by combined construction noise. Ranges of an optimum stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio between two construction machine noises are suggested to minimize the annoyance caused by combined noise. Optimum stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio ranges usually include 0 dBA when reference construction noise levels (e. g., pile driver or breaker) are lower than 60 dBA, whereas the stationary-to-mobile machine noise ratio should be greater than 5 dBA as construction noise levels exceed 65 dBA.

Construction noise becomes one of the main sources of noise pollution which affect the public and construction workers. Construction noise prediction at planning stage must be carried out and prepared through Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). There are various methods of construction noise prediction that have been practiced by the respected parties. The British Standards Institution (BSI) and the Department of Environment (DOE) have published BS 5228 – Part 1 : 2009 – Code of Practice for Noise and Vibration Control on <b>Construction</b> and Open <b>Sites</b> and The Planning Guidelines for Environmental Noise Limits and Control respectively. These standards and guidelines were usually be used by the respected parties since currently, there are no specific established noise prediction method. However, previous researches were claimed BS 5228 – Part 1 : 2009 procedures as inaccurate due to several factors. Thus, this study was carried out to evaluate the disparity of results between construction noise predictions using BS 5228 – Part 1 : 2009 procedures and real on-site noise measurements.
