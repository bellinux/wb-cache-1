5|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Harry Blackmun held that natural parents have a right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the burden of proof used by New York State is not stringent enough to satisfy the <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> of the due process clause. In striking down New York's burden, the Court utilized the Mathews test to determine what burden of proof was due.|$|E
5|$|Referring to {{the cases}} in which the High Court had upheld the wartime {{legislation}} allowing indefinite administrative detention, Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other countries had come to be regarded as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While conceding that the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater in wartime than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> such as those in Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler {{attempted}} to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, {{insisted on a}} tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments {{to the security of}} Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to bring his new Secretary of State directly into negotiations. Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> that Congress authorize appropriations for war.|$|E

25|$|In {{upholding}} the Court of Appeals’ decision the Supreme Court again upheld a key finding of Wilson, noting {{that even the}} possibility of an infamous punishment (regardless of whether or not lesser punishments like fines were available) made the crime infamous, and required Fifth Amendment <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> to be met.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the Illinois Secretary of State, Jesse White, {{reiterated that}} he would not certify any {{appointment}} made by Blagojevich, although {{at the time it was}} not clear whether this could prevent Burris from taking office. Furthermore, the Senate might not actually have been able to refuse to seat Burris, as he met all <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> for the office and was not involved in the Blagojevich corruption scandal (per the U.S. Supreme Court decision Powell v. McCormack).|$|E

5000|$|Justice Scalia {{described}} the majority's decision as an unprincipled compromise between justices who believed Miranda was a <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirement</b> {{and those who}} disagreed. He noted that the majority did not state outright that the Miranda warning is a <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirement,</b> but merely that it is [...] "constitutionally based." [...] Justice Scalia further criticized the majority for implying that Congress has no power to override judicially imposed safeguards of constitutional rights (Marbury v. Madison (1803) having settled that Congress may not override judicial interpretations of the Constitution).|$|R
25|$|The {{date and}} type of federal {{election}} {{is determined by the}} Prime Minister — after a consideration of <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements,</b> legal requirements, as well as political considerations — who advises the Governor-General to set the process in motion by dissolving the lower or both houses and issuing writs for election. Some state elections are statutorily determined while others are determined by the respective state premiers. By federal law, state elections cannot take place on the same day as a federal election, which takes precedence if there is conflict. Federal elections have been held on a Saturday since the 1913 federal election. In Victoria elections have been held on a Saturday since the 1927 state election.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1936, Somoza openly confronted President Sacasa {{by using}} {{military}} force to displace local government officials loyal {{to the president and}} replacing them with close associates. Somoza García's increasing military confrontation led to Sacasa's resignation on June 6, 1936. The Congress appointed Carlos Brenes Jarquín, a Somoza García associate, as interim president and postponed presidential elections until December. In November, Somoza resigned as chief director of the National Guard, thus complying with <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> for eligibility to run for the presidency. The Liberal Nationalist Party (Partido Liberal Nacionalista—PLN) was established with support from a faction of the Conservative Party to support Somoza Garcia's candidacy. Somoza was elected president in the December election by the remarkable margin of 107,201 votes to 108. On January 1, 1937, he resumed control of the National Guard, combining the roles of president and chief director of the military.|$|E

2500|$|On May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama used an Autopen to {{sign the}} PATRIOT Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, a {{four-year}} extension of three key provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act {{while he was in}} France: roving wiretaps, searches of business records (the [...] "library records provision"), and conducting surveillance of [...] "lone wolves"—individuals suspected of terrorist-related activities not linked to terrorist groups.

2500|$|Because the hate-crime {{enhancement}} {{increased the}} punishment {{available to the}} sentencing judge instead of raising the floor on the sentencing range as a mandatory minimum would, the Court would not allow the hate-crime enhancement to escape the constitutional protections. [...] The reason for criminal activity requires an inquiry into the defendant's motive, a traditional arena of criminal examination. [...] Punishing a person for this specific bad intent has historically been {{the province of the}} criminal law, and historically required certain procedural safeguards. [...] Merely labelling the hate-crime enhancement as a [...] "sentencing factor" [...] could not allow New Jersey to escape <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Incorporation applies both procedurally and substantively to the {{guarantees}} of the states. Thus, procedurally, only a jury can convict a defendant {{of a serious}} crime, since the Sixth Amendment jury-trial right has been incorporated against the states; substantively, for example, states must recognize the First Amendment prohibition against a state-established religion, regardless of whether state laws and constitutions offer such a prohibition. The Supreme Court has declined, however, to apply new procedural constitutional rights retroactively against the states in criminal cases (Teague v. Lane, [...] ) with limited exceptions, and it has waived <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> if the states can prove that a constitutional violation was [...] "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson, Price, {{and their}} staff {{promptly}} returned to Jefferson City where the Governor issued a proclamation declaring {{that it was}} still the duty of all Missourians [...] "to obey all the <b>constitutional</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Federal Government" [...] but also that they were [...] "under no obligation whatever to obey the unconstitutional edicts of the military despotism" [...] and its [...] "wicked minions," [...] referring to Lyon, who he said should be driven from the state. However, the President had exercised his constitutional authority to declare an insurrection {{as a result of}} Fort Sumter, and he had called for state volunteers under existing Federal law.|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court firmly {{established}} {{its power to}} declare laws unconstitutional in Marbury v. Madison (1803), consummating the American {{system of checks and}} balances. In explaining the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts, part of the duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.
