The last syllable, bog, is obviously, therefore, a mere corruption of the Saxon Burgh, which we find in the various transmutations of Burgh, Burrow, Brough, Bruff, Buff, and Boff, which last approaches very near the sound in question--since, supposing the word to have been originally borgh, which is the genuine Saxon spelling, a slight change, such as modern organs too often make upon ancient sounds, will produce first Bogh, and then, elisa H, or compromising and sinking the guttural, agreeable to the common vernacular practice, you have either Boff or Bog as it happens. The word Quickens requires in like manner to be altered,--decomposed, as it were,--and reduced to its original and genuine sound, ere we can discern its real meaning. By the ordinary exchange of the Qu into Wh, familiar to the rudest tyro who has opened a book of old Scottish poetry, we gain either Whilkens, or Whichensborgh--put we may suppose, by way of question, as if those who imposed the name, struck with the extreme antiquity of the place, had expressed in it an interrogation, To whom did this fortress belong?'--Or, it might be Whackens-burgh, from the Saxon Whacken, to strike with the hand, as doubtless the skirmishes near a place of such apparent consequence must have legitimated such a derivation," [...] etc. etc. etc.|$|E

The characteristic ratios of IR bands (RIR) showed aromatization of the organic matter in the two composts, higher in the DPGC compost parallel with an advanced maturation. The TGA/DTA analysis showed that the OM transformations were less extensive in DPW compost. The values of the RTGA ratios gave the same end value for both composts, indicating that this index does not correctly assess biological stability.

For the DPCG mixture, the HA formed had a structure richer in peptides and carboxylic compounds than DPW compost, which was richer in aliphatic compounds.

The IR absorption ratios did not show the same patterns of change during the gradual degradation of substrate occurring on composting. Underlying the variations specific to each compost was a different degree of humification. It was higher for the DPCG mixture.

A strong female bias is shown (2. 8 : 1 female to male) and the adult females show a clumped distribution. No moth was observed to move more than 349 metres, with females in particular crawling rather than flying; males are more active but rarely fly at wind speeds above 2. 8 m/s. Adult moths appear able to tolerate both high daytime temperatures (over 30 °C) at high salinity levels on the exposed shingle near the sea.   They are associated with the coarser element of sand and shingle present on Loe Bar, perhaps because the larvae can move more easily through the larger sand particles. Sandhill Rustic moths prefer the more vigorous Elytrigia juncea plants that occur near the sea; these plants have a large underground biomass (suitable for the larvae which spend 60 % of their time feeding underground) and grow in large clumps joined together by extensive rhizomes along which the larvae can move. The conservation of Sandhill Rustics on Loe Bar depends in the medium term on controlling visitor pressure, maintaining habitat quality and increasing habitat size.   In the longer term, Sandhill Rustics here are threatened by climate change, in particular sea level rise and an increased number of storm events.

40|$|When sown {{correctly}} at {{the right}} time, in the right position within the rotation, cover crops retain nutrients, conserve water, prevent soil erosion, improve soil fertility and quality, and suppress weeds. Growing cover crops is recognized as a climate-smart agricultural practice. Practical recommendation Where to position and when to time cover crops in the rotation? •	Grow cover crops in the 1 st and 2 nd year after ploughing of clover-grass to avoid nitrogen losses. •	Grow nitrogen fixing cover crops on soils with low fertility. •	Sow cover crops into or immediately after the main crop. In row crops, sow the cover crop {{in combination with the}} last hoeing. If the harvest of the main crop is rather early, sow the cover crop after harvest. •	The earlier a cover crop is sown in August, less nitrogen is lost. Each day of delay in sowing a cruciferous cover crop in August results in loss of about 2 kg of N per ha. •	Do not sow cruciferous cover crops into main crops shortly before the harvest, as weed competition may be too high for successful establishment of the cover crop. •	Cover crops sown in spring usually establish well and safely. For spring-sown cover crops use clover mix rather than ryegrass to satisfy nitrogen needs. •	On sandy soils with irrigation, undersow spring crops with wide row distances after the main crop has developed 1 - 2 nodes high to allow hoeing of the main crop in early stages. •	In winter crops, sow cover crops (clover mix rather than ryegrass) in spring as early as possible. •	Use cover crops after application of large amounts of solid manure, as it helps to retain the nitrogen. •	In lupines or broad beans, undersow a cover crop followed by a spring crop the next year. If a winter crop is chosen instead, perennial weeds might flourish. Cover crops and weed control •	Problems with creeping thistle, sow-thistle and coltsfoot do not rule out cover crops: Sow the cover crop immedia¬tely after an early harvest and ploughing. Repeat ploughing in spring before sowing a spring crop. •	To reduce <b>couch-grass,</b> mechanical treatment in autumn is more efficient than growing a cover crop...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{content of}} total lipids and fatty-acid methyl esters (FAMEs) {{identified}} by GC MS analysis was followed during composting of date palm waste (DPW) alone or mixed with <b>couch-grass</b> clippings (DPGC). The DPGC compost contained more fats and FAMEs (FAs) {{than did the}} DPW compost. Total lipid content decreased during both composting processes with an increase {{towards the end of}} DPW composting. The initial fatty acid composition in both composts showed that the DPGC mixture was richer in microbial biomass than the DPW compost. The lignocellulose nature of the date palm substrate probably obstructed the proliferation and development of a broad category of microbial biomass. The appearance of a series of odd-numbered carbon and branched FAMEs was recorded only toward the end of DPW composting. This confirms the low level of biodegradation of date palm substrate rich in substrates that presented difficult access to micro-organisms, as confirmed by a slower degradation. DPW compost required longer to reach similar maturity to DPGC that of the mixture. Calculating the relationship between the various bacterial groups showed that bacteria strongly prevailed over fungi during both DPW and DPGC composting. The follow-up of these ratios in both composts showed that the stabilization phase was not complete in DPGC compost, but that it reached a very advanced stage during DPGC composting after the 8 -month trial. An increase in G(+) /G(-) and G(+) /fungus ratios toward the end of DPW composting indicated that composting had just started in the DPW. The variations in the levels of the different steroid compounds identified in the two composts showed that dehydration was stronger in the DPGC mixture than in DPW. An increase of the level of stigmastanol acetate (24 -ethylcholestanol), methyl cholestadiene (campestadienes), and cholestanol acetate (cholestanol) in DPGC compost suggests the stimulation of microbial organisms and/or micro-fauna capable of performing the hydrogenation of the corresponding sterols. This microbial activity fluctuated during DPW composting following the bioavailability of substrate that was steadily degraded. The appearance of stigmastadienone toward the end of DPW composting confirmed that composting had just started after the full 8 months...|$|E

Here, it is demonstrated that 28 isolates of the closely related species R. agropyri (on <b>couch-grass)</b> and R. secalis (on rye and triticale), collected from Europe, were also either of MAT 1 - 1 or MAT 1 - 2 genotype and that the distribution of mating types did not deviate significantly from a 1 : 1 ratio. Evidence is then provided for MAT 1 - 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 - 1 gene expression during mycelial growth for all three species. By contrast, 27 isolates of the more distantly related R. orthosporum (on cocksfoot) and R. lolii (on Italian and perennial ryegrasses) from Europe were exclusively of the MAT 1 - 1 genotype, and expression of the MAT 1 - 1 - 1 gene could not be detected during mycelial growth. These data suggest that cryptic sexual cycles are more likely to exist for R. commune, R. agropyri and R. secalis than for either R. orthosporum or R. lolii. A phylogenetic analysis of partial MAT 1 - 1 idiomorph sequences resolved these five species into two distinct groups (R. commune, R. agropyri and R. secalis versus R. orthosporum and R. lolii) but provided only limited resolution within each grou...|$|E
40|$|Summary 	Organic farming means {{a chance}} for plants to reveal their abilities. We offer better {{conditions}} to the associated plants for their growth and reproduction by no use of chemical herbicides and by using alternative growing methods. 	Organic agrophytocoenoses are significant by higher species richness and cover. There can be found some of endangered species among the weeds, which may be more successful in organic system, therfore the organic type of farming may serve for their protection. The most successful weed species endanger cultural crops on both organic and conventional fields. They become more dangerous {{without the possibility of}} herbicide application. Thanks to this, the strategy of each plant species is more important. That is why the question of weed suppression in organic farming is highly important and frequently asked. 	The aim of this thesis is to analyse weed flora on organic cereals fields and to point out possible factors influencing them. Braun-Blanquet scale of dominance and abundance has been used for the assessment of weed communities. Several different localities were investigated in Benešov district. Influence of winter cereals, spring cereals, previous crop and the tillage system have been assessed. 	Some of the most important weed species were: annual winter weed species in winter cereals, perennials and few annual spring species in spring cereals. Annual weeds were typical for spring cereals sown two years on a one plot, perennials were associated with spring cereals sown after fodder crops. -There were not found any evident differences in weed spectrum in winter cereals based on previous crop. Agrophytocoenosis on fields with conventional and reduced tillage differed. Wider spectrum of perennial species was typical for fields where reduced tillage was applied, differences in annual weed spectrum were also found. Typical species for conventional tillage were for example: marsh woundwort, common <b>couch-grass</b> and common poppy, while, creeping thistle, creeping buttercup, perennial sow-thistle, mugwort, corn chamomile, loose silky-bent and some others were often found on fields where reduced tillage were used. 	The results of the analysis in this thesis mostly lead to the same description of weeds as in literature, but few of the results are different. Thanks to statistically decisive results, it is apparent, how a farmer can affect the plant associations over a long period. Key words: organic farming, weeds, agrophytocoenosis, cereals, weed control, features(characteristic) of weeds...|$|E
40|$|Background. Allergen-specific {{immunotherapy}} as elimination procedures is {{the only}} method of treatment and prevention of allergic disorders formation and exacerbation of clinical symptoms. One of the approaches to molecular diagnosis is choice of allergen for allergen-specific immunotherapy (ASIT). The purpose of our {{study was to identify}} possible reasons of failure of ASIT with pollen allergens (predominantly weeds) in children with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and/or bronchial asthma based on studying hypersensitivity to the allergens, analysis of anamnestic data. Materials and methods. Allergy skin prick tests were conducted to 192 children (middle age 9. 8 ± 2. 7 years) with the seasonal symptoms of rhinitis and/or bronchial asthma according to standard methodology with pollen allergens of Immunolog Ltd (Vinnytsia). We evaluated positive results as 5 mm and higher diameter of papula/hyperemia. The anamnestic survey was carried out in 52 patients by means of the questionnaire that contained questions about cross allergy (pollen-food, oral allergy syndrome), concomitant pathology of upper respiratory tract and effectiveness of АSІТ, which is elaborated by us. Results. The skin prick tests show that in 192 patients, who have hay fever, ragweed, sunflower sensibilization predominates (56 and 58 %, correspondingly). About 10 – 20 % of children are sensitive to cereals (ryegrass, fescue). To the allergens of poplar, acacia, <b>couch-grass,</b> oak, mint, nettle, walnut, the positive reactions of prick tests were observed in 3 – 7 children, that is 1. 5 – 3. 6 %. According to our results, 23 % of patients had sensibilization to 5 and more pollen allergens. 52 % of children had concomitant food allergy, 15 % of patients have reactions of the lips, oral cavity when using certain products, mostly tomatoes, nuts, seeds (they were diagnosed oral allergy syndrome). Also, one third of children have varying degrees of adenoid hypertrophy, tonsils hypertrophy, allergic rhinitis is complicated by sinusitis in 13 % of cases. Children received 3 to 4 courses of preseason subcutaneous ASIT (December to May) according to classic scheme. The vast majority of children got mixed extracts of ragweed, cyclachaena, mugwort, quinoa, sunflower (90 %). One allergen (ragweed or sunflower) has been used only in 6 children (10 %). We detected that 1 / 5 children had no clinical effect, the symptoms of hay fever were not diminished or changed their temporal frames. 82 % of patients without effect of ASIT had cross plant-food allergy (oral allergy syndrome). Conclusion. Before the beginning of АSІТ in children with hay fever, the doctor must define a high-risk group in relation to its possible ineffectiveness. We suggest taking into account children with sensitization to 4 and more pollen allergens, with the presence of oral allergic syndrome, concomitant pathology of ENT organs, in particular, adenoid hypertrophy, chronic sinusitis. Such children are recommended to make a profile of molecular allergy diagnostics to determine the specific immunoglobulines Е to the major and minor allergens. Component resolved molecular allergy diagnostics maybe also helpful in estimation the risk of systemic (anaphylactic) reactions in children with cross reactivity (pollen-food allergy) and in improvement of preventive measures, in particular, in patients with oral allergy syndrome...|$|E
