5|$|Following {{the removal}} of the Beardmore Crane in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007, there are now four giant <b>cantilever</b> <b>cranes</b> on the River Clyde. The others are at Stobcross (Finnieston Crane), Scotstoun (Barclay Curle Crane) and Greenock (James Watt Dock Crane).

50|$|The {{design of}} Hammerkran evolved first in Germany {{around the turn}} of the 19th century and was adopted and {{developed}} for use in British shipyards to support the battleship construction program from 1904 to 1914. The ability of the hammerhead crane to lift heavy weights was useful for installing large pieces of battleships such as armour plate and gun barrels. Giant cantilever cranes were also installed in naval shipyards in Japan and in the United States. The British government also installed a giant <b>cantilever</b> <b>crane</b> at the Singapore Naval Base (1938) and later a copy of the crane was installed at Garden Island Naval Dockyard in Sydney (1951). These cranes provided repair support for the battle fleet operating far from Great Britain.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "hammerhead", or giant <b>cantilever,</b> <b>crane</b> is a fixed-jib crane {{consisting}} of a steel-braced tower on which revolves a large, horizontal, double cantilever; the forward part of this cantilever or jib carries the lifting trolley, the jib is extended backwards in order to form a support for the machinery and counterbalancing weight. In addition to the motions of lifting and revolving, there is provided a so-called [...] "racking" [...] motion, by which the lifting trolley, with the load suspended, can be moved in and out along the jib without altering {{the level of the}} load. Such horizontal movement of the load is a marked feature of later crane design. These cranes are generally constructed in large sizes and can weigh up to 350 tons.|$|E

In the 1970s the northern end of No. 5 Basin was converted to serve as a new Fleet Maintenance Base, to be built alongside a Submarine Refit Complex for nuclear submarines; an 80-ton <b>cantilever</b> <b>crane,</b> {{one of the largest in}} western Europe, was installed to lift nuclear cores from submarines in newly-built adjacent dry docks.|$|E
