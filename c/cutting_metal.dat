40|$|AbstractEnd Milling {{operations}} {{have been developed}} in response to productivity, quality and economical cost concerns. Significant advancements in controls and machining technologies have recently come together to enable the wide spread use of this operation. The main objective of this work {{is to develop a}} new procedure for predicting the <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> forces and coefficients during machining. The new technique proposed in this paper was found to be more flexible and easier to use than other available techniques. Experimental validation of the proposed procedure was carried out with the help of regression analysis using MINITAB- 16 software. The present paper discusses a response surface methodological approach for prediction of <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> coefficients in an end-milling operation of an Aluminum alloy. In this work, an approach was used to develop mathematical model based on RSM design for predicting the <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> forces and coefficients in an end milling operation. Different machining conditions like cutting speed, feed rate, and axial depth of cut are considered. The first order cutting force equations are developed using the response surface methodology (RSM) to study the effect of input <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate and axial depth of cut at 50 % radial immersion on <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> forces and It has been observed the decrease of cutting speed along with the increase in the feed rate, axial depths of cut results in higher <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> forces. The differences between experimental and <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> forces obtained from the mathematical modeling using regression analysis at different feed rate, spindle speed, depth of cuts are presented. From the experimental results, <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> coefficients were determined with and without the influence of magneto rheological damping to the end milling tool. It has been observed from the experimental data that the <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> forces are less when compared to the forces obtained without the application of the magneto-rheological damper. The cutting parameter which affects the cutting force and their interaction are investigated in this study with and without the effect of Magneto-rheological damping. The regression models in this study are believed to produce values for <b>metal</b> <b>cutting</b> coefficients close to readings recorded experimentally with a 95 % confident level...|$|R
