5|$|Natural rubies are <b>corundum</b> (aluminum oxide) {{crystals}} {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of <b>corundum</b> gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial <b>corundum</b> crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} reduced oxides of {{titanium}} are known. Ti3O5, {{described as a}} Ti(IV)-Ti(III) species, is a purple semiconductor produced by reduction of TiO2 with hydrogen at high temperatures,O5 Powder|journal=Journal of Inorganic Materials|date=26 June 2013|volume=28|issue=4|pages=425–430|doi=10.3724/SP.J.1077.2013.12309|language=Chinese}} and is used industrially when surfaces need to be vapour-coated with titanium dioxide: it evaporates as pure TiO, whereas TiO2 evaporates as a mixture of oxides and deposits coatings with variable refractive index. Also known is Ti2O3, with the <b>corundum</b> structure, and TiO, with the rock salt structure, although often nonstoichiometric.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in <b>corundum</b> deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide saw blades that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains <b>corundum.</b> The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic mounted points: {{granular}} sand (usually <b>corundum,</b> white jade, chrome <b>corundum,</b> silicon carbide) made of ceramic binder sintering, the central supplemented by metal handle. Mainly grinding {{all kinds of}} metal, for {{the diameter of the}} inner wall of the grinding, mold correction.|$|E
25|$|Sapphire {{is one of}} the two gem-varieties of <b>corundum,</b> {{the other}} being ruby (defined as <b>corundum</b> in a shade of red). Although blue is the best-known {{sapphire}} color, they occur in other colors, including gray and black, and they can be colorless. A pinkish orange variety of sapphire is called padparadscha.|$|E
25|$|<b>Corundum</b> is {{the most}} common {{naturally}} occurring crystalline form of aluminium oxide. Rubies and sapphires are gem-quality forms of <b>corundum,</b> which owe their characteristic colors to trace impurities. Rubies are given their characteristic deep red color and their laser qualities by traces of chromium. Sapphires come in different colors given by various other impurities, such as iron and titanium.|$|E
25|$|Rubies have a {{hardness}} of 9.0 on the Mohs {{scale of}} mineral hardness. Among the natural gems only moissanite and diamond are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling {{somewhere in between}} <b>corundum</b> (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure <b>corundum</b> are α-alumina, the most stable form of Al2O3, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminum ion to join the regular octahedral group of six nearby O2− ions; in pure <b>corundum</b> this leaves all of the aluminum ions with a very stable configuration of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of {{crystalline}} aluminium oxide is known as <b>corundum,</b> which is the thermodynamically stable form. The oxygen ions nearly form a hexagonal close-packed structure with the aluminium ions filling two-thirds of the octahedral interstices. Each Al3+ center is octahedral. In terms of its crystallography, <b>corundum</b> adopts a trigonal Bravais lattice with a space group of R-3c (number 167 in the International Tables). The primitive cell contains two formula units of aluminium oxide.|$|E
25|$|Grinding wheels with diamond or CBN grains {{are called}} superabrasives. Grinding wheels with {{aluminum}} oxide (<b>corundum),</b> silicon carbide, or ceramic grains are called conventional abrasives.|$|E
25|$|Rubies are <b>corundum</b> {{which contain}} {{chromium}} impurities that absorb yellow-green light {{and result in}} deeper ruby red color with increasing content. Purple sapphires contain trace amounts of vanadium and {{come in a variety}} of shades. <b>Corundum</b> that contains ~0.01% of titanium is colorless. If trace amounts of iron are present, a very pale yellow to green color may be seen. However, if both titanium and iron impurities are present together, and in the correct valence states, the result is a deep-blue color.|$|E
25|$|Padparadscha is a delicate, {{light to}} medium toned, pink-orange to orange-pink hued <b>corundum,</b> {{originally}} found in Sri Lanka, but {{also found in}} deposits in Vietnam and parts of East Africa. Padparadscha sapphires are rare; the rarest {{of all is the}} totally natural variety, with no sign of artificial treatment.|$|E
25|$|Intervalence charge {{transfer}} {{is a process}} that produces a strong colored appearance at a low percentage of impurity. While at least 1% chromium must be present in <b>corundum</b> before the deep red ruby color is seen, sapphire blue is apparent with the presence of only 0.01% of titanium and iron.|$|E
25|$|It {{typically}} {{occurs as}} an alteration product at the contact between felsic and mafic or ultramafic rocks such as pyroxenites and dunites. It also occurs in carbonatites and metamorphosed magnesium rich limestone. Associated mineral phases include: <b>corundum,</b> apatite, serpentine and talc. It occurs interlayered with chlorite, biotite and phlogopite.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation in {{the form}} of liquid (rain) or solid (snow) varies in {{composition}} depending on atmospheric temperature, pressure, composition, and altitude. Hot atmospheres could have iron rain, molten-glass rain, and rain made from rocky minerals such as enstatite, <b>corundum,</b> spinel, and wollastonite. Deep in the atmospheres of gas giants, it could rain diamonds and helium containing dissolved neon.|$|E
25|$|The product {{aluminium}} oxide {{tends to be}} multi-phase, i.e., consisting of several phases of {{aluminium oxide}} rather than solely <b>corundum.</b> The production process can therefore be optimized to produce a tailored product. The type of phases present affects, for example, the solubility and pore structure of the aluminium oxide product which, in turn, affects the cost of aluminium production and pollution control.|$|E
25|$|Kalahandi {{became a}} princely state under British and known as Karonda Mandal. Maharaja Pratap Keshari Deo, the Ex-Maharaja of Kalahandi, {{in one of}} his {{articles}} expressed his view that the historical significance of naming Kalahandi as Karunda Mandala is based on the availability of <b>Corundum</b> in this region. Manikeswari (the goddess of Manikya), the clan deity of the Naga kings of Kalahandi may have also necessitated the adoption of the name.|$|E
25|$|Geological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitution—the {{hitherto}} accepted {{criteria for}} the discrimination of rock species—were relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted {{in terms of the}} rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, <b>corundum,</b> and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.|$|E
25|$|The founders {{original}} {{plan was to}} sell the mineral <b>corundum</b> to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was {{on the shore of}} Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.|$|E
25|$|Color: In the {{evaluation}} of colored gemstones, color {{is the most important}} factor. Color divides into three components: hue, saturation and tone. Hue refers to color as we normally use the term. Transparent gemstones occur in the pure spectral hues of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet. In nature, there are rarely pure hues, so when speaking of the hue of a gemstone, we speak of primary and secondary and sometimes tertiary hues. Ruby is defined to be red. All other hues of the gem species <b>corundum</b> are called sapphire. Ruby may exhibit a range of secondary hues, including orange, purple, violet, and pink.|$|E
25|$|Colour is {{the most}} obvious {{property}} of a mineral, but it is often non-diagnostic. It is caused by electromagnetic radiation interacting with electrons (except {{in the case of}} incandescence, which does not apply to minerals). Two broad classes of elements (idiochromatic and allochromatic) are defined with regards to their contribution to a mineral's colour: Idiochromatic elements are essential to a mineral's composition; their contribution to a mineral's colour is diagnostic. Examples of such minerals are malachite (green) and azurite (blue). In contrast, allochromatic elements in minerals are present in trace amounts as impurities. An example of such a mineral would be the ruby and sapphire varieties of the mineral <b>corundum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{sapphire}} {{deposits of}} Kashmir are still {{well known in}} the gem industry, {{despite the fact that the}} peak production from this area mostly took place in a relatively short period at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Kashmir-origin contributes meaningfully to the value of a sapphire, and most <b>corundum</b> of Kashmir origin can be readily identified by its characteristic silky appearance and exceptional hue. At present, the world record price-per-carat for sapphire at auction was achieved by a sapphire from Kashmir in a ring, which sold in October 2015 for approximately US$242,000 per carat (HK$52,280,000 in total, including buyer's premium, or more than US$6.74 million).|$|E
25|$|Despite some {{improvements}} in the method, the Verneuil process remains virtually unchanged to this day, while maintaining a leading position {{in the manufacture of}} synthetic <b>corundum</b> and spinel gemstones. Its most significant setback came in 1917, when Jan Czochralski introduced the Czochralski process, which has found numerous applications in the semiconductor industry, where a much higher quality of crystals is required than the Verneuil process can produce. Other alternatives to the process emerged in 1957, when Bell Labs introduced the hydrothermal process, and in 1958, when Carroll Chatham introduced the flux method. In 1989 Larry P Kelley of ICT, Inc. also developed a variant of the Czochralski process where natural ruby is used as the 'feed' material.|$|E
25|$|Because the ammolite {{layer is}} usually mere {{fractions}} of a millimeter in thickness, most ammolite gems {{are in fact}} composite stones: these usually {{take the form of}} two-part doublets, with the ammolite layer adhered to a dark backing material. This is usually the matrix or mother rock from which the ammolite was quarried; black onyx or glass could also be used as backing. In composites where the ammolite layer is exceptionally thin, a third component is used: this constitutes a triplet, with a durable and transparent convex topping piece. This cap may be either synthetic spinel, synthetic <b>corundum,</b> synthetic quartz, or in lower-end productions, glass. The convex cap acts as a lens and has the effect of enhancing the ammolite's iridescent display.|$|E
25|$|Commercially {{valuable}} {{minerals and}} rocks {{are referred to}} as industrial minerals. For example, muscovite, a white mica, can be used for windows (sometimes referred to as isinglass), as a filler, or as an insulator. Ores are minerals that have a high concentration of a certain element, typically a metal. Examples are cinnabar (HgS), an ore of mercury, sphalerite (ZnS), an ore of zinc, or cassiterite (SnO2), an ore of tin. Gems are minerals with an ornamental value, and are distinguished from non-gems by their beauty, durability, and usually, rarity. There are about 20 mineral species that qualify as gem minerals, which constitute about 35 of the most common gemstones. Gem minerals are often present in several varieties, and so one mineral can account for several different gemstones; for example, ruby and sapphire are both <b>corundum,</b> Al2O3.|$|E
25|$|The first {{crystalline}} artificial diamond simulants were synthetic white sapphire (Al2O3, pure <b>corundum)</b> and spinel (MgO·Al2O3, pure magnesium aluminium oxide). Both {{have been}} synthesized {{in large quantities}} since {{the first decade of}} the 20th century via the Verneuil or flame-fusion process, although spinel was not in wide use until the 1920s. The Verneuil process involves an inverted oxyhydrogen blowpipe, with purified feed powder mixed with oxygen that is carefully fed through the blowpipe. The feed powder falls through the oxy-hydrogen flame, melts, and lands on a rotating and slowly descending pedestal below. The height of the pedestal is constantly adjusted to keep its top at the optimal position below the flame, and over a number of hours the molten powder cools and crystallizes to form a single pedunculated pear or boule crystal. The process is an economical one, with crystals of up to 9 centimeters (3.5nbsp&inches) in diameter grown. Boules grown via the modern Czochralski process may weigh several kilograms.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to simple body colour, minerals can have various other distinctive optical properties, such as play of colours, asterism, chatoyancy, iridescence, tarnish, and pleochroism. Several of these properties involve variability in colour. Play of colour, {{such as in}} opal, results in the sample reflecting different colours as it is turned, while pleochroism describes the change in colour as light passes through a mineral in a different orientation. Iridescence is a variety of the play of colours where light scatters off a coating {{on the surface of}} crystal, cleavage planes, or off layers having minor gradations in chemistry. In contrast, the play of colours in opal is caused by light refracting from ordered microscopic silica spheres within its physical structure. Chatoyancy ("cat's eye") is the wavy banding of colour that is observed as the sample is rotated; asterism, a variety of chatoyancy, gives the appearance of a star on the mineral grain. The latter property is particularly common in gem-quality <b>corundum.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the solidification of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, <b>corundum,</b> cristobalite and coesite.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperatures}} on the illuminated side of the planet, and the likelihood that all surface volatiles have been depleted, silicate rock vaporization may have produced a tenuous atmosphere (with a pressure approaching 1 Pa or 10−2 mbar at 2500 K) consisting predominantly of sodium, O2, O and silicon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of potassium and other metals. Magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), silicon (Si), and iron (Fe) may rain out from such an atmosphere on the planet's daylight side {{in the form of}} particles of minerals, such as enstatite, <b>corundum</b> and spinel, wollastonite, silica, and iron (II) oxide, that would condense at altitudes below 10km. Titanium (Ti) may be depleted (and possibly iron similarly) by being transported towards the night side before condensing as perovskite and geikelite. Sodium (and to a lesser extent, potassium), being more volatile, would be less subject to condensation into clouds, and would dominate the outer layers of the atmosphere. Observations carried out with the UVES spectrograph on COROT-7b in and out of transit, searching for emission and absorption lines originating in the exosphere of the planet, failed to detect any significative feature. Spectral lines of calcium (Ca I, Ca II) and sodium (Na), expected for a Mercury-like planet, are either absent or below detection limits, and even emission lines expected from volcanic activity, due to tidal forces exerted by the gravity of the nearby star, were not found. The lack of detections is in agreement with the previously cited theoretical work, which points to a cloudless atmosphere made of rocky vapours with a very low pressure. From the data available, scientists can only infer that COROT-7b does not resemble any of the rocky planets of the Solar System.|$|E
500|$|Sapphires are a color {{variety of}} <b>corundum,</b> a {{crystalline}} form of aluminium oxide (...) [...] <b>Corundum</b> {{is one of}} the hardest minerals, rating9 on the Mohs scale. <b>Corundum</b> gems of most colors are called sapphires, except for red ones, which are called rubies. The term [...] "Yogo sapphire" [...] refers only to sapphires from the Yogo Gulch. [...] The cornflower blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of iron and titanium. Yogo sapphires are unique in that they are free of cavities and inclusions, have high uniform clarity, lack color zoning, and do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep. Unlike Asian sapphires, they maintain their brilliance in artificial light. Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters: since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an igneous bedrock rather than in sedimentary alluvial deposits where most other sapphires are located, they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape, making cutting much easier, as does their lack of inclusions, color zoning, or cloudiness. Yogos also exhibit a triangular pattern on the basal plane of the flattened crystals, with thin rhombohedral crystal faces, a feature absent in sapphires from other parts of Montana.|$|E
500|$|Chromium(III) {{hydroxide}} (Cr(OH)3) is amphoteric, dissolving in acidic {{solutions to}} form 3+, and in basic solutions to form [...] It is dehydrated by heating {{to form the}} green chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3), a stable oxide with a crystal structure identical to that of <b>corundum.</b>|$|E
500|$|Acheson {{patented}} {{the method}} for making silicon carbide powder on February 28, 1893. Acheson also developed the electric batch furnace by which SiC is still made today and formed the Carborundum Company to manufacture bulk SiC, initially {{for use as}} an abrasive. In 1900 the company settled with the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company when a judge's decision gave [...] "priority broadly" [...] to its founders [...] "for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method". It is said that Acheson was trying to dissolve carbon in molten <b>corundum</b> (alumina) and discovered the presence of hard, blue-black crystals which he {{believed to be a}} compound of carbon and corundum: hence carborundum. It may be that he named the material [...] "carborundum" [...] by analogy to <b>corundum,</b> which is another very hard substance (9 on the Mohs scale).|$|E
500|$|They {{eventually}} narrowed {{their search}} to {{a mixture of}} Illinois-sourced silica and the abrasive substance <b>corundum</b> or aloxite (a form of aluminum oxide, Al2O3), founding William A. Spinks & Company with a factory in Chicago after securing a patent on March 9, 1897. [...] Spinks later left the company as an active party, but it retained his name and was subsequently run by Hoskins, and later by Hoskins's cousin Edmund F. Hoskin, after Hoskins {{moved on to other}} projects.|$|E
500|$|A {{large number}} of chromium(III) {{compounds}} are known. Chromium(III) {{can be obtained by}} dissolving elemental chromium in acids like hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The [...] ion has a similar radius (63pm) to [...] (radius 50pm), and they can replace each other in some compounds, such as in chrome alum and alum. When a trace amount of [...] replaces [...] in <b>corundum</b> (aluminium oxide, Al2O3), pink sapphire or red-colored ruby is formed, depending on the amount of chromium.|$|E
500|$|Oxygen {{is present}} in the {{atmosphere}} in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide (...) [...] The Earth's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon (silica , as found in granite and quartz), aluminium (aluminium oxide , in bauxite and <b>corundum),</b> iron (iron(III) oxide , in hematite and rust), and calcium carbonate (in limestone). The rest of the Earth's crust is also made of oxygen compounds, in particular various complex silicates (in silicate minerals). The Earth's mantle, of much larger mass than the crust, is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.|$|E
500|$|Wide-scale {{production}} is credited to Edward Goodrich Acheson in 1890. Acheson was [...] attempting to prepare artificial diamonds when he heated {{a mixture of}} clay (aluminium silicate) and powdered coke (carbon) in an iron bowl. [...] He called the blue crystals that formed carborundum, believing {{it to be a}} new compound of carbon and aluminium, similar to <b>corundum.</b> [...] In 1893, Ferdinand Henri Moissan discovered the very rare naturally occurring SiC mineral while examining rock samples found in the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona. [...] The mineral was named moissanite in his honor. [...] Moissan also synthesized SiC by several routes, including dissolution of carbon in molten silicon, melting a mixture of calcium carbide and silica, and by reducing silica with carbon in an electric furnace.|$|E
