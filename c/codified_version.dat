25|$|The {{introduction}} and translation of Western legal texts into Chinese {{is believed to}} have been started under the auspices of Lin Zexu in 1839. More systematic introduction of Western law together with other Western sciences started with the establishment of Tongwen Guan in 1862. The major efforts in translation of Western law that continued until the 1920s prepared the building blocks for modern Chinese legal language and Chinese law. Legal translation was very important from 1896 to 1936 during which period the Chinese absorbed and <b>codified</b> their <b>version</b> of Western laws. These efforts were assisted by the medium of the Japanese legal language and law developed in Japan during the Meiji period which involved in large part Japanese translation of European Continental laws.|$|R

Legal Researchers often use the more timely, commercially published United States Code Annotated (USCA) or the United States Code Service (USCS). The USCA is available on Westlaw while the USCS is available on Lexis. They are called annotated codes because they include summaries of cases which interpret the meaning of the statute.

40|$|The seismic {{design of}} moment {{resisting}} steel frames, classically, {{is carried out}} by adopting full strength joints. In this approach, the dissipation of the seismic input energy is obtained relying on the plastic hinges developed at beam ends and {{at the base of}} columns preventing from plasticization the elements composing the connections. Currently, the design of full strength joints can be led in the framework of Eurocode 8, which proposes to design joints adequately overstrengthened with respect to the flexural resistance of the connected beam/column. This overstrength depends on two factors: the first one accounting for the strain-hardening of the steel composing the beam/column, the second one depending on the materials’ random variability. In this work, the attention is focused on the evaluation of the accuracy of the code approach for the case of exposed column base plate joints. In order to reach this goal four steps are developed. First, a wide set of full strength column base joints is designed according to the component method <b>codified</b> in last <b>version</b> of EC 3. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation accounting for the statistical distribution of the material composing the elements of the base plate (i. e. concrete, steel of plate, steel of anchors, steel of column) is set up and the accuracy of the approach provided by Eurocode 8 is analyzed. Finally, a criterion accounting for both the material random variability and the overstrength of the connected member due to the strain hardening is proposed and its accuracy is evaluated on the base of the collected statistical data...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the law {{relating to}} the standard of care expected of doctors {{in the areas of}} diagnosis and treatment in Malaysia. The analysis does not deal with issues concerning disclosure of risk. The central argument in this thesis is that the law for determining the standard of care of doctors in the areas of diagnosis and treatment in Malaysia is ambiguous and uncertain, and that legislation is the most effective reform method to resolve these problems. A clear and predictable legal framework is recommended for legislative enactment in Malaysia. One of the main objectives of this proposed legal framework is {{to strike a balance between}} the interests of defendant doctors and that of injured patients in medical negligence litigation concerning issues of diagnosis and treatment. This thesis traces the historical development of the law in Malaysia, from the application of the original English Bolam test in the 1960 s to the current legal position as decided by the highest Malaysian court decision in Foo Fio Na v Dr Soo Fook Mun (2007) 1 MLJ 593. It takes a cross-jurisdictional approach to examine the corresponding legal development in the United Kingdom, Singapore and the Australian states. A consistent trend in these jurisdictions is the adoption of the original Bolam test with modifications, albeit in different forms. It is argued that the decision in Foo Fio Na was a lost opportunity for the highest Malaysian court to give a definitive statement for determining the standard of care in the areas of medical diagnosis and treatment. The basis for this argument is the ambiguity in Foo Fio Na on the issue of negligent treatment and the conflicting interpretations of this decision by academic scholars and judges in subsequent Malaysian lower court cases. It is proposed that Malaysia should <b>codify</b> the qualified <b>version</b> of the Bolam test in legislation as a means of resolving the uncertainty and ambiguity in the current state of the law. It is also suggested that the proposed legislation should implement the procedural rules on the use of expert witnesses similar to those under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (Qld), although with slight modifications. The proposed procedural framework requires the appointment of a single agreed or a single court-appointed expert prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. Litigants may also appoint an additional agreed or court-appointed expert or experts after legal proceedings have started. Under the proposal, the courts are also given the authority to allow litigants to engage their own medical experts provided that certain conditions are satisfied. These recommendations aim to save costs, facilitate a speedy resolution of medical disputes and provide flexibility in the adjudication of the standard of care in medical diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
5000|$|No [...] "official" [...] <b>codified</b> <b>version</b> of {{the rules}} of pong exist, and many [...] "house rules" [...] {{variations}} exist. In general terms, players start by assembling cups of beer or other obstacles onto either side of a pong table and placing a median {{at the center of the}} table. Like table tennis, pong requires one side to serve the ball and the other side to attempt to return the ball, thus beginning a rally. Both the serve and the intra-game volleys generally must propel in an arch trajectory. Players may not return the ball until it has struck their own side, objects on their side, or the floor. Following the serve, players attempt to hit or sink in the opponents cups, whereby the opponent will lose one or more points. Once all points for a cup or obstacle have been taken away, the object is removed. The game is won when all objects have been removed from the opponents side.|$|E
5000|$|There is some {{evidence}} of indigenous Australian forms of football being played in Australia, before the European arrival. Some of these involved kick and catch games.

50|$|In {{its second}} ice skating season, the Sydney Glaciarium {{management}} drew plans to facilitate ice hockey matches between an Australian team selected from ice skating patrons and teams {{drawn from the}} crew of various visiting fleet of American warships, known by the name Great White Fleet. Sydney was the first stop made by the fleet to Australia and invitations to the proposed hockey match {{were sent to the}} officers and petty officers of each warship, planning to host the match on the evening of their arrival on 20 August 1908. The first match that was arranged ended up being scheduled for the evening of 26 August 1907 at the Sydney Glaciarium. Though the American team had not been on skates for 3 years, they still managed to win the game 5 - 1 against the Australian team formed from Sydney Glaciarium patrons. The Australian team was first to score but the Americans would tie up the game in the first half. In the second half, the Americans would go on to score 4 more goals. An important aspect to this game was that the American players were using much larger hockey sticks than the local Australian team.The fleet would visit Melbourne afterwards where they would play ice hockey against a local team, presumably again, using the larger ice hockey sticks and a puck made from a disc of wood. Due to the Americans being short of 2 players, each team played with only 5 men per side but this would play an important part to establishing the <b>codified</b> <b>version</b> of ice hockey in Australia rather than the Australian variant played before.|$|E
