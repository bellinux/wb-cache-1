40|$|Antenna array pattern nulling is {{desirable}} {{in order to}} suppress the interfering signals. But in large antenna arrays, {{there is always a}} possibility of failure of some elements, which may degrade the radiation pattern with an increase in side lobe level (SLL) and removal of the nulls from desired position. In this paper a correction procedure is introduced based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which maintains the nulling performance of the failed antenna array. Considering the faulty elements as nonradiating elements, PSO reoptimizes the weights of the remaining radiating elements to reshape the pattern. Simulation results for a <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>array</b> with imposed single, multiple, and broad nulls with failed antenna array are presented...|$|E

In particular, the Dolph-Chebyshev and binomial methods are used, so as to improve the directivity of the array and to reduce {{the level of the}} secondary lobes by adjusting the geometrical and electric parameters of the array. The radiation patterns, the directivity, and the array factors of the uniform and the non-uniform methods are presented. It is shown that the <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>arrays</b> have better directivity than binomial arrays for the same number of elements and separation distance, while binomial arrays have very low side lobes compared with Chebyshev and uniform excitation arrays.

40|$|The {{objective}} in array design is {{the rejection of}} bands of wavelengths which contain noise. In marine exploration, where the coupling between receiver element and water does not vary sig-nificantly along the array, element gains can be chosen to maximize this rejection. For a fixed number of elements and no limitations on array length, a <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>array</b> results. The solution to the more relevant problem of a fixed length array with a variable number of elements is pre-sented here. Upon implementation, element gains cannot be realized exactly, but only to 1 % ithin a specified tolerance. Corresponding to this specified toler-ance, an array design procedure lnesented in this paper provides the best possible array. Naturally, the smaller the tolerance, the better the array. Ex-amples of various array designs arc compared for gain tolerances of one percent and five percent; the effect of inexact placement of the array ele-ments is also considered...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In [5], Y. Xu {{proposed}} {{a set of}} Chebyshev-like points for polynomial interpolation on the square [− 1, 1] 2. We have recently proved that the Lebesgue constant of these points grows like log 2 (n), n being the degree, as with the best known points for the square, and we have implemented an accurate version of their Lagrange interpolation formula at linear cost; see [1, 2]). Here we construct non-polynomial Xu-like interpolation formulas on bivariate compact domains with various geometries. Applications to regular surface compression are presented. 1 Polynomial interpolation at Xu points Given the Chebyshev-Lobatto points on the interval [− 1, 1] ξk = ξk,n = cos kπ, k = 0, [...] ., n, n = 2 m, n the Xu interpolation points on the square Q = [− 1, 1] 2 are the twodimensional <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>array</b> XN = {zr,s} of dimension N = n(n + 2) / 2 z 2 i, 2 j+ 1 = (ξ 2 i, ξ 2 j+ 1), 0 ≤ i ≤ m, 0 ≤ j ≤ m − 1, z 2 i+ 1, 2 j = (ξ 2 i+ 1, ξ 2 j), 0 ≤ i ≤ m − 1, 0 ≤ j ≤ m.

40|$|The {{suppression}} of interferences is conventionally done by passing {{the signal that}} is corrupted by interference signals through a filter (such as an FIR digital filter) which tends to suppress these interferences while leaving the desired signal relatively unchanged. However, if these interferences are very strong compared to the desired signal {{such as in the}} case of jamming communications, then conventional filters at the receiver will ultimately fail to remove these strong interferences. In this case the use of the antenna array is essential in eliminating such strong interferences. Thus, the antenna array may be considered as a spatial filter with an antenna pattern of the array equivalent to that of the frequency response of an FIR digital filter. This dissertation describes several new techniques to suppress strong interference signals that usually can not be achieved using conventional filters. In this study, the antenna array at the receiver utilizes the angle of arrival of interference signals together with the geometry of the array elements to make the sidelobe level of the antenna pattern equal to zero (null) in the direction of the interfering signals. The basic idea of the techniques described in this dissertation is to make use of the array geometry to alter the spatial phase differences on the array. This will perturb the original pattern so that nulls can be placed at jammer angles of arrival. In addition the main beam of the original pattern will not be significantly changed. For a linear array, these spatial phases are obtained by perturbing the elevations, positions, and rotations of the array elements. For a circular array, these spatial phases are obtained by perturbing the radial and angular locations of the array elements. The problem of obtaining the new locations of the array elements to place nulls in the antenna pattern is a nonlinear problem with more unknowns (equal to the number of elements) than the number of available equations (equal to the number of nulls). Analytic solutions exist if a further constraint is imposed on the unknowns. Analysis and computer simulation for <b>Chebyshev</b> <b>arrays</b> with 20 and 36 element have confirmed the ability of these methods to form controllable nulls in the direction of interferences. Furthermore, it is shown that these approaches lead directly to the type of signal processing architecture that is used to move the array to new locations...|$|R

The array is {{used to examine the}} c' rge in the received signal when a fluid loaded steel plate is replaced by the free surface. Twenty millisecond active pulses at 2 kHz were scattered by the target plate and recorded by the synthetic aperture array for post processing. 'I ie method of reverberant field subtraction was utilized and found unsatisfactory for use with signals of 20 msec duration in a reverberant tank. Array processing using a rectangular amplitude function was marginally successful. A <b>Chebyshev</b> amplitude weighted <b>array</b> was successfully used to demonstrate the ability of a linear array to discriminate between the steel plate and free surface scattering.

40|$|Broadband {{beamforming}} {{plays an}} important role in many applications involving antenna array signal processing such as communications, radar, sonar, imaging, geophysical exploration, astrophysical exploration and biomedical diagnostics. The traditional approaches to broadband beamforming use tapped delay line filter architectures, where the weights of the filters are chosen by optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, these approaches have some limitations. Firstly, large matrices need to be manipulated to estimate the filter coefficients and the necessary steering delays are cumbersome to implement, with implementation errors causing loss of system performance. Secondly, when some imperfections occur in the array, the resulting mismatch in array responses causes degradation in the beamformer performance. Therefore, the need for robust beamforming arises in many practical applications. Additionally, the placement of nulls in the array pattern is also a vital issue for cancelling slow moving jammers and known unwanted directional sources. Moreover, the traditional techniques have difficulties in controlling side lobe level regardless of the main lobe position in the array pattern. This thesis presents algorithms for broadband beamforming that overcomes these limitations. The result is a computationally efficient beamformer that does not require presteering delays. A unique feature of these new algorithms is inherent robustness to array imperfections, giving the user some degree of flexibility in choosing array parameters. The thesis also discusses techniques for broadband pattern synthesis. These techniques are designed to produce isolated point and broad sector spatial nulls in the presence of array imperfections. Moreover, a robust <b>Chebyshev</b> broadband antenna <b>array</b> pattern synthesis technique is proposed to achieve a specified side lobe level with interference cancellation capabilities. The thesis also presents broadband arrays having circular and concentric circular antenna element geometries, where these arrays are able to scan a beam through entire space with little change in either the beamwidth or the side lobe level. The performance of this proposed processor is compared with the performance of existing broadband processors and shows that the limitations of steering delays, computational cost, robustness, equal side lobe level, null placement and array geometries can be overcome by the use of the robust broadband methods presented in this thesis...|$|R
