In this survey, important components of tea dust and three kinds common tea wastes was studied from 1382 to 1383. Four compounds (caffeine, protein, fiber and fluor) were extracted and measured separately from four samples of wastes (dust, fluff, footstalk and stalk) as experimental component. In three periods of plucking (spring, summery and autumn) from two kinds of arrangement (from curve and flat bushes). The experiment were conducted in four experimental components with replications and were analyzed with Duncan method. The results indicated that effects all of wastes, plucking periods and two kinds of arrangement (except effect of that on amount of caffeine) were significant on caffeine, protein, fiber and fluor whereas <b>maximum</b> <b>amounts</b> of caffeine, fluor and protein in dust but <b>maximum</b> <b>amounts</b> of fiber was in stalk and Effect of plucking period indicated <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of fluor and caffeine in summer plucking and <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of fiber and protein in autumn plucking and effect of plots indicated <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of fiber in flat plot and <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of fluor and protein in curve plot...|$|R

Although techniques for hard real-time {{garbage collection}} exist, {{they are based}} on estimations of the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of referenced (live) memory. Such estimations may be difficult to derive manually for complex programs. We present techniques for predicting the <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of live memory in object-oriented languages with inheritance and virtual methods. Annotations are used to bound recursively defined data structures. The annotations may also be used for timing analysis of code traversing annotated structures. A prototype live memory analysis tool has been developed.

Phosphorous and zinc were absent in males whereas potassium was absent in addition to phosphorous and zinc in berried females. Among different sexes females contain <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of minerals (61. 56 mg) followed by males (39. 92 mg) and berried females (35. 11 mg). From the study females contain <b>maximum</b> <b>amount</b> of minerals than berried females and males. So it is recommended to consume females to get maximum minerals. ...|$|R
