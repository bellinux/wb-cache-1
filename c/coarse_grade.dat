This study investigated how foot morphology (tarsal structure) correlates with substrate adhesion and ecological niche in the Madagascan hissing cockroach, Gromphadorhina portentosa Schaum (Blattaria: Blaberidae). Using light and scanning electron microscopy, the morphology of the different structures of the tarsus of G. portentosa was analysed. Using an Instron � universal testing machine, a series of peak force experiments were then conducted to record the force required to lift the cockroaches off different substrates. G. portentosa was pulled off 10 different substrates, which consisted of smooth Perspex; Perspex scored at 1 cm intervals; Perspex hatched at 1 cm, 0. 5 cm, and 1 mm intervals; Perspex abraded with fine grade sandpaper; Perspex abraded with <b>coarse</b> <b>grade</b> sandpaper; wood; glass; and Teflon. A clear relationship was seen where an increase in scoring on the Perspex caused a decrease in adhesive ability of G. portentosa. This may be due to there being adequate contact area for the attachment of the pads and to allow the claws to engage. The results obtained suggest that to achieve the greatest adhesion to substrates, G. portentosa uses a combined effect of both adhesive pads and pretarsal claws.

Glass beads form the large size particle fraction in the mixture, whereas {{the small size}} particle fraction {{was made by the}} following filter aids: kieselgel, kieselguhr-G, and industrial kieselguhr of different grades. Investigated particle size ratio of beads and filter aids was in the range around 20 – 100. Obtained results show that the large size particles do not influence the cake filtration performance up to a volume fraction of large particles in the layer of 0. 8 ÷ 0. 85. Bench filtration through a composite layer was performed, being the mixed layer built by filtering a kieselguhr suspension through the glass beads packing formed on a support. Regeneration of the glass beads by fluidization allows its use as a non-disposal fraction of the filter bed.

Clinical Findings— On presentation, the patient had pale mucous membranes and a capillary refill time of 2 seconds. On auscultation, a <b>coarse</b> <b>grade</b> IV/VI right-sided heart murmur was heard along with an arrhythmia. The patient was tachycardic and his femoral pulses were weak to fair.

Thoracic radiographs showed enlarged pulmonary arteries and mild right heart enlargement suggestive of heartworm disease. A 4 Dx SNAP test was positive for heartworm antigen.

In the case of a flock impacting surface and in that of a glass fiber filter impacting surface, the 50 % cut-off radius value for a double impactor with 4 mm orifice opening, at a q = 90 m 3 /h average volume flow was r 50 % = 1 µm, while for a teflon impacting surface it was r 50 % = 2. 3 µm. The E(r) impacting efficiency curve was steepest in case of applying the flock impacting surface, it was less steep in case of an undulated teflon one. The separation of the average background aerosol for coarse and fine grade domains was well performed both by flock and glass fiber filter impacting surfaces. It is of special significance that the glass fiber filter impacting surface and the undulated teflon impacting surface are excellent for so-called gravimetric chemical analysis. When applying flock or glass fiber filter surfaces, about 8 - 10 % of the winter-time fine grade penetration derived from the <b>coarse</b> <b>grade</b> domain, while the respective summer parameters were between 16 - 23 %.

40|$|Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a {{first-line}} drug {{used for}} the treatment of partial and tonic-clonic seizures. It is also the drug of choice for use during pregnancy and recommended {{for the treatment of}} seizure disorders in children. CBZ possesses the ability to induce metabolism of drugs that are transformed in the liver and has the unique ability to induce its own metabolism by a phenomenon known as ‘auto- induction’, where its biological half-life is significantly reduced during chronic administration. Large doses of CBZ are often prescribed as daily divided doses and this often adversely affects patient compliance, with the result that therapy is ineffective. A sustained-release dosage form containing CBZ is currently marketed as Tegretol® CR {{and the development of a}} generic product would provide patients with an equivalent product with a similar dosing frequency, at a reduced cost. Therefore, the development of a polymer-based matrix tablet was undertaken to produce a sustained-release dosage form of CBZ, since these dosage forms are relatively simple and cheap to produce when compared to other, more sophisticated forms of sustained-release technology. Preformulation studies were conducted to assess moisture content of excipients and dosage forms and to identify possible incompatibilities between CBZ and potential formulation excipients. Furthermore, studies were conducted to assess the potential for polymorphic transitions to occur during manufacture. Stability testing was conducted to assess the behaviour of the dosage forms under storage conditions that the product may be exposed to. Dissolution testing was undertaken using USP Apparatus 3, which allowed for a more realistic assessment and prediction of in vivo drug release rates. Samples were analysed using a high performance liquid chromatographic method that was developed and validated for the determination of CBZ. Tablets were manufactured by wet granulation and direct compression techniques, and the resultant drug release profiles were evaluated statistically by means of the f 1 and f 2 difference and similarity factors. The f 2 factor was incorporated as an assessment criterion in the design of an artificial neural network that was used to predict drug release profiles and formulation composition. A direct compression tablet formulation was successfully adapted from a prototype wet granulation matrix formulation and a number of formulation variables were assessed to establish their effect(s) on the dissolution rate profile of CBZ that resulted from testing of the dosage forms. The particle size grade of CBZ was also investigated and it was ascertained that fine particle size grade CBZ showed improved drug release profiles when compared to the <b>coarse</b> <b>grade</b> CBZ which was desirable, since CBZ is a highly water insoluble compound. Furthermore, the impact of the viscosity grade and proportion of rate-controlling polymer, viz., hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was also investigated for its effect on drug release rates. The lower viscosity grade was found to be more appropriate for use with CBZ. The type of anti-frictional agent used in the formulations did not appear to affect drug release from the polymeric matrix tablets, however specific compounds may have an effect on the physical characteristics of the polymeric tablets. The resultant formulations did not display zero-order drug release kinetics and a first-order mathematical model was developed to provide an additional resource for athematical analysis of dissolution profiles. An artificial neural network was designed, developed and applied to predict dissolution rate profiles for formulation. Furthermore, the network was used to predict formulation compositions that would produce drug release profiles comparable to the reference product, Tegretol® CR. The formulation composition predicted by the network to match the dissolution profile of the innovator product was manufactured and tested in vitro. The formulation was further manipulated, empirically, so as to match the in vitro dissolution rate profile of Tegretol® CR, more completely. The test tablets that were produced were tested in two health male volunteers using Tegretol® CR 400 mg as the reference product. The batch used for this “proof of concept” biostudy was produced in accordance with cGMP guidelines and the protocol in accordance with ICH guidelines. The test matrix tablets revealed in vivo bioavailability profiles for CBZ, however, bioequivalence between the test and reference product could not be established. It can be concluded that the polymeric matrix CBZ tablets have the potential to be used as a twice-daily dosage form for the treatment of relevant seizure disorders. ...|$|E

The· mechanical analysis of soils has thus come to be considered of primary importance in soil investigations. Any improvements in the methods or apparatus for mechanical analysis will, therefore, doubtless be welcomed by agricultural investigators.
