40|$|Voice over IP (VoIP) {{promises}} to up-end a century-old model of voice telephony by breaking the traditional monolithic service {{model of the}} public switched tele-phone network (PSTN) and changing the point of control and provision from the central offi <b>ce</b> <b>switch</b> to the end user’s device. Placing intelligence at the edge, in the Internet tradition, {{has a number of}} consequences: a wider community of developers—in particular the large community of Web service developers—can work on voice applications—; open interfaces and decomposable functionality facilitate multi-vendor and “homegrown” solutions; and open source and nonproprietary software development can facilitate innovation and experimenta-tion. Users themselves will take a much bigger role in defi ning, implementing, and controlling the features of telephone services. Contrast this with the more-than- 100 -year institution of traditional voice service through a single ubiquitous dedicated network, the PSTN. Charac-teristically, in the PSTN, services are developed hand-in-hand with vendors of the hardware (the circuit switch), the product and its operation are a closely guarded proprietary concern, and, consequently, relatively few DDOS takes on a whole new meaning...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complexity adaptive channel estimator for low power. Channel estimation (CE) {{is one of}} the most computation intensive tasks in a software-defined radio (SDR) based OFDM demodulator. Complementary to the conventional low-power design methodology on processor architectures or circuits, we propose to reduce power also at the algorithm level. The idea is to dynamically scale the processing load of the channel estimator according to the run-time estimated channel quality. In this work, with a case study on China Mobile Multimedia Broadcasting (CMMB) standard, three practical CE algorithms are adopted to form a complexity scalable algorithm set, and signal noise ratio (SNR) is chosen to be the channel quality parameter for <b>CE</b> algorithm <b>switching.</b> In order to accurately estimate the SNR in the run-time, we also propose a noise variance estimation algorithm which is robust against fast-fading channels and introduces small computation overheads. Simulation shows that, under a pre-defined scenario for our targeting SDR demodulator, more than 50 % run-time load reduction can be achieved compared with a fixed worst case channel estimator, while still fulfilling the mean square error requirement, resulting in about 25 % of power reduction for the total demodulator. In addition, complexity adaption enables dynamical voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) in a SDR demodulator which can lead to furthermore power reduction. © 2012 EDAA...|$|R
40|$|Although infants {{perceptually}} attune {{to native}} vowels and consonants well before 12 months, at 13 – 15 months, they have difficulty learning to associate novel words that differ by their initial consonant (e. g., BIN and DIN) to their visual referents. However, this difficulty may {{not apply to}} all minimal-pair novel words. While Canadian English (CE) 15 -month-olds {{failed to respond to}} a switch from the newly learned word DEET to the novel nonword DOOT, they did notice a switch from DEET to DIT (Curtin, Fennell, & Escudero, 2009). Those authors argued that early word learners capitalize on large phonetic differences, seen in CE DEET–DIT, but not on smaller phonetic differences, as in CE DEET–DOOT. To assess this hypothesis, we tested Australian English (AusE) 15 -month-olds, as AusE has a smaller magnitude of phonetic difference in both novel word pairs. Two groups of infants were trained on the novel word DEET and tested on the vowel switches in DIT and DOOT, produced by an AusE female speaker or the same CE female speaker as in Curtin et al. (2009). If the size of the phonetic distinction plays a more central role than native accent experience in early word learning, AusE children should more easily recognize both of the unfamiliar but larger <b>CE</b> vowel <b>switches</b> than the more familiar but smaller AusE ones. The results support our phonetic-magnitude hypothesis: AusE children taught and tested with the CE-accented novel words looked longer to both of the switch test trials (DIT, DOOT) than same test trials (DEET), while those who heard the AusE-accented tokens did not notice either switch. Implications of our findings for models of early word learning are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Recently, {{cerium oxide}} {{nanoparticles}} (CeO 2 NPs) have attracted great attentions {{due to their}} unique redox properties that were extensively applied in energy, catalysis, and biomedical fields [14 – 16]. Especially, CeO 2 nanoparticles exhibited huge potential as ideal antioxidant to treat ROS-related diseases in biomedical applications [17, 18]. The antioxidant activity of ceria nanoparticles derives from their ability of scavenging free radicals, such as superoxide (•O 2 −) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), and maintains the antioxidant effect as an enzyme for a sustained period [19]. There is increasing evidence that CeO 2 nanoparticles usually have a fluorite-type crystal structure, and cerium ions possess the ability of reversible conversion between tervalence (3 +) and quadrivalence (4 +) [20]. The <b>switch</b> of <b>Ce</b> 3 + to Ce 4 + oxidation states could eliminate O 2 − via superoxide dismutase (SOD)-mimetics, and •OH via redox reactions, whereas the Ce 4 + to <b>Ce</b> 3 + <b>switch</b> remove H 2 O 2 via catalase (CAT)-mimetics [21]. However, {{physical and chemical properties}} of CeO 2 NPs may influence biological behavior, including its bio-distribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, dissolution, and elimination [22]. Given the hypothesis that it is well established on the superficial chemistry of Ce-doped CNPs, the biological utilization of Ce-doped CNPs as a therapeutic approach still need to be broadly explored [23, 24].|$|R
3000|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} rare earth oxides, CeO 2 has been widely used in three-way catalysts as an efficient catalyst support due to its unique physical and chemical properties [6, 8, 15, 17]. CeO 2 has an excellent oxygen storage and release capacity due to the ability to <b>switch</b> <b>Ce</b> 4 +/Ce 3 +, which makes CeO 2 become an active oxide component of various oxidation catalysts used in diverse redox catalytic reactions [17 – 32]. Surface areas, mesoporous structures, lattice defects, and synergistic effects with other dopants can all promote the catalytic properties of ceria nanomaterials [3, 22]. To further improve the performance of Au-CeO 2 catalysts for CO oxidation reaction, many strategies have been tried, such as preparation methods including deposition-precipitation, coprecipitation, and urea-gelation coprecipitation, which has been used to control and optimize the interaction of the Au-O-Ce structure, as well as the size and shape of ceria [33 – 35]. Attempts have been also made by the surface modification of support [4, 5, 22, 24, 26, 36 – 38]. It has been found that the use of binary mixed oxides as support could provide a good solution for the stabilization of gold nanoparticles. Moreover, the promotion by noble or transition metal enhances ceria reducibility and facilitates the formation of surface oxygen vacancies. Meanwhile, doping with transition metal cations has been proved to be an effective method to promote the physicochemical properties of one-dimensional (1 D) nanostructured nanomaterials, such as catalytic activity [38 – 40].

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{fabrication}} of electrochromic (nanocomposite-) materials {{based on the}} metal-complex Fe(ph-tpy) 2 and a metallo-supramolecular polyelectrolyte (Fe-MEPE) for use in glass and plastic electrochromic devices (ECD) with electrically switchable transmittance was investigated. Using Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition and dip-coating {{it is possible to}} fabricate homogeneous Fe-MEPE films on transparent conductive oxide substrates (TCO). The used TCO substrates have high transparency in the visible region and low sheet resistance so that the electrochromic element can achieve in the bleached state high transmittance and fast switching times. The reference material Fe(ph-tpy) 2 was investigated to reveal the advantages of polymeric structures compared to mononuclear metal complexes. The purple Fe(ph-tpy) 2 complexes are not useful for fabrication of electrochromic thin films because of their weak wettability and adhesion on TCO substrates. In contrast Fe-MEPE exhibits remarkable electrochromic properties. Fe-MEPE is readily soluble in alcohols and ether alcohols, in which the largest extinction coefficient εmax is obtained in MeOH (46. 890 M- 1 •cm- 1). A comparison between LbL-assembled and dip-coated Fe-MEPE films shows that electrochromic thin films can be easierly fabricated by dip-coating process and have faster switching times. The highest optical quality is obtained with a solvent mixture of EtOH, MeOH and 2 -butoxyethanol. The thin films show a homogeneous, defect-free surface with high transparency. Fe-MEPE films are stable up to 100 °C. At higher temperatures the colour turns irreversible green and the films are no longer switchable. A change of the molecular structure of the Fe-MEPE polymers is responsible for the green colouration. At a temperature of approximately 100 °C a transition from low to high temperature state can be observed. The axial Fe-N bond is shortened from 1, 95 to 1, 88 Å, the equatorial Fe-N bond is elongated from 1, 98 to 2, 01 Å. Electrochemical investigations show that Fe-MEPE thin films switch at voltages between 3, 85 and 4, 10 V vs. Li/Li+ in liquid organic electrolytes from blue to colourless upon oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and at around 4, 00 to 3, 75 V vs. Li/Li+ the Fe-MEPE films turn blue again upon reduction. High couloumb efficiencies of approx. 94 %, colouration efficiencies η > 500 cm 2 •C- 1 at 592 nm and visible optical contrasts Δτv up to 58 % could be reached. However, the Fe-MEPE films without a hybrid polymer (ORMOCER®) as binder can be partially dissolved in some liquid and gel electrolytes after a while. To improve the adhesion and the thermal stability of the electrochromic layers Fe(ph-tpy) 2 and Fe-MEPE are embedded in an ORMOCER®. Therefore, a hydroxy functionalized ORMOCER® with a high OH/Si ratio (1, 75 : 1) is most suitable. In contrast to the purple ORMOCER®/Fe(ph-tpy) 2 films the blue coloured ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE layers exhibit better film formation and higher homogeneity and transparency. With a solvent mixture of EtOH, MeOH and 2 -butoxyethanol homogeneous ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE films with low haze (< 0, 5 %) could be fabricated up to a sample size of 20 x 30 cm 2. The electrochromic properties remain up to an ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE ratio of 40 : 1 and layer thicknesses of around 10 µm, in which the switching speed decreases with an increasing ORMOCER® ratio. The optimum is an ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE ratio of 3 : 1, in which the thin films exhibit outstanding optical and electrochromic properties as well as good thermal and mechanical stability. The thermal stability of ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE films could be increased above 100 °C; the blue colour and the electrochromic properties of the films are preserved also after a short annealing step at 200 °C. In comparison to the Fe-MEPE films without ORMOCER® the intensity of the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition at around 593 nm and the charge density of the ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE films with the same layer thickness is lower, which also leads to a lower colouration efficiency of the nanocomposite materials. However, Δτv could be increased up to 62 % and the ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE films show a high cycle stability over several thousand cycles without significant loss of charge density. Furthermore, in ORMOCER® embedded Fe-MEPE exhibit polyelectrochromic properties; at negative voltages (< - 1, 9 V vs. Fc/Fc+) the ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE films are green coloured and show a strong absorbance in the NIR region. With regard to the use of Fe(ph-tpy) 2 and Fe-MEPE as working electrode (WE) in ECDs various materials, such as ITO, V 2 O 5, TiVOx and Prussian blue (PB), are suitable for the use as counter electrode (CE). In particular, PB is interesting as a material for the <b>CE,</b> because it <b>switches</b> complementary to Fe-MEPE from blue to colourless. Thus, in an ECD with a Fe-MEPE-based WE the visible optical contrast ∆τv can be increased in comparison to ECDs with V 2 O 5 or TiVOx as counter electrode, which have no colourless redox state. As a result Fe-MEPE or ORMOCER®/Fe-MEPE are promising electrochromic materials for the use in switchable windows (smart windows), particularly because of their excellent coating properties, high colouration efficiencies and fast switching times...|$|R
