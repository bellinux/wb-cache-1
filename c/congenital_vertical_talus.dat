The flexible flatfoot is caused by ligamentous laxity, it is mostly pain-free and is treated symptomatically (prescription of adequate shoes and kinesitherapy). The rigid foot is most often caused by bone changes (tarsal coalition, <b>vertical</b> <b>congenital</b> <b>talus)</b> occurring idiopathically or within neuromuscular pathological conditions, with mostly present pain problems.

40|$|The term <b>{{congenital}}</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus</b> {{is applied}} to a severe congenital deformity of the foot, which resembles club foot (talipes equino-cavo-varus) in that the heel is elevated, there is dislocation of the talo-navicular joint and the foot is stiff. The displacement of the tab-navicular joint is, however, opposite in the two conditions: in club foot it is downwards and medially, whereas in <b>congenital</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus</b> the navicular bone moves upwards and laterally to lie on the dorsum of the head or neck of the talus. A further {{difference is that the}} elevated heel in vertical talus is not fixed. Rigidity of the foot is so formidable in <b>congenital</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus</b> that most authorities agree that the condition is amenable only to operative treatment.

Methods: The records of twenty-seven consecutive patients with vertical talus (forty-two feet) were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of seven years (range, five to 11. 3 years) after initial correction was achieved. The minimally invasive method was used to treat sixteen patients (twenty-four feet), and extensive soft-tissue release surgery was used to treat eleven patients (eighteen feet).

There are sporadic literature on costing with mixed results. We describe our early experience of reverse ponseti technique. Materials and methods: Four cases (four feet) of idiopathic <b>congenital</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus</b> (CVT) which presented one month after birth were treated by serial manipulation and casting, tendoachilles tenotomy and percutaneous pinning of talonavicular joint. An average of 5. 2 (range - four to six) plaster cast applications were required to correct the forefoot deformity. Once the talus and navicular were aligned based on the radiographic talus-first metatarsal axis, percutaneous fixation of the talo-navicular joint with a Kirschner wire, and percutaneous tendoachilles tenotomy under anesthesia was performed following which a cast was applied with the foot in slight dorsiflexion. Results: The mean follow-up period for the four cases was 8. 5 months (6 - 12 months). At {{the end of the}} treatment all feet were supple and plantigrade but still using ankle foot orthosis (AFO). The mean talocalcaneal angle was 70 degrees before treatment and this reduced to 31 degrees after casting.

This condition is usually associated with multiple other congenital deformities and only rarely is an isolated deformity. The reported familial cases are consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance. In contrast, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is thought to be a completely distinct heterogeneous group of disorders, with foot abnormalities that typically develop a high-arched “claw foot” appearance later in life. In the present study, DNA was isolated from 36 members of a single upstate (northern) New York white family of Italian descent in which both CVT and CMT were segregating. Whole-genome linkage analysis with Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 10 K Array defined a 7 -Mb critical region on chromosome 2 q 31, which led to candidate-gene sequencing of six HOX genes and detection of a single missense mutation, M 319 K (956 T→A), in the HOXD 10 gene.

40|$|<b>Congenital</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus</b> is an {{uncommon}} foot deformity that is present at birth {{and results in}} a rigid flatfoot deformity. Left untreated the deformity can result in pain and disability. Though the exact etiology of vertical talus is unknown, {{an increasing number of}} cases have been shown to have a genetic cause. Approximately 50 % of all cases of vertical talus are associated with other neuromuscular abnormalities or known genetic syndromes. The remaining 50 % of cases were once thought to be idiopathic in nature. However, there is increasing evidence that many of these cases are related to single gene defects. Most patients with vertical talus have been treated with major reconstructive surgeries that are fraught with complications such as wound necrosis, talar necrosis, undercorrection of the deformity, stiffness of the ankle and subtalar joint, and the eventual need for multiple operative procedures. Recently, a new approach to vertical talus that consists of serial casting and minimal surgery has resulted in excellent correction in the short-term. Longer follow-up will be necessary to ensure maintenance of correction with this new technique. A less invasive approach to the correction of vertical talus may provide more favorable long-term outcomes than more extensive surgery as {{has been shown to be}} true for clubfoot outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Foot {{and ankle}} {{problems}} are highly {{prevalent in the}} general community and a substantial proportion of people seek surgical treatment to alleviate foot pain and deformity. However, the epidemiology of foot and ankle surgery has not been examined in detail. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine patterns and costs of private sector foot surgery provision in Australia. Methods Data pertaining to all foot and ankle surgical procedures for the calendar years 1997 – 2006 were extracted from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) database and were cross-tabulated by sex and age. Descriptive analyses were undertaken to assess sex and age differences in the number and type of procedures performed and to assess for temporal trends over the ten year assessment period. The total cost to Medicare of subsiding surgeons' fees in 2006 was also determined. Results During the 1997 – 2006 period, 996, 477 surgical procedures were performed on the foot and ankle by private surgeons in Australia. Approximately equal numbers of procedures were performed on males (52 %) and females (48 %). However, males were more likely to undergo toenail, ankle, clubfoot, tarsal coalition and <b>congenital</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus</b> surgery, whereas females were more likely to undergo lesser toe, first metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ), neuroma, heel, rearfoot and lesser MPJ surgery. The total number of procedures was stable over the assessment period, however there was a relative increase in the number of procedures performed on people aged over 55 years. The total contribution of Medicare to subsiding surgeons' fees for procedures performed in 2006 was $ 14 M. Conclusion Foot and ankle surgery accounts for a considerable degree of healthcare expenditure in Australia, and the number of procedures in those aged over 55 years is increasing. Given the ageing demographics of the Australian population, the future public health and economic impact of foot morbidity is likely to be substantial. Strategies need to be implemented to ensure that the surgical labour force is adequate to address this increasing demand. </p...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the exact}} {{incidence}} of flatfoot in children is unknown, {{it is very}} common and is, in fact, {{one of the most}} common conditions seen in pediatric orthopedic practices. All children are born with flat feet, and more than 30 % of neonates have a calcaneovalgus deformity of both feet. This condition is not painful and generally resolves without treatment; very rarely is corrective casting necessary. For the pediatrician evaluating flatfoot, it is important to differentiate between flexible and nonflexible (rigid) flatfoot, and to classify the condition as painful or painless. Most children who present to a pediatrician for evaluation of flatfoot will have a flexible flatfoot that does not require treatment. On the other hand, other conditions that do require treatment, such as <b>congenital</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>talus,</b> tarsal coalition, and skew-foot often present as nonflexible flatfoot. Surgical management is rarely indicated for a true flexible flatfoot. The longitudinal arch of the foot is not present at birth and slowly develops during childhood, usually by about age five or six. It is a process that occurs throughout growth and is not affected by the presence or absence of external arch support. Sometimes the arch takes even longer to take shape, but this still usually does not cause any problems. A variety of tendon transfers and reconstructive procedures have been advocated, but none has proved uniformly successful. Nor have any of the various types of supports ever been shown to change the arch architecture. It should be borne in mind that painful flexible flat foot requires treatment, often with several types of shoe inserts and supports and as a last resort by operative procedures. Although parents are often concerned about pediatric flatfoot, the child is usually found to be asymptomatic, and no treatment is indicated. In most instances, the best treatment is simply taking enough time to convince the family that no treatment is necessary...|$|E
50|$|Saltonstall Mountain rises steeply 200 ft {{above the}} {{surrounding}} landscape, {{with a high}} point of (est.) 320 ft. It is roughly 5.75 mi long by 1.25 mi wide and shaped like a hunting bow. The mountain lies within the towns of Branford, North Branford, and East Haven, Connecticut. Its western side is steepest, with <b>vertical</b> ledges and <b>talus</b> slopes, while its eastern side is lower and punctuated by hilly rises. The high point lies {{at the north end}} of the mountain; Lake Saltonstall is sandwiched in the mountain's southern arms. Beside Lake Saltonstall, the mountain shelters several other small bodies of water, including Lidyhites Pond, located in the center of the ridge north of Lake Saltonstall; Linsley Pond and Cedar Pond, located at the mountain's northern foot; and the two Branford Supply Ponds, located at the eastern foot. The Farm River runs along the western foot of the mountain. Interstate 95 cuts through the southern tip of the ridge.|$|R
30|$|After Graf [11] popularised baby hip {{ultrasound}}, ultrasound {{has been}} increasingly {{used to assess}} orthopaedic abnormalities {{and the results of}} orthopaedic treatments in children. Schlesinger et al. [12] and Hamel et al. [13] reported on the use of ultrasound in the assessment of clubfeet and <b>vertical</b> <b>talus.</b> Weigl et al. [14] described sonographic healing stages of Achilles tendons after tenomuscular lengthening (1 : haematoma and exudate, 2 : organization of haematoma, 3 : appearance of connective tissue fibres in the gap, 4 : maturation of connective tissue, 5 : tendon-like structure, and 6 : organization of tendonlike structure) in children with cerebral palsy and stated that the healed tendons were not differentiable from normal tendons. However, the healed tendons were described as fusiform with a markedly increased anteroposterior diameter. Barker and Lavy [8] were the first to visualise the healing of Achilles tenotomies as part of Ponseti clubfoot treatment using ultrasound. They reported that all divided 11 Achilles tendons showed ultrasonographic continuity by six weeks. Mangat et al. [7] reported three phases of healing within the gap zone of a divided Achilles tendon in children with clubfeet with the healing being complete by 12  weeks in the majority of {{children under the age of}} 24  months. At six weeks a bulbous mass was still present within the gap. In their patients the transition from regenerating to normal tendon appeared between six and 12  weeks, when the new fibres became indistinguishable from the original tendon. Maranho et al. [6] were the first who measured tendon dimensions ultrasonographically after Achilles tenotomy in clubfeet in 2009. Focal thickening was still present in the repaired area at one year. Foot position and level of scanning at the gap area were not defined. Agarwal et al. [9] measured dimensions in 2012 after Achilles tendon releases in clubfeet. The tendons were scanned first preoperatively with the feet in maximum dorsiflexion at a level approximately 1  cm above the calcaneal insertion. This means that the feet and calcanei will have been in different positions, and the tendons will have been stretched different amounts. The text indicates that the 1  cm distance was estimated giving a further unknown variable increasing the inaccuracy of any measurement. However, the radiologist performing the ultrasounds was able to measure tendon dimensions to a precision of 0.01  mm. The second measurement was performed four weeks after tenotomy, but the foot position and level of the ultrasound were not described at this point. The authors reported that there was no significant difference in Achilles tendon width, thickness, area in normal tendons and in unilateral and bilateral clubfeet before and after tenotomy. However, the provided mean data showed a 28 / 4 / 48  % increase of thickness, width and area, respectively, for the normal tendons. A bulbous mass, as previously reported [6, 7] and seen in our study, would have made measurements of thickness, width, and surface area irreproducible since they would change depending on the tendon level scanned and the position of the foot, but Agarwal et al. did not report such a bulbous mass. The mean age at tenotomy was five months in the Agarwal [9] paper and seven weeks in the Maranho et al. [6] paper with a mean thickness of the normal tendons of 1.84 and 2.50  mm, respectively. Therefore, the mean thickness of the latter group was 36  % larger despite the patients mean age being about three times younger.|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remaining}} {{as one of}} {{the deadliest}} communicable diseases. <b>Congenital</b> infection by <b>vertical</b> transmission is rare but high neonatal mortality (up to 60 %) and morbidity warrant early and accurate diagnosis of newborns suffering from TB. Intrauterine infection of tuberculosis is most commonly caused by haematogenous spread from the mother causing placental seedling. The organisms reach the fetus via the umbilical vein and the primary focus is often in the fetal liver in hematgenous spread. Another route of infection is by direct ingestion or aspiration of infected amniotic fluid if the placental caseous lesion ruptures directly into the amniotic cavity. Transplacental infection occurs late in pregnancy and aspiration from amniotic fluid occurs in the perinatal period. We report here one case of disseminated tuberculosis in a new born infant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractToxoplasma gondii is an obligate {{intracellular}} protozoan parasite {{that causes}} {{a variety of}} clinical syndromes, but the infection is severe in immunocompromised individuals and during pregnancy due {{to the possibility of}} transplacental transmission of the parasite causing <b>congenital</b> toxoplasmosis. <b>Vertical</b> transmission of the parasite usually occurs when females are primarily infected during pregnancy. Calomys callosus is resistant to T. gondii ME 49 strain, which presents a moderate virulence and congenital disease occurs only during the acute phase of infection. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether vertical transmission occurs when females of C. callosus chronically infected with ME 49 strain of T. gondii are reinfected with a highly virulent strain (RH, type I). Females were infected with cysts of the ME 49 strain. On the 1 st day of pregnancy, animals were reinfected with tachyzoites of the RH strain. In the 19 th day of pregnancy, placentas and embryos were processed for morphological analysis, immunohistochemistry and for detection of the parasite by PCR and mouse bioassay. Morphological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed the presence of parasites only in placental tissues. Mouse bioassay results showed seroconversion only in mice that were inoculated with placental tissues. Also, T.  gondii DNA was detected only in placental samples. Congenital toxoplasmosis does not occur in C. callosus females chronically infected with the moderately virulent ME 49 strain of T. gondii and reinfected with the highly virulent RH strain, thus indicating that primary T. gondii infection before pregnancy leads to an effective long-term immunity preventing transplacental transmission to the fetus...|$|R
40|$|This review {{defines the}} {{concepts}} of maternal-fetal (<b>congenital)</b> and <b>vertical</b> transmissions (mother-to-child) of pathogens and specifies the human parasites susceptible to be congenitally transferred. It highlights the epidemiological features of this transmission mode for the three main congenital parasitic infections due to Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium sp. Information on the possible maternal-fetal routes of transmission, the placental responses to infection and timing of parasite transmission are synthesized and compared. The factors susceptible {{to be involved in}} parasite transmission and development of congenital parasitic diseases, such as the parasite genotypes, the maternal co-infections and parasitic load, the immunological features of pregnant women and the capacity of some fetuses/neonates to overcome their immunological immaturity to mount an immune response against the transmitted parasites are also discussed and compared. Analysis of clinical data indicates that parasitic congenital infections are often asymptomatic, whereas symptomatic newborns generally display non-specific symptoms. The long-term consequences of congenital infections are also mentioned, such as the imprinting of neonatal immune system and the possible trans-generational transmission. The detection of infection in pregnant women is mainly based on standard serological or parasitological investigations. Amniocentesis and cordocentesis can be used for the detection of some fetal infections. The neonatal infection can be assessed using parasitological, molecular or immunological methods; the place of PCR in such neonatal diagnosis is discussed. When such laboratory diagnosis is not possible at birth or in the first weeks of life, standard serological investigations can also be performed 8 - 10 months after birth, to avoid detection of maternal transmitted antibodies. The specific aspects of treatment of T. gondii, T. cruzi and Plasmodium congenital infections are mentioned. The possibilities of primary and secondary prophylaxes, as well as the available WHO corresponding recommendations are also presented.
