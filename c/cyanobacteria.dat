5|$|Various {{types of}} <b>cyanobacteria</b> inhabit Lake Chillisquaque. The {{specific}} genera that inhabit the lake vary {{at different times}} of the year and also at different depths within the lake. Due to the presence of light attenuation in the lake, light plays a role in determining which species of <b>cyanobacteria</b> inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|A lichen is a {{symbiosis}} of a macroscopic fungus with photosynthetic microbial algae or <b>cyanobacteria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the park}} are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of cryptobiotic soil, which are a mix of lichens, algae, fungi, and <b>cyanobacteria.</b> Together these organisms slow erosion, add {{nitrogen}} to soil, and help it to retain moisture.|$|E
30|$|Cluster A, showed two sub clusters; 1 a and 2 a. In cluster 1 a, Synechococcus GK 9 and uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 4 {{clustered}} with non toxic Synechococcus PCC 7009 sharing 100 % sequence similarity with 54 % bootstrap (BT) support while uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 3 and GK 6 clustered together sharing > 96 % sequence similarity with 86 % BT support. Cluster 2 a contained uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 2, AT 4 and GK 7 sharing > 98 % similarity. Other uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 8 and GK 5 clustered with 2 a sharing > 96 % {{similarity and}} 56 % BT support. Uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 3 and GK 6 deviated from 1 % and similarly uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 5 and unicellular <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 8 deviated from 1 %. However all four sequences were clustered with 1 a and 2 a sub clusters sharing > 98 % similarity and 56 % BT support. Therefore, Cluster A comprised non-toxic unicellular cyanobacterial strains sharing > 96 % similarity.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} Pseudocyphellaria are cyanolichens and contain the <b>cyanobacterium</b> Nostoc as a photobiont, which allows {{nitrogen}} fixation. In some species of Pseudocyphellaria the <b>cyanobacterium</b> {{is the sole}} photobiont, while other species also contain the green alga Dictyochloropsis and restrict the <b>cyanobacterium</b> to warty cephalodia on the lower surface of the lichen.|$|R
30|$|Cluster J {{consisted}} of a single sub cluster 1 J along with a separate branch of Uncultured Oscillatoria GK 13 with 70 % BT support. Sub cluster 1 J composed Prochlorales <b>cyanobacterium</b> HM 17 and unicellular <b>cyanobacterium</b> A 3 sharing 100 % sequence similarity while clustered with unicellular <b>cyanobacterium</b> A 3 sharing over 99 % sequence similarity with 67 and 99 % BT support respectively.|$|R
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. <b>Cyanobacteria,</b> the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the <b>cyanobacteria,</b> changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic infestations, stings, and bites {{in humans}} {{are caused by}} several groups of organisms {{belonging}} to the following phyla: Annelida, Arthropoda, Bryozoa, Chordata, Cnidaria, <b>Cyanobacteria,</b> Echinodermata, Nemathelminthes, Platyhelminthes, and Protozoa.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis feeds {{mainly on}} diatoms living on stones, {{scraping}} biofilms and also consuming detritus. It can also consume <b>Cyanobacteria</b> and green algae as a poor-quality food supply. <b>Cyanobacteria</b> contain toxins and indigestible mucopolysaccharides, and green algae have cellulose in their cell walls (Theodoxus species have no cellulase enzymes to digest cellulose). They also graze on zygotes and germlings of brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, when the alga is small up to 1mm. Peters and Traunspurger (2012) studied {{the effect of}} the grazing of Theodoxus fluviatilis on epilithic meiofauna and algae.|$|E
50|$|Antillatoxin {{is found}} in the venom of the marine <b>cyanobacterium</b> Lyngbya majuscula. The {{filamentous}} <b>cyanobacterium</b> grows on seagrass, macroalgae, and corals up to 30m deep in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.|$|R
30|$|Considering cluster K, it {{composed}} a sub cluster 1 K {{along with a}} separate branch of Chroococcales <b>cyanobacterium</b> HM 6. Sub cluster 1 K clustered uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> AT 6 and GK 1 sharing > 98 % sequence similarity with 99 % BT support.|$|R
50|$|Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a {{freshwater}} <b>cyanobacterium.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in Big Sur since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of <b>cyanobacteria</b> (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. <b>Cyanobacteria</b> are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis. According to some estimates, green algae and <b>cyanobacteria</b> in marine environments provide about 70% of the free oxygen produced on Earth, and the rest {{is produced}} by terrestrial plants. Other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher, while some estimates are lower, suggesting oceans produce ~45% of Earth's atmospheric oxygen each year.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{experimental}} precision {{combined with}} vastly improved scientific instrumentation was opening up exciting new fields. In 1936 Alexander Oparin (1894–1980) demonstrated a possible {{mechanism for the}} synthesis of organic matter from inorganic molecules. In the 1960s {{it was determined that}} the Earth's earliest life-forms treated as plants, the <b>cyanobacteria</b> known as stromatolites, dated back some 3.5 billion years.|$|E
30|$|Considering Cluster B, it {{consisted}} of a single sub cluster; 1 b which composed uncultured Synechococcus GK 14 and uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> GK 15 which showed > 98 % similarity and clustered with 56 % BT support. Further, sub cluster 1 b along with uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> AN 2 and AT 3 clustered with toxic Synechococcus sp. sharing > 98 % similarity and 56 % BT support. Further, 1 b clustered with uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> AT 3 and KN 1 grouping the cluster B. Furthermore, uncultured <b>cyanobacterium</b> AT 2 clustered with 1 b with 99 % BT support. Therefore cluster B contained toxic unicellular cyanobacterial strains sharing > 98 % similarity. Further, both cluster A and cluster B re-clustered with toxic M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 sharing > 94 % similarity.|$|R
50|$|The fungi form lichens in a {{symbiotic}} relationship {{with one or two}} photosynthetic partners which may be a <b>cyanobacterium</b> such as Nostoc or a green alga such as Coccomyxa. The majority of species contain just a <b>cyanobacterium,</b> a smaller number have both a <b>cyanobacterium</b> and a green alga while only a few species have just a green alga. The thallus of the lichen may be foliose (leafy), subfruticose (somewhat shrubby) or granular-squamulose (scaly). The thallus attaches to a surface by means of small root-like rhizines. In some species, the thallus may vary in appearance depending on whether it contains a <b>cyanobacterium</b> or a green alga. Sometimes these different morphs of a single fungus were formerly thought to be separate species.|$|R
50|$|Oscillaria is a genus of {{filamentous}} <b>cyanobacterium.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pilophorus acicularis is a {{tripartite}} lichen—containing a fungus, a green alga, and a cyanobacterium. Cephalodia (lichenized aggregations of nitrogen-fixing <b>cyanobacteria)</b> {{are present}} on the primary thallus; smaller cephalodia {{are also on the}} pseudopodetia. Hemispherical to irregularly shaped, and light to dark brown in color, they contain species from the genus Nostoc. The green algal photosynthetic symbiont (photobiont) associated with P.acicularis is Asterochloris magna (formerly Trebouxia magna).|$|E
5|$|Polyadenylate polymerases {{are not as}} ancient. They have {{separately}} {{evolved in}} both bacteria and eukaryotes from CCA-adding enzyme, which is the enzyme that completes the 3' ends of tRNAs. Its catalytic domain is homologous {{to that of other}} polymerases. It is presumed that the horizontal transfer of bacterial CCA-adding enzyme to eukaryotes allowed the archaeal-like CCA-adding enzyme to switch function to a poly(A) polymerase. Some lineages, like archaea and <b>cyanobacteria,</b> never evolved a polyadenylate polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy in}} {{sunlight}} is captured by plants, <b>cyanobacteria,</b> purple bacteria, green sulfur bacteria and some protists. This process is often coupled to {{the conversion of}} carbon dioxide into organic compounds, as part of photosynthesis, which is discussed below. The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes, as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight {{as a source of}} energy, while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} showed {{by means of}} autoradiography that the <b>cyanobacterium</b> Microcystis wesenbergii did not incorporate [3 H]thymidine at nanomolar concentrations, whereas its associated heterotrophic bacteria appearing in the gelatinous cover of the <b>cyanobacterium</b> became labeled. Several other tested cyaobacteria and algae did not incorporate [3 H]thymidine...|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where organic carbon compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic <b>cyanobacteria,</b> green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E
5|$|In {{animals and}} plants, a {{tricyclic}} compound called molybdopterin (which, despite the name, contains no molybdenum) is reacted with molybdate {{to form a}} complete molybdenum-containing cofactor called molybdenum cofactor. Other than the phylogenetically-ancient nitrogenases (discussed above) that fix nitrogen in some bacteria and <b>cyanobacteria,</b> all molybdenum-using enzymes (so far identified) use the molybdenum cofactor, where molybdenum is in the oxidation state of VI, similar to molybdate. Molybdenum enzymes in plants and animals catalyze the oxidation and sometimes reduction of certain small molecules {{in the process of}} regulating nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and <b>cyanobacteria</b> have two.|$|E

Results demonstrate a potential use of a <b>cyanobacterium</b> for biological control of mosquitoes...|$|R
5|$|In plants, algae, and <b>cyanobacteria,</b> photosystem II uses {{light energy}} to remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E
5|$|Salinity {{differences}} between the sections of the lake separated by the railroad causeway result in significantly different biota. A phytoplankton community dominated by green algae or <b>cyanobacteria</b> (blue-green algae) tint the water south of the causeway a greenish color. North of the causeway, the lake is dominated by Dunaliella salina, a species of algae which releases beta-carotene, and the bacteria-like haloarchaea, which together give the water an unusual reddish or purplish color, and the bacteria converts non-toxic mercury into toxic methyl mercury, which then flows into the Southern portion of the lake in a heavy brine layer through the causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, brown algae, <b>cyanobacteria,</b> slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the purification and crystallization of oxygen-evolving photosystem II core dimer complex from a thermophilic <b>cyanobacterium</b> Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. Procedures used for purification of photosystem II from the <b>cyanobacterium</b> involves cultivation of cells, isolation of thylakoid membranes, purification of crude and pure photosystem II core complexes by detergent solubilization, followed by differential centrifugation and column chromatography. The purified core dimer particles were successfully used for crystallization, {{and the methods}} and conditions used for crystallization are presented. These purification and crystallization procedures can be applied for another thermophilic <b>cyanobacterium</b> T. elongatus...|$|R
5000|$|The {{endangered}} lichen Erioderma pedicellatum, {{which is}} a symbiosis between an ascomycete fungus and a <b>cyanobacterium,</b> seems to {{only be able to}} grow in association with Frullania asagrayana. It has been suggested that the water sacs of F. asagrayana may host the <b>cyanobacterium</b> Scytonema, and that the symbiosis between this <b>cyanobacterium</b> and the germinating fungal spores of Erioderma pedicellatum can only begin within these water sacs, where the fungal hyphae assimilate a <b>cyanobacterium,</b> and needs to develop for 5 to 10 years before it reaches a visible size. [...] F. asagrayana may also benefit from the nitrogen that is being fixed by the cyanolichen growing within it. [...] Frullania tamarisci, a closely related species that is found in the United Kingdom is often found with apothecia of the ascomycete fungi Filicupula suboperculata growing on it.|$|R
