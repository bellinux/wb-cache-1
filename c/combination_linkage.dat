Social networks require text mining algorithms for a wide variety of applications such as keyword search, classification, and clustering. While search and classification are well known applications for a wide variety of scenarios, social networks have a much richer structure both in terms of text and links.

In this analysis, we first employed linkage analysis based on frailty models that take into account age of onset information to establish which regions along the chromosome are likely to harbor disease susceptibility genes for alcohol dependence. Second, we used an association analysis by exploiting linkage disequilibrium to narrow down the peak regions.

By a <b>combination</b> of <b>linkage</b> analysis, homozygosity mapping, and exome sequencing in three families, we identified mutations in CLPP as the likely cause of this phenotype. In each family, affected individuals were homozygous for a different pathogenic CLPP allele: c. 433 A>C (p. Thr 145 Pro), c. 440 G>C (p.

CLPP, a component of a mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteolytic complex, is a highly conserved endopeptidase encoded by CLPP and forms {{an element of the}} evolutionarily ancient mitochondrial unfolded-protein response (UPRmt) stress signaling pathway. Crystal-structure modeling suggests that both substitutions would alter the structure of the CLPP barrel chamber that captures unfolded proteins and exposes them to proteolysis.

30|$|About {{one-third of}} major onshore oilfields in East China are complexly faulted, and {{characterized}} by high water cut, high recovery percentage, high recovery rate, low reserve/production ratio, and low oil recovery ratio (Yu 1998; Hu 2008; Jin et al. 2009). After long-term waterflooding, {{most of them}} are at the later stage of high waterflooding. However, the oil recovery is only 35  % or so, and approximately 50  % of reserves remain to be recovered. At the stage of high water cut and high recovery percentage of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), annual oil production had accounted for 58  % of total oil production, and remaining recoverable reserves had reached 44  % of cumulative remaining recoverable reserves until the end of 2011  (Han 2010; Liu et al. 2008). The core of development and adjustment of old oilfields during the high water cut stage is “recognizing and recovering remaining oil,” yet the remaining oil in fault oilfields concentrates at the edges of faults and poor sand bodies, as well as insufficiently injected and produced areas; therefore, the edges of faults are a major target for remaining oil enrichment and potential tapping (Jiang 2013). Currently, domestic and foreign research on remaining oil at fault edges of fault oilfields mainly focuses on reservoir heterogeneity, well pattern rationality, microscopic displacement experiments, potential tapping methods, etc. (Miall 1994; Peng et al. 2007; Yue et al. 2008; Hou et al. 2014; Feng et al. 2014), seriously neglecting the influence of fault zone structural features on remaining formation, enrichment, and development (Jin et al. 2012). This influence is manifest in two aspects. The first is the different sites of remaining oil owing to the configuration of faults and formation occurrence (Qi 2004), fault <b>combination</b> pattern, fault <b>linkage</b> status (hard linkage, soft linkage, cross linkage, superimposed deformation, etc.) (Kim and Sanderson 2005), and associated micro-amplitude structural differences. The foundation of research into remaining oil at the fault edges is to examine the microscopic <b>combinations,</b> <b>linkages,</b> and associated micro-amplitude structural features of faults. The second aspect is that the remaining oil at the fault edges is affected by fault sealing (Yielding 2002), apart from its relevance to the injection–recovery relationship, such as water channeling and oil leakage occurring frequently at footwall and hanging wall of faults. Thus, quantitative evaluation of fault sealing is the core of research into remaining oil at fault edges (Bretan et al. 2003; Fu et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2014). In this paper, the Putaohua oil layer of the Xingbei Oilfield in the Daqing Placanticline was selected for the study of faults and remaining oil. According to the dynamic variation of production from development wells controlled by fault edge injection–recovery relationships, the control of fault zone structural features on remaining oil at the fault edge was analyzed, and a systematic approach for predicting the remaining oil distribution at fault edges of fault oilfields during the high water cut stage was established.|$|R

We support that each heterozygous affected individual produces three bestrophin isoforms consisting of the wild type and two abnormal forms: one containing a missense substitution and the other an in-frame deletion.
