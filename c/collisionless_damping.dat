40|$|<b>Collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> of the {{geodesic}} acoustic mode (GAM) is {{investigated by}} a drift kinetic simulation. The main {{subject of the}} study is to analyze how the magnetic configuration and the finite-orbit-width(FOW) effect of the ion drift motion affect the <b>collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> of GAM. We utilize the neoclassical transport code ”FORTEC- 3 D”, which solves the drift kinetic equation based on the delta-f method, to study these issues. In recent analytical study on GAM and zonal flow it is found that the FOW effect and the helical components of magnetic field spectrum change the damping rate of the GAM oscillation. We inspect the change of the damping rate in our simulation. First, the dependence of the damping rate on the FOW effect is investigated. We find that the <b>collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> becomes faster as typical banana width becomes wider. On the other hand, the damping rate in helical magnetic configuration is mainly determined by the effect of helical ripples. It is found that the sideband components, which appear as the axis moves inward, make the GAM damping faster.

40|$|We {{present the}} first study of the {{formation}} and dissipation of current sheets at electron scales in a wave-driven, weakly collisional, 3 D kinetic turbulence simulation. We investigate {{the relative importance of}} dissipation associated with <b>collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> via resonant wave-particle interactions versus dissipation in small-scale current sheets in weakly collisional plasma turbulence. Current sheets form self-consistently from the wave-driven turbulence, and their filling fraction is well correlated to the electron heating rate. However, the weakly collisional nature of the simulation necessarily implies that the current sheets are not significantly dissipated via Ohmic dissipation. Rather, <b>collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> via the Landau resonance with the electrons is sufficient to account for the measured heating as a function of scale in the simulation, without the need for significant Ohmic dissipation. This finding suggests the possibility that the dissipation of the current sheets is governed by resonant wave-particle interactions and that the locations of current sheets correspond spatially to regions of enhanced heating.

The Harris instability is excited most readily when the frequency is near the midpoint between the harmonics of the cyclotron frequency.

The importance of these zonal flows in the regulation of the turbulence was shown in our early simulations 1 – 3 and has been widely confirmed. Most of these flows experience fast collisionless linear damping, {{but there is a}} residual non-Maxwellian component of the flow which is undamped 4 and scales with r R.

Our preliminary results indicate very near marginal stability zero-flux states can exist where the undamped zonal flows completely damp the turbulence, as shown in Ref. 5.

Electromagnetic nature of the plasma wakes in the channel makes their excitation nonlocal. This results in the algebraic decay of the fields with time due to phase-mixing of plasma oscillations with spatially-varying fequencies. Characteristic decay rate is given by the mixing time, which corresponds to the dephasing of two plasma fluid elements separated by the collisionless skin depth. For wide channels the exact expressions for the field evolution are derived. Implications for electron acceleration in plasma channels are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{confinement}} fusion is {{a promising}} {{candidate for a}} future energy source. Its efficiency is limited by particle and heat transport due to plasma turbulence. A thorough understanding of the turbulence and turbulence moderation mechanisms, is therefore needed. The geodesic acoustic mode (GAM) is a radially localised plasma flow oscillation which contributes to the reduction of turbulent transport through velocity shearing. This thesis investigates the fundamental behaviour of the GAM through a systematic experimental study of its properties in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. In particular, {{the role of the}} plasma geometry on the scaling of the GAM frequency and amplitude, as well as the GAM radial structure are investigated in detail. The experimental data was obtained with the aid of the microwave Doppler reflectometry diagnostic. The GAM frequency scaling is compared with multiple models which reproduce the expected fundamental scaling behaviour, but do not give a satisfyingly accurate prediction. The GAM amplitude is studied in connection with damping rates predicted by models for collisional and <b>collisionless</b> Landau <b>damping</b> processes. It is found that finite orbit width effects need to be considered and that collisional damping effects cannot be neglected.

40|$|Kinetic Alfvén waves {{represent}} an important subject in space plasma physics, {{since they are}} thought to {{play a crucial role}} in the development of the turbulent energy cascade in the solar wind plasma at short wavelengths (of the order of the proton inertial length d_p and beyond). A full understanding of the physical mechanisms which govern the kinetic plasma dynamics at these scales can provide important clues on the problem of the turbulent dissipation and heating in collisionless systems. In this paper, hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations are employed to analyze in detail the features of the kinetic Alfvén waves at proton kinetic scales, in typical conditions of the solar wind environment. In particular, linear and nonlinear regimes of propagation of these fluctuations have been investigated in a single-wave situation, focusing on the physical processes of <b>collisionless</b> Landau <b>damping</b> and wave-particle resonant interaction. Interestingly, since for wavelengths close to d_p and proton plasma beta β of order unity the kinetic Alfvén waves have small phase speed compared to the proton thermal velocity, wave-particle interaction processes produce significant deformations in the core of the particle velocity distribution, appearing as phase space vortices and resulting in flat-top velocity profiles. Moreover, as the Eulerian hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell algorithm allows for a clean almost noise-free description of the velocity space, three-dimensional plots of the proton velocity distribution help to emphasize how the plasma departs from the Maxwellian configuration of thermodynamic equilibrium due to nonlinear kinetic effects...|$|R

40|$|We propose <b>collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> of fast MHD waves as a {{important}} {{mechanism for}} the heating and acceleration of winds from rotating stars. Stellar rotation causes magnetic field lines anchored at the surface to form a spiral pattern and magnetorotational winds can be driven. If the structure is a magnetically dominated, fast MHD waves generated at the surface can propagate almost radially outward and cross the field lines. The propagating waves undergo <b>collisionless</b> <b>damping</b> owing to interactions with particles trapped in magnetic mirrors that are formed by the waves themselves. The energy damping rate is especially effective where the angle between the wave propagation and the field lines becomes moderately large (∼ 20 to 80 ◦). The angle tends naturally to increase into this range because the field in magnetorotational winds develops an increasingly large azimuthal component. The dissipation of the wave energy produces heating and acceleration of the outflow. We show using specified wind structures that this damping process can be important in both solar-type stars and massive stars that have moderately large rotation rates, provided that there are high temperatures in the outer atmosphere, which we treat as extended hot coronae.
