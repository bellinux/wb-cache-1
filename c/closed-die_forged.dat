For these reasons such alloys have a relatively good workability and can be <b>closed-die</b> <b>forged</b> without preceding ingot breakdown even if the alloys contain no large fractions of the β phase at the working temperature. The present work was devoted to a combined study of the constitution and microstructural morphologies that develop in various two-step heat treatments of a single-step forged β solidifying alloy. The study included high-energy X-ray diffraction for in situ investigations of the constitution at the heat treatment temperature. It was observed that the phase transformations are quite sluggish in the material which results in fine microstructures and some conditions that significantly deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of forging design is to ensure cavity filling with minimum {{material}} wastage, minimum die load and minimum deformation energy. Given the desired shape of the component and the material to be forged, this goal is achieved by optimising the initial volume of the billet, the geometrical parameters of the die and the process parameters. It is general industrial practise to fix the initial billet volume and the die parameters using empirical relationships derived from practical experience. In this paper a basis for optimising some of the parameters for simple <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> is proposed.

Excess metal is squeezed out of the die cavities; this is called flash.

40|$|In <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> {{the flash}} {{geometry}} should be such as {{to ensure that}} the cavity is completely filled just as the two dies come into contact at the parting plane. If metal is caused to extrude through the flash gap as the dies approach the point of contact — a practice generally resorted to as a means of ensuring complete filling — dies are unnecessarily stressed in a high-stress regime (as the flash is quite thin and possibly cooled by then), which reduces the die life and unnecessarily increases the energy requirement of the operation. It is therefore necessary to carefully determine the dimensions of the flash land and flash thickness — the two parameters, apart from friction at the land, which control the lateral flow. The dimensions should be such that the flow into the longitudinal cavity is controlled throughout the operation, ensuring complete filling just as the dies touch at the parting plane. The design of the flash must be related to the shape and size of the forging cavity as the control of flow has to be exercised throughout the operation: it is possible to do this if the mechanics of how the lateral extrusion into the flash takes place is understood for specific cavity shapes and sizes. The work reported here is part of an ongoing programme investigating flow in <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging.</b> A simple closed shape (no longitudinal flow) which may correspond to the last stages of a real forging operation is analysed using the stress equilibrium approach. Metal from the cavity (flange) flows into the flash by shearing in the cavity in one of the three modes considered here: for a given cavity the mode with the least energy requirement is assumed to be the most realistic. On this basis a map has been developed which, given the depth and width of the cavity as well as the flash thickness, will tell the designer of the most likely mode (of the three modes considered) in which metal in the cavity will shear and then flow into the flash gap.

The paper aims the {{determination}} of the friction force by means of external friction stress, at the severe plastic deformation processing using cyclic <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> method. It is known that the total force used at the severe plastic deformation by the method of multiaxial forging is being composed by the deformation force itself and the friction force between the semi-product and the deformation tools. Once the friction stresses known, for a certain material, one can determine the friction force corresponding for a given deformation of a semi-product of a particular shape and sizes. By means of the flowing curve of the semi-product material one can determine the deformation force, which together with the friction force give the total necessary force for a deformation and so one can choose the necessary equipment for the processing of the material by severe plastic deformation.

Extensive research and development work is being undertaken, internationally, to analyse the stresses in forging dies and the flow of material in forged components.

This study attempts to relate some of the important parameters involved when considering, simple upsetting, closed die forging and extrusion forging. A literature survey showed some of the empirical graphical and statistical methods of load prediction together with analytical methods of estimating load and energy. Investigations of the effects of high strain rate and temperature on the stress-strain properties of materials are also evident. In the present study special equipment including an experimental drop hammer and various die-sets have been designed and manufactured. Instrumentation to measure load/time and displacement/time behaviour, of the deformed metal, has been incorporated and calibrated. A high speed camera was used to record the behaviour mode of test pieces used in the simple upsetting tests. Dynamic and quasi-static material properties for the test materials, lead and aluminium alloy, were measured using the drop hammer and a compression-test machine. Analytically two separate mathematical solutions have been developed: A numerical technique using a lumped-mass model for the analysis of simple upsetting and <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> and, for extrusion forging, an analysis which equates the shear and compression energy requirements to the work done by the forging load. Cylindrical test pieces were used for all the experiments and both dry and lubricated test conditions were investigated.

Aiming towards process improvement and stronger shackles development, the main purpose of this study is, with the help of numerical simulation, to understand, predict and control all aspects that can be involved in the manufacturing of a WB 125 tons shackle. In close collaboration with forging industry Le Béon Manufacturing in Lorient area, forging experiments were carried out on a 0. 3 MJ friction drive screw press and at temperatures higher than 900 °C. In order to form both jaws, two successive sequences of <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> and deflashing are performed. It follows an open-die forging stage to form the body. Finally, the crown is obtained using a ram bending process. The numerical model presented herein is developed using a fully coupled 3 D thermomechanical analysis and is conducted on Abaqus software. Tools are made of AISI H 13 with constant thermophysical properties. Mechanical properties of the 34 CrNiMo 6 used for the workpiece at temperatures ranging from 900 to 1200 °C and strain rates ranging from 0. 1 to 1 /s were extracted from the literature. To describe the compression behavior, the Johnson-Cook flow stress model has been used.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on improving the material yield in <b>closed-die</b> <b>forging</b> and rolling. The former {{is restricted to}} the manufacturing of heavy crown wheels and front axle beams and the latter to the hot rolling of steel slabs. To enhance the yield the commercial FE-codes Form 2 D and Dyna 3 D are used. Results from forging simulations are strengthened by full scale experiments. The research is carried out in near contact with the Swedish steel and engineering industry. In closed die forging, two bulk forming problems are treated: How to improve the tool design and how to change the pre-form geometry for decreasing the amount of material exiting the flash gap? In slab rolling, two problems related to material defects are considered: How to eliminate existing surface cracks and how to prevent the formation of voids around macro-inclusions embedded in the steel matrix? Internal voids might be the reason for scrapping the whole workpiece. Considering the forging of crown wheels, a new concept is proposed. For making the central hole of the product, the traditional method was forging a thin circular plate which was then sheared off and scrapped. Using the new technique this operation is replaced by forging a conical tap in the centre, which is then discarded. Doing so, the inner scrap material decreased with about 15 %. The idea {{has been used in}} production for seven years. – Regarding the forging of front axle beams, a quasi- 3 D method is used comprising full scale measurements of the axial material flow. Here the theoretical material yield increased 2 - 7 %. Regarding rolling, the initial surface cracks in the simulations are V-shaped with a crack angle of 6 o and of depth 5 - 20 mm. The inclusions are cylindrical and either three times harder or three times softer than the matrix. The behaviour of the cracks and the inclusions are studied as influenced by process parameters. Current industrial input data are used as a reference. – It is concluded that longitudinal cracks cannot be totally eliminated. During rolling their V-shape gradually changes to Y-shape and a remaining oxide flake separates the crack bottom surfaces. For minimizing the detrimental influence of the entrapped oxide, an early closure of the crack bottom is important. Throughout the remaining rolling schedule the entrapped oxide is then torn to pieces with large areas of virgin metal in between ensuring a strong bond. The following recommendations are given for the longitudinal cracks: Light drafts/pass {{at the beginning of the}} rolling schedule followed by heavy ones. – Contradictory to longitudinal cracks it is concluded that transversal cracks are possible to eliminate. When eliminated, the initial bottom of the crack coincides with the slab surface. No folds are formed. For the transversal cracks light drafts/pass are proposed together with reversal rolling, the latter for avoiding crack folding. – Voids are easiest formed around hard macro-inclusions in the centre of the slab.

Initially, the various forging defects that occur in the components during <b>closed-die</b> hot <b>forging</b> process are investigated. The investigation is done with the help of Quality Assurance department in a forging industry. During investigation, the various defects that causes high rejection rates are identified and unfilling defect which has major contribution in high rejection rate is selected for study purpose. The process parameters considered for study purpose are- billet weight, heating temperature, heating time each at three levels and required output is final job weight. To obtain the optimal process parameter combination, optimization is carried out by the Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio analysis of Taguchi method using L 9 Orthogonal Array. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to present the influence of process parameters on filling the job weight. Results obtained by Taguchi method and by ANOVA method, are compared and found that they match closely with each other. Further multiple regression equation is formulated for estimating the predicted values of job weight. The values are then evaluated by conducting confirmation experiments to verify the validity of this study. In this way, the optimum levels of process parameters can be predicted. Finally it is concluded that, in order to reduce the rejection rate due to unfilling forging defect, the best process parameter combination which is derived through this study must be followed during the production process...|$|R
