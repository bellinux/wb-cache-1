6000|$|I began again. Up jumped mademoiselle for {{the second}} time, and tripped {{across the room to}} a <b>cheval-glass.</b> [...] "No!" [...] I heard her say to herself, [...] "I have not discomposed my head in kissing my angels. I may come back and pose for my picture." ...|$|E

60|$|After {{ringing the}} bell which would summon Madame Mantalini, Kate {{glanced at the}} card, {{and saw that it}} {{displayed}} the name of 'Scaley,' together with some other information to which she had not had time to refer, when her attention was attracted by Mr Scaley himself, who, walking up to one of the <b>cheval-glasses,</b> gave it a hard poke in the centre with his stick, as coolly {{as if it had been}} made of cast iron.|$|R
60|$|A liveried footman {{opened the}} door, and in reply to Ralph's inquiry whether Madame Mantalini was at home, ushered them, through a {{handsome}} hall and up a spacious staircase, {{into the show}} saloon, which comprised two spacious drawing-rooms, and exhibited an immense variety of superb dresses and materials for dresses: some arranged on stands, others laid carelessly on sofas, and others again, scattered over the carpet, hanging on the <b>cheval-glasses,</b> or mingling, in some other way, with the rich furniture of various descriptions, which was profusely displayed.|$|R
60|$|In the Burlington Arcade, I observe, with {{peculiar}} pleasure, {{a primitive}} state of manners to have superseded the baneful influences of ultra civilisation. Nothing can surpass {{the innocence of}} the ladies' shoe-shops, the artificial-flower repositories, and the head-dress depots. They are in strange hands {{at this time of}} year--hands of unaccustomed persons, who are imperfectly acquainted with the prices of the goods, and contemplate them with unsophisticated delight and wonder. The children of these virtuous people exchange familiarities in the Arcade, and temper the asperity of the two tall beadles. Their youthful prattle blends in an unwonted manner with the harmonious shade of the scene, and the general effect is, as of the voices of birds in a grove. In this happy restoration of the golden time, it has been my privilege even to see the bigger beadle's wife. She brought him his dinner in a basin, and he ate it in his arm-chair, and afterwards fell asleep like a satiated child. At Mr. Truefitt's, the excellent hairdresser's, they are learning French to beguile the time; and even the few solitaries left on guard at Mr. Atkinson's, the perfumer's round the corner (generally the most inexorable gentleman in London, and the most scornful of three-and- sixpence), condescend a little, as they drowsily bide or recall their turn for chasing the ebbing Neptune on the ribbed sea-sand. From Messrs. Hunt and Roskell's, the jewellers, all things are absent but the precious stones, and the gold and silver, and the soldierly pensioner at the door with his decorated breast. I might stand night and day for a month to come, in Saville-row, with my tongue out, yet not find a doctor to look at it for love or money. The dentists' instruments are rusting in their drawers, and their horrible cool parlours, where people pretend to read the Every-Day Book and not to be afraid, are doing penance for their grimness in white sheets. The light-weight of shrewd appearance, with one eye always shut up, as if he were eating a sharp gooseberry in all seasons, who usually stands at the gateway of the livery-stables on very little legs under a very large waistcoat, has gone to Doncaster. Of such undesigning aspect is his guileless yard now, with its gravel and scarlet beans, and the yellow Break housed under a glass roof in a corner, that I almost believe I could not be taken in there, if I tried. In the places of business of the great tailors, the <b>cheval-glasses</b> are dim and dusty for lack of being looked into. Ranges of brown paper coat and waistcoat bodies look as funereal {{as if they were the}} hatchments of the customers with whose names they are inscribed; the measuring tapes hang idle on the wall; the order-taker, left on the hopeless chance of some one looking in, yawns in the last extremity over the book of patterns, as if he were trying to read that entertaining library. The hotels in Brook-street have no one in them, and the staffs of servants stare disconsolately for next season out of all the windows. The very man who goes about like an erect Turtle, between two boards recommendatory of the Sixteen Shilling Trousers, is aware of himself as a hollow mockery, and eats filberts while he leans his hinder shell against a wall.|$|R
60|$|Next, in {{the course}} of their review of the chamber, the searchers came to the <b>cheval-glass,</b> into whose depths they looked with an {{involuntary}} horror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow playing on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions along the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful countenances stooping to look in.|$|E
60|$|Luca {{turned again}} to the statue; and, at the same moment, Father Rocco softly moved the <b>cheval-glass</b> toward the open doorway between the two rooms, placing it at such an angle as to make it reflect the figures of the persons in the smaller studio. He did this with {{significant}} quickness and precision. It was evidently {{not the first time}} he had used the glass for purposes of secret observation.|$|E
60|$|She passed {{across the}} room, {{and on her}} way paused before an old <b>cheval-glass,</b> before which were {{suspended}} two silver candlesticks containing lighted wax candles. She looked steadfastly at her own reflection. A little smile parted her lips. In the bedroom of this quaint farmhouse she was looking upon a face and a figure which the illustrated papers and the enterprise of the modern photographer had combined to make familiar to the world.|$|E
6000|$|The {{words were}} spoken in all sincerity {{and to help}} forward any absurd [...] "dressing-up" [...] {{amusement}} that the children might take into their minds. But the young savage has {{a keen sense of}} the ludicrous. His Majesty the King swung the great <b>cheval-glass</b> down, and saw his head crowned with the staring horror of a fool's cap--a thing which his father would rend to pieces if it ever came into his office. He plucked it off, and burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|She {{broke loose}} {{from him and}} ran to the bed and, {{throwing}} her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stock-still for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed {{in the way of the}} <b>cheval-glass</b> he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said: ...|$|E
60|$|On {{leaving the}} house {{he looked up at}} the bedroom again. Grace, {{surrounded}} by a sufficient number of candles to answer all purposes of self-criticism, was standing before a <b>cheval-glass</b> that her father had lately bought expressly for her use; she was bonneted, cloaked, and gloved, and glanced over her shoulder into the mirror, estimating her aspect. Her face was lit with the natural elation of a young girl hoping to inaugurate on the morrow an intimate acquaintance with a new, interesting, and powerful friend.|$|E
60|$|Now, the old lord, {{who was a}} VERY old lord, said nothing, but mumbled and chuckled in a {{state of}} great delight, no less with the nuptial bonnets and their wearers, than with his own address in getting such a fine woman for his wife; and the young lady, who was a very lively young lady, seeing the old lord in this rapturous condition, chased the old lord behind a <b>cheval-glass,</b> and then and there kissed him, while Madame Mantalini and the other young lady looked, discreetly, another way.|$|E
60|$|Gustavus, a slight, {{handsome}} man {{of a good}} height, was standing before a <b>cheval-glass</b> when Bjelke came in. Francois, the priceless valet His Majesty had brought back from his last pleasure-seeking visit to pre-revolutionary Paris some five years ago, was standing back judicially to consider the domino he had just placed upon the royal shoulders. Baron Armfelt whom the conspirators accused of wielding the most sinister of all the sinister influences that perverted the King's mind--dressed {{from head to foot}} in shimmering white satin, lounged on a divan with all the easy familiarity permitted to this most intimate of courtiers, the associate of all royal follies.|$|E
60|$|Knight {{turned his}} head wearily towards the house. The ground rose rapidly on nearing the {{shrubbery}} in which he stood, raising it almost to a level with {{the first floor of}} The Crags. Elfride's dressing-room lay in the salient angle in this direction, and it was lighted by two windows in such a position that, from Knight's standing-place, his sight passed through both windows, and raked the room. Elfride was there; she was pausing between the two windows, looking at her figure in the <b>cheval-glass.</b> She regarded herself long and attentively in front; turned, flung back her head, and observed the reflection over her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Luca {{shrugged his}} shoulders, {{and went back}} to his statue. Father Rocco, who had been engaged during the last ten minutes in mixing wet plaster to the right {{consistency}} for taking a cast, suspended his occupation; and crossing the room to a corner next the partition, removed from it a <b>cheval-glass</b> which stood there. He lifted it away gently, while his brother's back was turned, carried it close to the table at which he had been at work, and then resumed his employment of mixing the plaster. Having at last prepared the composition for use, he laid it over the exposed half of the statuette with a neatness and dexterity which showed him to be a practiced hand at cast-taking. Just as he had covered the necessary extent of surface, Luca turned round from his statue.|$|E
60|$|Fate {{intended}} {{me for a}} singularly fortunate man. Properly, I {{ought to}} have been born in June, which being, as is well known, the luckiest month in all the year for such events, should, by thoughtful parents, be more generally selected. How it was I came to be born in May, which is, on the other hand, of all the twelve the most unlucky, as I have proved, I leave to those more conversant with the subject to explain. An early nurse, the first human being of whom I have any distinct recollection, unhesitatingly attributed the unfortunate fact to my natural impatience; which quality she at the same time predicted would lead me into even greater trouble, a prophecy impressed by future events with the stamp of prescience. It was from this same bony lady that I likewise learned the manner of my coming. It seems that I arrived, quite unexpectedly, two hours after news had reached the house of the ruin of my father's mines through inundation; misfortunes, as it was expounded to me, never coming singly in this world to any one. That all things might be of a piece, my poor mother, attempting to reach the bell, fell against and broke the <b>cheval-glass,</b> thus further saddening herself with the conviction--for no amount of reasoning ever succeeded in purging her Welsh blood of its natural superstition--that whatever might be the result of future battles with my evil star, the first seven years of tiny existence had been, by her act, doomed to disaster.|$|E
60|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekyll's door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden to the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or the dissecting-rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a celebrated surgeon; and, his own tastes being rather chemical than anatomical, had changed the destination of the block {{at the bottom of the}} garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in that part of his friend's quarters; and he eyed the dingy windowless structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the farther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctor's cabinet. It was a large room, fitted round with glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a <b>cheval-glass</b> and a business-table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deadly sick; he did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice.|$|E
6000|$|I tapped lightly; {{no answer}} came. Someone was talking; {{it sounded like}} a girl's voice. I pushed the door further open and walked in; such was the custom of the house. It was a large room, built over the yard, lighted by one high window, before which was the {{engraving}} desk, shaded under a screen of tissue paper. At the further end of the room stood a large <b>cheval-glass,</b> and in front of this, its back towards me, was a figure that excited my curiosity; so that remaining where I was, partly hidden behind a large easel, I watched it for awhile in silence. Above a heavily flounced blue skirt, which fell in creases on the floor and trailed a couple of yards or so behind, it wore a black low-cut sleeveless bodice--much too big for it--of the fashion early Victorian. A good deal of dark-brown hair, fastened up by hair-pins that stuck out in all directions like quills upon a porcupine, suggesting collapse with every movement, was ornamented by three enormous green feathers, one of which hung limply over the lady's left ear. Three times, while I watched, unnoticed, the lady propped it into a more befitting attitude, and three times, limp and intoxicated-looking, it fell back into its former foolish position. Her long, thin arms, displaying a pair of brilliantly red elbows, pointed to quite a dangerous degree, terminated in hands so very sunburnt as to convey the impression of a pair of remarkably well-fitting gloves. Her right hand grasped and waved with determination a large lace fan, her left clutched fiercely the front of her skirt. With a sweeping curtsey to herself in the glass, which would have been more effective could she have avoided tying her legs together with her skirt--a contretemps necessitating the use of both hands and a succession of jumps before she could disentangle herself--she remarked so soon as she had recovered her balance: ...|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes--once {{or twice}} in a week--that lady visited the upper regions in which the child lived. She came like a vivified figure out of the Magasin des Modes--blandly smiling in the most {{beautiful}} new clothes and little gloves and boots. Wonderful scarfs, laces, and jewels glittered about her. She had always a new bonnet on, and flowers bloomed perpetually in it, or else magnificent curling ostrich feathers, soft and snowy as camellias. She nodded twice or thrice patronizingly to the little boy, who {{looked up from his}} dinner or from the pictures of soldiers he was painting. When she left the room, an odour of rose, or some other magical fragrance, lingered about the nursery. She was an unearthly being in his eyes, superior to his father--to all the world: to be worshipped and admired at a distance. To drive with that lady in the carriage was an awful rite: he sat up in the back seat and did not dare to speak: he gazed with all his eyes at the beautifully dressed Princess opposite to him. Gentlemen on splendid prancing horses came up and smiled and talked with her. How her eyes beamed upon all of them! Her hand used to quiver and wave gracefully as they passed. When he went out with her he had his new red dress on. His old brown holland was good enough when he stayed at home. Sometimes, when she was away, and Dolly his maid was making his bed, he came into his mother's room. It was as the abode of a fairy to him--a mystic chamber of splendour and delights. There in the wardrobe hung those wonderful robes--pink and blue and many-tinted. There was the jewel-case, silver-clasped, and the wondrous bronze hand on the dressing-table, glistening all over with a hundred rings. There was the <b>cheval-glass,</b> that miracle of art, in which he could just see his own wondering head and the reflection of Dolly (queerly distorted, and as if up in the ceiling), plumping and patting the pillows of the bed. Oh, thou poor lonely little benighted boy! Mother is the name for God in the lips and hearts of little children; and here was one who was worshipping a stone! ...|$|E
