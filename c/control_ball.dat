A NEWCO N 36726 manual gate valve, a Truline 330 AITFM-CH-SQ pneumatic flow <b>control</b> <b>ball</b> valve, and a Fisher Valves Type 667 -EWT-DVC 6200 pressure regulating valve are located along this pipe. The manual gate valve is open fully during testing. The pneumatic flow <b>control</b> <b>ball</b> valve is also fully open during testing. The pressure regulating valve is controlled by a Fisher FIELDVUE DVC 6200 Digital Valve Controller. The digital valve controller is set to maintain a constant downstream pressure of 413.7 [*]kPa as an individual blow down test is underway. Downstream of the pressure regulating valve, the air flows into the air diverter plenum. Six Kunkle 913 BFEM 03 pressure relief valves provide means to vent over-pressurized air, {{both before and after}} the manual gate valve. Flow static pressure is measured before and after each control valve within the piping system, using both Ashcroft analog pressure gauges and Honeywell FPA 060 -C 860 – 15 digital pressure transducers.|$|E

40|$|The {{long-term}} impact of practice with different task constraints on perceptual skill is relatively un-explored. This {{study examined the}} influence of extensive practice, i. e., more than a 1000 h of structured practice, with domain-specific task constraints on perceptual skill associated with the passing action. Despite performing the same passing skill, {{it is not known}} whether long-term exposure to specific soccer or futsal task constraints influences the players’ attunement to environmental information. This study examined this issue by assessing the attention orientation of soccer (n = 24) and futsal players (n = 24) during modified games (6 vs. 6). Futsal players had higher scanning behavior during ball reception and control (40 % more ball-player attention alternations) while soccer players mainly scanned the environment when not in ball possession (25 % more attention alternations). We suggest that the behavioral differences found are elicited by the extensive domain-specific practice.

40|$|Abstract—For today’s {{computer}} users, {{the mouse}} plays {{such an important}} role that it dominates the interaction interface in personal computer {{for nearly half a}} century since it was invented. However, the mouse is gradually unfit for the demand of modern 3 D display techniques, e. g. 3 D-projection or-screen, for the reason that the relevant interactions are confined in a surface. Although some new methods such as computer vision based techniques attempt to bridge the human-computer barrier, they suffer from many limitations such as ambiguity in multi-targets and dependence on light. This paper presents a battery-free device called Tagball for 3 D human-computer interaction via RFID tags. Tagball devises a <b>control</b> <b>ball,</b> on which N passive tags are attached, for users to generate two basic kinds of interactive commands: translation and rotation. Instead of locating N tags independently, we model the ball as a whole in a more cooperative way under the circumstance that their geometric relationships are known in advance. In addition, we consider the phase values measured by M RF antennas for these N tags as observations of the ball state. Our key innovations are the studies on motion behaviors of a group of tags by using Extended Kalman Filter, and the implementation based on purely Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID products. The systematical evaluation shows that Tagball traces the ball translation to 1. 5 cm and identifies ball orientation to 1. 8 ◦ in 3 D space...|$|E
40|$|At Domfer Metal Powders, {{the ball}} milling {{operation}} is critical since it determines many {{characteristics of the}} final product, such as density, green strength, compressibility and dimensional change. Highly variable input material properties and operational procedures accompanied by poor product feedback frequency generate large variations in powder properties. The goal of the research {{is to develop a}} model-based control system for the ball milling process of metal powder. The following research objectives are aimed at reducing process variations while maximizing throughput: include ball mill physics into design and computer models, develop control strategies and computer architectures for real-time control, and develop process monitoring and fault diagnosis techniques. Ball mill size reduction theory is presented as a basis for process characterization. Next, process physics are described along with the measurability and controllability of the variables. Then, plant trials are performed to define system behavior and performance specifications of variables and sensors. After that, a sampler for metal powder is developed to automate the entire sieve analysis process. A new ball mill model is created for open-circuit dry ball milling of metal powders. The process model is a combination of rules, equations and heuristics and is implemented using an agent based architecture that can deal with multiple data streams and a network of related sub-models of different sizes and operating time scales. The model architecture is integrated using a programmable logic controller. Control and monitoring algorithms are developed in low-level PC language. A performance plant trial validated the control system and demonstrated that ball milling product specifications, namely size distribution and apparent density, are achievable and maintainable at a 99. 7 % confidence interval. This new technology will endow Domfer with a serious lead in metal powder manufacturing. Key words. model-based <b>control,</b> <b>ball</b> milling, metal powder...|$|E
40|$|To {{consistently}} produce {{high quality}} products, a quality management system, {{such as the}} ISO 9001, 2000 or TS 16949 must be practically implemented. One core instrument of the TS 16949 MSA (Measurement System Analysis) is to rank the capability of a measurement system and ensure the quality characteristics of the product would likely be transformed through the whole manufacturing process. It is important {{to reduce the risk}} of Type I errors (acceptable goods are misjudged as defective parts) and Type II errors (defective parts are misjudged as good parts). An ideal measuring system would have the statistical characteristic of zero error, but such a system could hardly exist. Hence, to maintain better control of the variance that might occur in the manufacturing process, MSA is necessary for better quality <b>control.</b> <b>Ball</b> screws, which are a key component in precision machines, have significant attributes with respect to positioning and transmitting. Failures of lead accuracy and axial-gap of a ball screw can cause negative and expensive effects in machine positioning accuracy. Consequently, a functional measurement system can incur great savings by detecting Type I and Type II errors. If the measurement system fails with respect to specification of the product, it will likely misjudge Type I and Type II errors. Inspectors normally follow the MSA regulations for accuracy measurement, but the choice of measuring system does not merely depend on some simple indices. In this paper, we examine the stability of a measuring system by using a Monte Carlo simulation to establish bias, linearity variance of the normal distribution, and the probability density function. Further, we forecast the possible area distribution in the real case. After the simulation, the measurement capability will be improved, which helps the user classify the measurement system and establish measurement regulations for better performance and monitoring of the precision of the ball screw...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{most common}} {{problems}} in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders are eye contact, {{being able to}} follow objects {{for a long time}} and lack of attention. Sports activities are known to prevent the negative symptoms of Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The Badminton sports branch has a positive effect on the individual's object <b>control,</b> <b>ball</b> focus, and attention, reaction, perception and coordination characteristics. For this reason, racket sports are considered to be an important tool in reducing the lack of attention in individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Aim: The aim of this study, Investigation of the effect of simplified Badminton exercises on attention focus development of individuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and is the assessment of the level of retention of an acquisition. Material and Method: The study group was randomly selected 3 out of 6 children who are not mentally retarded and responded to commands among 10 children aged 12 - 14 years in Isparta Gülşen Önal Autistic Children Education Centre. The mean age of children was 12. 6 ± 1. 15 years, height was 154, 3 ± 5, 13 cm and weight was 52 ± 3 kg. Benton Visual Memory Test, Bourdon Visual Attention Test and Stroop Effect Test were used as the measurement tool. Children were performed adaptation exercises for 2 weeks and from simple to difficult badminton exercise drills for 10 weeks. For each individual, 3 studies were performed at different times and 60 minutes per week. Tests were performed at 3 different periods, to be 10 weeks Badminton exercise process before and after and also retention test after 8 weeks interval. The obtained data were evaluated by Wilcoxon test. Results: According to the results of all measurement instruments of the students participating in the research, there is a numerical rise between pre - test and post - test values. When the results of the retention test with the last test are evaluated, there was no decrease in the two participants according to the Benton visual memory test results, but the other participant had also decline, although not at the beginning level. Burdon attention test and Stroop effect test showed that there was no return to baseline in all participants despite a numerical decrease. Conclusion: We can say that Badminton exercise program has a positive effect on attention level. Individuals with autistic spectrum disorder can be said to have a positive influence on the development of eye contact, long-time focus of objects and attention level development. Badminton exercises can be offered as a model to improve attentiveness to children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder if the duration of participatory study is increased...|$|E
