5|$|The Guardians TV {{and radio}} blog stated that Friends has {{impacted}} {{the creation of}} other television shows such as How I Met Your Mother. The similarities between the two consist of both sitcoms taking place in Manhattan, a group of white adults who are funny and have similar <b>character</b> <b>traits.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bart's <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> of rebelliousness and {{disrespect for}} {{authority}} have {{been compared to}} that of America's founding fathers, and he has been described as an updated version of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, rolled into one. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner describes Bart as a nihilist, a philosophical position that argues that existence is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} <b>character</b> <b>traits,</b> however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship {{in his role}} as an able, determined soldier and in his embodiment of shared chivalric ideals. In religious observance he also fulfilled the expectations of his age: he attended chapel regularly and gave alms generously.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} developmental {{changes in the}} ability of young children to infer the personality traits of other people and to use information about these traits to predict their future behavior. Nursery school's children(two to four year-olds) watched a series of stories on TV. Each of the <b>character's</b> <b>traits</b> could be inferred from these stories. The subjects were asked to infer each of the <b>character's</b> <b>traits</b> and predict each of the character's behavioral reaction to a new event The main results were as follows:(1) by about 2 1 / 2 years of age, children have begun to infer each of the <b>character's</b> <b>traits</b> from a series of stories; (2) by about 3 1 / 2 years of age, children have begun to predict the future behavior of the characters from the <b>character's</b> <b>traits</b> inferred...|$|R

5|$|Higson {{stated that}} he was {{instructed}} by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond, except the original Fleming version. As the background to Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice {{as well as his}} own and Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's <b>character</b> <b>traits,</b> including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E
5|$|Naylor writes {{books for}} children, teens, and adults. Writing sporadically, Naylor {{typically}} takes {{several years to}} finish a book. With about 10 notebooks next to her workspace, she writes down story ideas and <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> when she thinks of them. She considered Shiloh to be a deviation from the norm because she finished the first draft in just eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|As Griffith stopped portraying {{some of the}} sheriff's more unsophisticated <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> and mannerisms, it was {{impossible}} for him to create his own problems and troubles in the manner of other central sitcom characters such as Lucy in I Love Lucy or Archie Bunker in All in the Family, whose problems were the result of their temperaments, philosophies and attitudes. Consequently, the characters around Taylor were employed to create the problems and troubles, with rock-solid Taylor stepping in as problem solver, mediator, advisor, disciplinarian and counselor.|$|E

5|$|In myth, {{the gods}} behave much like humans. They feel emotion; they can eat, drink, fight, weep, sicken, and die. Some have unique <b>character</b> <b>traits.</b> Set is {{aggressive}} and impulsive, and Thoth, patron {{of writing and}} knowledge, is prone to long-winded speeches. Yet overall, the gods are more like archetypes than well drawn characters. Their behavior is inconsistent, and their thoughts and motivations are rarely stated. Most myths about them lack highly developed characters and plots, because the symbolic meaning of the myths {{was more important than}} elaborate storytelling.|$|E
5|$|The Bond {{character}} is a Secret Service agent, code number 007, residing in London but active internationally. Bond was a composite character who {{was based on a}} number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War, to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes; Bond's name was appropriated from the American ornithologist James Bond. Bond has a number of <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> which run throughout the books, including an enjoyment of cars, a love of food and drink, and an average intake of sixty custom-made cigarettes a day.|$|E
5|$|As Heyer's {{popularity}} increased, {{other authors}} began to imitate her style. In May 1950, {{one of her}} readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's, reusing names, <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday's Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off These Old Shades. Heyer completed {{a detailed analysis of}} the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased. Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.|$|E

5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several <b>character</b> <b>traits,</b> such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question many ideas and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5|$|The {{title is}} known for its intense difficulty, which {{contributes}} to its reputation as a black sheep in the franchise. Reviewers viewed The Lost Levels {{as an extension of the}} original release, especially its difficulty progression. Journalists appreciated the game's challenge when spectating speedruns, and recognized the game as a precursor to the franchise's subculture in which fans create and share nearly impossible levels. This sequel gave Luigi his first <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> and introduced the poison mushroom item, which would be used throughout the Mario franchise. The Lost Levels was the most popular game on the Disk System, for which it sold about 2.5 million copies. It is remembered among the most difficult games by Nintendo and in the video game medium, and among the least important games in the Mario series.|$|E

5|$|Players {{and game}} journalists {{consider}} the game among the Spectrum's best. Sabre Wulf {{was the first}} of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. Retro Gamer credited the character's name and <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with a hat and exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game 8-bit era's character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, Mire Mare, was planned to have been similar to Sabre Wulf in gameplay. Rare, the successor to Ultimate, later released a side-scrolling platformer in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console—also titled Sabre Wulf—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the Sabre Wulf's puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original Sabre Wulf appear in other games, including Rare's Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer considered Sabreman's recurring appearance to be proof of Rare's interest in the character and series.|$|E
5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E
5|$|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: Though at {{an early}} age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75, he has an endearing {{character}} and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> which bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) sit next to her. John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role, and admits passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate.|$|E

5|$|As {{the plans}} for three {{different}} versions of the game appeared, the staff realized {{that it was impossible to}} write three storylines in-house. After searching through known video game writers, they decided to consider writers in other fields. The writer suggested by Maeda was Shin Kibayashi, who was famous in Japan for his work on multiple manga and television series. Kibayashi was initially approached by Kozaki through their shared editor, and was pitched the project by the staff in December 2012. Kibayashi was going to refuse the project as he had a tight work schedule, but after both he and his daughter played through a copy of Awakening provided by staff, Kibayashi decided to accept and wrote an initial draft story. Despite his initial minimal commitment of a ten-page summary for each storyline, he became fond of the characters and felt that 10 pages were not enough, and thus the full summary for Birthright extended to about 500 pages. After delivering his work, he then wrote summaries of equal length for Conquest and Revelation, driven by the need to create a high-quality story, partially to surpass his daughter's pressuring expectations, and ended up writing enough script to fill two books. While the Japanese titles for Birthright and Conquest were written in kanji, the third storyline's title was written in katakana to distinguish it from the other two. A great deal of the <b>character</b> <b>traits</b> for the royals of Hoshido and Nohr were contributed by Kibayashi. After he had done his work on the storylines, other writers took over much of the rest of the work. The main scenario writer for the Revelation storyline was Yukinori Kitajima, a writer associated with the Senran Kagura series. He and other staff from his company Synthese also wrote the support conversations for Birthright and Conquest. One of the principal writers for all three story routes was Nami Komuro, who had previously worked on Awakening.|$|E
