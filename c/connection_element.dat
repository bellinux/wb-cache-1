40|$|Abstract: The {{applicability}} {{and productivity}} of the hydroforming process can be increased by combining pre- and post-forming processes such as bending, piercing, and embedding. For the fabrication of structural parts, hollow bodies with connecting nuts are widely used to connect parts together. It usually requires multiple steps and devices for welding and/or screwing. Therefore, the hydro-embedding process, which combines hydraulic embedding of the connec-tion element with the hydroforming process, is investigated in this study. To increase the con-nection force, the authors focus on the optimization of {{the shape of the}} <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> and rotational embedding of the <b>connection</b> <b>element.</b> The effects of the shape of the screw tip, the screw thread, and the thread shape on the connection force have been investigated, and the optimal shape of the <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> has been determined.

40|$|Conventional {{approaches}} to the design and analysis of steel frames commonly assume the structure to be of either simple or rigid construction. In the simple construction approach, connections between members are not capable of transmitting moment, whereas in the rigid construction approach, full rotational continuity is provided. In practice, however, most connections are semirigid possessing some degree of rotational stiffness {{as a function of}} the applied load. A method for the nonlinear analysis of space frames incorporating the effect of flexible or semirigid joints is presented. A two-node zero length <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> with three rotational degrees of freedom per node is used to model the joint. The <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> may be introduced at one or both ends of a general thin-walled beam-column element, via kinematic transformation and static condensation. The proposed <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> may be represented by any set of nonlinear coupled or uncoupled, in-plane, out-of-plane, and torsional moment-rotation relationships.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a robust 2 -noded <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> has been {{developed}} for modelling the bolted end-plate connection between a steel beam and column at elevated temperatures. The <b>connection</b> <b>element</b> allows the element nodes to be placed at the reference plane with offset and the non-uniform temperature distributions within the connection. In this model the connection failure due to bending, axial tension, compression and vertical shear are considered. The influence of the axial tensile force of the connected beam on the connection is also taken into account. This model has the advantages of both the previous simple and component-based models. A total of 23 fire tests were used to extensively validate the model. It {{can be seen that}} the current model is robust and has a capability to predict the behaviour of a bolted end-plate connection under fire attack with reasonable accuracy. Compared to the tested results the predictions of the current model were mainly on the conservative side. Hence, the model can be used for structural fire engineering design on steel-framed composite buildings. The idea described in this paper can also easily be applied to develop other kinds of connections, such as simple connections, column based connections or hollow section connections, and so on.
