25|$|Pay-to-play {{was cited}} {{as a cause of}} major damage {{to the quality of the}} New York comedy scene. In {{economic}} terms, a pay-to-play strategy elevates those people who can afford to perform for nothing, or <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for their stage-time, which has nothing to do with their quality as an act. The pay-to-play promoter is able to profit from the goodwill and desire to perform of the acts, while discouraging appearances by those who cannot afford to perform without payment.|$|E

50|$|In normal {{insurance}} markets, insurers price high-risk {{individuals at}} a higher premium to discourage them from buying insurance and offer lower-risk individuals lower premiums.

Young people, on the other hand, for whom ill health is not a major concern, often do not buy health insurance even though it is relatively cheap for them to do so.|$|R

40|$|What is {{the value}} of a farm? One answer is the amount it will bring if sold. But let us assume a farmer wants to buy a farm. What <b>can</b> he <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for it? A similar {{question}} faces the seller, anxious about what he should ask for his farm. For situations like these, valuation of the land on a productivity basis is helpful. Rightly used such a method can make farm valuations more precise and reliable. In addition to its use in determining the sale price of land, this method is well adapted for appraisals of land for mortgage loans...|$|R

2500|$|Since the {{majority}} (85%) of Americans have health insurance, {{they do not}} directly pay for medical services. Insurance companies, as payors, negotiate health care pricing with providers {{on behalf of the}} insured. Hospitals, doctors, and other medical providers have traditionally disclosed their fee schedules only to insurance companies and other institutional payors, and not to individual patients. Uninsured individuals are expected to pay directly for services, but since they lack access to pricing information, price-based competition may be reduced. The introduction of high-deductible insurance has increased demand for pricing information among consumers. [...] As high-deductible health plans rise across the country, with many individuals having deductibles of $2500 or more, their ability to pay for costly procedures diminishes, and hospitals end up covering the cost of patients care. [...] Many health systems are putting in place price transparency initiatives and payments plans for their patients so that the patients better understand what the estimated cost of their care is, and how they <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for their care over time.|$|E

Since the natives have few personal assets, they <b>can</b> easily <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> but such an exorbitant rate would bankrupt Wembling. The developer mounts a legal challenge, but a government can impose any tax it wishes, {{as long as it is}} applied equally to all.

50|$|There {{are three}} major roads {{connecting}} the village with nearby Unn, Sachin and Bhestan. The relative {{prosperity of the}} village has also increased substantially within recent times due to the high land prices {{in the village and}} because of the return of many former NRI's (Non-resident Indian and Person of Indian Origin) and thus their contributions to the village's welfare.
