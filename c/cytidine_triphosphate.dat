The reaction is enhanced by the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvic kinase, and exogenous deoxyribonucleic acid, and is inhibited by deoxyribonuclease and actinomycin D. Incorporation is maximal between pH 7. 0 and 8. 0, and at 37 C. The synthesized polymer is relatively insensitive to deoxyribonuclease and is sensitive to ribonuclease and dilute alkaline hydrolysis.

40|$|Threose {{nucleic acid}} (TNA) is an {{artificial}} genetic polymer capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution to produce aptamers with affinity to specific targets. This property, {{coupled with a}} backbone structure that is refractory to nuclease digestion, makes TNA an attractive biopolymer system for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Expanding the chemical diversity of TNA beyond the natural bases would enable the development of functional TNA molecules with enhanced physiochemical properties. Here, we describe the synthesis and polymerase activity of a fluorescent <b>cytidine</b> TNA <b>triphosphate</b> analogue (1, 3 -diaza- 2 -oxo-phenothiazine, tCfTP) that maintains Watson-Crick base pairing with guanine. Polymerase-mediated primer-extension assays reveal that tCfTP is efficiently added to the growing end of a TNA primer. Detailed kinetic assays indicate that tCfTP and tCTP have comparable rates for the first nucleotide incorporation step (kobs 1). However, addition of the second nucleotide (kobs 2) is 700 -fold faster for tCfTP than tCTP due the increased effects of base stacking. Last, we found that TNA replication using tCfTP in place of tCTP exhibits 98. 4 % overall fidelity for the combined process of TNA transcription and reverse transcription. Together, these results expand the chemical diversity of enzymatically generated TNA molecules to include a hydrophobic base analogue with strong fluorescent properties that is compatible with in vitro selection...|$|R

The nucleoside mono-phosphokinases were extracted from brewer's veast in a four-step procedure. The specific activity of the yeast enzyme preparation after gel permeation chromatography was sufficiently high that the yeast kinases could be immobilized in volumes that were practical for labo-ratory scale syntheses.

40|$|The {{glutamine}} synthetase of Bacillus licheniformis {{has been}} obtained at about 15 % purity. Sucrose gradient centrifugation gave a molecular weight value of approximately 612, 000. Both l- and d-glutamate can be utilized as substrates in the biosynthetic reaction, although the l isomer was {{five times more}} active. The requirement for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be partially replaced by guanosine or inosine triphosphates, but not by <b>cytidine</b> or uridine <b>triphosphates.</b> The Mn++ was required for activity, and the requirement cannot be satisfied with Mg++. Maximal activity of the biosynthetic reaction was observed when ATP and Mn++ were present in equimolar amounts. An excess of either reactant gave less activity. However, other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, when added in combination with ATP, can partially substitute for ATP in attaining the equimolar ratio of nucleotide to Mn++. A complex of ATP and Mn++ is the preferred form of substrate. The B. licheniformis enzyme catalyzes the glutamyl transfer reaction but at a much slower rate than the Escherichia coli glutamine synthetase. Either adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or ATP can activate the glutamotransferase, although ADP is more active...|$|R
40|$|The cytidylyltransferases are {{a family}} of enzymes that utilize <b>cytidine</b> 5 â?? <b>triphosphate</b> (CTP) to {{synthesize}} molecules that are precursors to membrane phospholipids. There are four well known enzymes: CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (ECT), CTP: glycerol- 3 -phosphate cytidylyltransferase (GCT), 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol- 4 -phosphate cytidylyltransferase synthetase (CMS), and CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT). Previously, a radioisotope tagging method was employed to study cytidylyltransferase catalysis. Using CCT as a model, a method utilizing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed to replace the radioisotope scintillation technique. The development of this new HPLC method is cheaper, more efficient, and more accurate than the previously established method. The targets of separation are the substrate CTP and the product cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline) of the reaction catalyzed by CCT. A solvent system based on previous literature which separated nucleotides and nucleosides was successfully developed using standard solutions of CTP and CDP-choline. Once successful separation was achieved, it was applied to CCT. The cytidylyltransferase {{used to test the}} HPLC enzyme assay was a truncated version of CCT denoted CCT 236. The full length CCT has 3 domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain, a membrane lipid activation domain, and a C-terminal phosphorylated domain (Friesen et al. 1999). The full length enzyme is activated by membrane association, specifically with lipids. The truncated version only has the N-terminal catalytic domain so it does not need lipid association. An enzymatic assay was performed using the CCT 236 isoform that was subjected to the newly developed HPLC method that successfully separated the reactant (CTP) from the product (CDP-choline). This method was then applied to GCT and CMS for separation as well. Herein the results of the application of this new HPLC separation method to members of the cytidylyltransferase family are presented...|$|R

50|$|CMP can be {{phosphorylated}} to cytidine diphosphate by {{the enzyme}} CMP kinase, with adenosine triphosphate or guanosine triphosphate donating the phosphate group.

50|$|The nucleosides {{cytidine}} and deoxycytidine can be salvaged {{along the}} uracil pathway by cytidine deaminase, which converts them to uridine and deoxyuridine, respectively. Alternatively, uridine-cytidine kinase can phosphorylate them into cytidine monophosphate (CMP) or deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP).

50|$|The {{study of}} the tumor metabolism, also known as tumor {{metabolome}} describes the different characteristic metabolic changes in tumor cells.

50|$|The {{product of}} this reaction, phosphoribosyl {{pyrophosphate}} (PRPP), {{is used in}} numerous biosynthesis (de novo and salvage) pathways. PRPP provides the ribose sugar in de novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, used in the nucleotide bases that form RNA and DNA. PRPP reacts with orotate to form orotidylate, which {{can be converted to}} uridylate (UMP). UMP can then be converted to the nucleotide <b>cytidine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (CTP). The reaction of PRPP, glutamine, and ammonia forms 5-Phosphoribosyl-1-amine, a precursor to inosinate (IMP), which can ultimately be converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP). PRPP plays a role in purine salvage pathways by reacting with free purine bases to form adenylate, guanylate, and inosinate. PRPP is also used in the synthesis of NAD: the reaction of PRPP with nicotinic acid yields the intermediate nicotinic acid mononucleotide.|$|E
5000|$|NDPK {{are found}} in all cells, {{displaying}} not much specificity towards the types of nucleoside bases and are capable of accepting nucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides as substrates or donors. Therefore, NDPK {{is the source of}} RNA and DNA precursors, except ATP.NDPK utilize specific enzyme kinetics for multi-substrate reaction, namely ping-pong mechanism. A ping-pong mechanism integrates phosphorylation of a histidine residue by transferring terminal phosphate group (γ-phosphate) from ATP to NDP β-phosphate in order to produce a NTP, and NDPK catalyzes such reversible reactions. NTP phosphorylates a histidine, which in turn phosphorylates NDP. NDPK are involved in the synthesis of nucleoside triphosphates (NTP), such as guanosine triphosphate (GTP), <b>cytidine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (CTP) and uridine triphosphate (UTP).Behind this apparently simple reaction is a multistep mechanism.

50|$|Regulation of GS only {{occurs in}} prokaryotes. GS {{is subject to}} {{reversible}} covalent modification. Tyr397 of all 12 subunits can undergo adenylylation or deadenylylation by adenylyl transferase (AT), a bifunctional regulatory enzyme. Adenylylation is a post-translational modification involving the covalent attachment of AMP to a protein side chain. Each adenylylation requires an ATP and complete inhibition of GS requires 12 ATP. Deadenylylation by AT involves phosphorolytic removal of the Tyr-linked adenylyl groups as ADP. AT activity {{is influenced by the}} regulatory protein that is associated with it: PII, a 44-kD trimer. PII also undergoes post-translational modification by uridylyl transferase, thus PII has two forms. The state of PII dictates the activity of adenylyl transferase. If PII is not uridylylated, then it will take on the PIIA form. The AT:PIIA complex will deactivate GS by adenylylation. If PII is uridylylated, then it will take on the PIID form. The AT:PIID complex will activate GS by deadenylylation. The AT:PIIA and AT:PIID complexes are allosterically regulated in a reciprocal fashion by α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and glutamine (Gln). Gln will activate AT:PIIA activity and inhibits AT:PIID, leading to adenylylation and subsequent deactivation of GS. Furthermore, Gln favors the conversion of PIID to PIIA. The effects of α-KG on the complexes are opposite. In the majority of gram-negative bacteria, GS can be modified by adenylylation (some cyanobacteria and green algae or exceptions).Inhibition of GS has largely focused on amino site ligands. Other inhibitors are the result of glutamine metabolism: tryptophan, histidine, carbamoyl phosphate, glucosamine-6-phosphate, <b>cytidine</b> <b>triphosphate</b> (CTP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Other inhibitors/regulators are glycine and alanine. Alanine, glycine, and serine bind to the glutamate substrate site. GDP, AMP, ADP bind to the ATP site. L-serine, L-alanine, and glycine bind to the site for L-glutamate in unadenylated GS. The four amino acids bind to the site by their common atoms, “the main chain” of amino acids. Glutamate is another product of glutamine metabolism; however, glutamate is a substrate for GS inhibiting it to act as a regulator to GS.2 Each inhibitor can reduce the activity of the enzyme; once all final glutamine metabolites are bound to GS, the activity of GS is almost completely inhibited. Many inhibitory input signals allows for fine tuning of GS by reflecting nitrogen levels in the organism.|$|E
