5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that, if one fully understood the concept of God, one must accept his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments as those that start from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> God's existence.|$|E

Tom Baker was considered at one point for the role of the guide.|$|E
5|$|As {{temperatures}} {{continue to}} rise, the last animal {{life will be}} driven back toward the poles, and possibly underground. They would become primarily active during the polar night, aestivating during the polar day due to the intense heat. Much of the surface would become a barren desert and life would primarily {{be found in the}} oceans. However, due to a decrease of the amount or organic matter coming to the oceans from the land as well as oxygen in the water, life would disappear there too following a similar path to that on Earth's surface. This process would start with the loss of freshwater species and <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> invertebrates, particularly those that do not depend on living plants such as termites or those near hydrothermal vents such as worms of the genus Riftia. As a result of these processes, multi-cellular lifeforms may be extinct in about 800 million years, and eukaryotes in 1.3 billion years, leaving only the prokaryotes.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Braunschweig {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise in June and July, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> a winter training cruise. During torpedo training on 16 February 1905, Wörth ran aground off Stollergrund; Braunschweig unsuccessfully attempted to pull her free and other ships were called to come to Wörths aid. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde.

5|$|For {{the next}} several years, Elsass {{and the rest of}} the fleet were {{occupied}} with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise during the summer, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically <b>conclude</b> <b>with</b> a winter training cruise. For Elsass, her career began with squadron training in the North Sea and Baltic Sea in May, followed by the summer cruise in July and August. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. KzS Reinhard Scheer replaced Bachmann in October 1907. The winter cruise that year went to the Baltic.|$|E
