Recent stable carbon isotope analyses have revealed that methanotrophic bacteria help fuel lake food webs. We analysed individual larvae of co-existing Chironomus plumosus and C. anthracinus for stable sulphur isotopes as an alternative tracer for bacterial assimilation, and compared them with existing stable carbon isotope data. The combination of these 2 isotopes suggests that there are large inter- and intraspecific differences in the incorporation of bacteria rather than algae in the diet of both species. C. anthracinus appears to assimilate a greater proportion of <b>chemoautotrophs</b> relative to its congener, which is consistent with classical descriptions of C. anthracinus feeding mode relative to bacterial stratigraphy in the sediments.

Antibodies elicited by the purified large subunit of RbuP 2 Case from tobacco (Nicotana tabacum) cross-reacted on immunoblots with a protein of similar molecular mass occurring in extracts of the symbiont-containing gill tissue of S. velum. No cross-reactivity was detected in symbiont-free tissue extracts.

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{significant}} advances {{in our understanding}} of the physiology, ecology, and molecular biology of chemoautotrophic bacteria. Many ecosystems are dependent on CO 2 fixation by either free-living or symbiotic chemoautotrophs. CO 2 fixation in the <b>chemoautotroph</b> occurs via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. The cycle is characterized by three unique enzymatic activities: ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, phosphoribulokinase, and sedoheptulose bisphosphatase. Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is commonly found in the cytoplasm, but a number of bacteria package much of the enzyme into polyhedral organelles, the carboxysomes. The carboxysome genes are located adjacent to cbb genes, which are often, but not always, clustered in large operons. The availability of carbon and reduced substrates control the expression of cbb genes in concert with the LysR-type transcriptional regulator, CbbR. Additional regulatory proteins may also be involved. All of these, as well as related topics, are discussed in detail in this review...|$|E

The mechanism of saltpetre formation is unknown, although hypotheses encompassing both biotic and abiotic functions have been suggested. Present studies were conducted in various saltpetre caves using species specific fluorescent antibodies in order to determine if the <b>chemoautotroph,</b> Nitrobacter, were present. Population densities and species distribution of Nitrobacter were studied in relation to chemical and physical parameters for over 200 sediment samples from Mammoth Cave. Both the isolation and immunofluorescence data indicate that Nitrobacter are present in relatively high population densities in Mammoth Cave sediments, and that such bacteria are common among saltpetre caves in the southeastern United States.

The initial “complex” would be oxygenated, but not oxidized because no electron transport has taken place. The “complex” is formed in solution or on the cell surface and is somehow reacted with iron oxidase (or oxygenase), resulting in the release of an electron. Either sulfate or a flavoprotein is suggested as involved in the initial electron-transfer link between iron and the cell. The electron is transported in the cell through a typical electron-transport system involving coenzyme Q 6, cytochrome c, and cytochrome a; oxygen is the final electron acceptor.

A transcriptomic analysis of B. japonicum cultured chemoautotrophically identified 1, 485 transcripts, representing 17. 5 % of the genome, as differentially expressed when compared to heterotrophic cultures. Genetic determinants required for hydrogen utilization and carbon fixation, including the uptake hydrogenase system and components of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, were strongly induced in chemoautotrophically cultured cells. A putative isocitrate lyase (aceA; blr 2455) {{was among the most}} strongly upregulated genes, suggesting a role for the glyoxylate cycle during chemoautotrophic growth. Addition of arabinose to chemoautotrophic cultures of B. japonicum did not significantly alter transcript profiles. Furthermore, a subset of nitrogen fixation genes was moderately induced during chemoautotrophic growth. In order to specifically address the role of isocitrate lyase and nitrogenase in chemoautotrophic growth, we cultured aceA, nifD, and nifH mutants under chemoautotrophic conditions.

40|$|Differential {{rates of}} {{incorporation}} of sugars, organic acids, and amino acids during autotrophic growth of several blue-green algae and thiobacilli have been determined. In obligate autotrophs (both blue-green algae and thiobacilli), exogenously furnished organic compounds {{make a very}} small contribution to cellular carbon; acetate, the most readily incorporated compound of those studied, contributes about 10 % of newly synthesized cellular carbon. In Thiobacillus intermedius, a facultative <b>chemoautotroph,</b> acetate contributes over 40 % of newly synthesized cellular carbon, and succinate and glutamate almost 90 %. In the obligate autotrophs, carbon from pyruvate, acetate, and glutamate is incorporated into restricted groups of cellular amino acids, and the patterns of incorporation in all five organisms are essentially identical. These patterns suggest that the tricarboxylic acid cycle is blocked {{at the level of}} α-ketoglutarate oxidation. Enzymatic analyses confirmed the absence of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the obligate autotrophs, and also revealed that they lacked reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase, and had extremely low levels of malic and succinic dehydrogenase.

40|$|Microorganisms play a {{significant}} role in environmental arsenic cycling. The most recent discovery to the ever growing collection of known arsenic metabolisms is photosynthesis-linked arsenite oxidation (photoarsenotrophy). However, it is poorly understood and has only been identified in thermal springs on Paoha Island of Mono Lake, CA. The arsenite oxidase ArxA is thought to be responsible for the oxidation of arsenite in photoarsenotrophy. However, the first and only isolated photoarsenotroph, Ectothiorhodospira sp PHS- 1, has not proven amenable to genetic manipulations, making genetic confirmation impossible. Water, sediment, and tufa collected from Big Soda Lake and Mono County were used for enrichment culturing and functional gene analyses. arxA -specific primers successfully amplified products from 15 out of 18 environmental samples, and cloned products show high homology to existing arxA -like sequences. Strains containing arxA -like sequences and capable of arsenite oxidation belonging to the genera Ectothiorhodospira and Halomonas were isolated. This work demonstrates that arxA sequences and photoarsenotrophs can also be found in Big Soda Lake, NV, and presents two novel arxA -containing, arsenite-oxidizing strains: the <b>chemoautotroph</b> Halomonas sp.

We have applied the recently developed method of protein-based stable isotope probing (protein-SIP) to track carbon flow in a mixed culture of acidophilic bacteria. The heterotroph Acidiphilium cryptum was grown {{in the presence of}} 13 C-labeled galactose, together with the iron- and sulfur-oxidizing autotroph Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Cultures were harvested at five time points, proteins extracted and separated by 1 -dimensional SDS gel electrophoresis, peptides obtained by tryptic digest of gel slices and analyzed by UPLC Orbitrap MS/MS measurements. Syntrophic interactions were confirmed by analysis of the time-dependent incorporation of 13 C into peptides, and quantified by calculation of relative isotope abundance (RIA) and labeling ratio (lr) from mass spectral isotope patterns. 13 CO 2 formed by catabolism of galactose by A. cryptum, was found to be assimilated by At. ferrooxidans which used tetrathionate as electron donor.

No trace of phosphatidylserine (PS), glycerolphosphorylserine, or serine could be detected in the lipid extract or in derivatives of that extract. This casts some doubt on the postulated involvement of PS in iron metabolism.

The assay measured Fe 3 + as a chloride complex which absorbs at 410 nm. Kinetic analysis showed the apparent Km for iron oxidation to be 5. 4 × 10 − 3 m in an unbuffered system and 2. 2 × 10 − 3 m in the presence of β-alanine-SO 42 − buffer. Glycine and β-alanine buffers were used in the measurement of the pH optimum for iron oxidation; the optimum ranged from 2. 5 to 3. 8. The effect of pH was primarily on the Vmax while the Km remained constant. Added SO 42 − was found to stimulate iron oxidation by increasing the Vmax of iron oxidation by whole cells, but it did not affect the Km. Results of assays of iron oxidation in systems containing various mole percentages of SO 42 − and Cl− indicated that Cl− did not inhibit iron oxidation but that SO 42 − was required.
