40|$|Chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus, GGA) and Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica, CCO) karyotypes {{are very}} similar. They have {{identical}} chromosome number (2 n = 78) and show {{a high degree}} of synteny. Centromere positions on the majority of orthologous chromosomes are different in these two species. To explore the nature of this divergence, we used high-resolution comparative fluorescent in situ hybridization mapping on giant lampbrush chromosomes (LBCs) from growing oocytes. We applied 41 BAC clones specific for GGA 1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 to chicken and quail LBCs. This approach allowed us to rule out a pericentric inversion earlier proposed to explain the difference between GGA 1 and CCO 1. In addition to a well-established large-scale pericentric inversion that discriminates GGA 2 and CCO 2, we identified another, smaller one in the large inverted region. For the first time, we described in detail inversions that distinguish GGA 3 from CCO 3 and GGA 11 from CCO 11. Despite the newly identified and confirmed inversions, our data suggest that, in chicken and Japanese quail, the difference in centromere positions is not mainly caused by pericentric inversions but is instead due to centromere repositioning events and the formation of new centromeres. We also consider the formation of short arms of quail microchromosomes by heterochromatin accumulation as a third scenario that could explain the discrepancy in <b>centromeric</b> <b>indexes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} developed methods of non radioactive {{in situ hybridization}} of chromosomes offer new aspects for chromosome analysis. Fluorescent labelling of hybridized chromosomes or chromosomal subregions allows to facilitate considerably the detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities. For many biomedical applications (e. g. biological dosimetry in the low dose range), a fast scoring for aberrations (e. g. dicentrics or translocations) in required. Here, we present an approach depending on {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} of isolated suspension chromosomes that indicates the feasibility of a rapid screening for specific chromosomes or translocations by slit scan flow cytometry. Chromosomes of a Chinese hamster x human hybrid cell line were hybridized in suspension with biotinylated human genomic DNA. This DNA was decorated with FITC by a double antibody system against biotin. For flow cytometry the chromosomes were stabilized with ethanol and counterstained with DAPI or propidium iodide (PI). An experimental data set of several hundred double profiles was obtained by two parameter slit scan flow cytometry and evaluated automatically. The evaluation algorithm developed allowed a classification of chromosomes according to the number of centromeres and their chromosomal positions in less than 1 msec per individual profile. Approximately 20 % of the measured DAPI profiles showed a bimodal distribution with a significant centromeric dip indicating a "normal" chromosomal morphology and a correct alignment in the flow system. In many cases, profiles of a "normal" bimodal fluorescence distribution of the DNA stain (DAPI, PI) were correlated with a "normal" FITC profile. Due to their <b>centromeric</b> <b>indices</b> these profiles agreed well to the expected human chromosomes of the cell line. In some cases of "normal" DAPI (PI) profiles, "aberrant" FITC profiles were observed. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Aedes aegypti, {{the primary}} vector of dengue, yellow fever and Zika flaviviruses, {{consists}} {{of at least}} two subspecies. Aedes aegypti (Aaa) is light in color, has pale scales on the first abdominal tergite, oviposits in artificial containers, and preferentially feeds on humans. Aedes aegypti formosus (Aaf), has a dark cuticle, is restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, has no pale scales on the first abdominal tergite and frequently oviposits in natural containers. Scale patterns correlate with cuticle color in East Africa but not in Senegal, West Africa where black cuticle mosquitoes display a continuum of scaling patterns and breed domestically indoors. An earlier laboratory study did not indicate any pre- or postzygotic barriers to gene flow between Aaa and Aaf in East Africa. However, similar attempts to construct F 1 intercross families between Aaa laboratory strains and Senegal Ae. aegypti (SenAae) failed due to poor F 1 oviposition and low F 2 egg-to-adult survival. Insemination and assortative mating experiments failed to identify prezygotic mating barriers. Backcrosses were performed to test for postzygotic isolation patterns consistent with Haldane's rule modified for species, like Aedes, that have an autosomal sex determining locus (SDL). Egg-pupal survival was predicted to be low in females mated to hybrid F 1 males but average when a male mates with a hybrid F 1 female. Survival was in fact significantly reduced when females mated to hybrid males but egg-pupal survival was significantly increased when males were mated to hybrid F 1 females. These observations are therefore inconclusive with regards to Haldane's rule. Basic cytogenetic analyses and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) experiments were performed to compare SenAae strains with the IB 12 strain of Aaa that was used for genome sequencing and physical mapping. Some SenAae strains had longer chromosomes than IB 12 and significantly different <b>centromeric</b> <b>indices</b> on chromosomes 1 and 3. DAPI staining was used to identify AT-rich regions, chromomycin A 3 following pretreatment with barium hydroxide stained for GC-rich regions and stained the ribosomal RNA locus and YOYO- 1 was used to test for differential staining. Chromosome patterns in SenAae strains revealed by these three stains differed from those in IB 12. For FISH, 40 BAC clones previously physically mapped on Aaa chromosomes were used to test for chromosome rearrangements in SenAae relative to IB 12. Differences in the order of markers identified two chromosomal rearrangements between IB 12 and SenAae strains. The first rearrangement involves two overlapping pericentric (containing the centromere) inversions in chromosome 3 or an insertion of a large fragment into the 3 q arm. The second rearrangement is close to the centromere on the p arm of chromosome 2. Linkage analysis of the SDL and the white-eye locus identified a likely chromosomal rearrangement on chromosome 1. The reproductive incompatibility observed within SenAae and between SenAae and Aaa may be generally associated with chromosome rearrangements on all three chromosomes and specifically caused by pericentric inversions on chromosomes 2 and 3...|$|R

There were significant differences among populations within each species and among species {{in the number of}} metacentric, submetacentric and subtelocentric chromosomes, the number and location of secondary constrictions, chromosome length (longest and shortest), total haploid complement, arm ratio, and <b>centromeric</b> <b>index.</b> L. odoratus showed the highest tendency towards karyotype symmetry whereas the three South American species showed a moderate tendency towards asymmetry, with L. pubescens being the most asymmetrical. Silver staining was used to identify the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) and the number of nucleoli per interphase nucleus in each species. In L. pubescens and L. nervosus, the NORs were located on the secondary constriction of the long arm of pair 7, in L. crassipes, the NOR was proximal being located in the pair of metacentric chromosomes, and in L. odoratus there were four terminal NORs on the short arms of pairs 4 and 5. The four species had a maximum of four nucleoli per interphase nucleus, indicating the presence of four regions with active ribosomal genes in each case...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that {{comparison}} {{of the size of}} the Y chromosome between individuals may be made as reliably by computation of measurement relative to the X chromosome as by proportionation relative to the genome in the cell. By either method agreement was found with previous studies: first in placing the Y in the size range, for the cattle karyotype, between autosomes 22 and 26; second by finding the Y in the Charolais breed to be larger than other breeds. The value of the C-band method for recognition of the Y in Bos indicus, in particular, is reaffirmed and acridine orange is used to confirm the hypothesis of pericentric inversion as the basis of the relationship between the Y of Bos indicus and that of Bos taurus. The G-band pattern showed seven discernable regions in either species, so that the terminal part of the q arm in Bos indicus is homologous with the p arm in Bos taurus. The overall size and <b>centromeric</b> <b>index</b> of the Y are defined for each of 18 breeds of Bos taurus and 8 breeds of Bos indicus. It was found that the Y might be expected to be distinctive in certain breeds or groups: Afrikander, Augus, Claarolais, Friesian, Guern. rey, Hereford, Jersey, Murray Gre...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} two improvements of {{the on-line}} <b>centromeric</b> <b>index</b> (CI) {{analysis for the}} detection of chromosome abnormalities. On-line CI versus DNA content analysis of an EBV-transformed cell line, with a deletion (11) (p 13 p 15. 1), of a patient with aniridia and Wilms' tumour demonstrates the first improvement of the method of on-line CI analysis for flow karyotyping and sorting; a reciprocal translocation, insertion, or deletion can, when the cell type contains not more than a few of these types of abnormalities, be traced to the p-arm or q-arm of the relevant chromosome. On-line CI analysis was also performed with chromosomes isolated from a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Cytogenetic analysis of this cell line showed numerous chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomes of this cell line were also karyotyped by bivariate flow cytometry using a different set of parameters: Hoechst 33, 258 fluorescence intensity (HOfl) versus chromomycin A 3 fluorescence intensity (CAfl). A comparison of these results reveals the second improvement of the CI method {{for the detection of}} chromosome abnormalities; bivariate analysis of CI versus propidium fluorescence (PIfl) are complementary to bivariate analysis of HOfl versus CAfl. Chromosomes with distributions that fuse together in the HO/CA flow karyotype may be distinguished as individual peaks {{on the basis of their}} CI value...|$|E
40|$|The Karyotype {{analysis}} was performed on 46 wheat accessions belonging to five species (Triticum monococcum, T. urartu, T. durum, T. turgidum and T. aestivum) and two subspecies (T. boeoticum subsp. thaodar and T. boeoticum subsp. boeoticum) carrying A genome. All chromosomal sizes were measured with computer-aided program Micro Measure 3. 3. Software. RL, TCL, MCL, arm ratio, <b>centromeric</b> <b>index,</b> TF%, mean of long and short arms, AsI%, S%, DRL, A 1, A 2 and karyotype formula were calculated for each chromosome. All the accessions were placed in 1 A category of stebbines asymmetry categories. The scatter diagram based on A 1 and A 2 constructed three groups of karyotype asymmetry in the accessions studied: 1 - T. aestivum with the highest asymmetrical karyotype, 2 - T. monococcum, T. boeoticum subsp. thaodar and T. boeoticum subsp. boeoticum with the lowest asymmetrical karyotype and 3 - T. urartu, T. turgidum and T. durum being with an intermediate between the two previous groups. T. monococcum based on the A 1 and A 2 index (asymmetric index) had the oldest and the most primitive karyotype among diploid species. According to the results, it might be suggested that T. durum is more primitive than T. turgidum and T. monococcum could {{be considered as a}} donor of A genome to T. durum and T. aestivum...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} popular, cheap and widely used {{approaches}} in comparative cytogenetics – especially by botanists – is that concerning intrachromosomal and interchromosomal karyotype asymmetry. Currently, {{there is no clear}} indication of which method, among the many different ones reported in literature, is the most adequate to infer karyotype asymmetry (especially intrachromosomal), above all in view of the criticisms recently moved to the most recent proposal published. This work addresses a critical review of the methods so far proposed for estimation of karyotype asymmetry, using both artificial and real chromosome datasets. It is shown once again how the concept karyotype of asymmetry is composed by two kinds of estimation: interchromosomal and intrachromosomal asymmetries. For the first one, the use of Coefficient of Variation of Chromosome Length, a powerful statistical parameter, is here confirmed. For the second one, the most appropriate parameter is the new Mean Centromeric Asymmetry, where Centromeric Asymmetry for each chromosome in a complement is easily obtained by calculating the difference of relative lengths of long arm and short arm. The Coefficient of Variation of <b>Centromeric</b> <b>Index,</b> strongly criticized in recent literature, is an additional karyological parameter, not properly connected with karyotype asymmetry. This shows definitively what and how to measure to correctly infer karyotype asymmetry, by proposing to couple two already known parameters in a new way. Hopefully, it will be the basic future reference for all those scientists dealing with cytotaxonomy...|$|E
40|$|Among Anguilliformes, morphologically {{differentiated}} sex chromosomes {{have been}} described in 25 % of the species studied. Interestingly, in this taxon the occurrence of different sex chromosome systems, {{both male and female}} heterogamety as well as a multiple chromosome system, has been reported. In this work we describe the karyotype and demonstrate the presence of a ZZ/ZW sex determination system in Dalophis imberbis (Delaroche, 1809). The chromosome preparations have been obtained from blood cell cultures. Dalophis imberbis has 46 chromosomes; its karyotype is made up of 4 metacentric and submetacentric pairs, 18 acrocentric and subtelocentric pairs and a sex chromosome pair, heteromorphic in females. By measuring with the Cromowin System software the relative length and the <b>centromeric</b> <b>index</b> of each chromosome pair, we have constructed the idiogram of this species. By C-banding we have located the constitutive heterochromatin in all centromeres; some chromosomes show peculiar banding patterns, in particular Z and W chromosomes present large heterochromatic blocks, probably related to mechanisms that lead to the inactivation and differentiation of sex chromosomes. Moreover, by replication banding, which represents the most effective karyotyping method in fishes, we have characterized each chromosome pair of D. imberbis. Furthermore, the 45 S rDNA FISH has allowed to locate the ribosomal genes in two pairs of autosomes and in the subtelomeric region of the chromosome W. Ag-staining has shown in different individuals, three-four transcriptionally active NORs; the ribosomal clusters present on the W chromosome are often Ag-positive...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{exploring}} the fidelity of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) plants recovered from cryopreservation. Zygotic embryos from various different cultivars were cryopreserved following four successive steps, namely: rapid dehydration, rapid freezing, rapid thawing and in vitro recovery followed by acclimatization. At {{the end of}} the acclimatization period, the seedlings were compared to counterparts of the same age, which were produced from non-cryopreserved embryos. Both series were submitted to morphological, cytological and molecular comparisons. No significant differences in terms of growth rates could be measured. In addition, no morphological variation could be detected through the measurement of shoot elongation rates, production of opened leaves, and the number and total length of primary roots. Karyotype analysis revealed the same chromosome number (2 n = 32) in all studied cultivars independently of cryopreservation. No significant differences could be observed between control and cryopreserved material concerning the type of chromosomes, the length of the long and short arms, the arm length ratio and the <b>centromeric</b> <b>index.</b> However, idiogram analysis did show a greater number of black banding on chromosomes isolated from cryopreserved material. Genetic and epigenetic fidelity was assessed through microsatellite (SSR) analysis and global DNA methylation rates; no significant differences would be observed between genomic DNAs isolated from seedlings originating from cryopreserved embryos and respective controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the method of cryopreservation under study did not induce gross morphological, genetic or epigenetic changes, thus suggesting that it is an appropriate method to efficiently preserve coconut germplasm.
