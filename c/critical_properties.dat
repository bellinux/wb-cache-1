40|$|Sweet ukel is a {{traditional}} snack that commonly produced by food home industry at Kota Geda Yogyakarta. During storage, sweet ukel would deteriorate with several changes of texture, flavor, taste, and appearance. The objectives of this research were to study the <b>critical</b> <b>property,</b> activation energy, and Q 10 – value of sweet ukel. The <b>critical</b> <b>property</b> was determined by sensory evaluation of sweet ukel during storage at room temperature. Activation energy and Q 10 – value were determined by TBA - value (Thio Barbituric Acid) analysis of sweet ukel during storage at 25 oC, 35 oC, dan 45 oC. The result showed that <b>critical</b> <b>property</b> of sweet ukel was depend on appearing of rancid flavor. Sweet ukel was rancid after be stored {{at room temperature for}} 24 days, with TBA – value of 0, 690 mg malonaldehyde/ kg dry matter. The higher the storage temperature, the higher the rate of rancidity. According to Arrhenius formula, the Activation energy was 1. 544, 1 cal/mole. The Q 10 – value of sweet ukel were 1, 03 and 1, 14. The shelf life of sweet ukel at 25 oC, 35 oC, and 45 oC were 25 days, 23 days, and 20 days respectively...|$|R
