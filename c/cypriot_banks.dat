50|$|The 2012-2013 Cypriot {{financial}} crisis was {{an economic crisis}} in the Republic of Cyprus that involved the exposure of <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> to overleveraged local property companies, the Greek government-debt crisis, the downgrading of the Cypriot government's bond credit rating to junk status by international credit rating agencies, the consequential inability to refund its state expenses from the international markets and the reluctance {{of the government to}} restructure the troubled Cypriot financial sector.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} between a bailout and a bail-in was first realised {{by the events of}} the 2012-2013 Cypriot financial crisis. Two <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> were exposed to a haircut of upwards of 50% in 2011 during the Greek government-debt crisis, leading to fears of a collapse of the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks.</b> Rumours circulated for a time, then in early 2013 matters came to a head. On 25 March 2013, a €10 billion bailout was announced by the Troika — a loose coalition of the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund — in return for Cyprus agreeing to close its second largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank). The Cypriots had to agree to levy all uninsured deposits there, and possibly around 40% of uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus (the island's largest commercial bank). No insured deposit of €100k or less was to be affected. [...] The levy of deposits that exceeded €100k was termed a [...] "bail-in", to differentiate it from a bailout because of the depositor fund levy. [...] The Bank of Cyprus executed the depositor bail-in on 28 April 2013.|$|E
50|$|Cyprus banks {{first came}} under severe {{financial}} pressure as bad debt ratios rose. Former Laiki CEO Efthimios Bouloutas admitted that his bank was probably insolvent {{as early as}} 2008, even before Cyprus entered the Eurozone.

40|$|Cyprus’ {{accession}} {{into the}} Eurozone {{has been a}} cornerstone on the modern history of the island. The research project is concentrating on the effect that Cyprus’ participation in the Euro Area {{will have on the}} banking and financial institutions. The new Euro Area environment is characterized by “price stability” and that is achieved through an interest rate mechanism set by the European Central Bank. The interest rate levels however, are not disbursed uniformly within each member state. It was identified quite early in the research project that a number of factors are affecting the depositors and borrowers characteristics. Factors such as risk exposure, disposable income, alternative financing sources, average firm size, banking market concentration, asset and liability structure differ from one member state to another. For a banking institution, these particular factors, are enough to deviate from the interest rate benchmark that the European Central Bank is setting, in order to operate efficiently and profitable within each member state’s economic characteristics. The research project was concentrated on the level of the interest rates that exist between the different deposit and loan type products in the Cypriot economy and in the Euro Area. Involving case description general analytic strategies, results were produced from the description of the Euro Area and Cypriot economies, the Euro Area MFIs against <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> and also at the end the Creek banks against the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks.</b> It was proved that during this transition period, there exists disequilibrium on the level of the interest rates between the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks,</b> the Euro Area MFIs and the Greek banks.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} loan loss {{provisioning}} behaviours of <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> {{and how they}} are related to the business cycle, income smoothing and capital management. Overall, thirteen banks were selected for this study between the period 1997 - 2011, and both the random effects model and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator were used to conduct the analysis. In a brief summary of my findings, <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> seem to give a lot more weight on their own internal actions and characteristics when deciding on their provisioning amounts, rather than the external economic factors. Results showed banks’ provisions are countercyclical to the business cycle but {{due to the fact that}} banks do not participate in income smoothing practices and because earnings have a bigger role in provisioning decisions, those countercyclical tendencies due to GDP growth are overshadowed. There are also signs of capital management, albeit at terribly small amounts. The lagged dependent variable and the impaired loans variable are also significant, indicating that banks adjust their provisions according to the previous year’s levels, and that they also respond to realized credit risk...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Middle {{managers}} are the organizational actors burdened {{with the task}} to implement changes that others –senior management most likely– have designed. The dichotomy in literature regarding their contribution to strategic change is evident. Some authors strongly defend their importance in strategic change management whilst others label them as obstructive, resisters and saboteurs. Various authors have called for further research on middle managers roles and contributions in various types of strategic change, since strategic change comes in many forms and sizes. This study attempts to fill that gap by “putting under the microscope” middle managers who are experiencing the process of strategic reconstruction. Design/methodology/Approach The approach {{of this study is}} qualitative and involved semi-structured interviews with 12 middle managers from the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banking</b> industry. The rationale behind the selection of the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banking</b> industry is that given the recently agreed memorandum between Cyprus and Troika, the banking industry has to undertake reconstruction. Three banks were used as platforms to access middle managers. Findings Despite the fact that middle {{managers are}} excluded from strategy making, they are change protagonists. The analysis revealed that middle managers apart from making sense of, communicating and implementing changes, they manage the psychological element of change by assisting their subordinates and by developing commitment. Also, they make suggestions on how change process and organizational performance can be improved. Research limitations/implications Apart from describing the limitations of the study, the researcher proposes direction for future research. Originality/value It is a study that examines the contributions and roles of middle managers in strategic reconstruction by gathering qualitative data from one industry. The involvement of Troika and the agreed memorandum make the context in which these banks operate unique and worth examining...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyze the sector of the Cyprus economy that deals with the International Banking or Offshore Banking as otherwise is being called in Cyprus. During {{the last two decades}} the island of Cyprus has managed to establish itself as a reputable international financial centre. Therefore the literature review of this paper examines the research theme from two different aspects. First it examines the financial system of Cyprus as related to international banking. In addition it examines the subject of offshore financial centres around the world. This particular research was performed by implementing the qualitative method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a limited number of people. The people being interviewed were knowledgeable of the research problem. Finally the research findings are presented. Each one of the research questions are being answered using the primary and secondary data which were collected from the research. Thus by analyzing the research questions, this paper manages to establish the reasons that made Cyprus a reputable international business centre. Also it examines how the Cyprus banking system is being benefited from the international business sector of the economy. In addition it indicates how the country of Cyprus is being benefited from its International business sector. Furthermore it indicates the anti-money laundering measures that the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> are implementing. Next offers a description of the implications that the current economic crisis has on the international banking in Cyprus. After that it lists the services that <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks,</b> offer to international investors. And finally it completes with the necessary steps required for the approval and formation of a company in Cyprus...|$|E

40|$|Part 12 : First Workshop on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Theory and Applications (FCMTA 2013) International audienceRecently, Greece {{experienced}} {{a financial crisis}} unprecedented in its modern history. In May of 2010 Greece signed a bailout memorandum with Troika (a tripartite committee constituted by the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund). In February of 2012, they proceeded to a second bailout package along with a debt restructuring deal that included a private sector involvement (PSI). The overall loss, for the private investors, was equivalent to around 75 %. Due to the strong economic ties between Greece and Cyprus, PSI had a substantial impact on the Cypriot economy. A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) system has been developed and used to study the repercussions of the Greek PSI on the economic dynamics of Cyprus and more specifically on the probability of cutting off the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>Bank</b> branches that operate in Greece. The system allows one to observe how a change on some parameters can affect {{the stability of the}} rest of the parameters.

40|$|The {{past decade}} {{was full of}} changes for the third largest Mediterranean island, Cyprus. The {{entrance}} in the European Union and the adoption of Euro have brought {{significant changes in the}} Cyprus economy. The remarkable rise of the Cypriot economy until 2008 and the sudden recent failure of its banking system have made Cyprus a very interesting country to study. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate and determine the factors that affect the risk-taking behaviour of Cyprus banks and whether the 2008 Global financial crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis, have affected in any way these determinants. The analysis is conducted on a sample of 18 banks for the period of 2005 to 2011. The results show evidence that the risk-taking behaviour of <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> was significantly affected as a result of the crisis leading to a decrease in the banks’ lending activities. Even though credit crisis turned to be insignificant, capital adequacy seems to play an important role especially in the post-crisis period...|$|E
40|$|Banks in the Republic of Cyprus {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} in 2010 due to risky investments with Greece. The two largest <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks,</b> Cyprus Popular Bank (Laiki) and Bank of Cyprus (BoC), undertook losses, {{which made the}} country economically unstable. After requesting financial assistance from the Eurogroup and International Monetary Fund, there was an agreement for Cyprus to raise € 4. 2 billion {{in return for a}} € 10 billion bailout. Part of the agreement in raising the funds was a levy of bank deposits towards the recapitalization needs of the two largest banks. The Cyprus bail-in was unpopular and received much criticism because of its unprecedented and seemingly unfair condition. In this paper, I will investigate to what extent Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (Charter) protects European Union depositors from a ‘bail-in’ obligation using Cyprus as a case study. I believe that the levying of bank deposits, as a condition of a bail-out of Cyprus by the EU did not violate Article 17 of the Charter. However, I will argue that while the obligation was legal, the European Union should hold a higher standard for bank deposits with regard to Article 17 protection because of the special nature of bank deposits, and for the preservation of confidence in the EU banking system...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} found {{well-established}} firms attempting to capitalise {{on the benefits}} of corporate entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit. In fact, a growing body of evidence suggests that a corporate entrepreneurial orientation is critical for organisational survival and growth in the contemporary business environment. When applied to existing firms, entrepreneurship takes on unique characteristics, and becomes subject to a number of obstacles and constraints not found in most independent start-ups. The magnitude of these constraints has led many to conclude that unique approaches to organisational design and management are necessary if entrepreneurship is to be facilitated on an ongoing basis. Of all the managerial decision making areas that can affect corporate entrepreneurship, human resources management (HRM) would seem the most vital. Indeed, the HRM field appears to be experiencing a fundamental transformation from a micro-oriented, bureaucracy-based, tool-driven discipline to one centred around the congruence of the various aspects of the HRM system with business strategies. This research reviews human resource practices and their impact on corporate entrepreneurship in the banking industry of Cyprus. A case-based methodology is adopted to investigate the research problem and objectives. The starting point of this research was an extensive review of the corporate entrepreneurship and human resource management literature. A case study pilot was conducted to investigate the appropriateness of the questions in the interview guide. The case studies were five well-established Cyprus banks of varying sizes. Data was collected through interviews with the HR managers of each bank and an additional two key managers from each bank. This research identifies the effectiveness of HRM practices in encouraging corporate entrepreneurship in Cyprus banks, as well as the inhibitors and motivators of corporate entrepreneurship. The research recognised that similar factors, as identified in the literature, such as organisational structure, rewards, management, training, autonomy, resource availability, act as inhibitors and motivators to corporate entrepreneurship. The only factor that was not in alignment with the literature research was job security, which was identified as an inhibitor to corporate entrepreneurial behaviour rather than a motivator. This research provides <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banks</b> with a framework to evaluate their organisational efforts for encouraging corporate entrepreneurship. The findings allow these organisations to review the current practices and act as a means to aid in the learning and in enhancing corporate entrepreneurial behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The {{crisis of}} the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>banking</b> sector is {{consequence}} to the unsustainable financial system that exceeded several times the country's GDP. Compared to the GDP seven times larger financial sector, supported by lax supervision {{and low levels of}} regulation contributed {{to the fact that the}} country got into trouble and needed help. It was the first of the affected countries which needed to use its own resources to save itself. This work provides a comprehensive view to the financial crisis, its development and impact on the EU economy. It examines and analyzes the steps that EU leaders have done to mitigate the effects of the crisis. Through the analysis examines the causes of the banking crisis outbreak in Cyprus and discovers that the crisis was caused by moral hazard because banks have decided to buy risky Greek bonds. These toxic assets had to be later written off and banks lost substantial part of their liquidity. The reader is getting familiar with the development and outcome of negotiations with international creditors and also the steps taken by the Cypriot government to ensure funds for the country. In conclusion, there are given the alternative solutions to the crisis and the steps taken by the Cypriot government to prevent similar scenarios also the reader is provided by forecasts of the economic development of the country...|$|R
40|$|All banking {{institutions}} {{in the process of}} providing financial services face financial risks. Failure to manage these risks can result to great problems for banks or even withdrawal of a banking licence. As a result, the need to manage risks is increasingly important across all banking institutions. Risk management is not an easy task since comprehensive processes and procedures are needed to identify, measure, control, and mitigate risks. Most measures and management procedures are driven by regulations such as the Basel Committee of banking supervisory authorities and are backed up by governments and central banks. Further procedures may be developed internally by banks as a method against unpredictable risks. This dissertation examines the credit, liquidity, operational, and human resource risk management practices by offering a detailed analysis of a <b>Cypriot</b> <b>bank’s</b> risk management processes. Even though market risk is of an immense importance for a bank, due to time and word limit constraints it is not a part of this dissertation. The key areas are the risk management structure, the risk management frameworks, and the stress and contingency plans developed internally. The Basel Committee’s requirements are adopted as a benchmark in the evaluation of this bank’s risk management. The effect of the recent financial crisis on the bank is identified, indicating risk management changes within the bank and the ability to predict and react proactively to reduce risks in a similar future crisis...|$|R
