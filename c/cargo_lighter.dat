60|$|He {{had come}} on purpose to Sulaco, {{and there was a}} one-o'clock dinner-party, a convite offered by the O.S.N. Company on board the Juno after the {{function}} on shore. Captain Mitchell had himself steered the <b>cargo</b> <b>lighter,</b> all draped with flags, which, in tow of the Juno's steam launch, took the Excellentissimo from the jetty to the ship. Everybody of note in Sulaco had been invited--the one or two foreign merchants, all the representatives of the old Spanish families then in town, the great owners of estates on the plain, grave, courteous, simple men, caballeros of pure descent, with small hands and feet, conservative, hospitable, and kind. The Occidental Province was their stronghold; their Blanco party had triumphed now; it was their President-Dictator, a Blanco of the Blancos, who sat smiling urbanely between the representatives of two friendly foreign powers. They had come with him from Sta. Marta to countenance by their presence the enterprise in which the capital of their countries was engaged. The only lady of that company was Mrs. Gould, the wife of Don Carlos, the administrator of the San Tome silver mine. The ladies of Sulaco were not advanced enough {{to take part in the}} public life to that extent. They had come out strongly at the great ball at the Intendencia the evening before, but Mrs. Gould alone had appeared, a bright spot in the group of black coats behind the President-Dictator, on the crimson cloth-covered stage erected under a shady tree on the shore of the harbour, where the ceremony of turning the first sod had taken place. She had come off in the <b>cargo</b> <b>lighter,</b> full of notabilities, sitting under the flutter of gay flags, in the place of honour by the side of Captain Mitchell, who steered, and her clear dress gave the only truly festive note to the sombre gathering in the long, gorgeous saloon of the Juno.|$|E

50|$|In Melbourne's early days, large {{ships were}} unable to {{navigate}} the Yarra River, so cargo destined for Melbourne had to be unloaded at either Hobsons Bay (now Williamstown) or Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) and transferred either by rail or by <b>cargo</b> <b>lighter</b> to warehouses which were concentrated around King Street. This was an expensive and inefficient process.|$|E

5000|$|On March 11, 1945, in {{a mission}} known as Operation Tan No. 2, several long range {{aircraft}} flying from southern Japan attempted a nighttime kamikaze {{attack on the}} naval base. [...] One struck the Essex-class aircraft carrier , which had left a <b>cargo</b> <b>light</b> on despite the black out. The plane struck over the stern starboard quarter, damaging the flight deck and killing a number of crewmen. [...] Another crashed on Sorlen Island, having perhaps mistaken a signal tower there for the superstructure of an aircraft carrier.|$|R

Some vehicles have [...] "approach lighting" [...] (puddle lights) in the exterior mirrors or lower edges of the doors, as well as interior lighting activated via key fob. Many cars have lights in the trunk (or boot), the engine compartment, and the glovebox and other storage compartments. [...] Modern pickup trucks usually have one or more white <b>cargo</b> <b>lights</b> which illuminate {{the bed of the}} truck, often controlled in conjunction with the interior dome lighting.|$|R
50|$|The ramped <b>cargo</b> <b>lighter</b> or RCL was {{a landing}} craft {{used in many}} parts of the world during the Second World War. Designed in Canada and {{manufactured}} in Vancouver and Toronto, its primary purpose was lighterage work following assault landings. The RCL also provided water transport in coastal operations. These lighters were built in sections to simplify shipping and assembled in the theatre of operations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{marine engine}} {{division}} continued operations for over forty years, and is most known for converting automotive engines for fishboats, cruisers and World War II landing craft, {{such as the}} Canadian Ramped <b>Cargo</b> <b>Lighter</b> and the famed Higgins Boats. Gray built their own engines up to 1924, but converted automotive engines from about April 1924 on. During WWII, Gray Marine built 100 marinized GM style 71 series diesels a day using GM cylinder blocks.|$|E
50|$|The ramped powered lighter (RPL) was a type {{of landing}} craft {{formerly}} operated by the Royal Corps of Transport of the British Army, from the 1960s until the 1990s. Performing similar tasks to the ramped <b>cargo</b> <b>lighter</b> of the Second World War, it had a vehicle deck that was 5.49 m wide and 13.26 m long, and a load capacity of 30.5 tonnes (30.0 long tons). From the early 1980s onwards it was replaced with the larger ramped craft logistic (RCL). The last RPL was in service in Belize until the main British Armed Forces presence was withdrawn from there in 1994.|$|E

The fifteen ships of the class were originally built as Design 381 coastal freighters or Design 427 coastal freighters and were converted to <b>light</b> <b>cargo</b> ships during 1949 and 1950 after acquisition by the United States Navy.|$|R

50|$|Masula boat, {{also known}} as masoola or masulah boat, {{is a kind of}} non-rigid boat built without knees used on the coast of Madras (the present day city of Chennai), India, along with catamarans. Locally known as padagu or salangu among the fisher folks, it is a large, flat-bottomed, high-sided, open boat with a clumsy design {{consisting}} of mango wood planks sewed together with strands of coir which cross over a wadding of the same material, but without frames or ribs, so that the shock due to surf is much reduced. It is specially designed for use where there are no harbours of refuge, chiefly upon the surf-beaten Coromandel Coast of India. It is used in shooting shore seines and also as a <b>cargo</b> <b>lighter.</b> Its range extends along the whole of the eastern coast of India northwards of Cape Calimere. The equivalent type of boats used on the west coast are the beach lighters. Masula boats are generally smaller, although they can be up to 9 m in length. The pattern varies across the coast, namely, padava on the Andhra coast and bar boat in Orissa coast. A variant found in the region between Kakinada and Machilipatnam has ribs inside.|$|E
50|$|ING 4727 {{was built}} in 1990. It was a dry cargo cover-top barge with a steel hull. It had an overall length of 200 feet (61 m), a beam of 35 feet (10.7 m) and a height of 12 feet (3.7 m), plus a coaming height of {{approximately}} 4 feet (1.2 m) above the deck. The fiberglass covers atop the hopper added another approximately 5 feet (1.5 m) of height. The cargo hopper yielded 84659 cubes of volume. Fully loaded to a draft of 10 feet (3 m), the barge could carry 1877 tons of <b>cargo.</b> <b>Light</b> (empty) draft was 1 foot 4 & 1/2 inches (0.4 m).|$|R
50|$|Various {{standard}} equipment included interesting {{features such as}} a coat hook on the driver's side, AM radio (AM/FM and AM/FM Cassette were optional), scuff plates and vent windows. The back of the glove compartment door featured coin slots and cup depressions to hold cups and food similar to a food tray on a train. This was a feature only found on this generation and never on later models. It also showed a diagram with lift points {{as well as other}} mechanical information. Sliding rear windows were optional as well as <b>cargo</b> <b>lights,</b> under-hood lights, and many others. Ford offered over 150 options for the seventh-generation F-Series.|$|R

5000|$|Introduced for 1980 models, an {{optional}} resettable trip meter was installed on speedometers and the mileage counter {{was moved to}} the top of the speedometer as part of the optional Sport Instrumentation Group. The Sport Instrumentation Group also included the optional tachometer in the center of the cluster, as well as oil and ammeter gauges. In 1984, the body moulding and interior trim were updated. In 1985-1986 models, the upper accent mouldings were moved below the front marker. For 1985, the rear tailgate moulding on XLT models was updated and previewed the design of the 1987 model. This molding has become increasingly rare and fetches a high price. A <b>cargo</b> <b>light</b> was available as an option and was included in the Light Group option package.
