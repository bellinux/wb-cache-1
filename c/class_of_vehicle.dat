25|$|The District of Columbia issues special {{license plates}} to {{vehicles}} {{owned by the}} D.C. government and the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. While ambulances and other support vehicles of the District of Columbia Fire Department have special red and white plates, fire engines are not issued license plates. Vehicles belonging to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority display standard DC license plates appropriate to the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> with special validation stickers. The transit authority police cars are issued ordinary District of Columbia passenger license plates, but the authority replaces them with self-issued number plates indicating the vehicle is with the transit police.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the fee was {{increased}} to S$5, but in 1989 it was reduced back to S$3, {{due to the}} fact that now more vehicles were paying. In 1994, two levels of licence fees were established, to differentiate between daily permits and inter-peak licences. The paper licences vary in shape depending on the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and their colours varied from one month to another to deter fraud. The colour-coded licences also made it easier for the enforcement personnel to identify the vehicles during the restricted hours. For reason of traffic management, violating vehicles were not stopped at the gantries, but their number plates were taken down and their owner would receive an order to appear in court to pay the fine. The control was made only at the gantries, therefore, vehicles were free to move around or leave the RZ without having to pay the fee.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1970s, {{following}} {{completion of}} the M6 to north of Carlisle, the remaining all-purpose section of the A74 was becoming increasingly outdated and unsafe, and so a special speed limit of [...] ( [...] for HGVs) was imposed. Hector Monro MP was particularly concerned about the speed of heavy goods vehicles along the road, and wanted to erect signs reminding lorry drivers of what the correct limit for that <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> was. He claimed {{that they did not}} realise they were driving on an all-purpose route and ignored the different speed limits.|$|E
2500|$|The tollway has two sections: an {{open section}} and a closed section. The open section (within Metro Manila) charges a flat toll based on vehicle class and is {{employed}} {{to reduce the}} number of toll barriers (and associated bottlenecks) within the metropolis. The closed section is distance-based, charging based on the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> and distance traveled. When the expressway was modernized, an electronic toll collection system was set up for Class 1 vehicles while prepaid magnetic cards were assigned to Class 2 and 3 vehicles to speed up transactions at toll booths. These have since been replaced by a unified ETC system operated by [...] As of October 1, 2011, all tolls (as shown below) include the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT).|$|E
2500|$|In early 2016, Mitsubishi partner Nissan found {{discrepancies}} between Mitsubishi information and actual fuel consumption {{while working in}} new micro cars for both companies, the eK Wagon, eK Space, Nissan Dayz and Nissan Dayz Roox. Mitsubishi manufactures micro cars for Nissan, which no longer makes that <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicle</b> itself. [...] Mitsubishi admitted {{that they had been}} giving wrong information on fuel consumption from 2002 onwards, using inaccurate test methods. Later, the company said it used fuel economy testing methods that did not comply with Japanese regulations for 25 years, much longer than previously known. Mitsubishi management said they did not know about the issue and that the wrong information came from the micro car development department. They ordered an investigation led by investigators not affiliated with the company. The resultant scandal culminated in Nissan acquiring a controlling interest in MMC in May 2016. [...] Nissan agreed to invest 237.4 billion yen ($2.2 billion US) in exchange for receiving a 34% ownership stake in Mitsubishi Motors. [...] Due to dilution of existing shares, other Mitsubishi group companies (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, [...] Mitsubishi Corp., and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ) will see their combined holdings in Mitsubishi Motors fall to about 20% from 34% currently.|$|E
