Three buildings containing seventeen flats in total were monitored {{during a period of}} over two years, monitoring energy consumption and internal temperature of the flats. The energy consumption for the flats was capture by the use of a Current Cost smart meter placed at the ground floor of each block of flats in a cover under stairs. Wireless sensors were clamped to each flat. The smart meters were not connected to the internet or a computer, but instead the data was stored in the internal memory of the equipment and manually downloaded to a computer at each data collection visit. For the purpose of double <b>checking,</b> <b>meter</b> readings were collected at the electricity meter to be able to compared the accuracy and success of the data collected by the Current Cost smart meters. The internal temperature of every flat was collected by mean of a LogTag temperature data. From comparing the Current Cost smart meter data versus the utility meter readings a huge range of overestimation and underestimation of the actual energy consumption was observed. Regarding the internal temperature monitoring, long periods of lost data was identified. The main factors contributing to these data lost were: Long periods between data collection, wireless signal drop offs, unplugging, tampering and removal of equipment. A normalized energy index, based on utility meter readings, internal temperature and outdoor conditions, was developed to overcome the loss of data and assess the effectiveness of the technology and the behavioral change in the occupants.

She negotiated financing with the bank, spent weeks getting building and operating permits and invested in new machinery as well as a new building. She has employees lined up and is ready to get started. But she will have to wait. She still needs to get a new electricity connection for the warehouse—a process that takes more than 7 months and 9 interactions with the utility and other agencies (figure 1). The first and longest step is to get the technical specifications (or conditions) for the external connection. During the winter this can be a source of delay—indeed, the longest delay—because of the electricity supply shortage in that season. To avoid overburdening the electricity network, the electricity company, Barki Tojik, postpones the issuance of the specifications. After this step is completed, the State Agency for Energy Supervision inspects the construction site twice, once before the connection works are carried out and once afterward, to ensure that the new external and internal installations meet the technical standards.

The Water Supply Network (WSN) Department manages the 5490  km of potable mains, 573  km of NEWater (high-grade reclaimed water) mains and 42  km of industrial water mains that deliver the water to more than 1.4 million customers. WSN {{has embarked on a}} Smart Water Grid journey to ensure good water is supplied to its customers 24  h a day, 7  days a week. A Smart Water Grid system integrates information and communications technologies (ICT) into the management of the water distribution system. Sensors, meters, digital controls and analytic tools are used to automate, monitor and control the transmission and distribution of water, ensuring that water is efficiently delivered only when and where it is needed and with good quality. Today, many industries are making use of ICT to improve their operations and processes, particularly through digitization and automation. Digitization and automation enable automatic remote collection of data at site, and wireless transmission to a central system for monitoring and analysis. Recent advancements in ICT have been largely driven by the emergence of Internet of Things, cloud computing and big data analytics. When applied to the water industry, these advances in ICT enable to capture and store enormous pools of big data and perform powerful analytics and predictive analysis to contribute towards greater efficiency and effectiveness in water resource management. As the Singapore population continues to grow, PUB’s water infrastructure needs to be ready to meet an increasing water demand while maintaining good asset condition to ensure good water is supplied to customers around the clock. There is an increasing need to leverage on these innovative technologies in order to ensure the water infrastructure is sustainable and resilient. Presently in WSN, many of the operational processes such as water leakage checks, water quality <b>checks</b> and <b>meter</b> readings, are still done manually. Against the backdrop of a shrinking and increasingly educated labour force, the implementation of the Smart Water Grid will also streamline manpower requirements and redesign work processes by automating menial tasks.|$|R

The 95 % confidence limits for flow measurement across {{the range of}} the new meters was between ± 151 min− 1 {{at the lower end of}} the range and ± 281 min− 1 at the top of the range. The readings for 22 (63 %) of the old meters (age range 1 – 13 yr) were within these 95 % confidence limits. For the remaining 13 old meters (age range 1 – 13 yr) whose readings were not within these limits, there were 11 meters with readings falling below and two meters with readings above these limits. Twelve of these old meters were washed and retested and there was no significant change in their readings.

The use of steel is one of the governing construction materials in the industries. One of the major concerns of existing steel structures is the durability. Corrosion and deterioration have become major challenges in the lifetime of the structure, as {{it is one of the}} major public focuses on the structures. Standards are intended to assist engineers and corrosion experts in adopting best practice in corrosion protection of structural steel at new constructions with proper identification of an actual exposure. There are six environmental corrosivity categories according to BS ISO 12944 as C 1, C 2 C 3, C 4, C 5 and C 5 –M. Those are according to BS standard and they should be adapted for Sri Lanka. In this research environmental corrosivity category of SC 1, SC 2, SC 3 and SC 4 are classified for Sri Lanka considering corrosion affecting factors temperature, rainfall, coastal region and industrial zones. A field survey was carried out in different locations of the structure in the country to identify the pattern of corrosion according to variation of corrosion affecting factors. Among the methods used to clean the surface of the steel before applying corrosion protection, sand blasting cleans best. However, it cannot be carried out in every location due to environmental issues and equipment required. Steel surface is difficult to clean using light tools because temporary stabilized corroded layer on the steel surface. If we change this surface (Convert surface grade A to Surface grade B), the light tools can be used for the surface preparation. Therefore a new method is proposed to change this surface grade.

40|$|ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY In {{this project}} a study {{about the use}} of {{geothermal}} energy for air conditioning of the Colegio Mayor Juan de la Cosa is done. The number of probes required, its position, all the elements required for the installation to extract heat from the subsoil, and the execution thereof are calculated. To this end, all the necessary parameters such as geology, climate, construction site, the energy demands of the building throughout the year, and the number of hours of use of the system will be analyzed. Relevant simulations will be conducted to verify proper operation of the system that will be chosen, and finally, the constructive solution will be defined to comply with these requirements. THEORETICAL CONTEXT The low enthalpy geothermal energy consists of transmiting thermal energy from underground short depth to a building. When a heat input into the building is needed, the use of the system is as heating. Or It is used for cooling when is necessary transport the heat inside the building to the surface layers of the Earth. Geothermal energy of low enthalpy present in anywhere in the world, is a renewable energy, is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, is safe, predictable, measurable, controllable, metered, virtually inexhaustible, present at any point of the terrestrial crust and with very low levels of use in Spain. There are several ways to exploit this energy. Used in this study is a closed system. The implementations of vertical geothermal boreholes are located under the building. LOCATION AND GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK The location of the building, on which the study of the use of very low enthalpy geothermal will be performed, is located on the current site located at number 55 (D) of the Avenue of the Castros of the city of Santander (39005). At the North, Avenue Castros, At South, Honduras Street, At West, La Teja park, and at the East, buildings for residential use are available. Geology in this area present for less than 170 m depth would be shown in the following two points: 1. A layer formed by an alternation of marl and marly limestones, with powers of centimeters or decimeters and abundant traces of water leaks. In this first layer the borehole has a depth of about 80 - 90 m from the level of project. 2. A second layer formed predominantly by calcarenitas, with bioclastic and sandy limestones with power decimeter or meter, very regular, and having well-defined surfaces frequently stratification by marly joints. In this second layer the 150 - 170 m depth are achieved from the level of project. STUDY OF ALTERNATIVES To determine the number of probes, depth and configuration of the building, is needed to start knowing the data and machines which have to be installed, and proceeds to simulate the thermal behavior of the subsoil over the years to ensure correct operation of the installation. This calculation is performed by EED 3. 2 software, very common in the design of vertical heat exchangers. A total of 4 simulations are performed, discarding the first because it doesn’t provide the the building energy needs. The second one is made with a single probe type U, it provides us the building energy needed with the minimum requirements of the installation. With the aim of seeking to reduce costs, a third simulation with a probe double U type is simulated, which save us meters of drilling and therefore reduce the final budget. After calculating the third simulation, and <b>checking</b> that effectively <b>meters</b> of drilling are below those of the second drilling, it is found that is capable of meeting the energy demands of the building. It is noted that this third option is very close to the cool limits for the heat transfer fluid, so it was decided to make one last simulation with a slight increase in the depth of the boreholes. Serving more safely to the limits given for the heat transfer fluid. BOREHOLE EXECUTION AND TESTS This first drilling soil type is required, which can be executed by various methods, the method chosen in this study is the rotation with the use of sludge in direct circulation for debris extraction. The casings will be needed at least {{in the first part of}} the boreholes to ensure the sustainability of the land. The introduction of the exchanger (PEX material) will be made once walls of drilling are fitted. It will review the probes lack of scratches caused during transport or during handling. The probes will have dividers that keep apart a given distance the pipes. In the the dividers center will have a hole where will be placed the injection tube. Probes were loaded with the water- antifreeze mixture before they will be introduced in the borehole. This will allow gravity pipe down, taking care to don’t introduce at a rate too high to avoid rubbing the probes with the mouth or the walls of the borehole. It will be introduced manually or with the aid of an unwinding mechanism. Before injection of the filling it is recommended a first pressure test subjecting the exchanger at a pressure of 6 bar for 30 min. If the test succeeds the filling material is injected through injection pipe from the base of the drilling. The filling mixture is made by injection plant. Once cemented the survey, final pressure test is performed according to the UNE 100715 - 1, whose operating scheme is summarized as follows: • The tubes were kept idle without load for at least 1 hour. • The probe is brought to test pressure (12 ± 1 bar) in a time of 10 minutes. • Stays in pressure (at least 10 bar) for 10 minutes. • Waiting Period: 60 minutes. Maximum pressure drop: 30 %. • The pressure is quickly reduced by 2 bar through water drain. the discharged amount is measured and the new pressure value is noted. • Start main test (30 minutes). The pressure is measured at 10, 20 and 30 minutes. The pressure test is satisfactory if, after the third measurement, the maximum pressure drop is 0. 1 bar. • After an additional 90 minutes, the pressure drop should be less than 0. 25 bar. Borehole connection to the heat pumps room is made by HDPE pipes, for it is needed to do a trench with 1 m deep, where a sand bed of 10 cm is placed to prevent scratching HDPE tubes is done. Another layer of sand over the HDPE tubes are placed and the rest is filled with ground own previous excavation. ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY AND FINAL CHOOSE In a first analysis indicates that the alternative Nº 2 is the most expensive because of the large number of underground drilling to be executed mainly. If the budget of the horizontal section is also analyzed it shows that the alternative Nº 2 is also the most expensive. This is because the cubic meters of excavation and pipe meters are higher for the largest number of probes to be executed. Analyzing the cost of vertical soundings noticed this difference because the survey meter drilling is more expensive than the exchanger, then reducing meters of drilling cost savings will be achieved. Therefore, The alternative Nº 2 is 7. 81 % more expensive than the alternative Nº 3 and a 5. 7 % more expensive than the alternative Nº 4. In this order, the alternative Nº 3 may be discarded for economic reasons. The difference between the alternative Nº 3 and alternative Nº 4 is 4346. 5 euros, 1. 9 % of the budget for the alternative Nº 3. It is not a significant economic difference between these two alternatives. But in response to technical reasons the alternative Nº. 4 is willing side of safety, while alternative Nº 3 is more in line with the limit values. Therefore to ensure the proper functioning of the system it decides that the alternative Nº 4, despite a small increase in the budget, is the best alternative with a tender base budget of € 322, 454. 42. RESUMEN: OBJETIVO DEL ESTUDIO En el presente proyecto se realiza un estudio sobre el uso de la energía geotérmica para la climatización del Colegio Mayor Juan de la Cosa, calculando el número de sondeos necesarios, su posición y todos los elementos que requiere la instalación para extraer el calor del subsuelo, así como su ejecución. Para ello se analizarán todos los parámetros necesarios como son la geología, el clima, el emplazamiento de la obra, las demandas energéticas del edificio a lo largo del año, así como el número de horas de utilización del sistema. Se realizarán las simulaciones pertinentes para comprobar el correcto funcionamiento del sistema escogido, y finalmente, se definirá la solución constructiva necesaria para dar cumplimiento a estos requisitos establecidos. CONTEXTO TEÓRICO La energía geotérmica de baja entalpía consiste en trasmitir energía térmica desde el subsuelo a pequeña profundidad a una edificación. Cuando sea necesario un aporte de calor en el edificio usando el sistema como calefacción, o cuando sea necesario refrigerar las estancias se transportará el calor del interior de la edificación a las capas superficiales de la Tierra. La energía geotérmica de baja entalpía, presente en cualquier punto del planeta, es una energía renovable, está disponible las 24 horas del día, 365 días al año, es segura, previsible, medible, controlable, dosificable, prácticamente inagotable, presente en cualquier punto de la corteza terrestre y con muy bajos niveles de utilización en España. Existen diversas formas de aprovechar esta energía. La utilizada en este estudio consiste en un sistema de lazo cerrado con ejecución de sondas geotérmicas verticales situadas debajo del edificio. UBICACIÓN Y MARCO GEOLOGICO El lugar donde se encontrará el edificio sobre el que se realiza el estudio del empleo de la geotermia de muy baja entalpía se ubica en el actual solar situado en el numero 55 (D) de la avenida de los Castros de la ciudad de Santander (39005). Al Norte se dispone la avenida de los Castros, al Sur la calle Honduras, al Oeste el parque municipal de la Teja y al Este un solar con edificaciones de tipología abierta de uso residencial. En esta zona la geología presente para un sondeo menor a 170 m sería la que se muestra en los|$|R
