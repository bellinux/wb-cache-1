In Goldens’ centrifugal casting process, molten iron is poured {{into a hollow}} <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mold</b> spinning on a horizontal or vertical axis at speeds generating 40 to 70 Gs of centrifugal force. This force distributes the molten metal, promotes directional solidification, and improves casting integrity by forcing impurities to the inside surface.|$|E

50|$|These {{laboratory}} tests generally consist of compacting soil at known moisture content into a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mold</b> of standard dimensions using a compactive effort of controlled magnitude. The soil is usually compacted {{into the mold}} to {{a certain amount of}} equal layers, each receiving a number of blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height. This process is then repeated for various moisture contents and the dry densities are determined for each. The graphical relationship of the dry density to moisture content is then plotted to establish the compaction curve. The maximum dry density is finally obtained from the peak point of the compaction curve and its corresponding moisture content, also known as the optimal moisture content.|$|E

50|$|In March 1995 Guo et al. {{were the}} first to report the use of a laser to ablate a block of pure {{graphite}}, and later graphite mixed with catalytic metal. The catalytic metal can consist of elements such as cobalt, niobium, platinum, nickel, copper, or a binary combination thereof. The composite block is formed by making a paste of graphite powder, carbon cement, and the metal. The paste is next placed in a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mold</b> and baked for several hours. After solidification, the graphite block is placed inside an oven with a laser pointed at it, and argon gas is pumped along the direction of the laser point. The oven temperature is approximately 1200 °C. As the laser ablates the target, carbon nanotubes form and are carried by the gas flow onto a cool copper collector. Like carbon nanotubes formed using the electric-arc discharge technique, carbon nanotube fibers are deposited in a haphazard and tangled fashion. Single-walled nanotubes are formed from the block of graphite and metal catalyst particles, whereas multi-walled nanotubes form from the pure graphite starting material.|$|E

40|$|In {{metal casting}} processes, surface {{tension of the}} molten metal {{typically}} resists filling of the metal into the mold. The effects are greater for smaller mold cavities, and ultimately, the smallest cavities may not be filled. Surface tension forces can be overcome by applying pressure (head) to the molten metal, thus forcing metal into the cavities. However, a pressure-window will exist, too little pressure resulting in non-filled cavities and too much pressure resulting in penetration of the mold, which is itself porous. Filling-pressure windows are investigated for cylindrical-shaped mold cavities on both a theoretical and experimental basis. The lower bound of the filling pressure window is examined by treating <b>cylindrical</b> <b>mold</b> cavities as cylinders lined with packed spheres representing mold particles. The upper bound is examined by treating the mold as a 3 -D array of close-packed spheres.
