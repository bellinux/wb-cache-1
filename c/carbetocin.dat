25|$|Oxytocin {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and {{a deficit of}} it {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the oxytocin receptor. In accordance, unlike oxytocin, the selective non-peptide oxytocin receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, <b>carbetocin,</b> a close analogue of oxytocin and peptide oxytocin receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of oxytocin may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where oxytocin is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbetocin</b> {{functions}} as an agonist at peripheral oxytocin receptors, {{particularly in the}} myometrium, with lesser affinity for myopepithelial cells. Oxytocin receptors are G protein-coupled and their mechanism of action involves second messengers {{and the production of}} inositol phosphates. <b>Carbetocin</b> mimics this mechanism. Binding for <b>carbetocin</b> and other oxytocin agonists {{has been shown to be}} nonselective at the extracellular N-terminus and loops E2 and E3. While the oxytocin receptor shows equal affinity for oxytocin and <b>carbetocin,</b> the biological effect of <b>carbetocin</b> is almost 50% that of endogenous or exogenous oxytocin. <b>Carbetocin</b> has a much longer lasting effect than oxytocin, necessitating only a single dose. <b>Carbetocin</b> inhibits endogenous oxytocin release, interrupting the uterine feedback loop with the hypothalamus and decreasing both central and peripheral release of oxytocin.|$|E

50|$|Contraindications {{for the use}} of <b>carbetocin</b> include {{inappropriate}} timing during {{labor and}} delivery (such as before parturition or to induce labor) or allergic reactions to <b>carbetocin</b> or other oxytocin homologues. Additionally, <b>carbetocin</b> should not be used if a patient has high blood pressure or cardiovascular problems. Overdosage or repeated use of <b>carbetocin,</b> particularly if used during pregnancy, could cause hyper-excitation of the oxytocin receptors resulting in excessive and prolonged stimulation of uterine contractions, increasing risk of uterine rupture, placental abruption, fetal respiratory distress and postpartum hemorrhage.|$|E
50|$|During pregnancy, the {{synthesis}} of oxytocin receptors in the uterus greatly increases, reaching a peak during labor and delivery. Consequently, the administration of <b>carbetocin</b> or another oxytocin analog during or immediately following birth will have increased uterotonic and contractile effect. The application of <b>carbetocin</b> does not affect a non-pregnant uterus with lower oxytocin receptor expression. <b>Carbetocin</b> also functions to thicken the blood, further preventing post-partum hemorrhage. <b>Carbetocin</b> {{should not be used}} to induce or augment labor since it could cause cardiac or respiratory distress to mother or infant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbetocin</b> {{has also}} been shown to stimulate milk letdown through its action on the {{oxytocin}} receptors on the myoepithelial cells and there was not a significant amount of <b>carbetocin</b> in breastmilk.|$|E
50|$|Safety of <b>carbetocin</b> {{following}} vaginal {{births and}} emergency Cesarean sections {{has not been}} established, though studies have suggested efficacy following vaginal births to that following Cesarean sections.

50|$|<b>Carbetocin</b> {{works as}} an oxytocic, {{antihemorrhagic}} and uterotonic drug in the peripheral nervous system. The most common causes of postpartum hemorrhage are lack of tone in the uterus from overstretching {{or the use of}} an anesthetic. <b>Carbetocin</b> has been approved for use immediately following an elective Cesarean section when a local or spinal anesthesia has been administered. Since the uterus cannot contract on its own following incision during a Cesarean section, exogenous administration of oxytocin or an analog is necessary to restore uterine tone and prevent hemorrhage.|$|E

Duratocin has also been approved for veterinary use in Poland, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Due to carbetocin's {{considerably}} longer half-life, {{its effects}} are longer lasting than other oxytocin homologs such as Pitocin or barusiban. A single <b>carbetocin</b> administration {{compared to a}} placebo or an eight-hour intravenous drip of oxytocin in a randomized blind study, necessitated significantly less additional oxytocin therapy following a Cesarean section. Oxytocin receptor antagonists, such as Barusiban or atosiban have the opposite effect of depressing oxytocin receptor activity {{and can be used}} to stop premature labor and uterine contractions.|$|E
50|$|Endogenous and {{synthetic}} oxytocin has a half-life of approximately 3.5 minutes. <b>Carbetocin,</b> in comparison, {{has a much}} longer half-life ranging from 85-100 minutes. The bioavailable dose is around 80%. The elimination half-life following intravenous administration is around 40 minutes, though the elimination mechanism is not entirely known. Studies have shown that elimination is only minimally renal (0.7%), but may occur at least partially through enzymatic degradation of peptides, primarily on the C-terminal end. Both elimination and volume of distribution are not dose dependent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbetocin</b> {{is to be}} used in the {{hospital}} by prescription only. It can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. In both cases, the recommended dose for an average adult female is 100 ug. Contractile effects of the uterus are apparent within two minutes and can be observed for approximately one hour, though maximum binding occurs about 30 minutes after intramuscular injection. Administration is performed immediately following parturition to minimize risk of postpartum hemorrhage by inducing uterine contractions, increasing muscle tone and thickening the blood. If further uterine stimulation is needed, treatment with other forms of oxytocic uterotonic drugs should be used.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{management}} of uterine atony is uterine massage. The next step is pharmacological therapies, {{the first of which}} is oxytocin, used because it initiates rhythmic contractions of the uterus, compressing the spiral arteries which should reduce bleeding. The next step in the pharmacological management is the use of methylergometrine, which is an ergot derivative, much like that use in the abortive treatment of migraines. Its side effect of hypertension means its use should not be used in those with hypertension or pre-eclampsia. In those with hypertension, the use of prostaglandin F2α is indicated (but beware of its use in patients with asthma).Another option <b>Carbetocin</b> and Carboprost where Oxytocin and ergometrin is inappropriate.|$|E

Materials and Methods: This study was a double blind randomized clinical trial that carried out on 200 pregnant women referred to Shabiehkhani maternity center of Kashan, during 2011. The first group received intramuscular syntometrine and the second group received intramuscular <b>carbetocin</b> after placental delivery. All of the participants were followed for 24 hours and blood pressure, pulse rate, uterine tone, hemoglobin concentration at first and 24 hours after delivery, and the need for additional uterotonic drugs and drug side effects were evaluated. Finally all data were analyzed using t-test, chi square tests and logistic regression. Results: The mean fall in hemoglobin level in the <b>carbetocin</b> group was significantly lower than the syntometrine group (P < 0. 001). Also there were significant differences between the two groups, regarding additional uterotonic drug requirements (P = 0. 002). Moreover systolic blood pressure and uterine tone immediately and 30 minutes after drug administration were significantly different (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Oxytocin receptors {{are known}} to {{modulate}} synaptic transmission and network activity in the hippocampus, but their precise function has been only partially elucidated.

This evidence paved the way for examining the effect of <b>carbetocin</b> treatment in "prenatally restraint stressed" (PRS) rats, i. e., the offspring of dams exposed to repeated episodes of restraint stress during pregnancy. Adult PRS rats exhibit an anxious/depressive-like phenotype associated with an abnormal glucocorticoid feedback regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and, remarkably, with a reduced depolarization-evoked glutamate release in the ventral hippocampus.

40|$|Tree shrews, {{a species}} phylogenetically close to primates, are {{regarded}} as a suitable and naturalistic animal model for depression studies. However, psychological symptoms that are essential for depression diagnosis and treatment, such as helplessness and social withdrawal, have not been studied in this model. Therefore, in this study, we first investigated learned helplessness, social interaction and sucrose preference induced by two chronic stress paradigms: uncontrollable foot shocks (1 -week foot shocks) and multiple unpredictable stimuli (1 -week foot shocks and 3 -week unpredictable stressors) in tree shrews. Our results showed that uncontrollable foot shocks could only induce learned helplessness in animals; whereas animals treated with multiple unpredictable stimuli exhibited more depression-like behaviors including social withdrawal, anhedonia and learned helplessness. These findings suggested that multiple unpredictable stimuli could effectively induce various depression-like behaviors in tree shrews. More importantly, we compared the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine and <b>carbetocin,</b> a long-acting oxytocin analog, on specific depression-like behaviors. Our present data displayed that, compared with fluoxetine, <b>carbetocin</b> was also effective in reversing learned helplessness, elevating sucrose preference and improving social interaction behaviors in depression-like animals.

The 10 mg/kg CBT-saline treatment suppressed locomotion and augmented anxiogenic behaviour, while OT antagonist treatment enhanced locomotor behaviour, and decreased anxiety-like behaviour. The present findings suggest that OT antagonist treatment has anxiolytic effects on basal anxiety-like behaviours, and attenuates the expression of sickness behaviour...|$|E
