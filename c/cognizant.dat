5|$|On 13 April 1968, {{in another}} one of his {{frequent}} cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain in his position as minister of state. <b>Cognizant</b> of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views.

5|$|Three court {{appointed}} psychiatrists found Kemper to {{be legally}} sane. One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile records and the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully <b>cognizant</b> in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy associated with being labeled a serial killer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cognizant</b> of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. <b>Cognizant</b> that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
5|$|Major {{information}} technology (IT) and outsourcing companies like Infosys, <b>Cognizant</b> Technology Solutions and Endurance International Group have their branches at Mangalore.

5|$|The main {{legacy of}} the SSR Abkhazia is that it created, {{for the first time}} in modern history, a defined {{geographic}} entity under the name Abkhazia. The Abkhaz people were <b>cognizant</b> of their republic and its quasi-independent status, and though it was removed in 1931 they did not forget that it had existed. The SSR Abkhazia would take a prominent role during the glasnost and perestroika era of the late 1980s, as Abkhaz leaders called for their state to once again be formed and break away from Georgia, citing the SSR Abkhazia as a precedent. This led to them restoring the 1925 SSR Abkhazian constitution, which ultimately led to the 1992–1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, and the modern Abkhaz–Georgian conflict.|$|E

5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained <b>cognizant</b> {{of the effects of the}} Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

25|$|An {{advantage}} of psychedelic drugs in exploring the unconscious {{is that a}} conscious sliver of the adult ego usually remains alert during the experience.

25|$|Article 14 {{does not}} define the offence of {{contempt}} and hence by necessary implication it {{is left to}} the courts to define it. Justice Loh stated that, in defining the offence, judges must be <b>cognizant</b> that the definition must be circumscribed by Article 14, to ensure {{a balance between the}} freedom of speech and the offence. Neither can be defined in a way that renders the other otiose.|$|E
25|$|While <b>cognizant</b> of {{the fact}} that both, the free {{software}} movement and the open source movement, share similarities in practical recommendations regarding open source, the free software movement fervently continues to distinguish themselves from the open source movement entirely.

The free software community does not view the open source community as their target grievance, however. Their target grievance is proprietary software itself.|$|E
25|$|The term {{may also}} refer to Jews {{who do not}} {{practice}} the religion of Judaism. Typically, ethnic Jews are <b>cognizant</b> of their Jewish background, and may feel strong cultural (even if not religious) ties to Jewish traditions and to the Jewish people or nation. Like people of any other ethnicity, non-religious ethnic Jews often assimilate into a surrounding non-Jewish culture, but, especially in areas {{where there is a}} strong local Jewish culture, they may remain largely part of that culture instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} {{robotics}} {{is closely related}} to AI. Intelligence is required for robots to handle tasks such as object manipulation and navigation, with sub-problems such as localization, mapping, and motion planning. These systems require that an agent is able to: Be spatially <b>cognizant</b> of its surroundings, learn from and build a map of its environment, {{figure out how to get}} from one point in space to another, and execute that movement (which often involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining physical contact with an object).|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the Supreme Student Council (SSC), the university's student {{governing}} body, led {{the campaign}} for the student representation at the PLM Board of Regents, and made the PLM community <b>cognizant</b> of the issue. Senator Francis Pangilinan, on January 15, 2002, filed the Senate Bill No. 1967 or an act amending certain provisions of Republic Act No. 4196.

25|$|The DACS was {{established}} in the late 1970s. The software community, at that time, recognized the need for data and information about computer software, its development process and the software technology area in general. The rapid expanison of software engineering technology and the proliferation of tools and techniques made it difficult for an individual or organization to remain <b>cognizant</b> of the current status of the software engineering field. This situation resulted in the duplication of efforts in software research and seriously hampered the transfer of technology from the software research environment to the user sector of the software community.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, Britain's Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and London was the {{financial}} centre of the world.

25|$|This LTM availability/accessibility {{dichotomy}} {{is analogous}} to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge {{as a result of}} information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against immortality is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted but we are not <b>cognizant</b> of many of those ideas because they have yet to be recalled.|$|E
25|$|Pershing {{exercised}} significant {{control over}} his command, with a full delegation of authority from Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker. Baker, <b>cognizant</b> of the endless problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision making in wartime, gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit. In turn, Pershing exercised his prerogative carefully, not engaging in politics or disputes over government policy that might distract him from his military mission. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, he did not advocate their full participation on the battlefield, understanding the general racial attitudes of white Americans. In addition, Wilson held reactionary views on race and owed political debts to southern Democratic politicians.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{feedback}} {{has also}} been studied in relation to visual extinction. Patients were asked to touch a known target in a darkened room. A light attached to the patient’s hand was sometimes briefly illuminated, {{to provide information about}} where the hand was in relation to the target. In some of these trials, a distracting light was also lit, which induced an extinction event in the patient. Although the patient reported in such cases that he had not seen the indicator light on his hand, their performance was correspondingly better, similar to the results when visual feedback had been available. Although the patient was not <b>cognizant</b> of having received the information, they were able to correctly act upon it, {{in a manner similar to}} blindsight.|$|E
25|$|Eager {{to achieve}} fame (and {{undoubtedly}} some expiation) {{in the cause}} of anti-slavery, he emigrated to the United States of America in the fall of 1786, moving to Philadelphia. His unsuccessful efforts to lead a contingent of free black Americans to join the small British settlement of London blacks {{at the mouth of the}} Sierra Leone River in West Africa were looked on favorably by Philadelphia's Quaker establishment. Some leaders of the new republic—notably James Madison, with whom he lodged at Mrs. Mary House's prominent boarding establishment in 1787 and 1788—were <b>cognizant</b> of Thornton's abolitionist activities. However, after moving to the City of Washington, he took advantage of slavery. According to a diary his wife kept in 1800, he frequently shopped for slaves and bought and hired them. In 1788, he became an American citizen. Thornton married Anna Maria Brodeau, daughter of a school teacher, in 1790.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1975, congressional Church Committee reports and the presidential Rockefeller Commission report {{revealed}} {{to the public for}} the first time that the CIA and the Department of Defense had conducted experiments on both unwitting and <b>cognizant</b> human subjects as part of an extensive program to find out how to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. They also revealed that at least one subject, Frank Olson had died after administration of LSD. Much of what the Church Committee and the Rockefeller Commission learned about MKUltra was contained in a report, prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963, that had survived the destruction of records ordered in 1973. However, it contained little detail. Sidney Gottlieb, who had retired from the CIA two years previously, was interviewed by the committee but claimed to have very little recollection of the activities of MKUltra.|$|E
25|$|After the Battle of Cold Harbor in Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's 1864 Overland Campaign, the Union Army of the Potomac {{slipped away}} from Gen. Robert E. Lee and began {{crossing}} the James River. Although the Overland Campaign's objective {{had been to}} defeat Lee's Army of Northern Virginia in a decisive battle, Grant changed his objective to be the city of Petersburg, an important rail junction that controlled the supplies leading to the Confederate capital of Richmond. Grant knew that Lee could not protect Richmond if Petersburg fell {{and he would be}} forced to battle Grant in the open. He also knew from the unsuccessful first assaults on June 9 how weak the Petersburg defenses actually were. Speed was essential to Grant's plan, requiring success before Lee realized Grant's objective and could reinforce Petersburg. Lee was not in fact fully <b>cognizant</b> of Grant's moves until June 18, assuming until then that Grant would target Richmond. Beauregard, however, had been loudly warning of the danger to Petersburg since June 9.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the blocked static ports, the basic flight {{instruments}} relayed false airspeed, altitude and vertical speed data. Because the failure was not in any of the instruments, but rather in a common supporting system, thereby defeating redundancy, the erroneous altimeter data was also broadcast to Air Traffic Control, who was attempting to provide the pilots with basic flight data. This led to extreme confusion in the cockpit as the pilots were provided with some data (altitude) which seemed to correlate correctly with instrument data (altimeter) while the other data provided by ATC (approximate airspeed) did not agree. Although the pilots were quite <b>cognizant</b> of the possibility that all of the flight instruments were providing inaccurate data, the correlation between the altitude data given by ATC and that on the altimeter likely further compounded the confusion. Also contributing to their difficulty were the numerous cockpit alarms that the computer system generated, which conflicted both {{with each other and with}} the instruments. This lack of situational awareness was revealed by the cockpit voice recorder transcript. The fact that the flight took place at night and over water, thus not giving the pilots any visual references, was also identified as a major factor.|$|E
