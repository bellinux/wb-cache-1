40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{the correlation between}} magnetic resonance manifestation and survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Methods The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of 30 glioblastoma patients were collected. Imaging features including degrees of contrasted area, edema surrounding the tumor, and intensity in T 2 -weighted imaging were selected to determine their correlation with patient survival. The relationship between imaging and survival time was studied using SPSS 19. 0 software. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were {{used to compare the}} survival curves. Results Patients with ≤ 5 % <b>contrasted</b> <b>enhancement</b> area of tumor had longer overall survival (OS) than those with> 5 % <b>contrasted</b> <b>enhancement</b> area of tumor. Patients without edema surrounding the tumor had longer OS than those with edema. Patients with tumor of hyperintensity and/or isointensity in T 2 -weighted imaging had longer OS than those with hyperintensity and/or isointensity and hypointensity. Conclusions Some MR imaging features including degrees of contrasted area, edema surrounding the tumor, and intensity in T 2 -weighted imaging are correlated with the survival of patients with GBM. These features can serve as prognostic indicators for GBM patients...|$|R
25|$|Stroke is {{diagnosed}} through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the NIHSS), CT scans (most often without <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancements)</b> or MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with {{assistance from the}} imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used blood test for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke.|$|R
25|$|Image {{processing}} and image analysis {{tend to focus}} on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixel-wise operations such as <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement,</b> local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image. This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither require assumptions nor produce interpretations about the image content.|$|E
25|$|Hepatobiliary MR is used {{to detect}} and {{characterize}} lesions of the liver, pancreas, and bile ducts. Focal or diffuse disorders of the liver may be evaluated using diffusion-weighted, opposed-phase imaging, and dynamic <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> sequences. Extracellular contrast agents are used widely in liver MRI and newer hepatobiliary contrast agents also provide the opportunity to perform functional biliary imaging. Anatomical imaging of the bile ducts is achieved by using a heavily T2-weighted sequence in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Functional imaging of the pancreas is performed following administration of secretin. MR enterography provides non-invasive assessment of inflammatory bowel disease and small bowel tumors. MR-colonography {{may play a role}} in the detection of large polyps in patients at increased risk of colorectal cancer.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet microscopes {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes. This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes it simple to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E
5000|$|Night sights: On {{tactical}} firearms, the <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancements</b> can {{consist of}} small vials containing tritium gas whose radioactive decay causes a fluorescent material to glow. Self-luminous tritium sights provide vital visibility in extremely low light situations where normal sights would be degraded or even useless. The tritium glow is not noticeable in bright {{conditions such as}} during daylight however. As a result, some manufacturers have started to integrate fiber optic sights with tritium vials to provide bright, high-contrast firearms sights in both bright and dim conditions.|$|R

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} pulse sequences {{can be used for}} specific MRI diagnostic imaging (multiparametric MRI or mpMRI). It is possible to differentiate tissue characteristics by combining two {{or more of the following}} imaging sequences, depending on the information being sought: T1-weighted (T1-MRI), T2-weighted (T2-MRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI-MRI), dynamic <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> (DCE-MRI), and spectroscopy (MRI-S). For example, imaging of prostate tumors is better accomplished using T2-MRI and DWI-MRI than T2-weighted imaging alone. [...] The number of applications of mpMRI for detecting disease in various organs continues to expand, including liver studies, breast tumors, pancreatic tumors, and assessing the effects of vascular disruption agents on cancer tumors.|$|E
2500|$|An {{additional}} category of anti-reflection coatings {{is the so-called}} [...] "absorbing ARC". These coatings are useful in situations where high transmission through a surface is unimportant or undesirable, but low reflectivity is required. They can produce very low reflectance with few layers, and can often be produced more cheaply, or at greater scale, than standard non-absorbing AR coatings. (See, for example, [...]) Absorbing ARCs often make use of unusual optical properties exhibited in compound thin films produced by sputter deposition. For example, titanium nitride and niobium nitride are used in absorbing ARCs. These {{can be useful in}} applications requiring <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancement</b> or as a replacement for tinted glass (for example, in a CRT display).|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper gives {{a method}} for fusion of visible and {{infrared}} image, which combined non-sampling contourlet and wavelet transform. This method firstly makes <b>contrast</b> <b>enhancements</b> to infrared image. Next, does NSCT decomposition to visible image and enhanced-infrared image, then decomposes the low frequency from above decomposition using wavelet. Thirdly, for high-frequency subband of NSCT decomposition and high or low-frequency subband of wavelet, it uses different fusion rules. Finally, it gets fusion image through refactoring of wavelet and NSCT. Experiments show that the method not only retains texture details belong to visible images, but also highlights targets in infrared images. It has a better fusion effect...|$|R

5000|$|Contrast mediums {{used for}} X-ray CT, {{as well as}} for plain film X-ray, are called radiocontrasts. Radiocontrasts for X-ray CT are, in general, iodine-based. This is useful to {{highlight}} structures such as blood vessels that otherwise would be difficult to delineate from their surroundings. Using contrast material can also help to obtain functional information about tissues. Often, images are taken both with and without radiocontrast. CT images are called precontrast or native-phase images before any radiocontrast has been administrated, and postcontrast after radiocontrast administration.
