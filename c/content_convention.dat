40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{taxonomy}} {{of the conventional}} forms of coordination of the action based on the progressive weakening of their interpretability.

The rule, concept essential of any theory of the action, can be considered like particular mode of organization {{of the field of}} the action possible.

After that, we propose to base the disjunction between the procedure and the routine on the differences between the formal and the tacit. Indeed, the weakening of the interpretable character of the rule in situations where uncertainty is reduced or largely endogeneized leads to giving it a more marked prescriptive character in the form of procedure like structure of formal action and the routine like structure of tacit action.

Using a quantitative approach, to data collection and analysis, three different methods of evaluation were used to score each piece of student writing. Using a matching non-random convenience sample students were placed in the two comparative groups. Each group of students received either shared writing instruction or interactive writing instruction for four 15 - 20 minute lessons per week. Following one week for baseline assessments and four weeks of intervention, students were given a concluding writing assessment and concluding writing journal samples were collected. Scores from both the baseline writing assessments and concluding assessments, as well as baseline journal samples and concluding journal samples, were analyzed and evaluated to show students progress. Overall scores were then compared between the two groups.
