The predicted negative central-force-constant <b>change</b> <b>for</b> NN cations is in essential {{agreement with the}} value inferred from measured Raman spectra by Glynn, Hayes and Wiltshire. The predicted force-constant <b>change</b> <b>for</b> NN anions is also negative, {{in contrast to the}} large positive value inferred from spectra. However, outward radial displacement of NN cations may produce a large, positive central force-constant <b>change</b> <b>for</b> those third-neighbor anions in line with NN cations. It now appears that the latter effect provides a better explanation for an observed A 1 resonance in the Raman spectrum at 310 cm- 1 than does a hypothetical positive force-constant <b>change</b> <b>for</b> NN anions...|$|R

5|$|Around {{the time}} of Dr. Nos release in October 1962, a comic book {{adaptation}} of the screenplay, written by Norman J.

It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic.

5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details <b>changed.</b> <b>For</b> instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little <b>changed.</b> <b>For</b> neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence for the overall efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E

5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian Rush and Newcastle's Darren Peacock was <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked likely to end in a draw, in stoppage time Rush and John Barnes began to play a series of one-twos towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings in distress.|$|E

The Ottoman Sultan then later changed his decision and demanded that a mosque and a Turkish colony be established in Constantinople. Manuel II not only refused this, he also refused to pay the Sultan tribute and {{went so far as}} to ignore the Sultan's messages, leading to a siege of the city in 1394.

5|$|In 1990, Hershey won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Special for {{her role}} as Candy Morrison in A Killing in a Small Town, which was based on Candy Montgomery's {{acquittal}} for the death of Betty Gore. Montgomery had killed Gore on Friday, June 13, 1980, in Gore's Wylie, Texas, home, by hitting her 41 times with an ax. The jury determined that she did so in self-defense. In preparation for the part, Hershey had a phone conversation with Montgomery. Many of the names of the real-life principals in the case were <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> the movie.

5|$|In Bulgaria, the {{two decades}} {{following}} the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country <b>changed</b> <b>for</b> the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E
