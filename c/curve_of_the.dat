Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP-43b as a planet, revealing its mass in the process. The use of La Silla's TRAPPIST telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet's transit in December 2010.|$|E

CORALIE provided radial velocity measurements that indicated that WASP-43 was being transited by a planet that was 1.8 times Jupiter's mass, now dubbed WASP-43b. Another follow-up using the TRAPPIST telescope further defined the light <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body transiting WASP-43.|$|E

5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle {{was built}} between the River Stour and the Chilton Stream {{and took the}} form of a motte and bailey design, with two baileys rather than the more common one. The motte is 850 feet (259 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) tall, with its flat summit 63 feet (19 m) across. The two baileys, {{stretching}} alongside from the motte along the north and east, were protected by deep ditches and steep palisades, with either a causeway or a drawbridge linking the inner to the outer bailey; the inner bailey was also sheltered by the <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chilton.|$|E

5|$|Southampton's town {{walls are}} a {{sequence}} of defensive structures built around the town in southern England. Although earlier Roman and Anglo-Saxon settlements around Southampton had been fortified with walls or ditches, the later walls originate with the move of the town to the current site in the 10th century. This new town was defended by banks, ditches and the natural <b>curve</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river and coastline. The Normans built a castle in Southampton but made no attempts to improve the wider defences of the town until the early 13th century, when Southampton's growing prosperity as a trading centre and conflict with France encouraged {{the construction of a}} number of gatehouses and stone walls to the north and east sides of the settlement.|$|E
