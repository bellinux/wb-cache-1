50|$|FHA allows {{first time}} homebuyers {{to put down}} as little as 3.5% and receive up to 6% towards closing costs. However, few lenders will allow a seller to {{contribute}} more than 3% toward allowable closing costs. If little or no credit exists for the applicants, the FHA will allow a qualified non-occupant <b>co-borrower</b> to co-sign for the loan without requiring that person to reside in the home with the first time homebuyer. The co-signer {{does not have to}} be a blood relative. This is called a Non-Occupying <b>Co-Borrower.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} the prognostic variables influencing foreclosures for Singapore residential properties {{through the building}} of three probit models â€“ one for all property types, the second for high-rise properties and the third for low-rise properties. A total of four variables {{are found to be}} statistically significant in all three analyses. Equity {{and the size of the}} property are found to have a positive influence on the likelihood of foreclosure. A negative relationship is found with firm as a type of purchaser and the number of <b>co-borrowers</b> with respect to the foreclosure likelihood. In general, it has been found that the foreclosure likelihood does not change significantly with changes in the economic environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{reputation as a}} contract enforcement instrument where legal institutions, especially commercial courts, fail to enforce commercial contracts has focused on informal credit markets. The literature centres on the argument that lenders or <b>co-borrowers</b> in group lending can easily monitor each borrower, given {{the small size of}} an individual lender. s market. Verifiability allows the detection of opportunistic default and hence allows its punishment. This paper argues that in Africa, even formal credit markets rely on reputation. However, the modelling strategy is not based on monitoring and verifiability, given the potential for residual information asymmetry between a bank and a borrower after screening. Instead, the paper conceptualises the relationship between a bank and a borrower as an infinitely repeated game. The bank learns the type of the borrower through repeated interaction, a process by which a borrower builds his reputation as an honest partner. A defaulting dishonest borrower forfeits his access to future loans. The main result of the model is that the higher the reputation of a borrower, the lower his equilibrium payoff that is incentive compatible with debt repayment. Conversely, {{in the absence of any}} reputation, the payoff that is incentive compatible with repayment is equal to infinity meaning that credit trade is impossible without either a credible formal contract enforcement mechanism or some level of reputation. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{granular}} level risk of education loan using {{a cross section}} of data from 5000 borrowers obtained from four major public sector banks in India. The findings suggest that education loan defaults are mainly influenced by security, borrower margin, and repayment periods. The presence of guarantor or <b>co-borrower</b> and collateral significantly reduce default loss rates. The socioeconomic characteristics of borrowers and their regional locations also act as important factors associated with education loan defaults. The results suggest that by segmenting borrowers by probability of default and loss given default in a multidimensional scale, banks can adopt better risk mitigation and pricing strategies to resolve borrower problems...|$|E
