50|$|Due to the ageing infrastructure, normal {{operation}} is made difficult by chronic power shortages and poor state of infrastructure maintenance. Sleepers, tunnels and bridges {{are in a}} critically poor state of repair. Tracks are laid on either wooden or concrete sleepers, using rails of 37, 40, 50, 60 kg/m (75, 81, 101, 121 lb/yd) of domestic, Chinese and Russian manufacture. Riverine gravel and <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>ballast</b> is used. Tunnels are of concrete construction; many are in poor condition, having been built during the colonial era. Communications equipment and the semi-automatic signalisation infrastructure dates to the 1970s, and was imported from China and the Soviet Union. The poor state of the infrastructure severely restricts operational speeds - average train speeds are as low as 20 km/h-60 km/h (in South Korea 60 km/h-100 km/h on non-high speed lines): only on the P'yŏngbu Line are speeds of 100 km/h possible.|$|R
5000|$|Track ballast {{forms the}} {{trackbed}} upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between, below, {{and around the}} ties. It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure. This also serves to hold the track in place as the trains roll by. It is typically made of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> although <b>ballast</b> has sometimes consisted of other, less suitable materials, for example burnt clay. The term [...] "ballast" [...] comes from a nautical term for the stones used to stabilize a ship.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{develops}} a methodology of FE modelling and simulation {{of the bridge}} – track – moving train (BTT) system using LS-DYNA computer code. The KNI 140070 viaduct of span length 14. 40 m with ballasted track was selected as a representative for the study. Two variants of the viaduct were taken into consideration – a version operated before the modernization in 2008 and the modernized version including additional flats welded to the bottom flanges of the main beams. The German high-speed train ICE- 3 moving at 150 – 300 km/h was selected. The FE model of the BTT system was developed using Altair HyperMesh and LS-PrePost software. The platform of the viaduct was modelled using 8 -node 48 DOF solid elements. The structure was symmetrised, homogenized and reflected by linear viscoelastic orthotropic materials. Discrete model of the track included the main and side rails, fastening systems, sleepers, <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>ballast</b> and approach RC slabs. Components of the train FE model were considered as rigid bodies. Cylindrical and revolute constrained joints were applied for kinematic connections and relations between respective components. Discrete springs and dampers were applied for FE modelling of the primary and the secondary suspension systems. Numerical simulations were focused on determining the resonant velocities for both considered variants.

Le Roy, near the Onondaga Escarpment, was a prime location for limestone quarrying, atop a 150 ft layer of the stone. Since shortly after its settlement in the early 19th century, Le Roy had supported several such operations. Most of the limestone had been produced for architectural use, and a number of extant buildings in the Le Roy area, including the Lathrop Chapel at Machpelah Cemetery, are made of locally quarried limestone.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The article {{deals with}} the {{insulation}} resistance of the track circuit {{as one of the}} parameters that affect the operating performance of the railway transport. To reduce the influence of the insulation resistance on the operation modes of the track circuits and the performance indicators of railway transport it is assumed to study the influence of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> treatment on the value of dielectric permeability of the ballast bed. Methodology. The influence of material type for the surface treatment of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> on the value of the dielectric permeability was assessed {{on the basis of the}} physical nature determination of the relative dielectric permeability. Determination of the relative dielectric permeability of granular media can only be indirect, as a consequence of incomplete adjoining of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> grains and uncertainty of the pore volume. Thus, the calculations were performed by comparing the measured capacity for a medium with the known with measured medium capacity, for which it is necessary to define. That is, the more the measured capacity is changed, the more changes the dielectric permeability of the medium. Findings. Sleepers and ballast significantly change their electrical conductivity depending on the presence of moisture, ambient temperature changes, the presence of pollutants and other factors. The article analyzes the existing models to describe the dielectric properties of such systems. It has been established that coating the <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>ballast</b> with organic substances influences the value of its relative dielectric permeability. The greatest effect of reducing this value is observed for the coatings based on rosin mixture and silicone. Originality. Authors proposed original method of dielectric properties increase of the permanent way by grains’ coating with nonwettable substances, on the surface of which is not formed a water film. Practical value. The article shows the possibility of minimizing the negative influence of reducing the isolation with maximum its elimination. It is proposed the solution of actual problem by eliminating the influence of insulation resistance on the modes of track circuits operation, which will eliminate the part of causes of the failure of signaling devices and reduce the number of cases of «false business»...|$|R
5000|$|During 1834-1840, Robinson {{served as}} chief {{engineer}} {{of the new}} Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and directed construction of the line including a spectacular stone bridge and a tunnel 1,932 feet long, considered his crowning achievements. The 93-mile railroad built from the major anthracite coal fields of Pottsville to Reading {{and then to the}} port at Philadelphia was the first double track mainline in the United States (after the British model), included three of the nine first railroad tunnels in the United States, and was reportedly the first to use <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> <b>ballast.</b> (In 1828-9, Robinson had designed his first railroads—the Allegheny Portage and the Danville & Pottsville railroads—as double track lines, but these included inclines that worked better with two tracks; the Reading was the first main line designed at the outset with double tracks in mind, though with only a 22' wide grade that required widening later). Because of the extensive coal fields it tapped, the Reading would {{become one of the most}} profitable railroads in the U. S. It was also considered Moncure Robinson’s first mountain railroad without inclines—a statement about the transition from the Canal Era of feeder coal roads to water transport/canals. The Reading paralleled the Schuylkill River navigation canal, and by the 1840s proved the superiority of the railroad over the turnpikes and canals as the inland transportation system of the nineteenth century.Horses and mules, gravity and stationary steam engines on inclines, were the first motive power on Moncure Robinson’s railroads. Though he held patents on incline systems, from the beginning, he recommended British built locomotives for railroads, especially the recently perfected 0-4-0s with Bury fire box. By the mid-1830s, American mechanics had perfected the 4-2-0, with its lead swivel truck or pilot wheels - designed by John B Jervis for the Mohawk & Hudson - and Robinson recommended these for steeper grade railroads during the late 1830s, in Virginia and Pennsylvania. For the Reading, he ordered British and American made locomotives. For more power, however, he is credited with helping design in 1839 one of the earliest 4-4-0 locomotives, the [...] "Gowan & Marx," [...] named after his London banker. This, the most powerful locomotive up to that time, was built by Eastwick & Harrison of Philadelphia, and proved ideal for the coal fields tapped by the Reading (John White, American Locomotives, correctly credits others for the 4-4-0 design patent; and this is true for the mechanics of the machine, but the concept of replacing the then dominant 4-2-0s with the better tractive 4-4-0s, which would become the major locomotive type for the next thirty years or more, has been shared with Robinson).|$|R

40|$|Using {{sea sand}} and <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> is the {{distinctive}} feature of concrete in Okinawa Prefecture. The characteristics of such concrete has already published in many papers by the auther and others. There {{are two kinds}} of <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> used in Okinawa Island. One is hard and called "Motobu" <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> and has large density and small specific water content. So the static and dynamic Young's maduli of the concrete which uses Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> are much larger than ones which described in the specifications of AIJ and JSCE in the practical range of compressive strength between 150 and 400 kg/cm². The other is relatively soft and called Ryukyu lime <b>stone</b> <b>crushed</b> <b>stone.</b> The concrete using the relatively soft <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> has smaller Young's moduli than the concrete with Motobu <b>crushed</b> <b>stone,</b> but still lightly larger than specified values in the AIJ specification. There are many factors which affect the values of the Young's maduli of concrete. In this study, compressive strength and unit weight of concrete are the most affecting factors. Formulae for both static and dynamic Young's moduli are presented by using the method of the least square. The formulae are described in terms of compressive strength and unit weight of concrete. The increasing pattern of compressing strength of the concrete using hard <b>crushed</b> <b>stone</b> as the time passes is almost the same as described in common technical books. The rate of increase of Young's moduli as the time passes is much slower than ones of compressive strength.
