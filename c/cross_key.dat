60|$|This brings {{these two}} men to a further remembrance. The name of one was John Hayward, who {{was at that time}} undersexton of the parish of St Stephen, Coleman Street. By undersexton was {{understood}} at that time gravedigger and bearer of the dead. This man carried, or assisted to carry, all the dead to their graves which were buried in that large parish, and who were carried in form; and after that form of burying was stopped, went with the dead-cart and the bell to fetch the dead bodies from the houses where they lay, and fetched many of them out of the chambers and houses; for the parish was, and is still, remarkable particularly, above all the parishes in London, for a great number of alleys and thoroughfares, very long, into which no carts could come, and where they were obliged to go and fetch the bodies a very long way; which alleys now remain to witness it, such as White's Alley, <b>Cross</b> <b>Key</b> Court, Swan Alley, Bell Alley, White Horse Alley, and many more. Here they went with a kind of hand-barrow and laid the dead bodies on it, and carried them out to the carts; which work he performed and never had the distemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it, and was sexton of the parish to the time of his death. His wife at the same time was a nurse to infected people, and tended many that died in the parish, being for her honesty recommended by the parish officers; yet she never was infected neither.|$|E

50|$|US 1 {{runs through}} Marathon as a four-laned road. After Key Vaca, the road becomes two-laned {{once more and}} runs through Fat Deer Key, where it forms the {{northern}} boundary {{of the city of}} Key Colony Beach. It then continues wholly in Marathon through Long Point Key, Crawl Key and Grassy Key. The road then crosses to Little Conch Key and then Conch Key, both part of the Duck Key district. US 1 then crosses to and traverses Long Key, which is mostly unincorporated except for the city of Layton, which the highway passes through. The road then reaches Craig Key, and then the village of Islamorada including Lower Matecumbe Key, Tea Table Key, Upper Matecumbe Key and Windley Key. US 1 crosses a drawbridge onto Plantation Key, where it expands to four lanes and then leaves Islamorada as it crosses to Key Largo. Immediately the Overseas Highway enters Tavernier, where it temporarily splits into a pair of one-way roads through the community. Soon the road enters the community of Key Largo, which also features another pair of one-way roads. At the northern end of the Key Largo district, about two-thirds of the way along the island, US 1 intersects County Road 905, which offers an alternative route out of the Keys via North Key Largo and the Card Sound Bridge. Signage approaching the intersection directs northbound motorists to take this alternative route if the lights on it are flashing. US 1 swings to the northwest, forms the southern boundary of North Key Largo, and becomes a two-laned divided road after the intersection. After crossing the Jewfish Creek Bridge (where it enters unincorporated Monroe County again) and travelling along <b>Cross</b> <b>Key,</b> US 1 crosses Manatee Creek, along with the Miami-Dade County boundary, and reaches the mainland.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{performed}} {{quantitative trait}} locus (QTL) mapping analysis for litter size (total number of pups born and/or number of pups born alive) in 255 backcross mice derived from C 57 BL/ 6 J and RR/Sgn inbred mice. We identified one significant QTL on chromosome 7 and 4 suggestive QTLs on chromosomes 3, 5, 10 and 13. In addition, two suggestive QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1 and 4 {{for the number of}} stillbirth. These results suggested that both litter size and number of stillbirth were heritable traits, although they were controlled by distinct genes. The RR allele was associated with reduced litter size and increased stillbirth at all QTLs. Therefore, RR mothers were observed to have reduced prolificacy in this particular genetic <b>cross.</b> <b>KEY</b> WORDS: litter size, {{quantitative trait locus}} (QTL), RR/Sgn mouse, stillbirth doi: 10. 1292 /jvms. 14 - 0350; J.

The percent disease incidence and coefficient of {{infection in the}} genotypes was highest in early autumn (planting in last week of August) followed by spring-summer (planting in first week of February) and autumn-winter (planting in second week of October) seasons suggesting significant influence of environment on symptom expression apart from white fly population. The three moderately resistant lines emerged from the study viz., ‘H- 24 ’, ‘Agata ’ and ‘EC- 321425 ’ showing very low coefficient of infection (2 - 6), were crossed with 5 highly susceptible testers with very high coefficient of infection (above 21), namely ‘Punjab Chhuhara’, ‘Pusa Ruby’, ‘Ratan’, ‘Hisar Arun ’ and ‘Patharkutchi ’ in line x tester mating design. The hybrids recorded a range of intermediate disease reaction and it varied widely in 2 seasons suggesting polygenic nature of disease resistance.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Blood Drive which takes place during the spring Greek Week event at Western Kentucky University. I {{primarily}} investigate the varying methods of negotiating issues of altruism and egoism {{in terms of the}} Blood Drive as well as way that the Blood Drive fits into the WKU Greek yearly cycle. I focus on issues of the process of identity in social Greek-letter organizations and how the process of this identity is renegotiated during the Blood Drive and other Greek events. I interviewed people from several groups for this paper. Initially, I interviewed Blood Donor Recruitment Representatives from the American Red Cross, WKU students associated with the social Greek-letter system and the Blood Drive of Greek Week, and employees of WKU associated with the social Greek-letter system and the Blood Drive of Greek Week. At the event itself I widened my scope to include information provided by Mobile Unit Assistants (MUAs) and other employees of the American Red <b>Cross.</b> <b>Key</b> conclusions of this paper include that while people may all participate or be involved in the same event, their methods of understanding concepts of altruism and egoism vary with their kinds of association. In turn, their conceptualizations mirror those developed by social scientists in the last two hundred years. Also, the issues of separation and integration, processes to do with identity, are central to the events of the Greek calendar year and the Blood Drive event in particular...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} public debate {{as to whether}} people {{should be allowed to}} use cell phones while driving. In several countries, this debate has led to restrictions on cell phone use while driving. Japanese data suggests that answering a call might be the most dangerous task, followed by dialing. Several questions were therefore selected for further investigation. 1. How does the dialing device and its location affect task time, errors, driving performance, and ratings of workload? 2. How does the location of the display (especially head-up displays) affect those same measures? 3. For various control-display combinations, how are those measures affected by driving workload? The experiment will be comprised of two distinct portions. In the first portion, subjects will drive a simulator on straight roads (implying controlled workload) while dialing a 10 -digit telephone number using 6 device configurations with various displays. During the second test portion, participants will drive a simulator on roads with curves of different radii while entering phone numbers for 3 different device combinations. The following device/location configurations will be examined: (1) 10 -key keypad on the steering wheel spoke, (2) 10 -key keypad on the center console, (3) joystick on the steering wheel spoke, (4) joystick mounted on the center console, (5) hand held 10 - key keypad, (6) a <b>cross</b> <b>key</b> on the touch screen, and (7) a 10 key keypad on the touch screen.

40|$|Background and Aims Sporophytic {{self-incompatibility}} (SI) prevents inbreeding in {{many members}} of the Brassicaceae, and has been well documented in a variety of high-profile species. Arabis alpina is currently being developed as a model system for studying the ecological genetics of arcticalpine environments, and is the focus of numerous studies on population structure and alpine phylogeography. Although it is highly inbreeding throughout most of its range, populations in central Italy have been identified that show inbreeding coefficients (FIS) more typical of self-incompatible relatives. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish whether this variation is due to a functioning SI system. Methods Outcrossing rate estimates were calculated based on 16 allozyme loci and self-compatibility assessed based on controlled pollinations for six Italian populations that have previously been shown to vary in FIS values. Putative SRK alleles (the gene controlling the female component of SI in other Brassicaceae) amplified from A. alpina were compared with those published for other species. Linkage of putative SRK alleles and SI phenotypes was assessed using a diallel <b>cross.</b> <b>Key</b> Results Functional avoidance of inbreeding is demonstrated in three populations of A. alpina, corresponding with previous FIS values. The presence is described of 15 putative SRK-like alleles, which show high sequence identity to known alleles from Brassica and Arabidopsis and the high levels of synonymous and nonsynonymous variation typical of genes under balancing selection. Also, orthologues of two other members of the S-receptor kinase gene family, Aly 8 (ARK 3) and Aly 9 (AtS 1) are identified. Further to this, co-segregation between some of the putative S-alleles and compatibility phenotypes was demonstrated using a full-sibling cross design. Conclusions The results strongly suggest that, as with other species in the Brassicaceae, A. alpina has a sporophytic SI system but shows variation in the strength of SI within and between population...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to recent studies exploring the longue durée of human impacts on island landscapes, {{the impacts of}} climate and other environmental changes on human communities, and the interaction of human societies and their environments at different spatial and temporal scales. In particular, the paper addresses Iceland during the medieval period (with a secondary, comparative focus on Norse Greenland) and discusses episodes where environmental and climatic changes have appeared to <b>cross</b> <b>key</b> thresholds for agricultural productivity. The paper draws upon international, interdisciplinary research in the North Atlantic region led by the North Atlantic Biocultural Organization (NABO) and the Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES) in the Circumpolar Networks program of the Integrated History and Future of People on Earth (IHOPE). By interlinking analyses of historically grounded literature with archaeological studies and environmental science, valuable new perspectives can emerge on how these past societies may have understood and coped with such impacts. As climate and other environmental changes do not operate in isolation, vulnerabilities created by socioeconomic factors also beg consideration. The paper illustrates the benefits of an integrated environmental-studies approach that draws on data, methodologies and analytical tools of environmental humanities, social sciences, and geosciences to better understand long-term human ecodynamics and changing human-landscape-environment interactions through time. One key goal is to apply previously unused data and concerted expertise to illuminate human responses to past changes; a secondary aim is to consider how lessons derived from these cases may be applicable to environmental threats and socioecological risks in the future, especially as understood {{in light of the}} New Human Condition, the concept transposed from Hannah Arendt's influential framing of the human condition that is foregrounded in the present special issue. This conception admits human agency's role in altering the conditions for life on earth, in large measure negatively, while acknowledging the potential of this self-same agency, if effectively harnessed and properly directed, to sustain essential planetary conditions through a salutary transformation of human perception, understanding and remedial action. The paper concludes that more long-term historical analyses of cultures and environments need to be undertaken at various scales. Past cases do not offer perfect analogues for the future, but they can contribute {{to a better understanding of}} how resilience and vulnerability occur, as well as how they may be compromised or mitigated...|$|E
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that the 21 st century will constitute a radically new era in human history, one that will be defined by our collective response to three inescapable and interconnected problems that are already combining to create a perfect storm: The Population Explosion: The global population now stands at 6. 7 billion people. By 2050 {{it is estimated that}} there will be more than 9 billion. Peak Oil and Natural Gas: There is a growing concensus among petroleum geologists and that we are presently on the “bumpy plateau” of peak oil and that the era of easily accessible, cheap oil (and other fossil fuels) is now forever behind us. With almost unimaginable consequences, it is estimated that by 2030 the world will have approximately 25 % less oil than is currently available and 50 % less by the year 2050. Climate Destabilization, Mass Extinctions and Ecosystem Collapse: As a direct result of population pressures and human activity we are already living in an era scientists call the Sixth Great Extinction. Without rapid and dramatic action to limit the production of greenhouse gases it is virtually certain that we will <b>cross</b> <b>key</b> climate change tipping points, leading to a world that is seriously inhospitable to all life as we know it. In order to respond effectively to these pressing problems it will be necessary for us to literally remake the human footprint on the earth, town by town and community by community. Our goal must be to create a sustainable pattern of human settlements comprised of compact, socially diverse, pedestrian-scaled and livable eco-communities that integrate renewable energy production, urban design, transportation planning, climatically adapted architecture, organic agriculture and ecologically based land use planning. The design of such resilient human ecologies, which would have to be carefully and gracefully integrated within the naturally occurring ecosystems of which they are a part, constitutes both the means and the ends of the great transformation that lies ahead. The land grant university is uniquely suited, in terms of its history, purpose and founding vision, to provide the societal guidance necessary {{in order to make the}} transition to a sustainable society worth sustaining. In order to demonstrate how Kansas State University can become a leader in the movement to create a sustainable pattern of human settlements, this presentation provides an overview of a graduate architectural design studio aimed at creating a resilient and sustainable Manhattan by the year 2050. During the fall semester of 2010 students developed a phased master plan for Manhattan and the surrounding area that is built around a multi-modal transportation system comprised of bikeways, walking paths, streetcars and roads for electric buses and autos. Within this framework students in the second semester will design specific areas of the city that are most critical in meeting the sustainability goals of the class. This presentation will provide a brief overview of these projects, which are presented in more detail by the students themselves in posters prepared for this conference. 1) Sustainable Manhattan 2050 : Master Plan based on a Multi-Modal Transportation System 2) Flint Hills Place: A Green Downtown Urban District 3) Fort Riley Boulevard: The Transition to an Urbane Mixed-Use Streetcar Avenue 4) Poyntz Avenue Housing: Adaptive re-use of Existing Historical Architecture 5) Near Net Zero Energy Backhouses, Granny Flats and Garage Apartments: A Strategy for Increasing Density and Sustainability in the Older Neighborhoods 6) The North End Mixed-Use Eco-community: A Case Study in Sprawl Repair and Integrated Community Development 7) Kimball Avenue Eco-village: Agricultural Urbanism as a Context for Organic and Sustainable Agriculture As Buckminister Fuller once said, “The best way to predict the future is to design it. ” The design of resilient cities, such as the sustainable Manhattan envisioned by our studio for the year 2050, constitutes both the means and the ends of the great transformation that lies ahead. The purpose of sharing our design and planning studies of what Manhattan might look like in the coming age of Peak Oil and Climate Destabilization is to begin a dialogue about the role of Kansas State University in helping to make the transition to a resilient and sustainable society...|$|E
