5|$|The {{anticoagulant}} rivaroxaban (Xarelto) bears {{a striking}} structural similarity to linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra ketone and chlorothiophene, and missing the fluorine atom).

5|$|Linezolid is in U.S. {{pregnancy}} category C, meaning {{there have}} been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into breast milk, although the <b>clinical</b> <b>significance</b> of this (if any) is unknown.|$|E

5|$|A circovirus—given {{the name}} raven circovirus or RaCV—was {{isolated}} from an Australian raven suffering from feather lesions in 2006.

5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the <b>clinical</b> <b>significance</b> of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the <b>clinical</b> <b>significance</b> of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. It is expected that additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E

5|$|The {{proteasome}} and its subunits are of <b>clinical</b> <b>significance</b> for {{at least}} two reasons: (1) a compromised complex assembly or a dysfunctional proteasome can be associated with the underlying pathophysiology of specific diseases, and (2) they can be exploited as drug targets for therapeutic interventions. More recently, more effort has been made to consider the proteasome for the development of novel diagnostic markers and strategies. An improved and comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of the proteasome should lead to clinical applications in the future.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a common}} condition (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the <b>clinical</b> <b>significance</b> of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E

40|$|Objectives Liver {{transplantation}} (LT) is {{a well-established}} option of cure for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with 5 -year survival rates that exceed 70 % in Hong Kong. One {{of the challenges}} in LT remains to be the high tumor recurrence rate. In the proposed study, we aim to investigate the <b>clinical</b> <b>significances</b> of M 2 macrophages in tumor recurrence and the underlying mechanisms after liver transplantation in HCC. Hypothesis to be tested We hypothesize that the ischemia reperfusion injury during transplantation induces the activation of M 2 macrophages and subsequently leading to increased tumor recurrence rate and poor survival outcome in HCC patients. Designs and subjects 80 Clinical liver specimens will be collected from HCC patients who underwent either deceased donor (DDLT) or living donor (LDLT) liver transplantation will be collected. A rat liver tumor transplantation model and toll-like receptor 4 knockout mice will be applied to study the M 2 macropahges activation and tumor promoting functions in transplantation. Main outcome measures and Data analysis Quantification of M 2 macrophages in DDLT and LDLT clinical sample {{as well as the}} rat transplant model using quantitative PCR and immunostaining will be performed. The results will be correlated with survival outcomes and tumor recurrence in patients. Expected results The findings provide experimental evidences proving the <b>clinical</b> <b>significances</b> of M 2 macrophages in promoting tumor recurrence after liver transplantation. Further in vivo and in vitro studies support the essential roles of TLR 4 in M 2 activation and protumor activities...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{a systemic}} inflammatory autoimmune disease, characterized by chronic, erosive polyarthritis {{and by the}} presence of various autoantibodies in serum and synovial fluid. Since rheumatoid factor (RF) was first described, a number of other autoantibodies have been discovered in RA patients. The autoantigens recognized by these autoantibodies include cartilage components, chaperones, enzymes, nuclear proteins and citrullinated proteins. However, the <b>clinical</b> <b>significances</b> and pathogenic roles of these antibodies are largely unknown except for RF and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), whose clinical usefulness has been acknowledged due to their acceptable sensitivities and specificities, and prognostic values.

40|$|Obturator artery is {{frequently}} {{a branch of}} anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It has drawn attention of pelvic surgeons, anatomists and radiologists {{because of the high}} frequency of variations in its course and origin.

During routine dissection classes to undergraduate medical students we have observed obturator artery arising from external iliac artery, obturator vein draining into external iliac vein, communicating vein between obturator vein and external iliac vein and inferior epigastric artery arising from the obturator artery.

40|$|Diabetes is a {{systematic}} metabolic disease, which often develops {{a number of}} well-recognized vascular complications including brain complications which may partly result from the dysfunction of blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB is generally considered as a mechanism for protecting the brain from unwanted actions resulting from substances in the blood and maintaining brain homeostasis via monitoring the entry or efflux of compounds. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of transporters including P-glycoprotein (P-GP) and breast cancer-related protein (BCRP), widely expressed in the luminal membrane of the microvessel endothelium and in the apical membrane of the choroids plexus epithelium, play important roles in the function of BBB.

40|$|The {{accumulated}} {{evidence has}} {{pointed to a}} key role of telomerase in carcinogenesis. As a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, telomerase synthesizes telomeric DNA {{at the end of}} linear chromosomes, and attenuates or prevents telomere erosion associated with cell divisions. By lengthening telomeres, telomerase extends cellular life-span or even induces immortalization. Consistent with its functional activity, telomerase is silent in most human normal somatic cells while active only in germ-line, stem and other highly proliferative cells. In contrast, telomerase activation widely occurs in human cancer and the enzymatic activity is detectable in up to 90 % of malignancies. Recently, hotspot point mutations in the regulatory region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, encoding the core catalytic component of telomerase, was identified as a novel mechanism to activate telomerase in cancer.
