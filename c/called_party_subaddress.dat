5000|$|Long-distance {{calls are}} charged to the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> if the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> declines a collect call.|$|R
50|$|In a {{collect call}} (i.e. reverse charge), the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> pays the {{fee for the}} call, when {{it is usually the}} <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> that does so. The <b>called</b> <b>party</b> also pays if the number dialed is a {{toll-free}} telephone number.|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} call {{is a connection}} over a telephone network between the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> and the <b>calling</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For example, the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> may {{indicate}} {{to the telephone}} exchange that the call is being disconnected by the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> by allowing loop current to flow in the line, or the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> indicates to the exchange that the call is being answered.|$|R
50|$|If the caller's {{wireline}} {{phone is}} connected {{directly to the}} <b>calling</b> <b>party,</b> when the caller takes their telephone off-hook, the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> phone will ring. This is called a hot line or ringdown. Otherwise, the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> is usually given a tone to indicate they should begin dialing the desired number. In some (now very rare) cases, if the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> cannot dial <b>calls</b> directly, they will be connected to an operator who places the call for them.|$|R
50|$|Line {{signaling}} is a {{class of}} telecommunications signaling protocols. Line signaling is responsible for off-hook, ringing signal, answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> to <b>called</b> <b>party</b> and vice versa. After an off-hook, line signaling initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of <b>called</b> <b>party</b> and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> as well. While register signaling occurs, line signaling remains quiescent unless the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R
5000|$|A custom {{ringback}} tone ("calling", [...] ), usually 5 yuan per month, {{is an additional}} service. It is when the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> can send a {{ringback tone}} to the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> music (or any kind of sound) that the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> likes. Usually detested by foreigners, but loved by the Chinese young.|$|R
50|$|If {{the desired}} <b>called</b> <b>party</b> {{is not the}} person who picked up the call, and the desired <b>called</b> <b>party</b> is at an unknown location, the person who picked up the call may park the call and then use the public address system to page the desired <b>called</b> <b>party</b> {{to pick up the}} call.|$|R
50|$|In telecommunication, a {{recorder}} {{warning tone}} is a tone transmitted over a telephone line to indicate to the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> that the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> is recording the conversation.|$|R
50|$|A <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> {{wishing to}} speak to another party {{will pick up the}} telephone's handset, thereby {{operating}} a lever which closes the switchhook (A4), which powers the telephone by connecting the transmitter (microphone), receiver (speaker), and related audio components to the line. The off-hook circuitry has a low resistance (less than 300 ohms) which causes a direct current (DC), which comes down the line (C) from the telephone exchange. The exchange detects this current, attaches a digit receiver circuit to the line, and sends a dial tone to indicate readiness. On a modern push-button telephone, the caller then presses the number keys to send the telephone number of the <b>called</b> <b>party.</b> The keys control a tone generator circuit (not shown) that makes DTMF tones that the exchange receives. A rotary-dial telephone uses pulse dialing, sending electrical pulses, that the exchange can count to get the telephone number (as of 2010 many exchanges were still equipped to handle pulse dialing). If the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> line is available, the exchange sends an intermittent ringing signal (about 75 volts alternating current (AC) in North America and UK and 60 volts in Germany) to alert the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> to an incoming call. If the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> line is in use, the exchange returns a busy signal to the <b>calling</b> <b>party.</b> However, if the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> line is in use but has call waiting installed, the exchange sends an intermittent audible tone to the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> to indicate an incoming call.|$|R
5000|$|Therefore, if a <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> {{being at}} the PSTN network dials a <b>called</b> <b>party</b> ENUM number by touch typing the E.164 <b>called</b> <b>party</b> number, the number will be {{translated}} at the ENUM gateway into the corresponding URI. This URI {{will be used for}} looking-up and fetching the NAPTR record obtaining the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (either on IP or on PSTN terminations) - the so-called access information - which the registrant (the <b>called</b> <b>party)</b> has specified by writing his/her choice at the NAPTR record ("Naming Authority Pointer Resource Records" [...] as defined in RFC 3403), such as e-mail addresses, a fax number, a personal website, a VoIP number, mobile telephone numbers, voice mail systems, IP-telephony addresses, web pages, GPS coordinates, call diversions or instant messaging. Alternatively, when the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> is at the IP side, the User Agent (UA) piece of software of the dialler will allow to dial a E.164 number, but the dialler UA will convert it into a URI, to be used for looking-up at the ENUM gateway DNS and fetch the NAPTR record obtaining the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> wishes about how the call should be forwarded or terminated (again, either on IP or on PSTN terminations).|$|R
5000|$|When a long {{distance}} call is made to a <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> wireline telephone, that party’s wireline local exchange carrier can charge the <b>calling</b> <b>party’s</b> {{long distance}} carrier an above-cost access charge for terminating the call; but if an identical long distance call were made to ths same <b>called</b> <b>party,</b> from and to the same physical location, but to the <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> wireless telephone, the <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> wireless carrier {{is not allowed to}} charge the <b>calling</b> <b>party’s</b> long distance carrier any access charge for terminating the call. Indeed, the average intercarrier compensation rate ranges from 0.1 cents per minute for traffic bound to an information service provider (“ISP”) to 5.1 cents per minute for intrastate traffic bound to a subscriber of a small (rural) incumbent local exchange carrier; individual rates can be as low as zero and as high as 35.9 cents per minute — even though in each case basically the same transport and switching functions are provided.

50|$|Other uses {{might include}} placing the caller in queue {{to connect to}} the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> when the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> line goes on-hook. Increasingly, the {{attendant}} function of a phone system is handled by an auto-attendant.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>called</b> <b>party</b> (in some {{contexts}} {{called the}} [...] "B-Number") {{is a person}} who (or device that) answers a telephone call. The person who (or device that) initiates a telephone call is the <b>calling</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{telephone}} call may carry ordinary voice transmission using a telephone, data transmission when the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> and <b>called</b> <b>party</b> are using modems, or facsimile transmission {{when they are}} using fax machines. The call may use land line, mobile phone, satellite phone or any combination thereof. When a {{telephone call}} {{has more than one}} <b>called</b> <b>party</b> it is referred to as a conference call. When two or more users of the network are sharing the same physical line, it is <b>called</b> a <b>party</b> line or Rural phone line.|$|R

5000|$|The service {{provider}} may {{also offer a}} facility by which the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> can prevent their number being revealed to the <b>called</b> <b>party,</b> either permanently or on a per-call basis. This is achieved by prefixing the dialed number with: ...|$|R
50|$|The QoS {{negotiation}} {{is supported}} by the PRACK request, that starts resource reservation in the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> network, and it is answered by a 2XX response code. Once this response has been sent, the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> has selected the codec too, and starts resource reservation on its side. Subsequent UPDATE requests are sent to inform about the reservation progress, and they are answered by 2XX response codes. In a typical offer/answer exchange, one UPDATE will be sent by the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> when its reservation is completed, then the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> will respond and eventually finish allocating the resources. It is then, when all the resources for the call are in place, when the caller is alerted.|$|R
5000|$|Systems {{that provide}} <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> camp-on [...] the system {{facilities}} until the necessary facilities become available, and then proceed {{to complete the}} requested access. Such systems {{may or may not}} issue a system blocking signal to inform the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> of the access delay.|$|R
50|$|Busy {{override}} is {{a function}} of the private branch exchange that allows the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> to override the busy signal on the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> in order to break into the ongoing conversation. Before breaking in most PBX announce the incoming call by a distinctive sound signal or tone, but in most cases this can be disabled by software. The Busy override function was originally intended to allow the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> to receive a high priority, implying that the call is very important, and should be handled first.|$|R
50|$|Call origination, {{also known}} as voice origination, refers to the {{collecting}} of the calls initiated by a <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> on a telephone exchange of the PSTN, and handing off the calls to a VoIP endpoint or to another exchange or telephone company for completion to a <b>called</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|Intercarrier compensation. Under these conditions, {{many calls}} will arise between parties on {{different}} networks. While {{it might be}} possible to have the <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> pay its carrier and the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> pay its carrier, for various reasons it has been traditional in the United States for the <b>calling</b> <b>party’s</b> carrier to pay the <b>called</b> <b>party’s</b> carrier for completing the call — this is called intercarrier compensation—and, in turn, recover those costs in the rates charged to its subscribers. The 1996 Act requires that intercarrier compensation rates among competing local exchange carriers (CLECs) be based on the “additional costs of terminating such calls”. However, the framework created by the 1996 Act set different intercarrier compensation rates for services that were not competing at that time but do compete today.|$|R
40|$|In {{competitive}} telecommunications markets each carrier {{relies on}} competing networks to terminate internetwork calls. Regulators typically require the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network {{to pay a}} termination fee to the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> network equal to the terminating network's "incremental cost" of completing the call, effectively imposing all of the costs on the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network. These payments can affect retail prices and therefore consumption. I show that when both parties benefit from a call, they should bear its costs {{in proportion to the}} benefit they receive. Therefore, imposing all of the costs of an internetwork call on the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> network can be inefficient if these costs are reflected in the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> usage rates. A system in which two networks exchange traffic at specified points on a bill-and-keep basis imposes some of the cost on each network, which will then be imposed on the parties. This can generate more efficient network utilization, even with unbalanced traffic between networks. Thus, regulators may improve the efficiency of telecommunications markets by establishing bill-and-keep intercarrier compensation rules.

50|$|The {{implementation}} of this feature is vendor-specific. In some cases, the ringer just does not ring and the <b>called</b> <b>party</b> is thus not alerted.

50|$|In general, CID as {{transmitted}} from {{the origin of}} the call is only the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> full phone number (including area code, and including international access code and country code if it's an international <b>call).</b> The <b>calling</b> <b>party</b> name is added by the consumer's terminating central office if the consumer has subscribed to that service. Calling name delivery is not automatic. A SS7 (or Signalling System 7) TCAP query may be launched by the <b>called</b> <b>party's</b> central office, in order to retrieve the information for Calling Name delivery to the caller ID equipment at the consumer's location, if the caller's name has not already been associated with the <b>calling</b> <b>party's</b> line at the originating central office.
