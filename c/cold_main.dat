40|$|Jets {{in cross}} flow are of {{fundamental}} industrial importance and {{play an important}} role in validating turbulence models. Two jet configurations related to thermal fatigue phenomena are investigated: • T-junction of circular tubes where a heated jet discharges into a <b>cold</b> <b>main</b> flow and • Rectangular jet marked by a scalar discharging into a main flow in a rectangular channel. The T-junction configuration is a classical test case for thermal fatigue phenomena. The Vattenfall T-junction experiment was already subject of an OECD/NEA benchmark. A LES modelling and calculation strategy is developed and validated on this data. The rectangular-jet configuration is important for basic physical understanding and modelling and has been analyzed experimentally at CEA. The experimental work was focused on turbulent mixing between a slightly heated rectangular jet which is injected perpendicularly into the <b>cold</b> <b>main</b> flow of a rectangular channel. These experiments are analyzed for the first time with LES. The overall results show a good agreement between the experimental data and the CFD calculation. Mean values of velocity and temperature are well captured by both RANS calculation and LES. The range of critical frequencies and their amplitudes, however, are only captured by LES...|$|E

40|$|We present new optical {{broadband}} colors, {{obtained with}} the Keck 1 and Vatican Advanced Technology telescopes, for six {{objects in the}} inner classical Kuiper Belt. Objects in the inner classical Kuiper Belt are of interest as they may represent the surviving members of the primordial Kuiper Belt that formed interior to the current position of the 3 : 2 resonance with Neptune, the current position of the plutinos, or, alternatively, they may be objects formed at a different heliocentric distance that were then moved to their present locations. The six new colors, combined with four previously published, show that the 10 inner belt objects with known colors form a neutral clump and a reddish clump in B-R color. Nonparametric statistical tests show {{no significant difference between}} the B-R color distribution of the inner disk objects compared to the color distributions of Centaurs, plutinos, or scattered disk objects. However, the B-R color distribution of the inner classical Kuiper belt objects does differ significantly from the distribution of colors in the cold (low inclination) main classical Kuiper belt. The <b>cold</b> <b>main</b> classical objects are predominately red, while the inner classical belt objects are a mixture of neutral and red. The color difference may reveal the existence of a gradient in the composition and /or surface processing history in the primordial Kuiper Belt, or indicate that the inner disk objects are not dynamically analogous to the <b>cold</b> <b>main</b> classical belt objects.

40|$|We report {{here the}} {{discovery}} of an new near-equal mass Trans-Neptunian Binaries (TNBs) L 5 c 02 and the and the putative detection of a second TNB (L 4 k 12) among the year two and three detections of the Canada-France-Eclipic Plane Survey (CFEPS). These new binaries (internal designation L 4 k 12 and L 5 c 02) have moderate separations of 0. 4 " and 0. 6 " respectively. The follow-up observation confirmed the binarity of L 5 c 02, but L 4 k 12 are still lack of more followup observations. L 4 k 12 has a heliocentric orbital inclination of ~ 35 ?degree, marking this system as having the highest heliocentric orbital inclination among known near-equal mass binaries. Both systems {{are members of the}} classical main Kuiper belt population. Based on the sample of objects searched we determine that the fraction of near-equal mass wide binaries with separations > 0. 4 " is 1. 5 % to 20 % in the <b>cold</b> <b>main</b> classical Kuiper belt and, if our detection the binarity L 4 k 12 holds, 3 % to 43 % in the hot main classical objects are binary.

40|$|This {{work has}} been carried out at the "Laboratoire de Modélisation et Simulation en mécanique des Fluides" of CEA during a stage of 6 months. The main subject of this work {{involves}} jets in cross ﬂow, which are of fundamental industrial importance and {{play an important role in}} the validation of turbulence models. Two jet conﬁgurations are investigated with the TrioCFD code: • a tee junction of circular tubes where a hot jet discharges into a <b>cold</b> <b>main</b> ﬂow. • a rectangular channel discharging a jet marked by a scalar into a main channel ﬂow. The tee-junction conﬁguration is very important for the phenomena of thermal fatigue. The OECD/NEA benchmark on the Vattenfall tee junction ﬂow is analyzed. This test case is selected because, beside the experimental results, various calculations with several turbulence modeling approaches have been published. A Large Eddie Simulation (LES) modeling and calculation strategy is developed and validated on these data for jets in crossﬂow under thermal fatigue conditions. The rectangular jet conﬁguration is important for basic physical understanding and modeling and has been analysed experimentally at CEA by previous studies. Such work was focused on the turbulent mixing between a rectangular channel ﬂow with grid turbulence exiting a heated jet into a conﬁned grid turbulent crossﬂow, with both kinematic and passive scalar high quality measurements in order to characterize its statistical properties (energy spectra, Reynolds stresses anisotropy and PdF). These experiments are analyzed for the ﬁrst time with LES by applying the strategy developed for the ﬁrst conﬁguration. The turbulent inlet boundary conditions are well controlled in both experiment and calculation (grid turbulence). Structured and unstructured grids are used to predict the measured mean values and turbulent ﬂuctuations (velocity and scalars) as well as the Reynolds stresses. The activities aimed also to test the capabilities of the TrioCFD code results through the inspection of their agreement with the experimental datas obtained for T-junctions mixing ducts for a preliminary analysis of TrioCFD performances and to get a balanced compliance of the code’s capabilities...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a 'hot' population of hydrogen atoms in the Venus exosphere is well known. In the outer coronal region where it is dominant, r greater than about 2. 0 R(V) (Venus radii), hydrogen atoms are also subject to a relatively strong radiation pressure exerted by resonant scattering of solar Lyman-alpha photons. Collisionless models illustrating the consequent structure are discussed, with the nonthermal population mimicked by a dual Maxwellian exobase kinetic distribution. In these models, a considerable fraction of the 'hot' atoms outside 2. 0 R(V) belongs to the quasi-satellite component, this fraction exceeding 1 / 2 for r values between about 4. 0 and 10. 0 R(V). Solar ionization of bound atoms occurs mainly outside the ionopause, yielding a partial escape flux greater than about 2, 000, 000 /sq cm per sec over the dayside exobase for assumed solar conditions. The inclusion of a cold exobase prescribed by Pioneer Venus observations has little influence on the outer region (in particular, the quasi-satellite component is unaltered) except that the transition to 'hot' kinetic character occurs closer to the exobase on the nightside due to the <b>colder</b> <b>main</b> exobase temperatures there...|$|R

In the outer coronal region where it is dominant (r [gsim] 2. 0 RV), hydrogen atoms are also subject to a relatively strong radiation pressure exerted by resonant scattering of solar Lyman-[alpha] photons. Collisionless models illustrating the consequent structure are discussed, with the nonthermal population mimicked by a dual Maxwellian exobase kinetic distribution.

To implement PNA in the main stream, better knowledge about microbial communities at the typical environmental conditions is necessary. In order to investigate the response of PNA microbial communities to decreasing substrate availability, we have operated a {{moving bed biofilm reactor}} (MBBR) at decreasing reactor concentrations (311 – 27 mg-N l− 1 of ammonium) and low temperature (13 °C) for 302 days and investigated the biofilm community using high throughput amplicon sequencing; quantitative PCR; and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The anammox bacteria (Ca. Brocadia) constituted a large fraction of the biomass with fewer aerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and even less nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB; Nitrotoga, Nitrospira and Nitrobacter). Still, NOB had considerable impact on the process performance. The anammox bacteria, AOB and NOB all harboured more than one population, indicating some diversity, and the heterotrophic bacterial community was diverse (seven phyla). Despite the downshifts in substrate availability, changes in the relative abundance and composition of anammox bacteria, AOB and NOB were small and also the heterotrophic community showed little changes in composition. This indicates stability of PNA MBBR communities towards decreasing substrate availability and suggests that even heterotrophic bacteria are integral components of these communities...|$|R
