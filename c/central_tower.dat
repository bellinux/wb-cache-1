5|$|An {{important}} feature of English cathedrals, uncommon elsewhere except in Normandy, is the large and often elaborate square <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> over the crossing. The larger of these towers range from 55 metres (182ft) at Wells to 82.5 metres (271ft) at Lincoln. The <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> may exist as a single feature as at Salisbury, Gloucester, Worcester, Norwich and Chichester or in combination with paired towers at the west front as at York, Lincoln, Canterbury, Durham and Wells. Among the cathedrals that have three towers, the <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> is usually much the tallest. At Southwell the two western towers are capped by pyramidal spires sheathed in lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} {{substantially}} remodelled in 1684, following Henry Hare's {{marriage to the}} dowager Duchess of Somerset, {{and much of the}} existing south facade dates from this time. The facade's <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> with a belvedere is a motif of the English Renaissance of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. Hatfield House, also close to London, had a similar <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> constructed in 1611, as does Blickling Hall in Norfolk, built circa 1616.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1676, Bruce drew up {{plans for}} the {{completion}} of Heriot's Hospital in Edinburgh, which had been started in the 1620s. His design, for the <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> of the south façade, was eventually executed in 1693.|$|E

5|$|From about 1493 until 1525 the {{architect}} {{appears to have}} been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory. He also built the <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> southwest porch and cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting light into the crossing. Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{stands on}} a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three {{rectangular}} galleries rising to a <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, Brahma, the moon, and Vishnu. Each gallery has a gopura {{at each of the}} points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a quincunx with the <b>central</b> <b>tower.</b> Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1079 and 1530, with a 19th-century west front, Hereford Cathedral has a Norman nave {{and large}} <b>central</b> <b>tower.</b> Other {{important}} features being the unusual {{style of the}} north transept and the north porch, also of the 13th century, but greatly extended in the 16th. Its Early English Lady Chapel is considered “one {{of the most beautiful}} of the thirteenth century”.|$|E

5|$|Built between 1084 and 1504, Worcester Cathedral {{represents}} every medieval style from Norman to Perpendicular. It {{is famous}} for its Norman crypt, and for its circular chapter house, which became the model from which derives the series of uniquely British polygonal chapter houses. Also notable are a series of unusual Transitional Gothic bays, fine woodwork and the <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> which, though not large, is nevertheless of particularly fine proportions.|$|E
5|$|Lighted signs {{spelling}} TECH hang {{on each of}} {{the four}} sides of the seven-story <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> dominating the building's facade and visible from many parts of the Georgia Tech campus and surrounding area.

5|$|The cathedral {{was used}} as an {{inspiration}} for Ken Follett's novel The Pillars of the Earth and, with a heavily modified <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> featured as the completed fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral {{at the end of the}} 2010 television adaptation of that novel. The interior of the cathedral was used for the Doctor Who episode, 'The Lazarus Experiment', while the exterior shots were filmed at Southwark Cathedral.|$|E
50|$|The Business <b>Central</b> <b>Towers</b> is {{a complex}} of two 53-floor towers in Dubai Media City in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Both towers have an equal total {{structural}} height of 265 m and resemble New York City's Chrysler Building. Both towers were topped out in November 2007 and were completed in early 2008. Originally named the Al Kazim Tower Towers, the towers were renamed as the Business <b>Central</b> <b>Towers,</b> a more friendly name for all foreign companies in both buildings.|$|R

5|$|A National Park Service {{spokesperson}} {{reported that}} surveys revealed cracks {{near the top}} of the Washington Monument, the world's tallest stone structure, which remained closed for repairs until May 2014. The earthquake severely damaged three of the four pinnacles (corner spires) on the <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> of the Washington National Cathedral, cracked some of its flying buttresses, and caused additional damage. As the cathedral's insurance policy did not cover earthquake damage, cathedral officials stated that they would need to raise millions of dollars to fully evaluate the damage and to stabilize and repair its limestone exterior.|$|E
5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and {{the upper part of}} the north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the complex}} are the Twin <b>Towers</b> of Parque <b>Central</b> which are two skyscrapers that, for decades, have become Caracas' {{architectural}} icon. From 1979 (when the West Tower was opened) until 2003, {{they held the}} title of tallest skyscrapers in Latin America until they were overtaken by Torre Mayor in Mexico City. Today the Parque <b>Central</b> <b>Towers</b> are South America's second tallest skyscrapers and the third tallest in Latin America, after Gran Torre Santiago in Santiago (Chile) and Torre Mayor in Mexico City. Parque <b>Central</b> <b>towers</b> are the tallest twin buildings in Latin America.|$|R

5|$|Between 1275 and 1310 the undercroft and {{chapter house}} were built by unknown architects, the undercroft in the Early English and the chapter {{house in the}} Geometric style of Decorated Gothic architecture. In about 1310 work {{commenced}} on the Lady Chapel, {{to the design of}} Thomas Witney, who also built the <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> from 1315 to 1322 in the Decorated Gothic style. The tower was later braced internally with arches by William Joy. Concurrent with this work, in 1329–45 Joy made alterations and extensions to the choir, joining it to the Lady Chapel with the retrochoir, the latter in the Flowing Decorated style.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1175 and 1490, Wells Cathedral {{has been}} {{described}} as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. Much of the structure is in the Early English style and is greatly enriched by the deeply sculptural nature of the mouldings and the vitality of the carved capitals in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. The eastern end has retained much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has the finest Early English façade and a large <b>central</b> <b>tower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Exhibits include cannons {{at the gun}} ports with shot, {{ropes and}} firing equipment, and old muskets and matchlocks. There are maps and other {{illustrations}} of historical times, including a plaque that depicts the winds and the currents in Muscat bay. One room, with a ceiling made from palm-logs, is filled with cultural relics of Oman. The square <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> holds the main museum exhibits including rugs, pottery, jewelry, weapons, household utensils and incense holders. A dining hall overlooks the courtyard {{for use by the}} distinguished visitors. An old breeze-maker has been preserved in this room, once manually operated but now mechanized.|$|E

5|$|From the exterior, the {{building}} appears austere, as was much of Mountfort's early work: a <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> dominates two flanking gabled wings in the Gothic revival style. However {{the interior was}} a riot of colour and medievalism as perceived through Victorian eyes; it included stained glass windows, and a large double-faced clock, thought {{to be one of}} only five around the globe. The chamber is decorated in a rich, almost Ruskinesque style, with carvings by a local sculptor William Brassington. Included in the carvings are representations of indigenous New Zealand species.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} {{included the}} repetition of Curvilinear or flame-like forms that occur in {{a great number of}} windows of around 1320, notably in the retro-choir at Wells and the nave of Exeter Cathedral. This type of tracery is often seen in combination with vaulting ribs of extreme projection and very rich moulding, as is seen in the chapter house at Wells, and the vault at Exeter, which stretches, uninterrupted by a <b>central</b> <b>tower,</b> for 91 metres (300ft) and is the longest medieval vault in the world.|$|E
5|$|Hotel Valley Ho is a {{historic}} hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the Valley Ho and, for 28 years, the Ramada Valley Ho, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. It first opened in 1956 with a forward-looking and futuristic design. Movie stars and famous baseball players stayed, and the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere. The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958, with two additional two-story wings of guest rooms extending to the north. Though initially proposed by Varney, a <b>central</b> <b>tower</b> of guest rooms, rising over the lobby, was not built.|$|E
