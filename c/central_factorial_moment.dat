In this paper, the <b>factorial</b> <b>moments</b> are simply calculated. Then a closed form is deduced for the central moments. A new number is produced to simplify calculations of the required moments. Central moments are calculated for some discrete distributions.

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{thesis is}} to derive properties of the random variable representing the cardinality of intersection of independent random samples (without replacement) from a finite population. Besides basic properties, such as exact probability distribution, <b>central</b> and <b>factorial</b> <b>moments,</b> we also study convergence of the moments and convergence of the probability distribution (under certain conditions) to Poisson and normal distribution. The asymptotic properties appear to be useful because the exact distribution is rather difficult to deal with.

40|$|Permutations {{are perhaps}} one of the most basic and {{important}} combinatorial structures. They appear in Mathematics and other fields of Science and Technology under many different appearances, for instance as linear orders, elements of the symmetric group, or associated to certain matrices and graphs. There are also many interesting statistics associated to permutations. Among others, in this work, we explore the number of ascents, the number of inversions and the number of cycles. In connection with theses statistics there are many interesting results and concepts like recurrence formulas, generating functions and a collection of important numbers not only in combinatorics but in some other fields as Eulerian numbers, Stirling numbers of first and second kind, etc. Finally, in the last chapter we present some aplications to run tests based on the length of ascents and descents and also the connection between <b>central</b> and <b>factorial</b> <b>moments.</b> Universidad de Sevilla.

40|$|<b>Factorial</b> <b>moments</b> are {{convenient}} {{tools in}} nuclear physics {{to characterize the}} multiplicity distributions when phase-space resolution (Δ) becomes small. For uncorrelated particle production within Δ, Gaussian statistics holds and <b>factorial</b> <b>moments</b> F_q are equal to unity for all orders q. Correlations between particles lead to a broadening of the multiplicity distribution and to dynamical fluctuations. In this case, the <b>factorial</b> <b>moments</b> increase above 1 with decreasing Δ. This corresponds to what can be called intermittency. In this letter, we show that a similar analysis can be developed on financial price series, with an adequate definition of <b>factorial</b> <b>moments.</b> An intermittent behavior can be extracted using moments of order 2 (F_ 2), illustrating a sensitivity to non-Gaussian fluctuations within time resolution below 4 hours.
