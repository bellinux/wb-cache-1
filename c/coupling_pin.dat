25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a <b>coupling</b> <b>pin</b> (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new control {{strategy}} is {{proposed for the}} synchronization of stochastic dynamical networks with nonlinear <b>coupling.</b> <b>Pinning</b> state feedback controllers have been proved to be effective for synchronization control of statecoupled dynamical networks. We will show that pinning impulsive controllers are also effective for synchronization control of the above mentioned dynamical networks. Some generic mean square stability criteria are derived in terms of algebraic conditions, which guarantee that the whole state-coupled dynamical network can be forced to some desired trajectory by placing impulsive controllers on {{a small fraction of}} nodes. An effective method is given to select the nodes which should be controlled at each impulsive constants. The proportion of the controlled nodes guaranteeing the stability is explicitly obtained, and the synchronization region is also derived and clearly plotted. Numerical simulations are exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the pinning impulsive strategy proposed in this paper.

This finder used the same <b>coupling</b> <b>pin</b> on the shutter speed dial as the Booster T Finder did, to sync the finder's shutter speed setting with the camera.

50|$|BRUTEs were a wheeled platform, {{generally}} with mesh {{around three}} {{sides of the}} body, the fourth side being open with canvas (or later plastic) straps for restraint of the load. The front included a panel for notes to be chalked to help sort traffic. A few BRUTEs had just the front, for carrying bulky loads {{too big for the}} cage, or two hinged ramps (no sides) to load or unload BRUTEs into railway vans. Each BRUTE had two fixed wheels at the rear and two swivelling caster wheels at the front, with polyurethane tyres and taper bearings. Coupling were at front and rear, the front being a pin, the rear a hinged loop on a sprung shaft. A lever on the front operated brakes on the rear wheels and lifted the <b>coupling</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Booster T Finder and Servo EE Finder {{were both}} {{essentially}} {{variations on the}} standard eye=level finder. The Booster T Finder contained an ultra-sensitive metering cell which could read as low as EV −3.5. Just like the metering range was shifted towards the dark side, this finder also shift the shutter speeds the camera provided towards the long end. Instead of the normal range (1 s - 1/2000 s), the Booster T Finder gave 60 s - 1/60 s. The shutter speed dial on the finder locked on to the camera's normal shutter dial and drove it through a <b>coupling</b> <b>pin</b> for the standard range of 1 s - 1/60 s. The finder also had a trigger button, which went through the finder down to the normal trigger button. When the Booster's shutter speed dial was turned further, towards longer times, the camera's dial stopped at the B(ulb) setting, and the finder kept the trigger button pressed {{for the duration of}} the exposure. The mechanics of this connection also resulted in the oddity that there was no 2 s setting, but 4, 3 and 1 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Around 1860, when Beugniot was {{the chief}} {{engineer}} at the firm of Köchlin, he developed a system whereby wheelsets are housed in pairs in the locomotive frame, with side-play, and connected by a lever. These levers are fixed to the frame in the centre and thus enable the sideways movement of the connected axles in opposite directions. In this way, instead of being fixed in the frame, the axles are able to move sideways rather like a bogie, but clearly nowhere near as much. On locomotives with a side rod drive, the axle side-play is balanced using longer <b>coupling</b> <b>pins</b> (Kuppelzapfen) on which the coupling rods are also able to move sideways.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{stability}} of linearly coupled dynamical systems with feedback pinning is studied. Event-triggered rules are employed on both diffusion <b>coupling</b> and feedback <b>pinning</b> {{to reduce the}} updating load of the coupled system. Here, both the coupling matrix and the set of pinned-nodes vary with time are induced by a homogeneous Markov chain. For each node, the diffusion <b>coupling</b> and feedback <b>pinning</b> are set up from the observation of its neighbors' and target's (if pinned) information at the latest event time and the next event time is triggered by some specified criteria. Two event-triggering rules are proposed and it is proved that if the system with time-average <b>coupling</b> and <b>pinning</b> gains are stable, the event-triggered strategies can stabilize the system if the switching is sufficiently fast. Moreover, Zeno behaviors are excluded in some cases. Finally, numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results...|$|R

Both had one driven and three coupled axles. The designer of this heavy locomotive was the then senior engineer and director at Joseph Anton von Maffei, Anton Hammel, (1857-1925), who had also developed the famous S 3/6. Between 1913 and 1914 the first series of 15 vehicles was procured and they entered service in 1914. The locomotives caused quite a stir {{at that time and}} could be seen at the railway exhibitions frequently held in those days (e.g. the 1922 transport exhibition in Munich) - and, like the S 3/6, they were often painted with a blue or ochre yellow photographic livery and adorned with a crowned chimney. As the first one of the second series, no. 5766 (96 016) was even spruced up with brass bands on the crowned chimney and boiler as well as brass decorations on its front cylinders, and certainly made an impression. A similar thing was carried out on the same locomotive after the rebuilding of the second series in 1926. Otherwise, the first series had a narrow chimney with a cap similar to the Prussian P 8. The operational livery of the K.Bay.Sts.B. locomotives was green with yellow lettering and a black chassis.|$|E

25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a transverse force of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the <b>coupling</b> <b>pins</b> push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|R

40|$|The {{synchronization}} {{problem for}} a complex dynamical network is investigated in this paper from a spectral analysis approach. It is assumed {{that only a small}} portion of the nodes in the network are chosen to be controlled, known as the pinning control scheme. Some new types of synchronized regions for networks with different node dynamics and inner-coupling structures are discovered, especially for the case of the special chaotic node systems with a stable equilibrium point under fully anti-diagonal and partially anti-diagonal couplings. The eigenvalue distributions of the coupling and control matrices for different types of complex networks are obtained. The effects of the network topology, global <b>coupling</b> strength, <b>pinning</b> density, and pinning strength on the network synchronizability are examined through extensive numerical simulations. It is shown that the synchronizability of the pinned network can be effectively improved by increasing the overall <b>coupling</b> strength, <b>pinning</b> density, and pinning strength for some classes of synchronized regions, whereas too large the pinning density and pinning strength will lead to desynchronization for other classes. It is found that small-world networks are not always easier to synchronize than regular rings, and a denser eigenvalue distribution may not always imply better synchronizability. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

40|$|The archaeological {{museum of}} Rome asked our group about the {{physical}} consistency of a marble slab (second to third century AD) that recently fell during its travel {{as part of an}} exhibition. We decided to use different methodologies to investigate the slab: namely a pacometer (Protovale Elcometer) to individuate the internal <b>coupling</b> <b>pins,</b> and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) (2000 MHz) and ultrasonic (55 kHz) tomographic high-density surveys to investigate the internal extension of all the visible fractures and to search for the hidden ones. For the ultrasonic data, tests were carried out to optimize the inversion parameters, in particular the cell dimensions. The choice of cell size for the inversion process must take into account the size of the acquisition grid and the ray number acquired. We proposed to calculate a minimum Fresnel’s radius using the sampling frequency instead of that of the probes. For every methodology used, the quality of the acquired data was relatively high. This was then processed and compared to provide information that was useful for some of the insurance problems of the museum. Later on, the data was processed in depth to see how to improve the data processing and interpretation. Finally, the results of this in-depth study were exposed in detail.
