The liquid is fed through the hollow fiber accumulating at the fiber tip to form droplets.

The spatial variation of the capillary pressure drives the droplets towards the wider side of the cone. Various liquids were used to change the surface tension by a factor of 3. 5 and viscosity by a factor of 1500. Within each droplet size and viscous-dissipation regime, the data for climbing speeds collapse on a single curve. Droplets traveling with and against gravity allow us to pinpoint the absolute strength of the driving capillary pressure and viscous stresses and thereby determine the prefactors in the dimensionless relationships.

Background Data: Thermal effects of root canal laser treatments on periodontal ligament cells and alveolar bone are of concern in terms of safety. Materials and Methods: A total of 64 single-rooted extracted teeth were prepared 1 mm short of the working length using rotary nickel-titanium Pro-Taper files to an apical size corresponding to a F 5 Pro-Taper instrument. A thermocouple located 2 mm from the apex was used to record temperature changes arising from delivery of laser energy through laterally emitting conical tips or plain tips, using an Er: YAG or Er, Cr: YSGG laser.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of tip design on patterns of laser energy dispersion through the dentine of tooth roots when using near-infrared diode lasers. Diode laser emissions of 810 or 940  nm were used in combination with optical fiber tips with either conventional plain ends or conical ends, to irradiate tooth roots of oval or round cross-sectional shapes. The lasers were operated in continuous wave mode at 0. 5  W for 5  s with the distal end of the fiber tip placed in the apical or coronal third of the root canal at preset positions. Laser light exiting through the roots and apical foramen was imaged, and the extent of lateral spread calculated.

For both laser wavelengths, there were no significant differences in emission patterns when the variable of canal shape was used and all other variables were kept the same (plain vs conical tip, tip position).

40|$|A {{major issue}} when lasers {{are used in}} {{endodontics}} is achieving the correct distribution {{of energy in the}} root canal. Conventional fiber designs emit energy in the forward direction, with a divergence of approximately 20 °. More recently, fibers have been developed with conical tips to achieve a wider distribution of laser energy. Since 2008, a number of alternative designs of the fiber-optic tips for endodontics has been developed which give greater lateral emissions. Such fibers have been used for diagnosing the presence of bacteria and biofilms in the root canal. They can also be used with pulsed erbium lasers to generate shockwaves in aqueous fluids. These shockwaves, directed {{on the walls of the}} root canals and also into lateral canals, deltas, and isthmus areas, can activate EDTA and provide enhanced removal of the smear layer. Because the tips have little forward emission, the risk of extruding irrigation fluids past the root canal apex is no greater than when conventional irrigation needles are used in the root canal. A further advantage of these lateral-emitting tip designs is that they do not require complex movements or withdrawal patterns to achieve even irradiation of the root canal walls.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Use of lasers in {{dentistry}} in root canals {{of teeth}} and in periodontal pockets for disinfection {{would be more}} effective if energy was delivered laterally. This study examined the energy emission profiles of fibers modified in various ways to enhance their lateral emissions for dental use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commercial optical fibers were altered by tube etching with hydrofluoric acid, modified tube etching (after removing the protective polyimide coating), alumina abrasive particle beams, and by etching and particle beams used in combination. Three free-running pulsed infrared lasers (Nd:YAG, Er:YAG, and Er,Cr:YSGG) were employed to test the modified fibers, with 25 fibers for each laser (modified or unmodified). Surface topography of fibers was examined using SEM. Laser emissions forward and laterally were measured, and thermally sensitive paper used to record the emission profiles. Visible tracing of emissions was undertaken using coaxial He-Ne or InGaAsP diode laser emissions. RESULTS: The etching/abrasion/etching combination gave a unique honeycomb surface configuration with grating-like properties, whilst etching alone gave a conical end. Conical and honeycomb tips showed greater lateral and lower forward emissions compared with plain fibers, with fourfold improvements in lateral emission. The most regular lateral emissions were from the honeycomb configuration. CONCLUSION: The honeycomb and the <b>conical</b> <b>fiber</b> modifications show dramatic improvements in lateral emissions.

40|$|Middle {{infrared}} lasers {{are currently}} used in clinical dental practice for ablation of dental hard and soft tissues. The use of middle infrared lasers for endodontic applications {{has not yet}} been adopted widely, with significant challenges being the limitations of optical delivery systems, the thermal stress developed by laser treatment, and the containment of energy {{within the confines of the}} root canal. Against this background, the current study investigated a series of novel approaches designed to address these issues. The study was done in eight phases. Phase 1 explored factors that influenced the ablative potential of the Er:YAG laser when used to ablate radicular dentine. This identified optimal parameters, and revealed that dentine ablated differently from the internal (radicular aspect) than from the external (root aspect). High water flow rates were found to attenuate dentine ablation within the root canal space. Phase 2 involved modifying optical fibers to increase lateral emission of laser energy, using a range of physical and chemical processes both alone and in combination. Three free-running pulsed infrared lasers (Nd:YAG, Er:YAG, and Er,Cr:YSGG) were employed to test the performance of the modified fibers. Compared with conventional fibers, conical ended and honeycomb fibers gave increased lateral emissions, which would be of benefit for ablation of radicular dentine. Methods for treating fibers of different chemical composition were quantified. In Phase 3, Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG lasers were used to treat root canals, with a particular emphasis on the removal of a thick smear layer which was created intentionally in root canals prior to lasing. A novel digital analysis method was developed to assess the extent of smear layer remaining after the various root canal treatments. This image analysis method was validated and then used in Phase 4, in which the effectiveness of the Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG lasers in removing smear layer in the apical third of the root canal was studied, this time using both conventional plain fibers and conical modified fibers. For smear layer removal, conical fibers performed better than plain fibers, when matched for the same laser system and the same irrigant. There was no difference in performance between the two middle infrared laser systems. Lasing was found to improve the action of EDTAC when allowed to remain in the canal for the same treatment time. Either of the laser systems, when used with conical tips, could remove thick smear layers. Conversely, if used with plain tips, the overall performance of the laser systems was less than the “gold standard” of rotary nickel titanium files used with EDTA and NaOCl irrigants. Phase 5 of the study showed that minimal temperature effects occurred on the external surface of the root when this laser treatment was undertaken with either plain or modified endodontic laser tips. An additional safety concern with intra-canal laser use is the possibility of extrusion of fluids from the apical foramen. Thus, Phase 6, a novel digital analysis method was developed to quantify extrusion of microdroplets from the apex when Er:YAG or Er,Cr:YSGG lasers were used with plain or <b>conical</b> <b>fiber</b> tips. Both lasers generated sufficient pressure waves to displace small volumes of fluids past the apex, with an effect greater than the conventional “gold standard” treatment of irrigation with a 25 -gauge needle. The issue of extrusion should be considered when considering the irrigants used with intra-canal laser treatments in endodontics. In Phase 7, additional variations to optical fiber design were examined, including “safe ended” fibers fabricated using metal deposition methods. Forward emissions were reduced, with no reduction in the lateral emissions. This suggests that tip plating methods may be useful in obtaining safe ended endodontic laser tips. In final phase of the study, the use of an alternative middle infrared laser, the holmium:YAG system, was examined, using methodology similar to that in Phase 1. Based on the work undertaken in Phases 1 it was predicted that the use of coaxial water mist could alter the ablative effect and overcome problems of surface thermal interactions such as carbonization. It was found that use of coaxial water spray altered the ablation effect, and produced craters with smooth outlines indicative of an entirely explosive process without adjacent collateral damage. The ability to ablate dentine under wet lasing conditions, and the ability to be transmitted through glass optical fibers offers promise for the application of the Ho:YAG laser for endodontic procedures, particularly shaping the root canal system with modified quartz glass fibers. This work has established the utility of middle infrared lasers for certain aspects of endodontic therapy, and demonstrated the value of lasing in combination with water-based irrigants. Of particular importance, new designs for optical fiber tips have been developed, with enhanced lateral emissions to address the challenges of irradiating the walls of the root canal...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 83 - 89. An optoelectronic {{nose for}} the analysis of alcohols (ethanol and methanol) in chemically complex environments is reported. The cross-responsive sensing unit of the optoelectronic nose is an array of three distinct hollow core infrared (IR) transmitting photonic band gap fibers (Bragg fibers), which transmit a specific band of IR light depending on their Bragg mirror structures. Presence of alcohol molecules in the optofluidic core quench the fiber transmissions if there is an absorption band of the analyte overlapping with the transmission band of the fiber. The cumulative response data of the fiber array enables rapid, reversible and accurate discrimination of alcohols in chemically complex backgrounds such as beer and fruit juice. In addition, we observed that humidity of the environment has no effect on the response of the optoelectronic nose, which is rarely achieved in gas sensing applications. Consequently, it can be reliably used in virtually any environment without precalibration for humidity or drying the analytes. To further improve the performance, we engineered the photonic bandgap of Bragg fibers by controlling the thickness profile of the fiber during the thermal drawing. Conical hollow core Bragg fibers were produced by thermal drawing under a rapidly alternating load, which was applied by introducing steep changes to the fiber drawing speed. In conventional cylindrical Bragg fibers, light is guided by omnidirectional reflections from interior dielectric mirrors with a single quarter wave stack period. In <b>conical</b> <b>fibers,</b> the diameter reduction introduced a gradient of the quarter wave stack period {{along the length of the}} fiber.

An oblique force was applied and stiffness and maximum load data were obtained. The same test was used for the dentine. The systems were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to investigate the surface of the post and inner surface of root canal after failure. The mechanical tests showed that load values in dental systems depend on the post material and used cement. The highest load (281 ± 59 N) was observed for the <b>conical</b> glass <b>fiber</b> posts in the cement without primer.

The microscopic analysis underlined the good adhesion of the second cement at the interfaces between dentine and post. The mechanical tests confirmed that the strength of the dental systems subjected to masticatory loads was strictly related to the bond at the interface post/cement and cement/dentine.

40|$|NOVELTY - To coat fibers with an {{adhesive}}, the adhesive {{is applied}} while the fibers have a residual moisture content of at most 100 %. After {{the application of}} the adhesive, the fiber clumps are broken down. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In an INDEPENDENT CLAIM, an assembly has a tower (4) which can be filled (18) and emptied (20). The adhesive is applied to the fibers in the tower through feeds (8) in the tower or its wall (6). A mechanism (22) to break down fiber clumps is at the outlet of the tower. Before application, the residual moisture content in the fibers is set by drying at at most 100 % and pref. 10 - 1 %. The fiber clumps are agitated in an air stream, giving turbulence which breaks them down in the air eddies. Or the glued fibers can be separated in a refiner or mill. The separated fibers are passed to a workstation to be formed into fiber materials. The fibers, in clumps or separated, can be fed to an intermediate store. The adhesive is applied to the fibers in a fiber/air stream mo ving at a speed of at most 150 m/s and pref. at most 50 m/s and especially at most 10 m/s, moving on a straight or a spiral path. The environment is controlled, in the application zone, to a given temperature and/or air humidity. The residual moisture content of the fibers can be varied while the fibers are being glued and/or separated. The adhesive glue is fed according to batches of fed fibers or fiber masses, or the vol. of delivered adhesive is set on a time scale. The adhesive is delivered by jets. The tower has a jet system (14) for the delivery of air or other gases into it, or through its walls, and also jets to generate air turbulence to eddy and/or advance the fibers. The tower is vertical, horizontal or at an angle, and is at least partially <b>conical.</b> The <b>fiber</b> clumps are broken down by a rotor, sieve, beating plate or the like, followed by winnowing where surplus air is diverted from the fiber/air stream for at least partial return to the tower after its temp. and/or humidi t y levels have been set. A control registers the fiber feed to set the volume of adhesive to be delivered by fiber batches or on a timed basis. The control system also sets the conditions of the environment within the tower according to the fiber moisture content and its mass, to give a temperature and/or humidity profile between the tower entry and exit. The consistency of the adhesive is adjusted according to the wetness and/or temperature of the fibers to be coated. USE - The method is for the preparation of wood fibers for use in fiberboards, and the like, where their adhesive coating gives a bond between them in the board structure. ADVANTAGE - The method reduces adhesive consumption, so that the fibers are effectively coated with minimum material and energy costs...|$|R
