In this study, we analyzed the sensitivity to venom specific (s) IgE by spiking with rVes v 5 and rPol d 5 in Japanese patients suspected of Hymenoptera venom allergy.

50|$|Micronucleus assay {{systems are}} very economical, require much less skill in scoring that {{conventional}} metaphase tests, and are {{much faster than}} these <b>conventional</b> <b>tests.</b> Since micronucleus assays reflect chromosomal aberrations reliably and rapidly, they are extremely useful for a quick assessment of chromosomal damage. In particular, the CBMNcyt (cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome) assay is extremely versatile {{and is one of}} the preferred methods to measure the level of chromosomal damage and chromosomal instability in cells. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was first developed to score micronuclei in cells that completed nuclear division by blocking them at the binucleate stage before cytokinesis. It later evolved into the CBMN 'cytome' assay to further explore cell death, cytostasis, and biomarkers of DNA damage. The major drawback of using micronucleus tests is that they cannot determine different types of chromosomal aberrations and can be influenced by the mitotic rate and proportion of cell death, skewing the results.|$|E

50|$|Researchers {{argued that}} since cognitively {{integrated}} knowledge {{is more likely}} to be internalized and retained by students, it {{is more likely to}} be remembered and correctly applied on standardized tests than knowledge memorized as discrete items only for the purpose of repeating it when called upon. (27) Since demands for authentic intellectual work pose questions of interest to students in their lives beyond school, students are more likely to care about both the questions they study and the answers they learn. Thus, such assignments enhance a student’s willingness to put forth serious effort in learning the material, as compared to exercises that have no personal meaning beyond completing an assignment to please the teacher or to attain a promotion. In sum, assignments that demand more authentic intellectual work elicit intensive thinking about and a deeper engagement in varied applications of words, concepts, and ideas.

50|$|The {{process of}} data {{dredging}} involves automatically testing {{huge numbers of}} hypotheses about a single data set by exhaustively searching -- perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable. <b>Conventional</b> <b>tests</b> of statistical significance {{are based on the}} probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis). This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type, hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses turn out to be significant at the 5% level, 1% turn out to be significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be statistically significant but misleading, since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.|$|E

The subjects consisted of 278 students taking first year Chemistry at the University Technology of Malaysia. The students were given a pretest and posttest in achievement, test anxiety, and attitudes toward science. The instruments included an achievement test in chemistry made up of selected items from previous American Chemical Society Cooperative Examinations and translated versions of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and Science Attitude Questionnaire. Pretest scores were used to assign students randomly into experimental and control groups. The experimental group was subjected to frequent testing, while the control group was subjected to <b>conventional</b> <b>testing.</b> The data were analyzed using one-way and three-way analysis of covariance. The analysis revealed significant difference between the experimental and control groups in student (a) achievement in chemistry with the experimental group achieving at higher levels and (b) test anxiety with the experimental group having lower test anxiety than the control group. No significant difference was found in students attitudes toward science between the experimental and control groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} whether, {{for patients}} with suspected myelin impairment, the sensitivity of motor nerve conduction studies can be increased by using an SFEMG electrode which {{makes it possible to}} study conduction velocity in a small number of axons (SF-CV). METHODS: We studied 22 consecutive patients with suspected neuropathy through conventional motor conduction study and through SF-CV. For each patient we selected a nerve that was normal at conventional neurography and studied it through SF-CV. Also, we performed SF-CV in 15 healthy subjects. We considered 36 m/s as the low limit of normal SF-CV (the normal value commonly accepted in the literature for the slowest alpha motor axons). RESULTS: In the healthy subjects we never observed abnormal SF-CV values. Of the 22 patients, in 18 the <b>conventional</b> <b>tests</b> showed abnormal findings suggestive of neuropathy. The remaining 4 patients were completely normal at the <b>conventional</b> <b>tests.</b> Through SF-CV we studied 22 nerves that were normal at the <b>conventional</b> <b>tests.</b> Fourteen of 22 (64 %) nerves presented pathological SF-CV test. Half of the patients with normal findings at the <b>conventional</b> <b>tests</b> showed pathological SF-CV test.

40|$|Approaches to {{adaptive}} (tailored) testing {{based on}} item response theory are described and research results summarized. Through appropriate combinations of item pool design {{and use of}} different test termination criteria, adaptive tests can be designed (1) to improve both measurement quality and measurement efficiency, resulting in measurements of equal precision at all trait levels; (2) to improve measurement efficiency for test batteries using item pools designed for conventional test administration; and (3) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of testing for classification (e. g., mastery testing). Research results show that tests based on item response theory (IRT) can achieve measurements of equal precision at all trait levels, given an adequately designed item pool; these results contrast with those of <b>conventional</b> <b>tests</b> which require a tradeoff of bandwidth for fidelity/precision of measurements. Data also show reductions in bias, inaccuracy, and {{root mean square error}} of ability estimates. Improvements in test fidelity observed in simulation studies are supported by live-testing data, which showed adaptive tests requiring half the number of items as that of <b>conventional</b> <b>tests</b> to achieve equal levels of reliability, and almost one-third the number to achieve equal levels of validity. When used with item pools from <b>conventional</b> <b>tests,</b> both simulation and live-testing results show reductions in test battery length from <b>conventional</b> <b>tests,</b> with no reductions in the quality of measurements. Adaptive tests designed for dichotomous classification also represent improvements over <b>conventional</b> <b>tests</b> designed for the same purpose. Simulation studies show reductions in test length and improvements in classification accuracy for adaptive vs. conventional tests; live-testing studies in which adaptive tests were compared with "optimal" <b>conventional</b> <b>tests</b> support these findings.
