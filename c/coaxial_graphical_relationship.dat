In this paper, we introduce a way to leverage <b>graphical</b> <b>relationship</b> to capture characteristics of information diffusion. With this approach, we extract subgraphs by projecting the first few domains mentioning a topic onto the domain hyperlink graph and co-mention graph, and use machine learning method to construct a predictive model.

50|$|These {{laboratory}} tests generally consist of compacting soil at known moisture content into a cylindrical mold of standard dimensions using a compactive effort of controlled magnitude. The soil is usually compacted {{into the mold}} to {{a certain amount of}} equal layers, each receiving a number of blows from a standard weighted hammer at a specified height. This process is then repeated for various moisture contents and the dry densities are determined for each. The <b>graphical</b> <b>relationship</b> of the dry density to moisture content is then plotted to establish the compaction curve. The maximum dry density is finally obtained from the peak point of the compaction curve and its corresponding moisture content, also known as the optimal moisture content.|$|R

30|$|Regarding {{function}} {{forms of}} explanatory variables, {{there is no}} universal guidance and various {{are used in the}} literature. To select the most suitable mathematical forms of explanatory variables, one may use <b>graphical</b> <b>relationships</b> between crash frequency or a road variable (i.e. univariate analysis) [4], or use more complex techniques, such as empirical integral functions and cumulative residuals (CURE) [33]. According to Hauer [35], the model equation may have both multiplicative components (to represent the influence of continuous factors, such as lane width or shoulder type), and additive components (to account for the influence of point hazards, such as driveways or narrow bridges). Despite these recommendations, the typical modelling approach is often simple. The general model form of Eq. (1) is widely adopted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Graphical {{languages}} {{provide a}} powerful tool for describing the behaviour of quantum systems. While the use of graphs vastly reduces the complexity of many calculations [4, 10], manual graphical manipulation quickly becomes untenable for large graphs or large numbers of graphs. To combat this issue, we are developing a tool called Quantomatic, which allows automated and semi-automated explorations of graph rewrite systems and their underlying semantics. We emphasise in this paper the features of Quantomatic that interact with a computer algebra system to discover <b>graphical</b> <b>relationships</b> via the unification of matrix equations. Since these equations can grow exponentially with the size of the graph, we use this method to discover small identities and use those identities as graph rewrites to expand the theory. ...|$|R

These {{are called the}} pump curves. They are determined by studies, whose methodology is standardized. These curves are specified when water is pumped with a density of 1000 kg/m3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 mm2/s. When the circulating pump is used for liquids of different density and viscosity, the pump curves have to be recalculated. These curves are provided in catalogues and in operation and maintenance manuals, however their stroke {{is the subject of}} pump manufacturers warranty.|$|R

Using a flow chart, the paper first describes the procedure in general and then illustrates it using an example. A range of mixes were made to test the method varying water-to-geopolymer solid ratio. It was found that certain basic principles established for conventional concrete still apply for geopolymer concrete mix designs.

To obtain the desired value of the performance measures the <b>graphical</b> <b>relationship</b> between the PI controller and the performance criteria is given. Thus by using graphical method a set of PI controller parameters to meet the desired performance measures are obtained in an effective and simpler way.

In this study were analyzed the possibilities of network traffic prediction using Farima model, the theory of chaos with Lyapunov exponents and neural networks. Possibilities of prediction with the focus on neural network were discussed in detail here, mainly on recurrent neural networks. Prediction was performed in Matlab development environment in Neural Network Toolbox, where they were created, trained and evaluated neural network to predict specific types of network traffic.

40|$|Measurements of {{body weight}} and body, tail and hindlimb lengths were made at various times during the {{postnatal}} development of the CFHB-Wistar rat using simple techniques which avoided unnecessary stress being applied to the animal. All the <b>graphical</b> <b>relationships</b> studied using these measurements indicated that growth was divided into two phases which meet at 16 days. This was particularly noticeable when either body length or hindlimb length was plotted against either age or body weight. Body weight {{appeared to be a}} better indication of maturity than time; and linear relationships were found when measurements of body lengths were plotted against the square root {{of body weight}}. Curvilinear graphs were obtained when body weight was plotted on alternative scales. Results suggest that prior to 16 days metabolism is probably directed more towards attaining sufficient maturity to enable the animal to survive independently, than to increasing its stature; but after 16 days this situation is reversed...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{organization}} and architecture courses {{are an integral}} part of computer science education. For such courses, there are advantages to studying real architectures instead of simplified examples. However, real architectures are complex and difficult to grasp in a single semester course. Visualization of a running program on a given architecture can help with this problem by showing students functionality of architectural components and their interactive behavior. However, existing architectural simulations are difficult to use and consequently difficult to adopt in a course where time is already limited. To solve this problem, we present Frances-A. Key to Frances-A’s design is that it uses a simple web interface that requires no setup and is easy to use, making it easy to adopt in a course. Frances-A also includes several features that further enhance its usefulness in a classroom setting.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{convergence}} times of dynamics in games involving <b>graphical</b> <b>relationships</b> of players. Our model of local interaction games generalizes {{a variety of}} recently studied games in game theory and distributed computing. In a local interaction game each agent is a node embedded in a graph and plays the same 2 -player game with each neighbor. He can choose his strategy only once and must apply his choice in each 2 -player game he is involved in. This represents a fundamental model of decision making with local interaction and distributed control. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization called 2 -type interaction games, in which one 2 -player game is played on edges and possibly another game is played on non-edges. For the popular case with symmetric 2 × 2 games, we show that several dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium in polynomial time. This includes arbitrary sequential betterresponse dynamics, as well as concurrent dynamics resulting from a distributed protocol that does not rely on global knowledge. We supplement these results with an experimental comparison of sequential and concurrent dynamics...|$|R
