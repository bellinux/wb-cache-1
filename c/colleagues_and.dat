5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all power, but were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E

The series also starred Hermione Norris, Celia Imrie, Karl Davies, Phyllida Law and Tony Slattery.|$|E

5|$|On January 22, 2012, Giffords {{announced}} that she would resign from her congressional seat in order to concentrate on her recovery, but promised to return to public service in the future.

5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling that he could not fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and spoke {{in support of the}} children of Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E

5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the Swiss {{architect}} and then-Jesuit priest Hans Roth began an extensive restoration {{project of the}} missionary churches and many colonial buildings that were in ruins. These churches exist in their present form {{as a result of}} Roth's effort, who worked on the restoration with a few <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> many local people until his death in 1999. The restoration works have continued sporadically into the beginning of the 21st century under local leadership.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, Siddiqui {{continued}} {{to discover and}} isolate numerous unique anti-bacterial compounds from various parts (leaves, bark, etc.) of the Neem and other plants.

Most of these discoveries still remain vital natural ingredients of various medicines as well as biopesticides.|$|E

5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his <b>colleagues,</b> <b>and</b> suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2005, the Council of Social Sciences, Pakistan, in {{collaboration}} with the National Rural Support Programme and other institutions, announced the Akhter Hameed Khan Memorial Award. The annual cash award is given on Khan's birthday to a Pakistani author for a book on issues related to rural and urban development, peace, poverty alleviation, or gender discrimination. At the occasion of the award ceremony in 2006, a documentary film about {{the life and times of}} Akhter Hameed Khan was premiered. The film includes archival footage and interviews with family members, <b>colleagues,</b> <b>and</b> contributors and beneficiaries of the Comilla and OPP projects.|$|E

5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E
5|$|Ron, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} deadpan and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested in the personal lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his <b>colleagues,</b> <b>and</b> has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E
5|$|The Sopranos is an American crime drama {{television}} series created by David Chase.

These are often highlighted during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco). The series features Tony's family members, mafia <b>colleagues</b> <b>and</b> rivals, in prominent roles and story arcs, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and protégé Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli).|$|E
