5|$|On May21, 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to form or cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's <b>Climate</b> <b>Prediction</b> Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes.

500|$|On May24, 2012, NOAA {{released}} their {{forecast for}} the season, predicting a near-normal season, with nine to fifteen named storms, {{four to eight}} hurricanes, and one to three major hurricanes. NOAA based its forecast on higher wind shear, cooler temperatures in the Main Development Region of the Eastern Atlantic, and the continuance of the [...] "high activity" [...] era – known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation warm phase – which began in 1995. Gerry Bell, lead seasonal forecaster at NOAA's <b>Climate</b> <b>Prediction</b> Center, added the main uncertainty in the outlook was how much below or above the 2012 season would be, and whether {{the high end of}} the predicted range is reached dependent on whether El Niño develops or stays in its current Neutral phase. That same day, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of a below-average season. They predicted 10named storms with a 70% chance that the number would be between 7 and 13. However, they do not issue forecasts on the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. They also predicted an ACE index of 90 with a 70% chance that the index would be in the range 28 to 152. On May30, 2012, the Florida State University for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) issued its annual Atlantic hurricane season forecast. The organization predicted 13named storms, including 7hurricanes, and an ACE index of 122.|$|E

For this purpose, the coupled model of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, consisting of the atmosphere model ECHAM 5 and the ocean model MPI-OM, is initialized with oceanic synthesis fields available from the German contribution to Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (GECCO) project. The use of an anomaly-coupling scheme during the initialization avoids the main problems with drift in the <b>climate</b> <b>predictions.</b> The coupled model is thus continuously forced to follow the density anomalies of the GECCO synthesis over the period 1952 - 2001.
