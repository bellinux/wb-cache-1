25|$|DAT is a symporter {{that moves}} {{dopamine}} across the cell membrane by coupling {{the movement to}} the energetically-favorable movement of sodium ions moving from high to low concentration into the cell. DAT function requires the sequential binding and <b>co-transport</b> of two Na+ ions and one Cl− ion with the dopamine substrate. The driving force for DAT-mediated dopamine reuptake is the ion concentration gradient generated by the plasma membrane Na+/K+ ATPase.|$|E
25|$|In {{secondary}} active transport, {{also known}} as coupled transport or <b>co-transport,</b> energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to primary active transport, {{there is no direct}} coupling of ATP; instead it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in/out of the cell. Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase).|$|E

50|$|Sodium and glucose are <b>co-transported</b> by the SGLT-2 protein {{into the}} tubular {{epithelial}} cells across the brush-border membrane of the proximal convoluted tubule.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of Na-coupled {{solute transport}} by renal and jejunal brush-border vesicles in the rabbit were examined using the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye diS-C 3 -(5). All organic solutes {{known to be}} transported across these membranes by Na-coupled mechanisms increase the fluorescence of the dye {{in the presence of}} Na, but not K. An increase in fluorescence (delta F) corresponds to a depolarization of the electrical potential difference (5 - 60 mV) across the brush-border membrane in the intact cell. delta F was independent of the valency of the transported solute. The fluorescence response was saturable, and for twelve solutes the Kf, i. e. the concentration of the substrate generating 50 % of the maximal response, agreed quite closely with the Kt values reported from tracer studies. For six solutes increasing the Na concentration decreased Kf, and this agrees with the effect of Na on the kinetics of succinate transport in renal vesicles. We conclude that D-glucose, neutral amino acids and imino acids are <b>co-transported</b> with Na across both renal and jejunal brush-border membranes, and that carboxylic acids, beta-amino acids, and dibasic amino acids are <b>co-transported</b> with Na across the renal, but not jejunal, membranes...|$|R

50|$|<b>Co-transport</b> {{proteins}} of {{mammalian cell}} membranes had eluded efforts of purification with classical biochemical methods {{until the late}} 1980s. These proteins had proven difficult to isolate because they contain hydrophilic and hydrophobic sequences and exist in membranes only in very low abundance (<0.2% of membrane proteins). The rabbit form of SGLT1 was the first mammalian <b>co-transport</b> protein ever to be cloned and sequenced, and this was reported in 1987. To circumvent the difficulties with traditional isolation methods, a novel expression cloning technique was used. Size-fractionation of large amounts of rabbit intestinal mRNA with preparative gel electrophoresis were then sequentially injected into Xenopus oocytes to ultimately find the RNA species that induced the expression of sodium-glucose cotransport.|$|E

In order to check whether weak non-covalent aggregates between doxorubicin and glutathione can be formed, {{which might be}} substrates for the transporter, the effect of glutathione on the partition coefficient of doxorubicin was studied. No evidence of an effect of glutathione (at levels up to 20 mM) on the partition coefficient of doxorubicin {{was found in the}} pH range of 4. 0 - 7. 4.

40|$|The rate-limiting {{step in the}} {{transport}} of alkali cations through supported liquid membranes mediated by calix [4] arene carriers can be the diffusion of the carrier cation complex through the membrane and/or the kinetics of cation release from the complex. The effects of membrane solvent, <b>co-transported</b> anion, and support on the diffusion constant Dm, the extraction constant Kex and the rate constant k have been studied. These were determined from flux measurements {{as a function of}} source phase salt activity (Dm and Kex) and membrane thickness (Dm and k). Additional information about {{the transport}} resistances was obtained from variation of the operating temperature and from lag time measurements. The diffusion constants (Dm) for 1 /NaClO 4 and 2 /KClO 4 linearly increased with reciprocal solvent viscosity. On increasing the solvent polarity, the extraction constant increased, while the rate of cation release decreased. Both log Kex and log k correlate linearly with the Kirkwood function, (¿r ¿ 1) /(2 ¿r + 1). The <b>co-transported</b> anion (ClO 4 ¿ vs. SCN¿) affects the kinetics of release but not the diffusion constant. The normalized k and Dm values for 2 /KClO 4 in NPOE/Accurel® 1 E-PP and NPOE/Celgard® 2500 are nearly the same. This means that the transport regime (diffusion or kinetic control) depends only on the tortuosity (¿) and thickness of the support, irrespective of its morphology...|$|R

50|$|Firstly, the glucose in the {{proximal}} tubule is <b>co-transported</b> with sodium ions into {{the proximal}} convoluted tubule walls via the SGLT2 cotransporter. Some (typically smaller) amino acids are also transported in this way. Once in the tubule wall, the glucose and amino acids diffuse {{directly into the}} blood capillaries along a concentration gradient. This blood is flowing, so the gradient is maintained. Lastly, sodium/potassium ion active transport pumps remove sodium from the tubule wall and the sodium is put back into the blood. This maintains a sodium concentration gradient in the proximal tubule lining, so the first step continues to happen.|$|R

40|$|Liver {{swelling}} {{caused by}} incubating hepatocytes in hypotonic media or with amino acids that are <b>co-transported</b> with sodium ion stimulates glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis, and inhibits proteolysis.

The signal transduction for glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis involves changes in ionic composition of the cells that follow cell swelling, and leads to the activation of glycogen synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-controlling enzymes in these pathways.
