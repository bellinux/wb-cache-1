40|$|Perhaps because I am {{a veteran}} of the “good old days” (they were really quite bad), young {{physicians}} who hope to become <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> often ask me how they might establish their careers. Many are more than a little worried about their futures and often have trouble envisioning a career path that is financially secure for themselves and their families. The grumbling of <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> a few years their senior enhances their angst. So I try to encourage these young physicians because I know the great intellectual (if not monetary) rewards of the field and because I know that the future of medicine absolutely depends on <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators.</b> The following is what I try to say to them...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to assess ESL {{clinical}} investigators’ learning needs for academic writing for English scholarly publication. We used a qualitative evaluation approach to examine {{the gap between the}} current and desired proficiency level for academic writing of seven ESL <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators.</b> We considered the perspectives of these seven ESL <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> and those of three mentors’ and three writing instructors’ in this assessment. The findings suggest that ESL <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> do not accurately perceive their writing deficiencies, have little knowledge of criteria for academic writing, and their prior experiences create passive attitudes toward seeking appropriate writing resources. Adequate time is especially needed to develop successful writing skills. We provide suggestions for program planners to develop academic writing services and present useful information for pedagogical practice by adult educators in higher and continuing professional education regarding ESL academic writing...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of treatments for degenerative spine conditions, where the primary symptom is back pain, is typically determined using patient-reported {{quality of life}} (QoL) measures. However, patients may adjust their internal standards when scoring QoL based on factors other than their health. This response shift phenomenon could confound the interpretation of study data and impact effectiveness conclusions. In the current study, response shift was examined using structural equation modeling (SEM) and previously collected clinical trial data comparing 2 minimally invasive medical devices in lumbar spinal stenosis patients through 1 year postintervention. In subject QoL results, reprioritization shift between 3 months and 12 months that could confound standard analysis was identified. Treatment group did not influence response shift identified at 12 months. SEM provided an effective and practical tool for <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> to assess response shift in available clinical study data. As response shift could lead to invalid conclusions when QoL measures are analyzed, <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> should include response shift assessment {{in the design of}} clinical trials. This research into how response shift phenomenon can impact clinical trial results improves the ability of <b>clinical</b> <b>investigators</b> to interpret <b>clinical</b> trial data, potentially preventing erroneous conclusions. This research may also assist researchers and government regulators in the identification and reimbursement of beneficial, cost-effective medical treatments for patients worldwide. For clinical research designers, this study demonstrates a practical application of response shift assessment...|$|R
