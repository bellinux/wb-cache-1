40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of photometric variations in L dwarfs {{has opened a}} discussion on {{the cause of the}} variations. We argue against the existence of magnetic spots in these atmospheres and favor the idea that non-uniform condensate coverage (i. e. clouds) is responsible for the variations. The magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) in the atmosphere of L dwarfs, which describes how well the gas couples with the magnetic field, is too small (<< 1) to support the formation of magnetic spots. In constrast silicate and iron clouds form in the photospheres of L dwarfs. Inhomogeneities in such cloud decks can plausibly produce the observed photometric variations. Further evidence in support of clouds is the tendency for variable L dwarfs to be bluer in J-Ks than the average L dwarf of a given spectral type. This color effect is expected if <b>clear</b> <b>holes</b> appear in an otherwise uniform cloud layer. Comment: submitted to ApJL, 13 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the characteristics of}} the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of a UV YAG laser-drilled hole in glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) printed circuit boards. The structures of the HAZ produced by different laser parameters were analyzed. When drilled with lower power and repetition rate, a <b>clear</b> <b>hole</b> wall with very little black charred material was obtained. On the other hand, when drilled with high power and repetition rate, matrix recession and fiber protrusion were observed, also a loose coating was found covering the protruded glass fibers. The results also show that for a given repetition rate, the size of the HAZ increases with increase in average laser power. As for the effect of the pulse repetition rate, a peak value of HAZ width is reached at about 7 kHz for each given laser power, and beyond which the HAZ width decreases. A novel evaluation parameter, defined as the quotient of total area of the HAZ and the profile length, is suggested to quantify the size of the laser-induced HAZ in fiber reinforced composites.

50|$|A sewer jetter is {{composed}} of a controlled high-pressure water source such as a pressure washer or reciprocating displacement pump, a flexible high-pressure line (called a jetter hose which connects the high-pressure engine to the mini-reel) of up to hundreds of metres (several hundred feet) in length, the Mini-Reel (a hose reel which can be taken {{a distance from the}} engine) and a nozzle that uses hydraulic force to pull the line into sewer drains, clean the sides of pipes, and flush out residue. High-pressure sewer jetters can be mounted on trolleys, inside vans or on trailers. The power of a Sewer Jetter ranges from 1000 psi up to 5000 psi. Sewer jetter nozzles come in different sizes and applications; a bullet-type nozzle with a streamlined profile can <b>clear</b> a <b>hole</b> for the larger root cutting nozzle. Root-cutter nozzles are designed to cut roots with a spinning nozzle that shoots a jet stream horizontally inside the pipe. 5000 psi sewer jetters with root-cutting nozzles can <b>clear</b> a <b>hole</b> through the center of a root-infested sewer line and with its rear-facing jet streams cut the roots and clean the pipe walls, flushing the root debris through the sewer line. The sewer jetter has been labeled as a technological advancement of the plumber's snake (also known as an electric eel) drain clearing method.|$|R

40|$|Although {{there has}} yet been no undisputed {{discovery}} of a still-forming planet embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, the <b>cleared</b> inner <b>holes</b> of transitional disks may be signposts of young planets. Here we show that the subset of accreting transitional disks with wide, optically thin inner holes of 15 AU or more can only be sculpted by multiple planets orbiting inside each hole. Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the origins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can <b>clear</b> wide inner <b>holes</b> where single planets open only narrow gaps. Second, the confined, non-axisymmetric accretion flows produced by multiple planets provide a way for an arbitrary amount of mass transfer to occur through an apparently optically thin hole without over-producing infrared excess flux. Rather than assuming the gas and dust in the hole are evenly and axisymmetrically distributed, one can construct an inner hole with apparently optically thin infrared fluxes by covering a macroscopic fraction of the hole's surface area with locally optically thick tidal tails. We also establish that other clearing mechanisms, such as photoevaporation, cannot explain our subset of accreting transitional disks with wide holes. Transitional disks are therefore high-value targets for observational searches for young planetary systems.

40|$|We re-examine {{the recent}} {{suggestion}} of a high fraction of transition discs (i. e. those with a <b>cleared</b> inner <b>hole)</b> in M stars, motivated {{by the fact that}} we expect that, for M stars, even discs without inner holes should exhibit very weak excess shortward of around 10 um. Our analysis of spectral energy distribution models suggest that this indeed means that M stars where a detectable excess begins at around 6 um may be mis-classified as transition discs when in fact they have optically thick dust extending in to the dust sublimation radius. Consequently, we estimate that the transition disc fraction among M stars in the Coronet cluster is ~ 15 +/- 10 % (rather than the recently claimed value of 50 %). This revised figure would imply that the transition disc fraction is not after all markedly higher in later type stars. We suggest that for M stars, transition discs can only be readily identified if they have emission that is close to photospheric out to > 10 um.

In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a search for such periodic accretion in the pre–main-sequence spectroscopic binary UZ Tau E. We present BV RI photometry spanning three years; we find that the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19. 16 ± 0. 04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19. 13 days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than half the binary orbital period. The variability of the Hα line is not as clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component is not ruled out.
