25|$|Since the ACU {{is being}} {{considered}} to be a precursor to a common currency in the future, it has a dynamic outlook of the region. The overall goal of a common currency is to contribute to the financial stability of a regional economy, including price stability. It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of <b>currency</b> <b>risk</b> for the members of the monetary union. Greater flows of intra-regional trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling within the union, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders. However, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of macroeconomic conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Intra-ASEAN trade is growing, {{partly as a result of}} the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to a stockbroker, a {{professional}} who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller, {{and gets a}} guaranteed commission for every deal executed, {{a professional}} trader may have a steep learning curve and his/her ultra-competitive performance based career may be cut short, especially during generalized stock market crashes. Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of fiscal obligations must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these fiscal obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, <b>currency</b> <b>risk,</b> financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} interest rate policy in a small open economy subject to terms of trade shocks, and time-varying <b>currency</b> <b>risks.</b> The private sector makes optimal decisions in an intertemporal non-linear setting with rational, forward-looking expectations. In contrast, the monetary authority practices "least-squares learning" about the evolution of inflation, output growth, and exchange rate depreciation in alternative policy scenarios. Interest rates are set by linear quadratic optimization, with the objectives for inflation, output growth, or depreciation depending on current conditions. The simulation {{results show that the}} prefered stance is one which targets inflation only. Including other targets such as growth and exchange rate changes significantly increases output variability, and unambiguously decreases welfare. <b>Currency</b> <b>risks,</b> learning, parameterized expectations, policy targets...|$|R

In the second chapter, I explain how firms create their assumptions about future exchange rates. I also run a Monte Carlo analysis on historical data and come with predictions of my own. In the third chapter, I am discussing the relevance of using VaR models for estimating the maximum possible loss of funds due to unwanted moves in the exchange rate. Furthermore, I describe various instruments usable for hedging of currency exposure including forwards, options, swaps and other derivatives.

As the dataset also includes the period of global financial crisis, we examine the issue of risk pricing in the full sample as well as in before and after global financial crisis periods. Unlike most existing studies, the empirical results presented in this paper are based on (i) the Quasi Maximum Likelihood Estimation (QMLE) based multivariate GARCH-in-Mean specification and (ii) the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) techniques. Our empirical analysis based on weekly data on 58 largest Canadian firms indicates that the currency as well as the local and the world market risks are priced in the Canadian equity market. This result holds for all exchange currency rates proxies and in all sample periods. We find that the price of the world market, the local market and the <b>currency</b> <b>risks</b> is time-varying and the Canadian equity market is partially segmented...|$|R
