50|$|German-American {{psychoanalyst}} Erich Fromm {{was influenced}} by Freudian ideologies when {{coming up with the}} theory of <b>character</b> <b>orientation.</b> The basis of <b>character</b> <b>orientation</b> comes from Freud who said that character traits underlie behavior and that they must be inferred from it. These character traits can be powerful forces which are totally unconscious to the person. Fromm along with Freud believed that the most important aspect in one's character was not a single character trait, but rather, the total character organization from where many single character traits follow. These character traits can be understood as a syndrome resulting from a particular <b>character</b> <b>orientation.</b> In other words, the character of any given person is a blend of all, or some of the orientations, but where one is more predominant.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel method for detecting text in outdoor scenes, having different background, instead of perfect scanned documents. This bottom-up approach based on local {{principal component analysis}} identifies the layout structure of a document. A new method for segmenting text is proposed that is more robust against changes in the lighting conditions than standard approaches. Text written on white or black boards can be segmented as good as text in printed documents. To focus and illuminate all areas of an image that contains necessary information taking only one image is not always sufficient. Therefore a new algorithm is proposed for fusioning multi-exposure images of text documents based on edge intensities. The recognition rate of an OCR-engine {{is used as a}} benchmark to quantify the results. Experiments show that the current method delivers significant better results than standard methods. After layout detection warped text blocks are deskewed with respect to the local <b>character</b> <b>orientation</b> as the text blocks are not always justified. Each line of the text is segmented adaptively. To solve the vice-versa problem of the document orientation one can apply SITT features that identify dot like components in texts...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} on-line {{handwriting recognition}} of Japanese characters, mixture of ideographic characters (Kanji) of Chinese origin and phonetic characters made from them. Most of Kanji character patterns {{are composed of}} multiple subpatterns called radicals which are shared among many (sometimes hundreds of) Kanji character patterns. This is common is Oriental languages of Chinese origin, i. e., Chinese, Korean and Japanese. It is also common that each has thousands of characters. Due to these characteristics, structured character pattern representation (SCPR) composed of subpatterns is effective {{in terms of the}} size reduction of a prototype dictionary (a set of prototype patterns) and the robustness to deformation of common subpatterns. In this paper, we show a prototype learning algorithm and HMM-based recognition for SCPR. Then, we combine the SCPR-based on-line recognizer with a compact off-line recognizer employing quadratic discriminant functions. Moreover, we also discuss on-line handwritten Japanese text recognition and propose <b>character</b> <b>orientation</b> free and line direction free handwritten text recognition and segmentation. Finally, as applications of on-line handwritten Japanese text recognition, we show segmentation of mixed objects of text, formulas, tables and line-drawings and handwritten text search. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{touching}} character segmentation problem becomes complex when touching strings are multi-oriented. Moreover in graphical documents sometimes {{characters in}} a single-touching string have different orientations. Segmentation of such complex touching is more challenging. In this paper, we present a scheme towards the segmentation of English multi-oriented touching strings into individual characters. When two or more characters touch, they generate a big cavity region in the background portion. Based on the convex hull information, at first, we use this background information to find some initial points for segmentation of a touching string into possible primitives (a primitive consists of a single character or part of a character). Next, the primitives are merged to get optimum segmentation. A dynamic programming algorithm is applied for this purpose using the total likelihood of characters as the objective function. A SVM classifier is used to find {{the likelihood of a}} character.

40|$|Flanked {{objects are}} {{difficult}} to identify using peripheral vision. This is visual crowding. Crowding is the perceptual bottleneck for reading (Pelli et al., 2007) and object recognition (Pelli & Tillman, 2008). Theories for crowding had been suggested, but the underlying neural mechanism remained unclear. Some perceptual manipulations had been shown to break crowding, hinting the cortical locus of crowding. In {{the first part of}} the current study, we ask whether illusory contour formation survives crowding of illusion inducers. We measured the contrast thresholds for discriminating the rotation angle of a target Kanizsa inducer with and without flankers. When the other three Kanizsa inducers were rotated to misalign with the target, we observed strong crowding indicated through contrast threshold elevation. Interestingly, however, subjects were able to judge the shape (thin vs. fat) of the illusory Kanizsa square even when the individual inducers were flanked. Internal representation of the percept in the inducer-aligned condition was further studied through the classification image technique. Classification images indicated that illusory contours were formed and used in the perceptual decision task in both the non-flanked and flanked conditions. These findings suggest that crowding happens after illusory contour formation. In the second part, we ask if Chinese <b>character</b> <b>orientation</b> affects crowding. Fifty commonly used traditional Chinese characters were selected as stimuli. We measured the contrast threshold for identifying upright and inverted target surrounded by either upright or inverted flankers. At 5 ? eccentricity, we observed an interaction effect between target and flanker orientation on crowding: upright flankers produced a stronger crowding effect than inverted flankers for inverted but not upright target. Follow-up experiments showed that the observation was not due to a rise of detection sensitivity for upright flankers or a change of spatial extent between upright and inverted target. Yet, adding an enclosure to flankers eliminated the flanker orientation effect, suggesting that the flanker orientation effect may be attributed to the facilitation of texture perception in the periphery. At 10 ? eccentricity, upright target was generally more immune from crowding, further supporting that crowding takes place after Chinese <b>character</b> <b>orientation</b> has been coded. From previous fMRI studies, we know that lateral occipital complex (LOC) is the cortical site that first responds to Kanizsa?s illusory contours (Murray et al., 2002) and the fusiform gyrus is sensitive to the inversion of Chinese character (Kao, Chen, & Chen, 2009). Taken together with our findings, we infer that crowding happens at or after the two cortical locations. published_or_final_versionPsychologyMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

40|$|Crowding {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} that the visual performance to a visual target deteriorates {{with the presence of}} nearby flankers. To investigate the mechanisms underlying crowding in object perception, we used Chinese characters as stimuli such that we can estimated the role of grouping and familiarity. The target was presented at 6 deg from the fixation. The flankers were placed to both sides of the target with a 1. 5 deg center-to-center distance. The target and the flankers were either upright or inverted characters. When the target and the flankers were iso-orientation, in half of the trials, they might be combined into a compound character. The task of the observer was to decide whether the target is upright or inverted. Compared with the no flanker condition, the presence of the flankers reduced the percentage of correct response (accuracy) regardless of the character type or orientation. The accuracy for the iso-orientation conditions was always higher than that for the aniso-orientation conditions. The result is the same regardless whether the target and the flankers can be grouped into a compound word, hence cannot be explained by the word superior effect. Our result suggests two types of flanker effects: The first is a general crowding effect that reduces the visibility of the target whenever a flanker is presented and may result from an early visual mechanism. The second is specific to <b>character</b> <b>orientation</b> and thus should be mediated by a mechanism that tuned to visual word forms...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: More {{detailed}} {{acquaintance with}} specialist endodontic literature and treating complicated endodontic cases {{have revealed that}} the palatal root canal in maxillary first molars has different features from generally accepted simplicity. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the number, orientation and shape of the curvature of the palatal root canal in maxillary first molars, characteristics that may have great influence on the procedure and outcome of endodontic therapy. Materials and methods: Material consisted of 100 left and 100 right extracted human first maxillary molars. Extended access cavity was prepared, and canal orifices were detected using an endodontic probe. K-flex file no 15 or 20 was then introduced into the palatal root canal until the tip appeared at the apical foramen. The tooth was radiographed from buccal-oral (clinical) and mesial-distal (proximal) aspect under standardized conditions. On magnified images, the number and character of canal, orientation and shape of the curvature were determined. Results: One palatal root canal was found in each of 200 teeth. From the clinical projection, 60 % of the palatal canals appeared curved and from the proximal 93. 5 % (p< 0. 05). Out of 120 curved canals from the clinical aspect, 66. 7 % were oriented distally and 33. 3 % mesially. From the proximal projection, of 187 curved canals 68, 4 % were oriented buccally, and 31, 6 % palatally. From the clinical projection, 49. 2 % were C-shaped, and 32. 5 % with the J-shaped curvature. Only 18. 3 % of the palatal canals were with the S-shaped curvature (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Upon presented results, practitioners may predict with high significance the <b>character,</b> <b>orientation</b> and curvature shape of the palatal root canal in maxillary first molars in the buccal-oral dimension which is not visible on clinical radiographs and, therefore, perform more successful endodontic treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of place {{has always been}} a key issue of inquiry throughout theoretical discourse in relation to architecture and urban planning. To comprehend such a phenomenon, one must begin to understand how to concretize the factors {{that can be used to}} create such a meaningful environment. With respect to such a topic, what becomes of interest are the four primary elements that come together to illustrate how the structure and spirit of place are defined. Space, <b>character,</b> <b>orientation,</b> and identification are the elements that begin to provide such a definition. Ever since the end of the Second World War, American development patterns have been unaccommodating in an effort to cultivate place within our society. The trends in mainstream suburban retail and residential development along with unorganized zoning practices have all but ceased this phenomenon from occurring. Such behavior has taken the once genuine, collective, unifying concept of the main-street, and has splintered it into independent development patterns which are disorganized and disjointed. In light of this plaguing issue, suburban communities in today 2 ̆ 7 s society lack elements that foster identity and character, therefore stifling place from being created. This thesis will begin by exploring the place theory according to Christian Norberg-Schulz, providing an understanding of how the primary elements of place culminate to define its spirit and structure, and the study of the types of neighborhoods that possess and lack a sense of place and the means by which they do so. These efforts will ultimately work to establish a framework on how a sense of place can be reintroduced within today 2 ̆ 7 s society. The findings of this thesis will ultimately culminate in a project which will bring together prominent, fragmented developments that currently sit in a disorganized and disoriented portion of Tampa. Such developments have been burdened by isolation rather than be welcomed through integration. The vehicle used to unify these fragments will be a communal and shared place of transition, also known as an integrated district center, designed to accommodate those who reside, commute, and visit. This center will also work to illustrate the area as a defined place. It is only by means of coming in contact with methods that define and curtail place to seek the way in which it needs to be restored. In doing so, society shall grant a person pride to reside, reason to commute, and interest to visit...|$|E
