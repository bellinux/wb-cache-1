Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.|$|E

An example is ferroelectric materials, where the change from a paraelectric to a ferroelectric state occurs at the <b>Curie</b> <b>temperature</b> and is related to a change from the high-symmetry paraelectric state to the lower symmetry ferroelectric state, accompanied by a so-called soft phonon mode, a vibrational lattice mode that goes to zero frequency at the transition.|$|E

40|$|New {{magnetic}} materials with high <b>Curie</b> <b>temperatures</b> for spintronic applications are perpetually sought for. In this paper, we present an ab initio {{study of the}} structural, electronic and magnetic properties of Quaternary Heusler compounds CoX'Y'Si where X' is a transition metal with 4 d electrons and Y' is either Fe or Mn. We find five new half-metallic ferromagnets with spin polarisation nearly 100 % with very high <b>Curie</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The variation of <b>Curie</b> <b>temperatures</b> {{as a function of}} valence electrons can be understood from the calculated inter-atomic exchange interaction parameters. We also identify a few other compounds, which could be potential half-metals with suitable application of pressure or with controlled doping. Our results reveal that the half-metallicity in these compounds is intricately related to the arrangements of the magnetic atoms in the Heusler lattice and hence, the interatomic exchange interactions between the moments. The trends in the atomic arrangements, total and local magnetic moments, interatomic magnetic exchange interactions and <b>Curie</b> <b>temperatures</b> are discussed with fundamental insights...|$|R

25|$|If {{there is}} {{sufficient}} energy exchange between neighbouring dipoles they will interact, and may spontaneously align or anti-align and form magnetic domains, resulting in ferromagnetism (permanent magnets) or antiferromagnetism, respectively.

25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} a-hematite {{was the subject}} of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a <b>Curie</b> <b>temperature</b> of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 µB). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause canting of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy. The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the hematite nanoparticles, and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. Hematite is part of a complex solid solution oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties. Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.|$|E

500|$|As {{molten iron}} cools past its {{freezing}} point of 1538°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite. At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the <b>Curie</b> <b>temperature</b> there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E
