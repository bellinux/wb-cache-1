40|$|In a {{study of}} the {{ambulance}} service to an outpatient physiotherapy centre in an urban area over half of the palients were aged over 65, a quarter made at least three visits to the centre weekly, and the average travel and waiting times for all patients was about two-and-a-half hours. There was a direct relation between distance from home to the centre and travelling time for morning but not afternoon attenders. A second survey after some <b>changes</b> in the <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> showed some relatively small reductions in overall travelling and waiting time. It is concluded that even under favourable conditions an important side effect of outpatient physiotherapy is the probable fatigue and anxiety generated by ambulance travel...|$|R

40|$|The {{twentieth century}} has seen an {{increasing}} use of products of the nuclear industry in medical and engineering fields, scientific research and for the generation of electricity. Such uses require effective <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the varied radioactive and fissile materials involved. Throughout its development the nuclear industry has recognized that <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> must be such as to ensure safety of persons, property and the environment. Accordingly, controls have been developed by organizations involved in the various modes of transport. Prior to 1959, the various national and international controls were, in the main, based on the United States Interstate Commerce Commission regulations which essentially aimed to facilitate the movement of radioactive ores and concentrates and packages containing relatively small amounts of radionuclides for medical and industrial use. The rapid expansion of the nuclear industry then foreseen required that these early regulations be further developed so as to facilitate the safe movement of all kinds and quantities of radioactive materials...|$|R

40|$|A mass {{separator}} at the INEL {{has been}} successfully coupled on-line to a source of /sup 252 /Cf fission products via a He-gas jet <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement</b> using solid aerosols of NaCl as activity carriers. Initial tests of the ISOL system on-line to an approximately 7 mu g /sup 252 /Cf source are conducted using gamma-ray spectroscopic measurements of the separated /sup 138, 139 /Cs, /sup 141, 142 /Ba and /sup 142 /La activities. The measured transport efficiencies through the system of approximately 3 % and approximately 0. 3 % for the Cs and Ba isotopes, respectively, are comparable {{with the results of}} earlier tests conducted at INEL with a hollow-cathode ion source alone coupled to the He-gas jet <b>transport</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Following these tests, a general survey of the mass-separated activities is conducted with the ISOL system on-line to an approximately 600 mu g source of /sup 252 /Cf. Gross beta - gamma activity is measured for samples collected at 73 mass positions. Gamma-ray spectra are measured with a Ge(Li) detector for 29 of the mass positions. (5 refs) ...|$|R
5000|$|Preliminary {{investigations}} {{found that}} Sakthivel, while intoxicated, attempted {{to board the}} private bus, which {{was believed to be}} ferrying foreign workers to the Avery Lodge dormitory. The bus driver requested assistance from a female time-keeper, who was from the Singapore School Transport Association and was responsible for handling <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements,</b> to get Sakthivel to alight, as the latter was causing trouble. [...] The accident occurred shortly after Sakthivel alighted from the bus.|$|R

However it has not proved easy to ensure that the TransJakarta bus system works well so the arrangements are currently regarded as being of mixed success.|$|R

5000|$|When the <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{had been}} finalised, several {{operations}} staged {{out of the}} Z Experimental Station, including the famous Operation Jaywick raid into Singapore Harbour. This was due to Cairns' proximity to the islands in the South West Pacific Area. The Jaywick party departed Cairns near midnight 9 August 1943 in the MV Krait and sailed along the northern coast before reaching Potshot in North Western Australia which was the departure point for the Jaywick mission.|$|R
5000|$|The Wehrmacht was {{not content}} with the gun's performance: [...] "It was felt to be {{wasteful}} of time and manpower, the <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> were cumbersome and the performance was {{not considered to be}} commensurate with the size of weapon." [...] These led to experiments by Krupp and Rheinmetall to extend the range. These included [...] "pre-grooved" [...] projectiles which showed no significant improvement, squeeze-bore, discarding sabot and even a smoothbore version. None of these reached beyond the experimental stage.|$|R
25|$|Until 1916, <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the BEF {{were based}} on an {{assumption}} that the war of movement would soon resume and make it pointless to build infrastructure, since it would be left behind. The British relied on motor transport from railheads which was insufficient where large masses of men and guns were concentrated. When the Fourth Army advance resumed in August, the wisdom of not building light railways which would be left behind was argued by some, in favour of building standard gauge lines.|$|R
40|$|India was {{a rather}} {{marginal}} participant in world trade {{during the early years}} after independence. Since 1980, however, the structure and orientation of Indian export trades have undergone fundamental changes. Substantial {{progress has been made in}} diversifying the export base - manufactured goods have increased and the traditional bulk sector has shrunk. Key targets for the export of manufactured goods are the European, Japanese and North American markets. However, these markets are characterized by increasingly efficient trade logistics, including containerization and multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements.</b> To enable further trade growth, India is confronted with a need to tie into the highly organized international trade logistics networks, something the country is totally unprepared to cope with in terms of demanding logistical arrangements. There is a real danger that India's trade performance will deteriorate, if no corrective measures are taken. A highly fragmented service industry, outdated regulations, heavy Government control, a constrained private sector, and largely inadequate infrastructure have curtailed efforts to improve trade logistics, including containerization and multimodal <b>transport</b> <b>arrangements</b> in India. Major reforms are called for so that an effective framework for initiating urgently required system adjustments can be established.

The cream shed at Lagoon Pocket was removed in 1965 and at Dawn in 1968. In 1963 Dagun's cream shed was incorporated into the north corner of the goods sheds (erected 1938).
