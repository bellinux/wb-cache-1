5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are found}} in nature and are also {{designed}} and produced as part of pharmacology and biochemistry. Natural poisons are often enzyme inhibitors that have evolved to defend a plant or animal against predators. These natural toxins include {{some of the most}} poisonous compounds known. Artificial inhibitors are often used as drugs, but can also be insecticides such as malathion, herbicides such as glyphosate, or disinfectants such as triclosan. Other artificial enzyme inhibitors block acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which breaks down acetylcholine, and are used as nerve agents in <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{headed the}} Boston Psychopathic Hospital {{when it opened}} in 1912, {{pioneering}} the study of brain pathology with particular interests in shell shock and schizophrenia. Southard published several books, including Shell Shock and Other Neuropsychiatric Problems with nearly 1,000 case histories. He was president of the American Medico-Psychological Association and the Boston Society of Psychiatry and Neurology, and held advisory positions with the U.S. <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> Service and the Eugenics Record Office.|$|E

5|$|However it was {{not until}} the Wujing Zongyao that the exact {{chemical}} formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed. The Wujing Zongyao contains three formulas for gunpowder: one for an explosive bomb launched from a trebuchet, another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 1934, McClelland {{was given}} command of Rockwell Field and Rockwell Air Depot. In 1935 {{he began a}} series of courses, which saw him {{graduate}} from the Air Corps Tactical School, the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> School and the Command and General Staff School. In 1937 he became inspector for the General Headquarters Staff School. In 1937 he became inspector for the General Headquarters Air Force at Langley Field, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Nasal {{imagery and}} {{references}} appear in his music and lyrics, {{as well as}} in the collage album covers created by his long-time collaborator Cal Schenkel. Zappa believed his childhood diseases might have been due to exposure to mustard gas, released by the nearby <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> facility. His health worsened when he lived in Baltimore. In 1952, his family relocated for reasons of health. They next moved to Monterey, California, where his father taught metallurgy at the Naval Postgraduate School. They soon moved to Claremont, California, then to El Cajon, before finally settling in San Diego.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare.</b> In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Smyth {{worked in}} the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> Service and at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. After earning his second Ph.D., he {{returned}} to Princeton {{for the last year}} of his NRC fellowship. During his early years on the Princeton faculty he lived in the Graduate College west of the main campus. He was appointed an instructor in 1924, an assistant professor in 1925, an associate professor in 1929, and a full professor in 1936. In 1935 he became chairman of the Department of Physics, a position he held until 1949. During 1931–32 he was a Guggenheim Fellow at the University of Göttingen, where he studied the spectra of triatomic molecules, particularly carbon dioxide, with James Franck.|$|E

5|$|Frank, {{the eldest}} of four children, was raised in an Italian-American {{household}} where Italian was often spoken by his grandparents. The family moved often because his father, a chemist and mathematician, worked in the defense industry. After a time in Florida in the 1940s, the family returned to Maryland, where Zappa's father worked at the Edgewood Arsenal <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> facility of the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Due to their home's proximity to the arsenal, which stored mustard gas, gas masks were kept in the home {{in case of an}} accident. This {{had a profound effect on}} Zappa, and references to germs, germ warfare and the defense industry occur throughout his work.|$|E
5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in readiness, but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E
5|$|Jacob is {{approached}} by a distressed Michael Newman, the man who treated his wound in a medevac helicopter in Vietnam and who dragged him away from Paul’s burning car. Newman tells a story of having been a chemist with the Army’s <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> division in Saigon. He designed “the Ladder”, a drug that massively increased aggression, taking people straight to their most primal urges. To test its effectiveness, a dose was secretly given to Jacob’s unit – causing them to turn on {{each other in a}} homicidal frenzy. The revelation causes Jacob to fully remember the moment he was attacked in Vietnam, where it is revealed that a fellow American soldier bayoneted him.|$|E

Thompson financed the purchase of the island through the sale of his valuable stamp collection and later built a home on it from native stone and driftwood. During his proprietorship of the remote island, Thompson used it to entertain friends and guests from the nearby Friday Harbor Laboratories. In one summer alone he received more than 700 visitors.|$|E
5|$|The Alsos Mission to Italy {{questioned}} {{staff of}} the physics laboratory at the University of Rome following the capture {{of the city in}} June 1944. Meanwhile, Pash formed a combined British and American Alsos mission in London under the command of Captain Horace K. Calvert to participate in Operation Overlord. Groves considered the risk that the Germans might attempt to disrupt the Normandy landings with radioactive poisons was sufficient to warn General Dwight D. Eisenhower and send an officer to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith. Under the codename Operation Peppermint, special equipment was prepared and <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> Service teams were trained in its use.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or blackening of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority.

5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many processes in the chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous <b>chemical</b> <b>warfare</b> agent.|$|E
5|$|Following these appointments, Dean {{attended}} the US Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas before being {{assigned to a}} post on Oahu, Hawaii for two years. Following this stint, Dean {{attended the}} Armed Forces Industrial College at Fort McNair, Washington D.C. and then the field officer's course at the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> school in the United States Army War College at Carlisle Barracks. Dean was promoted to captain in 1936, and major in 1940. Upon this promotion, Dean was assigned to Washington D.C. on the United States Department of War on the General Staff, first as a junior member, then as assistant secretary, then as executive officer in the Requirement Division of the Ground Forces Headquarters, a department concerned with the acquisition of new weapons and electronics, and training literature.|$|E
5|$|Rixey went 22–10 in 1916 with a 1.85ERA and {{a career}} high of 134strikeouts. On June 29, Rixey pitched a four-hit shutout against the New York Giants, facing the minimum 27batters, because of three double plays, and a player caught stealing. In 1917, despite having a 2.27 earned run average, Rixey {{led the league in}} {{pitching}} losses with 21. He also handled 108chances without a single error. Rixey hated losing and was known for destroying the team locker room, or disappearing {{for days at a time}} after a loss. He missed the 1918 season to serve in the <b>Chemical</b> <b>Warfare</b> Division of the United States army during the war effort. He struggled upon returning to baseball, going 6–12 with a 3.97earned run average in 1919, and again leading the league in losses with 22 in 1920. Prior to the 1920 season, rumours circulated that his former manager, Pat Moran, now with the Cincinnati Reds, was interested in trading for Rixey. The relationship between Rixey and manager Gavvy Cravath was never good, and Cravath had made known his desire to trade him; however, he stayed with the Phillies that season, working on his delivery with former pitcher Jesse Tannehill, who, Rixey admitted, helped with his pitching delivery.|$|E
