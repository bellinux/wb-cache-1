5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the top and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E
5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. It {{is written in}} the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a language that is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the pre-migration era.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 2012, UBS {{announced}} that it was cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide in an effort to slim down its investment banking operations, of which 2,500 would be in Switzerland, followed by the United States and Great Britain. This 15-percent staff cut would make overall staff count <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> 63,745 to 54,000. (For comparison, the peak employment level in 2007 before the 2008 financial crisis was 83,500.) UBS also {{announced that}} the investment bank would focus on its traditional strengths and exit much of its fixed income trading business that was not economically profitable.|$|E

5|$|The Foehls knew {{many in the}} Hollywood film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel. In late December 1957, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood celebrated their wedding {{reception}} at the hotel. Bette Davis, Roy Rogers, Bing Crosby, Frankie Avalon, Humphrey Bogart, Betty Grable, Janet Leigh, Marilyn Monroe, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and Tony Curtis were known to have stayed there. Sometimes late at night, Jimmy Durante would <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> his room to play the piano in the lounge for other sleepless guests. The Foehls ran the hotel very closely—they lived on the premises.|$|E
5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and seized a third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns {{in the first two}} captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October 1469, Henry Percy {{had taken}} his oath of fealty to the King, and had been {{released}} from the Tower. The following year saw the return of Robin of Redesdale and another rebellion on behalf of Warwick. Montagu was forced to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> the Scottish border to suppress it; this he did, but, one historian has suggested, albeit that he 'allowed the leaders to escape... ensuring that the rebellion could rise again' at a more opportune moment. Almost immediately, Montagu was forced to crush another rebellion, this time lead by a Robin of Holderness, but calling {{for the return of}} Percy to the Northumberland Earldom. The Redesdale rebels soon reformed into an army big enough to march south and defeat a royal force at the Battle of Edgecote Moor on 26 July 1469. King Edward still accepted that Montagu was uninvolved in his brother's rebellion, and in the event, Montagu was the only Neville to accompany the king on his journey from the north back to London.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{unemployment}} rate in the city has <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> 36% in 1992 to 22.6% in 2006.

25|$|Over 300 kachinas {{were present}} in the worship and the Zia held {{religious}} festivals and ceremonies in which they asked the Kachinas to bring rain and make their crops grow.

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else.

The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E

In 2008, however, a repatriation agreement between the Thai and Lao governments resulted in a mass forced deportation of the people in these camps, and reports of atrocities committed against them by the Lao military spurred activist groups to try and persuade the Thai government to keep granting asylum to the refugees, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|In 1802, Johann Nikolaus Forkel {{published}} Ueber Johann Sebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke, {{the first}} {{biography of the}} composer, which contributed to the composer becoming known to a wider public. In 1805, Abraham Mendelssohn, who had married one of Itzig's granddaughters, bought a substantial collection of Bach manuscripts that had <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>from</b> C.P.E.Bach, and donated it to the Berlin Sing-Akademie. The Sing-Akademie occasionally performed Bach's works in public concerts, for instance his first keyboard concerto, with Sara Itzig Levy at the piano.|$|E
