50|$|Cross-dock {{operations}} were first pioneered in the US trucking {{industry in the}} 1930s, and have been in continuous use in less-than-truckload (LTL) operations ever since.

50|$|In the LTL {{trucking}} industry, <b>cross-docking</b> is done {{by moving}} cargo from one transport vehicle directly onto another, with minimal or no warehousing. In retail practice, <b>cross-docking</b> operations may utilize staging areas where inbound materials are sorted, consolidated, and stored until the outbound shipment is complete and ready to ship.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cross-docking</b> is a {{practice}} in logistics of unloading materials from an incoming semi-trailer truck or railroad car and loading these materials directly into outbound trucks, trailers, or rail cars, {{with little or}} no storage in between.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated <b>cross-dock</b> door assignment and vehicle rout-ing problem arising {{in the operation}} of <b>cross-dock</b> terminals in the parcel de-livery and retail industries. It consists in assigning origins to inbound doors, transferring commodities between doors, and routing vehicles from outbound doors to destinations. The objective is to minimize the total material handling and transportation costs. Two formulations of the problem are presented and computationally compared. Further, we introduce several heuristics with the purpose of finding good quality solutions of the problem quickly. Numerical re-sults on a set of benchmark instances with up to 20 origins and 50 destinations confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithms...|$|R
30|$|Equation (1) {{minimizes}} the total transportation cost {{and the cost}} of deviation from customer satisfaction time windows. Constraints (2) and (3) ensure that each truck visits each node once and each node is visited by one truck for pickup and delivery process, respectively. Constraints (4) and (5) imply that each inbound truck must start from the <b>cross-dock</b> and each outbound truck must start from the <b>cross-dock.</b> In addition all of the trucks must be utilized. Constraints (6) and (7) ensure that vehicles will return to the <b>cross-dock</b> {{at the end of their}} tours. Constraints (8) and (9) ensure that the total volume of transported products by inbound and outbound trucks must not exceed their capacity. Constraints (10) and (11) indicate the routs continuity, i.e., for each node if a truck travels from node i to node j it must leave node j for both pickup and delivery tours. Constraints (12) and (13) determine the traveling time between two nodes if they are traveled consecutively by the same truck. Constraint (14) implies that trucks must visit nodes within their hard time windows. Constraints (15) and (16) compute the deviation from customer satisfaction time windows. Consolidation decisions are determined by constraints (17) and (18). According to these constraints: if products are picked up from supplier i by truck k and delivered to its corresponding customer i + n, loading and unloading is not necessary and products remain into the truck; if products are picked up from supplier i by truck k but are not delivered to its corresponding customer i + n, products must be unloaded at the receiving doors of the cross-dock; if products are not picked up from supplier i by truck k but must be delivered to its corresponding customer i + n by that truck, products must be reloaded to truck k at shipping door of the <b>cross-dock.</b> Constraint (19) implies that truck k has a loading/unloading process or not. Constraint (20) calculates total loading/unloading time in the <b>cross-dock</b> for each vehicle. Constraints (21)–(23) imply that reloading process should be started after completing of unloading process of all products. Constraints (24) and (25) are similar to (19) and (20) for the reloading process.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{elucidate}} the spatial structure of ‘‘Just-in-Time’’ (JIT) -based logistics for the distribution of automotiveparts in Japan. A diverse range of opinions on spatial structure have been presented in economic geography in the West: namely the waysin which implementing JIT causes the locations of parts suppliers to become concentrated or dispersed; and the things which can be consideredas contributing factors in such concentrations or dispersals. In response to this, the authors of this paper decided to carefullyclarify the reality of such logistics in Japan by considering case examples of certain automotive parts suppliers which have implementedJIT from early on despite being located far from their respective car assembly plants. The authors will also shed light on the fact that, inorder to accommodate distribution from remote locations, <b>cross-docks</b> operated by third-party logistics providers (3 PL) are located nearcar assembly plants, and will seek to further clarify the functions of these <b>cross-docks.</b> This analysis has also enabled new insights to begained: concentrations of suppliers such as in Toyota City are exceptions to the norm, and that instead suppliers tend to be dispersedover a wide area in Japan; even in JIT-based logistics, economies of scale are being pursued and inventories are being stored; and indeliveries to car assembly plants 3 PL <b>cross-docks</b> are performing an important function in making small-lot, high-frequency deliveries...|$|R

5000|$|A {{distribution}} center {{for a set}} of products is a warehouse or other specialized building, often with refrigeration or air conditioning, which is stocked with products (goods) to be redistributed to retailers, to wholesalers, or directly to consumers.

A distribution center can also be called a warehouse, a DC, a fulfillment center, a <b>cross-dock</b> facility, a bulk break center, and a package handling center. The name by which the distribution center is known is commonly based on the purpose of the operation. For example, a [...] "retail distribution center" [...] normally distributes goods to retail stores, an [...] "order fulfillment center" [...] commonly distributes goods directly to consumers, and a <b>cross-dock</b> facility stores little or no product but distributes goods to other destinations.|$|R
