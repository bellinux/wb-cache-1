The <b>Chipps</b> designed building remains as the office of The Morning Bulletin.|$|R

5|$|Eureka Stockade, 3 December – The Eureka Stockade on 3 December {{has had a}} {{long history}} as an {{alternative}} choice for Australia Day, having been proposed by The Bulletin in the 1880s. The Eureka uprising occurred in 1854 during the Victorian gold rush, and saw a failed rebellion by the miners against the Victorian colonial government. Although the rebellion was crushed, it led to significant reforms, and has been described as being the birthplace of Australian democracy. Supporters of the date have included senator Don <b>Chipp</b> and former Victorian Premier Steve Bracks. However, the idea has been opposed by both hard-left unions and right-wing nationalist groups, both of whom claim symbolic attachment to the event, and by some who see it as an essentially Victorian event.|$|E
5|$|Soon, all {{the bodies}} except that of Alexey, which was never found, had been recovered. Those {{of the last}} three to die—De Long, Ambler and Ah Sam—were some {{distance}} from the rest, where they had evidently attempted to set up a final camp on higher ground. Melville's party wrapped all the bodies in canvas, and carried them to a hill high enough to be safe from seasonal flooding. There they placed them in a large coffin improvised from driftwood, which they covered with rocks surmounted by a large wooden cross, inscribed with the names of the lost men. Melville's group left the site on April 7, 1882, then spent a further month in the delta, searching without success for signs of <b>Chipp</b> and his crew.|$|E

25|$|The {{grassroot}} support {{attracted by}} Chipp's leadership was measurable at the party's first electoral test at the 1977 federal election on 10 December, when 9.38 per {{cent of the}} total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required quota was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don <b>Chipp</b> (Vic) and Colin Mason (NSW).|$|E

25|$|On {{condition}} of anonymity, a doctor informed the first Royal Commission {{that he had}} been confidentially prescribing amphetamine to Captain Stevens prior to the collision. This was a legal drug at the time and was carried in RAN ships' medical lockers. Navy Minister Don <b>Chipp</b> has suggested this as an explanation for the contradictory impressions created in the minds of witnesses who reported on Captain Stevens' apparent state of health and demeanour prior to the collision. This evidence was only made public after both enquiries were completed.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Democrats were {{originally}} a centrist party, with most current policies based on social liberalism. Federally, {{the party was}} founded in 1977 from three different groups, all of which had split from the Liberal Party at different times: 1) the Liberal Movement, which had split from its parent over electoral reform; 2) the Australia Party, which had rebelled against Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, and 3) initial leader Don <b>Chipp,</b> who left the Liberal Party of Australia, citing dissatisfaction with the increasing underrepresentation of small-l liberals within the party.|$|E
25|$|Cellier's first {{appointments}} were as organist at All Saints' Church, Blackheath and as {{conductor of}} the Belfast Philharmonic Society (both in 1862).

In 1868 he returned to London as organist of St Alban's Church, Holborn. In January 1871, Cellier became the first conductor and music director at the Royal Court Theatre in London. From 1871 to 1875 he was conductor and music director at the Prince's Theatre, in Manchester.|$|E

25|$|The first Australian Democrats (AD) federal parliamentarian was Senator Janine Haines who filled Steele Hall's casual Senate vacancy for South Australia in 1977. Surprisingly, {{she was not}} a {{candidate}} when the party contested the 1977 federal elections after Don <b>Chipp</b> had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since 1969 and the Liberal Movement, in 1974 and 1975. The party's broad aim was to achieve a balance of power in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.|$|E
25|$|Sowada was {{assigned}} {{the role of}} spokesperson on industrial relations, and she controversially backed the Hawke government's move to enshrine the right to strike in legislation. While this stand earned her much praise from the trade union movement– in September, {{she became the first}} female politician and first Democrat to address the biennial congress of the Australian Council of Trade Unions– it also sparked a major clash with party founder Don <b>Chipp,</b> who threatened to resign from the party because of the direction the party was taking with Sowada in charge of industrial relations. When Coulter officially took over as leader in October, Sowada lost the industrial relations portfolio. Soon after, she crossed the floor to vote with the opposition Liberal Party against a move to ban political advertising during elections.|$|E

500|$|Despite its inaccuracies, the Beviss account had {{a strong}} {{influence}} over the story. For many years, both John <b>Chipp</b> Hamp and Geharty figured prominently in retellings of the massacre. According to several accounts, Hamp's son was also involved in spreading {{the story of his}} father's death, including the story of the head in the camp oven, and that {{he was the one who}} discovered the body. Geharty was also mentioned by a number of those that told the story, but again, there are serious questions about the accuracy of his statements. In 1932, a version of the story was told in The Advertiser in which a party of 200 bushmen drove a group of Aboriginal people to the cliffs, but there was possibly only one victim. The writer claimed he had been told this by Geharty. However, from 1926 onwards, most accounts of the massacre usually referred to the archival and newspaper record and noted that there was no evidence for a massacre on the scale of that claimed by Congreve, Beviss or John <b>Chipp</b> Hamp. In 1936, the historian James Dugald Somerville wrote a series of articles in the Port Lincoln Times regarding early settler life on the Eyre Peninsula, in which he concluded that [...] "it is a certainty that the Waterloo Bay 'massacre', as pictured by H.J.C. ,.. A. Beviss and others did not occur, and that the natives did not cut the head off Hamps' body and place it in the camp oven".|$|E
500|$|The entire crew of 33 {{was still}} {{together}} on Semenovsky Island. [...] The boats left the island {{early in the}} morning of September 12, in fair weather. [...] Thirteen men were with De Long in the large cutter, <b>Chipp</b> with seven others took the smaller cutter, while Melville and ten men sailed in the whaleboat. Danenhower, who outranked Melville, complained bitterly to De Long about being placed under the engineer's command, but De Long replied that Danenhower was unfit for duty, a view confirmed by Ambler. [...] De Long instructed that the boats should each aim for a point indicated as [...] "Cape Barkin" [...] on the Petermann map; if they became separated, and landed in different areas, the parties should [...] rendezvous at Bulun, a sizeable settlement about [...] from the coast.|$|E
500|$|In {{selecting}} his crew, De Long's {{priority was}} [...] men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose Lieutenant Charles <b>Chipp,</b> {{who had served}} {{with him on the}} Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William Nindemann, a [...] Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, [...] who had [...] many years' experience in whalers. [...] The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John Wilson Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.|$|E

Hegvold registered with the Board of Architects (Queensland) on 13 July 1933. From 1935-1938 Hegvold was employed as the manager of Tucker and Hall, Plasters and Tilers, Rockhampton. He opened his own architectural practice in 1938. In 1942, he was employed as an architect at the US Army Base Section 3 Rockhampton.
