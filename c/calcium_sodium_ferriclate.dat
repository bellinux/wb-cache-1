40|$|Background: <b>Calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> {{phosphosilicate}} is {{a recently}} introduced desensitizing agent which acts by occluding the dentinal tubules and also resists acid decalcification. This {{study was designed}} to assess the efficacy of a new toothpaste containing 5 % <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate for the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity and also compare it with 5 % potassium nitrate. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients with the chief complaint of dentinal hypersensitivity were enrolled and randomly divided into two groups. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were taken for water and air stimuli at baseline, 3 weeks after usage of the respective toothpaste, and 3 weeks after discontinuation of the respective toothpaste. Results: Both the groups showed reduction in hypersensitivity scores at 3 weeks and 6 weeks for air stimulus and cold water. The <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate group, however, showed significantly reduction in hypersensitivity compared to the potassium nitrate group at any time point for both measures of hypersensitivity. Conclusion: The 5 % <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate group showed immense reduction in dentinal hypersensitivity symptoms. The 5 % <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate showed prolonged effects even after discontinuation as compared to 5 % potassium nitrate, due to its dentinal tubular occlusion property...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Dentinal {{hypersensitivity}} is {{a commonly}} encountered problem with varied treatment options for its management. A {{large number of}} home use products have been tested and used {{for the management of}} dentinal hypersensitivity. This 8 week clinical trial investigates the temporal efficacy of commercially available <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate containing toothpaste in comparison to a potassium nitrate containing toothpaste. Methods: A total 20 subjects between the ages of 18 to 65 years were screened for a visual analogue score (VAS) for sensitivity of 5 or more by testing with a cold stimulus and randomly divided into test and positive control groups. Baseline sensitivity VAS scores to air evaporative stimulus were recorded for minimum two teeth. The subjects were prescribed respective dentifrices and revaluated for sensitivity scores at 2, 4 and 8 weeks. Results:The study demonstrated reduction in symptoms for all treatment groups from baseline to 2, 4 and 8 weeks. The <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate group showed a higher degree of effectiveness at reducing hypersensitivity to air evaporative stimulus at 2 weeks, than commercially available potassium nitrate. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in scores of subjects using the <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate toothpaste as compared to potassium nitrate at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Conclusion: <b>Calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate showed greater reduction in sensitivity compared to potassium nitrate at an earlier stage which is of high clinical value. However, based on the findings of the present study long term effects of <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate seem to be less promising than previously claimed...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} and compare the efficacy of three desensitizing dentifrices on dentinal hypersensitivity (DH) and salivary biochemical characteristics. Materials and Methods: A randomized, parallel arm, triple-blinded, clinical trial was conducted {{over a period of}} 12 weeks, with a total of three visits: baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. <b>Calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate, potassium nitrate and amine fluoride dentifrices were compared. A total of 68 subjects who satisfied the inclusion criteria were included and randomly divided into four groups. Visual analog scale scores for controlled air stimulus were used to assess dentinal sensitivity and salivary pH and buffering capacity were recorded at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Results: All groups showed a reduction in sensitivity scores at 6 and 12 weeks. The <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate group showed a higher degree of effectiveness in reducing DH than potassium nitrate, amine fluoride dentifrices, and placebo for sensitivity measures. Salivary pH of <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate group was more toward neutral, and the buffering capacity of the same group showed significant changes from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks compared to the other groups. Conclusion: The desensitizing toothpaste containing <b>calcium</b> <b>sodium</b> phosphosilicate was found to be more effective in reducing DH and showed improvement in salivary biochemical characteristics over a period of 12 weeks compared to others...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{investigation}} of the possibilities of direct determination of <b>calcium,</b> <b>sodium</b> and potassium in the commercial and kombucha-based fermented milk products by flame photometry.

The results showed that the differences between the values obtained for the different sample treatment were within the experimental error at the 95 % confidence level.
