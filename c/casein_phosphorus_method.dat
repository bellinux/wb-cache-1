40|$|This is {{to report}} the results of {{investigation}} {{on the process of}} milk secretion and the phosphorus metabolism in animal body, by considering the changes of concentration of the radio active phosphorus (P 32) in the blood and in the milk, as a function of time. The results are summarized as follows: Radioactive phosphorus was transferred to the blood at nearly the same time after subcutaneous injection of P 32 and the maximum radioactivity was encountered within 30 minutes, and thereafter the specific activity regressed gradually. There was a considerable amount of P 32 in urine at 2 hours after injection, but not in feces. P 32 was transferred to the milk soon after injection. The radioactivity of the milk reached the peak at about 3 hours after injection and the specific activity was higher than that of blood. It seems probable that the alveolus cells may absorb phosphorus selectively. The specific activity of the <b>casein</b> <b>phosphorus</b> was detected at 2 hours after injection. From this, it may besaid that the time of formation of the casein in the gland cells is estimated to be about 2 hours. The peak of specific activity of <b>casein</b> <b>phosphorus</b> preceded considerably that of the organic phosphorus of milk. This considerable delay in the organic milk phosphorus may arise from formation of phospholipid. So it seems probable that the formation of fat involves a longer delay than that of protein formation. 1. 皮下注射直後血液中には多量の放射性燐が吸収されるが, しかし骨格並びに組織中の燐との速かなる置換及び細胞間体液への拡散等により急激に血液中から減少する. 同時に体外排泄, 就中尿への排泄は早く, 注射数時間後の尿中にすでに放射性燐が存在した. 2.

A total dose of approximately 850 C/cm [2] was used to acquire the whole image series. This dose is still high compared to what is possible with TEM [11], but for STEM, it is 1 % of the dose previously used for sub-picometer precision on single-crystal samples and 19 % of the dose used for a few picometer precision on a Pt nanoparticle [8]. The 240 image series was NR-registered [8, 9] and averaged to increase image SNR and to remove all sizes of distortions introduced by instabilities of the electron probe and sample during image series acquisition.

Instabilityin the stannous chloride method was due to precipitation in the stan-nous chloride-hydrazineworking solution. The common SMA 12 / 60 (Technicon Corp.) <b>method</b> for inorganic <b>phosphorus</b> in serum has been the stannous chloride technique in which ammonium molybdate reacts with phosphate to form ammonium molybdiphosphate, which is reduced by stannous chloride to molybdenum blue, under conditions that do not cause reduction of the excess molybdate pres-ent.

With {{the addition of the}} phosphorus extract into a colorimeter, there is visual color change of the solution and the degree to this color change is an indicator of phosphorus concentration. To apply this testing <b>method</b> on <b>phosphorus</b> deficiency, the measured phosphorus concentration must be compared to known values.

This allows rapid analysis of river, lake and groundwater samples from a range of environments for total nitrogen and <b>phosphorus.</b> The <b>method</b> was evaluated using a range of organic nitrogen and phosphorus structures tested at low, mid and high range concentrations from 2 to 50 mg l- 1 nitrogen and 0. 2 to 10 mg l- 1 phosphorus. Mean recoveries for nitrogen ranged from 94. 5 % (2 mg I- 1) to 92. 7 % (50 mg I- 1) and for phosphorus were 98. 2 % (0. 2 mg l- 1) to 100. 2 % (10 mg l- 1). The method is precise in its ability m reproduce results from replicate digestions, and robust in its ability to handle a variety of natural water samples in the pH range 5 - 8...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} an {{accelerated}} <b>phosphorus</b> poisoning <b>method</b> for an automotive SCR-catalyst and the phosphorus influence on catalyst activity {{has been carried}} out. The catalyst that was deactivated was a V 2 O 5 -WO 3 -TiO 2 SCR-catalyst. The deactivation was made with phosphorus doped fuel in an engine rig for 40 hours. Parts from the deactivated catalyst were tested for remaining activity and characterized by BET, ICP, XRD and TPD. The activity tests showed that phosphorus {{has an impact on}} the activity and that it is dependent on the phosphorus concentration. Phosphorus decreases the activity trough selective poisoning and an increased inner mass transport resistance. The characterization showed that phosphorus is present through the whole length of the catalyst. An increase in phosphorus decreases the specific surface and increases the average pore diameter. The phosphorus also affects the acid sites on the catalyst. The phosphorus did note change any of the crystalline phases detected by XRD. However, phosphorus could be part of the formation of a new crystalline phase in the two parts closest to the inlet of the catalyst...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are being raised concerning phosphorus (P) management as producers switch to minimum or no-tillage cropping systems. Benefits of P application are site specific and potential advantages need to be evaluated for each location. Deep band application effects on crop yield and soil P distribution have been studied, but conclusive results are lacking because {{of the complexity of}} environment and P placement interactions, particularly in moisture limited environments. Challenges in soil test sampling and interpretation have also affected P management in these reduced and no-tillage systems because of decreased confidence in soil test P data. The objectives of this research were to evaluate crop responses to P application rate and placement and to study the distribution of soil P concentration, both vertically and laterally at a number of locations in Kansas. This research shows that crop growth at the sites evaluated was not negatively affected by P stratification, which was present at all sites {{at the beginning of the}} study. <b>Phosphorus</b> placement <b>methods</b> (broadcast and deep band) did not have significant effects on P responses. However, P application was required to achieve maximum yields at sites with low soil P, bu...|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{varieties}} respond {{differently to}} <b>phosphorus</b> fertilization. <b>Method</b> of P application {{may influence the}} degree of responsiveness. Three varieties of wheat viz. Punjab- 96, Inqelab- 91 and Pasban- 90 were grown after applying Nitrophos (23 : 23) @ 0 or 44 kg P ha- 1 by two methods, (i) broadcast and incorporation at sowing and (ii) fertigation at first irrigation. Grain yield and total P uptake data obtained after crop harvest showed that wheat varieties differed significantly in grain and straw yield, harvest index and 1000 - grain weight. Application of P by either method increased grain and straw yield as well as total P uptake over control. Method x P interaction effect was also significant for yield, indicating higher yield response due to fertigation compared to broadcast method of P application. Where P was applied by fertigation grain yield, total P uptake, agronomic and P fertilizer efficiency were all higher in cv. Inqelab- 91 compared to cv. Pasban- 90. Thus application of phosphatic fertilizer by fertigation along with selection of an appropriate variety may contribute to improve P fertilizer efficiency and increase wheat grain yield...|$|R
