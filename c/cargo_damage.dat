5000|$|At {{the time}} of the passage of COGSA most cargo was shipped in boxes, crates, and bags. Shortly after its passage, cargo owners {{determined}} that cargo could be handled more efficiently if placed on pallets, a process that results in numerous boxes or bags of cargo being consolidated on a single pallet. Shipowners, seeing an opportunity to reduce their liability for <b>cargo</b> <b>damage,</b> argued to the courts that the pallets were now [...] "packages" [...] and that they were entitled to limit their liability to $500 per pallet. Some courts agreed.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Congress, {{concerned}} that the Hague Rules did not offer shippers enough protection against damage to cargo by shipowners, amended the Hague Rules {{in a number of}} minor, but important, ways. It increased the amount that shipowners would have to pay cargo owners for damage in transit from GBP 100 per package to USD 500 per package or, for goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit. This [...] "package limitation" [...] {{has become one of the}} most contentious and litigious areas in the field of <b>cargo</b> <b>damage,</b> particularly as it relates to the transportation of goods by ocean shipping containers.|$|E

5000|$|The courts, {{possibly}} {{believing that}} Congress' approach was too cumbersome, jettisoned the word [...] "customary" [...] from the phrase [...] "customary freight unit" [...] {{and decided that}} whatever freight unit the shipowner applied would be the freight unit for determining the limitation on liability. Again, seeing an opportunity to limit their liability for <b>cargo</b> <b>damage,</b> shipowners began freighting all cargo by unit, rather than by units of weight or measurement. Consequently, an automobile which might have a volume of 400 cubic feet (15 m3), or 4 measurement tons, which would previously entitle the carrier to a limitation of $2000, was now freighted as [...] "one automobile" [...] thereby reducing the shipowner's liability from $2000 per automobile to $500.|$|E

40|$|A non-minimum phase {{nonlinear}} ship {{model from}} rudder angle to roll angle {{is used to}} design a stable controller for simultaneous roll damping and course keeping. The controller is stable in presence of 1 st-order wave disturbances and modeling errors provided that {{the magnitude of the}} model errors and disturbances are known. Stability is proved using Lyapunov theory. The simulation results show excellent performance and robustness. 1 Introduction Besides controlling the heading of a ship it is often desirable to reduce the wave-induced roll motion. The main reasons for introducing a roll damping system are to prevent <b>cargo</b> <b>damage</b> and to increase crew effectiveness and passenger comfort. Criteria for the maximum roll angle are given in [4], and they suggest that the root mean square of the roll angle should be less than 6 degrees for light manual work and 3 degrees for intellectual work.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the rudder in ships is course keeping. However, the rudder can also be used, in some cases, to reject {{undesirable}} wave produced rolling motion. From a fundamental point of view, the main issues associated with this problem are {{the presence of a}} non minimum phase zero and the single input two output nature of the system. In this paper, the limitations imposed on the achievable closed loop performance due to these issues are analyzed. This gives {{a deeper understanding of the}} problem and leads to conclusions regarding the inherent design trade-offs which hold regardless of the control strategy used. 1 Introduction Rudder Roll Stabilization (RRS) is an attractive method for reducing ship rolling motion produced by waves. By so doing, <b>cargo</b> <b>damage</b> is prevented, while crew efficiency and passenger comfort are improved. RRS uses the capacity of the rudder to produce roll motion apart from its normal course keeping function. Using the rudder for simultaneous course keepi [...] ...|$|E
5000|$|Claims for <b>damage</b> to <b>cargo</b> {{shipped in}} {{international}} commerce {{are governed by}} the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a shipowner is liable for <b>cargo</b> <b>damaged</b> from [...] "hook to hook", meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an [...] "act of God", the inherent nature of the goods, errors in navigation, {{and management of the}} ship. The basis of liability for the shipowner is a bailment and if the carrier is to be liable as a common carrier, it must be established that the goods were placed in the carrier's possession and control for immediate carriage.|$|R

40|$|During a crash event, {{significant}} energy must {{be absorbed}} by kinetic energy-dissipating systems through material plastic deformation.

These discontinuities play the role of crash initiators, which can affect the axial collapse mode, by ensuring a stable collapse process and decreasing the initial peak load. Results of both experimental and finite element (FE) simulation of square steel tubes with circular discontinuities subjected to quasi-static axial loadings are reported. The tubular test specimens were manufactured from commercially mild steel S 355 tubes and were tested under various schemes of discontinuities (hole diameter, location, etc.). The proposed numerical model using the LS-DYNA explicit FE code was validated employing testing results from the axial loading and was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} large cargo ships use weather routing {{services}} for ocean passages. They are primarily geared towards protecting owners and charterers from speed claims, a secondary use being {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and improve ETAs (estimated time of arrival). There exist a large number of such ocean weather routing companies, such as WNI, Ocean routes, WRI and SPOS. Promoters of weather routing companies cite high fuel savings due to their use, while many mariners tend to be sceptic of their advantages due to a large number of maritime accidents (such as the sinking of the Derbyshire, and the parametric rolling of APL China) and <b>cargo</b> <b>damages</b> that continue to occur even when vessels follow routing advice. Most routing programs employ the Dijkstra algorithm and do not consider the different responses of each ship to the same weather, as the latter is difficult to estimate.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} a vehicle scheduling problem {{encountered in the}} cold chain logistics of the frozen food delivery industry. Unlike the single product delivery scenario, we propose an optimization model that manages the delivery {{of a variety of}} products. In this scenario, a set of customers make requests for a variety of frozen foods which are being loaded together. The objective is to find the routes that represent the minimum delivery cost for a fleet of identical vehicles that, departing from a depot, visiting all customers only once and returning to the depot. The delivery cost includes the transportation cost, the cost of refrigeration, the penalty cost and <b>cargo</b> <b>damage</b> cost based on the characteristics of different frozen food products. Apart from the usual constraints of time windows and loading weight, the study also takes into account the constraints of loading volume related to the unit volume of different frozen foods. We then propose a Genetic Algorithm (GA) method for the model. Computational tests with real data from a case validate the feasibility and rationality of the model and show the efficient combinations of parameter values of the GA method...|$|E

40|$|Carrying forest {{products}} like paper rolls and wood pulp requires special care. Such cargo is {{very sensitive to}} moisture. It has to be transported in a controlled, low-humidity environment to prevent damage from moisture condensation. Dehumidifiers are fitted onboard vessels to control humidity in the cargo-holds. It {{is the responsibility of}} the crew onboard the ship to control the humidity in the cargo-holds. Failure to do so may result in claims for <b>cargo</b> <b>damage.</b> The challenge for ship owners, operators, machinery manufacturers and training institutes is to equip the ship's crew with the basic engineering skills for the correct operation and maintenance of dehumidification equipment.

40|$|For roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ships, when {{transporting}} {{more cars}} {{within the same}} deck area on board, {{it is necessary to}} adjust or take away the current lashing system. Furthermore, this operation may also decrease the cost and time of operation as well as <b>cargo</b> <b>damages</b> due to lashing. This requirement, combined with the safety consideration on cargo shifting, may lead to concepts of lashing-free deck design. One of the lashing-free concepts suggests that in some conditions cars can be secured without using lashings, mainly depending on the friction between the tire and the deck without lashings. By doing a series of parametric studies of vehicle securing without lashings under roll and pitch motions, {{it was found that the}} value of the maximum required friction coefficient between the tires and the deck is highly relevant to the roll and pitch amplitude, pitch period, orientation of vehicles on decks, and the vertical location of vehicles from the baseline of the vessel...|$|R
