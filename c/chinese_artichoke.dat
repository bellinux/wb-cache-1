50|$|Stachys affinis, {{commonly}} called crosne, <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke,</b> Japanese artichoke, knotroot, and artichoke betony, is a perennial herbaceous plant {{of the family}} Lamiaceae, originating from China. Its rhizome can be grown and eaten as a root vegetable.|$|E
50|$|In Chinese and Japanese cuisine, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> is {{primarily}} pickled. In particular, its tuber {{is a part}} of Osechi, cooked for celebrating Japanese New Year. Dyed red by leaves of red shiso after being pickled, it is called chorogi.|$|E
5000|$|Lamiaceae ( [...] or [...] )or Labiatae is {{a family}} of {{flowering}} plants {{commonly known as the}} mint or deadnettle family. Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as Coleus. Others are grown for seed, such as Salvia hispanica (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as Plectranthus edulis, Plectranthus esculentus, Plectranthus rotundifolius, and Stachys affinis (<b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke).</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop an optimal composite recipe of nutritional cookies containing <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) powder. Rice powder was partially substituted with <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) powder to reduce its content. The optimal sensory composite recipe was determined by 3 concentrations of <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) powder, butter, and sugar, using the central composite design. In addition, the mixing condition of <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) powder rice cookies was optimized by subjecting the cookies to a sensory evaluation and instrumental analysis using the response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of the addition of the three variables on the quality of <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) rice powder cookies were assessed in terms of color, hardness, sweetness and sensory evaluation. The results of the sensory evaluation produced values very significant for flavor, texture, sweetness, appearance, and overall quality (p< 0. 05). The results of instrumental analysis showed significant values in moisture content, spreadability, sweetness (p< 0. 01), lightness, redness, and hardness (p< 0. 001). As a results, the optimal sensory ratio of <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) rice cookies was determined to be <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (Stachy sieboldii Miq) powder 4. 22 g, butter 120. 00 g, and sugar 130. 00 g.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we studied the {{chemical}} composition of <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke</b> (S. affinis tubers) by analyzing its polar constituents and its macro- and micro- nutrients. A total of nine compounds were {{isolated from the}} tuber ethanolic extract and structurally elucidated by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). The marker compounds identified were oligosaccharide stachyose and the organic acid, succinic acid, as well as phenylethanoid and iridoid glycosides. The macronutrient profile was dominated by carbohydrates (36. 9...|$|E
40|$|Stachys affinis Bunge, {{also known}} {{with the common}} name of <b>Chinese</b> <b>artichoke,</b> is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. This species is mainly known for its tubers which are used in gastronomy as root vegetables in several {{parts of the world}} comprising its origin area (Eastern Asia) as well as Europe where it is now fairly cultivated. In this work, we report the profile of S. affinis tubers, collected in December, 2014 in the town of Gazoldo degli Ippoliti, province of Mantova (geographic coordinates: 45 ° 11 ' 25 " N, 10 ° 34 ' 40 " E) at an altitude of 35 m a. s. l. where it was cultivated. We investigated both primary and secondary metabolites using HPLC and GC both coupled with MS {{for the study of the}} primary metabolites and CC, NMR and ESI-MS for separation and identification of the secondary metabolites, respectively. Primary metabolite pattern is composed by carbohydrates, proteins, fibers and fatty acids while secondary metabolite pattern is mainly constituted by phenyl-ethanoid glycosides (PhGs) and iridoids. The secondary pattern is in agreement with the botanical classification having found the typical compounds of the genus. Yet, it is also noteworthy to mention the important contribution that all the primary metabolites give to the nutritional properties of the rhizomes providing a rationale for their traditional culinary use, then. Moreover, PhGs and iridoids, that are endowed with interesting biological activities 4, 5, ascribe functional properties to this food and might also contritube to the characteristic bitter-sweet taste of the tubers...|$|E
