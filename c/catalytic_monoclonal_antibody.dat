5000|$|An abzyme (from {{antibody}} and enzyme), {{also called}} catmab (from <b>catalytic</b> <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody),</b> and most often called catalytic antibody, is a monoclonal antibody with catalytic activity. Abzymes are usually raised in lab animals immunized against synthetic haptens, but some natural abzymes {{can be found}} in normal humans (anti-vasoactive intestinal peptide autoantibodies) and in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, where they can bind to and hydrolyze DNA. To date abzymes display only weak, modest catalytic activity and have not proved to be of any practical use. [...] They are, however, subjects of considerable academic interest. Studying them has yielded important insights into reaction mechanisms, enzyme structure and function, catalysis, and the immune system itself.|$|E

40|$|The biosynthetic {{evolution}} of enzymes {{has taken over}} millions of years. These natural catalysts make the complicated process of life possible and have also become extremely viable tools in basic research, medicine and industry. There {{are a number of}} useful chemical reactions which can be catalyzed by enzymes in the laboratory, however there are still a large number of chemical transformation for which no suitable enzyme is known. My doctoral research has been concerned with developing strategies to generate and characterize catalysts, either by tailoring the active site of the enzyme or by raising <b>catalytic</b> <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> against transition state analogs. My work has been built on previous achievements in this area, focusing on the investigations of factors important in protein engineering (tailoring active sites of enzyes) and antibody catalysis. We have tailored the active site of chorismate mutase (EC 5. 4. 99. 5) which catalyzes the interamolecular rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate. Glu 78 and Arg 90 in the active site of the chorismate mutase enzyme from Bacillus subtillis was in close proximity to the substrate and may contribute to efficient catalysis by electrostatically stabilizing the presumed dipolar transition state that would result upon scission of the C-O bond which substantially precedes C-C bond formation. To test this idea we have developed a novel complementation system for chorismate mutase activity in Eshcerichia coli by reengineering parts of the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. The condons for Glu 78 and Arg 90 were randomized alone and in combination with Cys 78 and Cys 88, and active clones were selected. Our results support the nation that an electrostatic gradient in the active site is a major factor in chorismate mutase catalysis. The new selection system, in conjugation with combinatorial mutagenesis, renders the mechanism of the natural enzyme(s) accessible to further exploration and opens avenues for the improvement of the first generation of catalytic antibodies with chorismate mutase activity. We have characterized chorismate mutase by determining the activation parameters. Chorismate mutase is known to accelerate the chorismate to prephenate rearrangement, in part by significantly lowering the entropy barrier for the reaction. We have found that S(- 9. 1 1. 2 ev) is nearly as unfavorable as the activation entropy for the uncatalyzed process. Our results suggest that chorismate mutase catalysts show greater mechanistic versatility than commonly believed. Research towards expanding the reaction repertoire of catalytic antibodies has involved designing and synthesizing transition state analogs for the Diels Alser reaction...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis involved the production of antibodies to several defined antigens and the chemical synthesis of bispecific antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP), and against a GFAP-like protein on the human anaplastic astrocytoma cell line, G-CCM (anti-G-CCM) were produced by electrofusion and by fusion using polyethylene glycol, respectively. These antibodies were purified with saturated ammonium sulphate (S AS) and protein A. These antibodies were fully characterised by ELISA, Isotyping, SDS-PAGE, Immunocylochemisiry, Dot Blot, Western immunoblotting, BIAcore, HPLC, Immunofluoresence and FACS An {{attempt was made to}} clone and express the variable regions of the anti-G-CCM monoclonal antibody in Escherichia colt. Iodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent (IBHR) was conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin and keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). These IBHR-protein conjugates were characterised by the iodide assay and the Bradford protein assay. The IBHR-BSA conjugate was used to immunise six mice and a rabbit to produce anti-IBHR antibodies. A monoclonal anti-IBHR antibody was not obtained. However, a polyclonal anti-IBHR antibody was produced and was purified by SAS, protein A and CNBr-activated sepharose affinity chromatography. This antibody was characterised by ELISA, SDS-PAGE and HPLC Bispecific antibodies were chemically generated using (1) anti-GFAP and ana-IBHR and (u) anti-G-CCM and anti-IBHR Ricin is a highly cytotoxic compound Bispecific antibodies were made using an acquired anti-Ricm.

40|$|A {{total of}} 28 <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{have been raised}} against the (Ca 2 + + Mg 2 +) -ATPase of rabbit {{skeletal}} muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. Epitope mapping, using protein fragments generated by proteolysis, indicates that these antibodies include examples binding to at least four distinct epitopes on the A 1 and B tryptic fragments of the ATPase. Competition data also show that the 28 antibodies are directed against at least five spatially distinct regions. Altogether, nine inhibitory antibodies were produced: six of these inhibitory antibodies mapped to the same spatial region, although they appear to bind to two distinct epitopes located within the hinge region and the nucleotide-binding domains of current structural models; one antibody bound to an epitope located within the phosphorylation domain and the stalk-transmembranous region designated M 4 S 4 by Brandl, Green, Korczak & MacLennan [(1986) Cell 44, 597 - 607]. Two of the inhibitory antibodies recognized assembled epitopes exclusively {{and could not be}} mapped. Binding to four of the five identified spatial regions was without effect on activity. These data show that the inhibition of <b>catalytic</b> activity by <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> is achieved only by binding to defined regions of the ATPase and they may therefore provide useful probes of structure-function relationships...|$|R

40|$|The {{insertion}} of a copper(II) ion into mesoporphyrin by a <b>monoclonal</b> <b>catalytic</b> <b>antibody</b> {{has been investigated}} kinetically by measuring the increase in Soret absorbance due {{to the production of}} copper(II) -mesoporphyrin. The initial rate of the reaction showed saturation kinetics {{as a function of the}} mesoporphyrin concentration, while it increased linearly with an increase in the copper(II) concentration. Based on observations, a scheme for the reaction was proposed: mesoporphyrin binds to the antibody to form a complex, and copper(II) binds to the complex to yield copper(II) -me 8 oporphyrin. Kinetic parameters for the respective steps were estimated, and the thermodynamic parameters were calculated. The binding of mesoporphyrin to the antibody was endothermic and entropically driven. This implies that hydrophobic interactions are an important factor in the binding. Free energy profiles for the antibody-catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions were drawn by use of the obtained thermodynamic parameter values. The results demonstrate that the rate accelera-tion by the antibody is ascribable to transition-state stabilization, and suggest that the structure of mesoporphyrin in the complex is more distorted than that of free mesoporphy-rin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Norwalk virus causes {{outbreaks}} of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. The virus capsid {{is composed of}} a single 60 kDa protein. In a previous study, the capsid protein of recombinant Norwalk virus genogroup II was expressed in an E. coli system and <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were generated against it. The analysis of the reactivity of those <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> suggested that the N-terminal domain might contain more antigenic epitopes than the C-terminal domain. In the same study, two broadly reactive <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were observed to react with genogroup I recombinant protein. Results In the present study, we used the recombinant capsid protein of genogroup I and characterized the obtained 17 <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> by using 19 overlapping fragments. Sixteen <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> recognized sequential epitopes on three antigenic regions, and the only exceptional <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> recognized a conformational epitope. As for the two broadly reactive <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> generated against genogroup II, we indicated that they recognized fragment 2 of genogroup I. Furthermore, genogroup I antigen from a patient's stool was detected by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using genogroup I specific <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> and biotinated broadly reactive <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody.</b> Conclusion The reactivity analysis of above <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> suggests that the N-terminal domain may contain more antigenic epitopes than the C-terminal domain as suggested in our previous study. The detection of genogroup I antigen from a patient's stool by our system suggested that the <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> generated against E. coli expressed capsid protein {{can be used to}} detect genogroup I antigens in clinical material. </p...|$|R

Neither the antisera nor the anti-idiotypic <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody,</b> however, inhibited binding of [3 H]spiperone to D 2 -dopamine receptors...|$|R
40|$|Although radiolabelled <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{are useful}} in tumor imaging, in our opinion their most {{important}} role is {{in the evaluation of}} the capacity of newly developed <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> to localize in tumors specifically. Intravenous injections of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> fragments, labelled with beta-emitting radionuclides, can completely eradicate large human colon carcinoma xenografts in nude mice whereas this is not achieved by unconjugated <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> New strategies are being developed to make radioimmunotherapy applicable to carcinoma patients...|$|R
40|$|Immune complex {{formation}} of four different mouse <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> against human IgG {{has been studied}} using analytical zonal centrifugation. A theoretical model {{has been used to}} depict thermodynamic ideal immune complex {{formation of}} <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> It was found that the four <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> differed very much with respect to immune complex formation with human IgG. One of the <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> formed immune complexes in agreement with the theoretical model. Another was strongly related thereto. A third <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> formed only a single complex and might exhibit a positive co-operativity between its two sites. A fourth formed as excess of a possibly cyclic complex. Thus <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> differ substantially with respect to physical properties adding a new aspect to the problems of antibody heterogeneity. It is moreover found that analytical zonal centrifugation can be used to estimate the number of antigenic determinants and antibody-binding sites thereby assuring whether or not a particular IgG <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> has two binding sites...|$|R
40|$|Two <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{prepared}} to purified virions of bean golden mosaic virus (BGMV) isolates from Guatemala (GA) and the Dominican Republic (DR) and one <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> {{prepared to}} the coat protein of a BGMV isolate from Brazil (BZ) expressed in Escherichia coli were useful serological probes for detection of whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses. Abutilon mosaic, BGMV isolates from Puerto Rico (PR), and Homestead, Florida (H), BGMV-BZ, -DR, and -GA isolates, euphorbia mosaic, rhynchosia mosaic, squash leaf curl, soybean yellow mosaic, an isolate from Macroptilium lathyroides in Florida, and tomato mottle geminiviruses all reacted efficiently in Western blot and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} with <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> 3 F 7, indicating that this <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> has {{a broad spectrum of}} reactivity. Another <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> (2 G 5) reacted only with BGMV-DR, -GA, and -PR isolates. A third <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> (5 C 5) reacted only with BGMV-BZ. A new geminivirus infecting cabbage (Brassicaceae) in Florida did not react with any of the three <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|An {{international}} study {{supported by}} the World Health Organization comparing <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> for serotyping and serosubtyping of Neisseria meningitidis strains was performed {{and the results were}} assessed in 1992. A collection of 6 serotype-specific (1, 2 a, 2 b, 4, 14, and 15) and 12 serosubtype-specific (P 1. 1, P 1. 2, P 1. 4, P 1. 5, P 1. 6, P 1. 7, P 1. 9, P 1. 10, P 1. 12, P 1. 14, P 1. 15, and P 1. 16) <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> was provided to 11 participating laboratories throughout the world. <b>Monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were tested on 85 Neisseria meningitidis strains with known reference results. Whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for analysis in 10 of 11 laboratories. The sensitivities and specificities of individual serotype- and subtype-specific <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were evaluated. Differences in individual laboratories and with individual <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were assessed. Relatively large differences in sensitivities were achieved in individual laboratories. On the contrary, the specificities remained at high levels in all laboratories. The sensitivities of serotype-specific <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> ranged from 72. 0 to 100 %. Individual serosubtype-specific <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> showed sensitivities ranging from 64. 1 to 98. 1 %. The most frequent reason for the incorrect results obtained with the <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were false-negative results. The collaborative study demonstrated that some <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> are not very sensitive. Another study to define the most suitable <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> is planned...|$|R
25|$|Milstein himself {{made many}} major {{contributions}} to improvements and developments in <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody</b> technology—especially {{focusing on the}} use of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> to provide markers that allow distinction between different cell types. In collaboration with Claudio Cuello, Milstein helped lay the foundation for the use of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> as probes for the investigation of the pathological pathways in neurological disorders as well as many other diseases. Milstein and Cuello's work also enabled the use of <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> to enhance the power of immuno-based diagnostic tests. In addition Milstein foresaw the potential wealth of ligand-binding reagents that could result from applying recombinant DNA technology to <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> and inspired the development of the field of antibody engineering which was to lead to safer and more powerful <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> for use as therapeutics.|$|R
40|$|Nine <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> {{directed}} against the flagella of Campylobacter jejuni strain 81116 have been investigated for serotypic and cross-reacting activity using a panel of 17 Penner serotype strains of C. jejuni. Four <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> were exclusively specific for serotype- 6 strains, which was the serotype of C. jejuni strain 81116. Two <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> cross-reacted with all the flagellated strains of C. jejuni tested. One of these cross-reacting <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies,</b> CF 5, was found to react with all other Campylobacter species except C. sputorum bulbulus {{but it did not}} react with other bacterial enteropathogens. An antigen-capture ELISA technique was established, using this <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibody,</b> which could detect flagellar antigen in human faecal material. These anti-flagella <b>monoclonal</b> <b>antibodies</b> therefore may be valuable in the diagnosis and serotyping of C. jejuni in clinical material...|$|R
