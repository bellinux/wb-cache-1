These airfields may also be used for other general aviation activities, and the addition of gliding may be difficult to accommodate.

5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation <b>can</b> <b>limit</b> visibility.

5|$|Boyer {{observes the}} {{distinction}} between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection {{as individuals and as}} species. He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly anthropocentric, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered virtues; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of polar bear preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy <b>can</b> <b>limit</b> the achievement of animal welfare/rights goals.|$|E

5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines <b>can</b> <b>limit</b> the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once is costly, so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the risks of early pregnancy and older women from the increased risks of unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception <b>can</b> <b>limit</b> multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
