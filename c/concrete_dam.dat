40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the seismic analysis of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> with consideration of material nonlinearity. Based {{on a consistent}} rate-dependent model and two thermodynamics-based models, two thermodynamics-based rate-dependent constitutive models were developed with consideration {{of the influence of}} the strain rate. They can describe the dynamic behavior of concrete and be applied to nonlinear seismic analysis of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> taking into account the rate sensitivity of concrete. With the two models, a nonlinear analysis of the seismic response of the Koyna Gravity Dam and the Dagangshan Arch Dam was conducted. The results were compared with those of a linear elastic model and two rate-independent thermodynamics-based constitutive models, and the influences of constitutive models and strain rate on the seismic response of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> were discussed. It can be concluded from the analysis that, during seismic response, the tensile stress is the control stress in the design and seismic safety evaluation of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams.</b> In different models, the plastic strain and plastic strain rate of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> show a similar distribution. When the influence of the strain rate is considered, the maximum plastic strain and plastic strain rate decrease...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. More {{and more}} high dams with huge {{reservoirs}} {{have been built}} in China in recent years. A lot of research work on the causes of cracking in galleries of low <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> {{has been carried out}} at present, while studies on that of high <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> are less with the lack of systematic cognition. Based on that, the research on high <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> is conducted in this paper, using the method of finite element simulation. It is proven that self-weight action has more influence on the stress of arch crests of galleries existing in high <b>concrete</b> <b>dams,</b> especially the galleries whose overlying concrete height is relatively high. And surface cracks tend to appear in arch crests of these galleries under gravity. In the end, measures for improvement of the stress of arch crest are put forward, of which the effect of enlarging reinforcement is relatively obvious...|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} field of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> in operational stages is dominantly influenced by variations in environmental seasonal temperature and climatic conditions.

In this study, a critical review of the current state-of-the-art of temperature models for determining temperature distribution including the main environmental parameters influencing the temperature distribution for <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> in operation has been undertaken. It is found that, the heat flow in the <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> currently is approximated as conduction only and the classical Fourier heat conduction models are adopted as the governing equations to define heat flow mechanisms in the dam.

25|$|Logging came in {{the late}} 1880s, using streams and rivers to {{transport}} the wood. A dam was constructed on Wallowa Lake in 1884 to help irrigate the valley.

25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> wall with a drain valve control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|E
25|$|The St. Francis, {{sometimes}} referred to as the San Francisquito, would be only the second <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> to be designed and built by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply. The first was the near identical, in size and shape, Mulholland Dam, on which construction had begun one year earlier. The design of the St. Francis was in fact an adaptation of the Mulholland Dam with certain changes which were made so as to suit the location. Most of the design profiles and computation figures of stress factors for the St. Francis came from this adaptation of the plans and formulas which had been used in the constructing of Mulholland Dam. This work was done by the Engineering department within the Bureau of Water Works and Supply.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the dam on Lake Ilo was {{determined}} to be deficient {{in a number of ways}} and the lake was drained in 1989 a total of 7feet (2m). A new <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> was constructed and soil from the old dam was used to build two small islands to improve nesting habitat for waterfowl. After the lake water was partially drained, numerous Paleo Indian artifacts were discovered, including stone artifacts and even a Tipi ring. Subsequent archeological work resulted in obtaining over 58,000 artifacts by 1994. These artifacts help to reconstruct the lifestyle and culture of the earliest known human inhabitants to the region. Additionally, numerous bones of now extinct mammal species assist in determining the biodiversity of the region at the end of the ice age.|$|E
25|$|Water {{began to}} fill the {{reservoir}} on March 12, 1926. It rose steadily and rather uneventfully, although several temperature and contraction cracks did appear in the dam and a minor amount of seepage began to flow from under the abutments. In accord with the protocol for design, which had been established by the engineering department during construction of the Mulholland dam, no contraction joints were incorporated. The most notable incidents were two vertical cracks that ran down through the dam from the top. One was approximately fifty-eight feet west of the outlet gates and another about the same distance to the east. Mulholland, along with his Assistant Chief Engineer and General Manager Harvey Van Norman, inspected the cracks and leaks and judged them to be within expectation for a <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> {{the size of the}} St. Francis.|$|E

In the present paper, uplift pressure effects in cracked <b>concrete</b> gravity <b>dams</b> are studied. A parametric study {{on the influence of}} uplift pressure on stress intensity factors and crack-propagation angle is performed. Furthermore, uplift pressure effects on the LEFM scale law for the maximum water level carried by cracked gravity dams are examined...|$|R

30|$|Warning {{indicators}} of the dam body’s temperature are required for the real-time monitoring of the service conditions of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> to ensure safety and normal operations. Warnings theories are traditionally targeted at a single point which have limitations, and the scientific warning theories on global behavior of the temperature field are non-existent. In this paper, first, in 3 D space, the behavior of temperature field has regional dissimilarity. Through the Ward spatial clustering method, the temperature field was divided into regions. Second, the degree of order and degree of disorder of the temperature monitoring points were defined by the probability method. Third, the weight values of monitoring points of each regions were explored via projection pursuit. Forth, a temperature entropy expression that can describe degree of order of the spatial temperature field in <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> was established. Fifth, the early-warning index of temperature entropy was set up according to the calculated sequential value of temperature entropy. Finally, project cases verified the feasibility of the proposed theories. The early-warning index of temperature entropy is conducive to the improvement of early-warning ability and safety management levels during the operation of high <b>concrete</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R

500|$|The state {{made other}} {{improvements}} in the park, including replacing or removing all of Ricketts' dams. At Lake Jean it built an earthen dam in 1949–1950 to replace Ricketts' 1905 timber dam; the new dam increased the size of Lake Jean to [...] and its eastern end now included the former Mud Pond. On April 20, 1958, the 1907 <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> at Lake Leigh developed a hole, causing Pennsylvania State Police to evacuate close to 2,000people from the park. Engineers from the state inspected the dam and made a second breach in the dam near ground level, draining the lake. The resulting flow of water destroyed some of the hiking paths in Glen Leigh and the fish stocked in the lake wound up in Kitchen Creek. The Lake Jean dam was repaired in 1956. The last of Ricketts' dams, at Lake Rose, was breached in 1959 after remnants of a hurricane filled the lake to capacity. The rest of the 1905 dam was removed in 1969. At Grand View the state built a wooden fire tower {{at the site of}} Ricketts' earlier observation tower, then replaced it with a [...] steel tower.

500|$|A {{lawyer from}} Ephrata, Washington, named William M. Clapp {{proposed}} in 1917 that the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee. He suggested a <b>concrete</b> <b>dam</b> could flood the plateau, just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago. Clapp {{was joined by}} James O'Sullivan, another lawyer, and by Rufus Woods, publisher of The Wenatchee World newspaper in the nearby agricultural centre of Wenatchee. Together, they {{became known as the}} [...] "Dam College". Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper, often with articles written by O'Sullivan. The dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918. [...] Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps.

[...] The other side, known as the [...] "ditchers", favored diverting water from northeast Washington's Pend Oreille River via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington. [...] Many locals such as Woods, O'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers, while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the Washington Water and Power Company (WWPC) were staunch ditchers. The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could be used to cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power.|$|E
30|$|Temperature {{variation}} {{is one of}} main safety monitoring items during the operation of <b>concrete</b> <b>dams.</b> A scientific and reasonable early-warning index (Wu 2003) of the dam body’s temperature has important significance in accurate hazard recognition and dam security protection. Temperature control is a key factor influencing whether the temperature cracks occur or not. In the process of operation, improper temperature control (Zhu 2014) will lead to dam cracking and even endanger the safety of dam bodies. Generally, the <b>concrete</b> <b>dams</b> belong to the mass concrete structure which has bad temperature conductivity, and they are often exposed to the outside, contacting with water, air and so on. All kinds of factors like temperature change outside, cement hydration heat and constraint stress may produce tensile stress. With the limit ability of concrete tensile strength, cracks tend {{to appear in the}} mass concrete structure. Combined with long-acting service characteristics of the <b>concrete</b> <b>dams,</b> advanced mechanical and mathematical theories are employed to scientifical theory for early-warning, as well as to conduct timely and effective determination of the safety status of dams. These activities are critical to perform safe operations and determine crucial topics in dam safety monitoring field research.|$|R
