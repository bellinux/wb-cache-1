5|$|In a 2005 study, Felgenhauer and Jarvis {{analyzed}} the permutations {{of the top}} band used in valid solutions. Once the Band1 symmetries and equivalence classes for the partial grid solutions were identified, the completions of the lower two bands were constructed and counted for each equivalence class. Summing completions over the equivalence classes, weighted by <b>class</b> <b>size,</b> gives {{the total number of}} solutions as 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960, confirming the value obtained by QSCGZ. The value was subsequently confirmed numerous times independently. A second enumeration technique based on band generation was later developed that is significantly less computationally intensive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

50|$|In 2002, Meek {{launched}} an initiative to reduce <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> in Florida's public schools. The amendment {{would set the}} maximum <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> of pre-kindergarten through 3rd grade classes to 18, 4th through 8th grade classes to 22, and high school classes to 25. It would also require schools to reduce <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> by two students in 2003 and to reach full compliance {{by the beginning of}} the 2010 school year.|$|R
50|$|There were 28 {{members in}} the first graduating class. Until the 1990s, Pine View's <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> hovered around 130 per graduating group. From 1990 until 2010, <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> {{gradually}} rose but were generally kept under 200. However, the Class of 2012 (with 158 graduates) is generally considered the school's last small <b>class,</b> as <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> are steeply increasing above 200 with the Class of 2013 and younger grades.|$|R
5|$|Note, while column {{triplets}} {{are used}} to construct and identify the equivalence classes, the class members themselves are the valid Band1 permutations: <b>class</b> <b>size</b> (Sb.z) reflects column triplet permutations compatible with the One Rule solution requirements. Counting symmetry is a completion property and applies only to a partial grid (band or stack). Solution symmetry for preserving solutions {{can be applied to}} either partial grids (bands, stacks) or full grid solutions. Lastly note, counting symmetry is more restrictive than simple numeric completion count equality: two (distinct) bands belong to the same counting symmetry equivalence class only if they impose equivalent completion constraints.|$|E
5|$|The average <b>class</b> <b>size</b> at FAU for {{undergraduates}} is 33students, and {{for graduate}} classes, 12students. The student-to-faculty ratio is 20:1. The top three undergraduate majors by enrollment are elementary education, accounting, and management, respectively. The top three graduate majors by enrollment are business administration, educational leadership, and accounting, respectively. The average age for first-year students is 18; however, {{the average age}} for all undergraduates is 24 and the average age for graduate students is 33. The average 4-year graduation rate for first-time, non-transfer students is 14% while the 6-year graduation rate is 39%.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average <b>class</b> <b>size</b> increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLet G be {{a finite}} group.

If we assume that G is solvable, we show that when the set of conjugacy <b>class</b> <b>sizes</b> of G is { 1,m,n,mn} with m and n {{arbitrary}} positive integers such that (m,n) = 1, then G is nilpotent and m=pa and n=qb for two primes p and q...|$|R
