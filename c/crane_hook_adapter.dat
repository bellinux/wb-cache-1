30|$|Next, we {{consider}} two problems with complex boundary: (a) a wrench and (b) a two-dimensional <b>crane</b> <b>hook,</b> both {{subjected to a}} concentrated force, P= 210 KN. The geometry, loading, and boundary conditions are shown in Figs. 10 and 11 for the wrench and the <b>crane</b> <b>hook,</b> respectively. The material properties are as follows: Young’s modulus E= 3 e^ 7 and Poisson’s ratio ν = 0.3. The domain is discretized with arbitrary polygonal elements. The appropriate number of T-functions and integration points are chosen {{based on the number}} of sides of the polygonal element. As these two problems do not have a closed form solution, we use the results from a FE simulation having 29, 016 and 33, 104 nodes for wrench and <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> domain, respectively, as a reference solution. The convergence of the total strain energy with mesh refinement is shown in Fig. 12 for the wrench and <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> domain. The results from the present method are compared with the results from the conventional PFEM. It is inferred that the present method converges faster than the conventional PFEM. Moreover, for the same number of degrees of freedom, the present method is more accurate than the PFEM with triangulation.|$|R

40|$|The {{base and}} ball hook system is an {{attachment}} {{that is designed}} to be used on the lunar surface as an improved alternative to the common <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> and eye system. The design proposed uses an omni-directional ball hook and base to overcome the design problems associated with a conventional <b>crane</b> <b>hook.</b> The base and ball hook is not sensitive to cable twist which would render a robotic lunar crane useless since there is little atmospheric resistance to dampen the motion of an oscillating member. The symmetric characteristics of the ball hook and base eliminates manual placement of the ball hook into the base; commonly associated with the typical hook and eye stem. The major advantage of the base and ball hook system is it's ease of couple and uncouple modes that are advantages during unmanned robotic lunar missions...|$|R

With more and more industrialization the rate at which these hooks are forged are increasing. This work has been carried out on one of the major <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> carrying a larger load comparatively. The cad model of the <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> is initially prepared with the help of existing drawings. It is then followed by implementation of modified cross section of hook in the static structural analysis workbench of catia v 5. These results lead us to the determination of stress and deflections in the existing model. In order to reach the most optimum dimensions several models in the form of different dimensions of hook were tested and the most optimum dimension was selected. The selection was based on the satisfaction of several factors in the form of load carrying capacity, stress induced and deflection...|$|R

Due to communication problems, {{failure of the}} lights on the Stena Welder bell, the absence of the Wildrake bells transponder, {{and the fact that the}} Wildrake crew had forgotten they had moved the bell away from the SALM base a few hours earlier, it took Kasey-Smith nearly an hour to find the Wildrake bell on the seafloor. At 0755 hours, he saw Walker and Guiel giving him thumbs up through the porthole. Kasey-Smith spent another hour directing the recovery of the slack guide wire around the SALM base. Because the Stena Welder was not a dynamic positioning (DP) vessel, it could not be held in a constant position, causing the Stena Welder bell to drag Kasey-Smith around the seabed on his umbilical. At 0902 hours, Kasey-Smith attached the guide wire to the bell. The Wildrake began lowering its <b>crane</b> <b>hook,</b> but Kasey-Smith now saw that Walker and Guiels movements had become [...] "very very frantic". The <b>crane</b> <b>hook</b> came down too far from the bell for Kasey-Smith to reach it with the wire slings attached to the hook. The hook was raised, had further slings attached, and was sent down again to Kasey-Smith, who attached the slings to the Wildrake bell at 1010 hours.|$|R
