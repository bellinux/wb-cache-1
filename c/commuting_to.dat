5|$|In 1846 {{the first}} railway line reached Richmond. Richmond Gasworks opened in 1848, and Richmond {{began to develop}} into a {{significant}} town. The District Railway (later the District line) reached Richmond in 1877, connecting it to the London Underground. <b>Commuting</b> <b>to</b> central London became feasible and affordable, leading to further population growth in the previously relatively isolated Richmond and Twickenham areas.|$|E
5|$|The Cycle Center is {{designed}} to encourage bicycle <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> Millennium and Grant Parks {{as well as to}} work and other nearby downtown locations, such as the Art Institute of Chicago.

By supporting cycling as an alternate form of transportation, it will help reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality and promote the health benefits of cycling.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{dramatically}} ended Chesham's isolation. <b>Commuting</b> <b>to</b> London became possible for the first time, as did affordable excursions to the seaside resorts on {{the south and east}} coasts.

50|$|There {{are those}} who <b>commute</b> <b>to</b> Hirosaki University. In Hirosaki, trains may only come once per an hour, {{so it can be}} {{inconvenient}} for students <b>to</b> <b>commute</b> <b>to</b> school: if they miss the train, they must wait another hour for the next train to come. Also, trains run slowly, so few students living in other prefectures outside of Aomori Prefecture <b>commute</b> daily <b>to</b> Hirosaki University.|$|R

5|$|Imagining the {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved with his family to No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{service would}} have 16 weekly departures to Bergen Airport, Flesland. The main market segment is the {{offshore}} petroleum industry, and the departure times {{were designed to}} mesh with helicopter routes to offshore installations. The company estimated that one-quarter of travellers would be people <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> the North Sea. Norsk Hydro, who {{have a lot of}} employees in the Grenland area, stated that they could not start using Vildanden because they had an agreement with SAS Braathens' services from Sandefjord. The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passengers. This first month, 972 passengers took the plane, and Vildanden announced that they would try to also start a route to Stavanger Airport, Sola, as well as potentially to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Army, {{he moved to}} Riverside, Connecticut, where he worked for M. W. Kellogg. He {{eventually}} tired of <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> New York City, and took a job with Koppers, building a coal loading facility in Turkey. He then worked for the United Nations Korean Relief at the UN Building in New York. He was also involved in mining projects in Africa. He made his home in Skaneateles, New York, while working on various projects around the world. In January 1961 he accepted an offer from the Governor of Minnesota, Elmer L. Andersen, to become that state's Commissioner of Highways. His four-year term was marred by a change of government {{in the state in}} 1963, and his final years saw a series of clashes with the new governor, Karl F. Rolvaag, and his attorney-general Walter Mondale.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Oslo Airport {{location}} controversy, {{after the}} new airport was decided located to Gardermoen, there was a public discussion {{as to what to}} do with the general aviation which had operated from Fornebu. While some local aircraft owners wanted to keep a small part of Fornebu for general aviation, the authorities decided to close the airport completely. Instead, the general aviation was distributed to various private airports in Eastern Norway, including Notodden. In May 1998, Air Team started flights from Notodden to Bergen. Air Team gradually moved all its operations, including its pilot school, to Notodden. After Fornebu was closed in October, the airline experienced a quadrupling of patronage, as Gardermoen had given longer travel time for people in Buskerud and Telemark. In addition to business travel, the airline catered offshore workers <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> the North Sea via Bergen. The airline stated that it intended to also open routes to Stavanger and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|Following the raids, {{tensions}} {{were high}} {{in the streets of}} the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s {{the city}} entered {{a period of}} rapid growth and the service sector overtook trade, {{industry}} and crafts as the leading sector of employment for the first time. Workers gradually began <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> the city from most of east and central Jutland as the region became more interconnected. The student population tripled between 1965 and 1977 turning the city into a Danish centre of research and education. The growing and comparably young population initiated a period of creativity and optimism; Gaffa and the KaosPilot school were founded in 1983 and 1991 respectively, and Aarhus was at the centre of a renaissance in Danish rock and pop music launching bands and musicians such as TV2, Gnags, Thomas Helmig, Bamses Venner, Anne Dorte Michelsen, Mek Pek and Shit & Chanel.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} built in 1878 for Theodore Waters Foster, born on May 19, 1847, to Chauncey Foster and Ophelia Remington. He was educated in Pawtucket and joined the Rhode Island Cavalry in 1863. He served in the American Civil War under Nathaniel P. Banks in the Red River Campaign. In 1873, he formed a jewelry-manufacturing {{partnership}} with Walter E. White and Samuel H. Baily, named White, Foster & Company. After White retired in 1878, the company was renamed Foster & Bailey. During this time, Foster constructed the house and lived in it {{for a period of}} four years, <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> his place of business in Providence, Rhode Island. Foster would continue to be successful in his jewelry manufacturing business and his son, Theodore Clyde Foster, would succeed him upon his death in 1928. In 1882, Theodore Foster sold the home to George W. Payne, the owner of the G. W. Payne & Company.|$|E
5|$|US 80 {{was removed}} from the state highway system in the 1964 state highway {{renumbering}} when I-80 was designated; I-8 assumed the routing from San Diego to El Centro and Yuma. However, US 80 signs were posted for several years afterward on the remaining portions of the original asphalt road that had not been bypassed by the freeway. The AASHO formally recognized California's requested elimination of US 80 by 1969. Gradually, the route {{was removed from}} Arizona, New Mexico and part of Texas between 1977 and 1991. After the freeway was built, the population of Jacumba went from 400 to 200, and many businesses closed or relocated. However, the population began to increase after a few years, and residents began <b>commuting</b> <b>to</b> jobs in El Centro and San Diego. Following a campaign from the local Old Highway 80 Committee and endorsement from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, the California State Legislature passed a resolution allowing for the route to be designated and signed as a state historic route, Historic U.S. Route 80, in 2006.|$|E
