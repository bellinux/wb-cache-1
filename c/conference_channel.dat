This offers the squad leader some flexibility in organising communication networks in his section. Each network has an audio <b>conference</b> <b>channel,</b> with priority given to the squad leader, an alert channel from the infantryman to his leader, and a data transmission channel. Voice and data transmission is based on tried and tested DECT civilian technology (domestic cordless telephone technology). Each sub-network works from a base carried by the squad leader. As RIF sets are all identical, a soldier can replace his commander if necessary by configuring his set as base. The radio is configured by the Félin computer, thereby {{limiting the number of}} control buttons needed on the set.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the transmission of}} a memoryless bivariate Gaussian source over a two-user additive Gaussian multiple-access channel with unidirectional conferencing encoders. Here, prior to each transmission block, Encoder 1, which observes the first source component, is allowed to communicate with Encoder 2, which observes the second source component, via a unidirectional noise-free bit-pipe of given capacity. The main results of this work are sufficient conditions and {{a necessary condition for}} the achievability of a distortion pair expressed {{as a function of the}} channel SNR and of the source correlation. The main sufficient condition is obtained by an extension of the vector-quantizer scheme suggested by Lapidoth-Tinguely, for the case without conferencing, to the case with unidirectional conference. In the high-SNR regime, and when the capacity of the <b>conference</b> <b>channel</b> is unlimited, these necessary and sufficient conditions are shown to agree. We evaluate the precise high-SNR asymptotics for a subset of distortion pairs when the capacity of the <b>conference</b> <b>channel</b> is unlimited in which case we show that a separation based scheme attains these optimal distortion pairs. However, with symmetric average-power constraints and fixed conferencing capacity, at high-SNR the latter separation based scheme is shown to be suboptimal.

40|$|We {{consider}} a wireless network composed of three nodes and {{limited by the}} half-duplex and total power constraints. This formulation encompasses many of the special cases studied in the literature and allows for capturing the common features shared by them. Here, we focus on three special cases, namely 1) Relay Channel, 2) Multicast Channel, and 3) <b>Conference</b> <b>Channel.</b> These special cases are judicially chosen to reflect varying degrees of complexity while highlighting the common ground shared by the different variants of the three node wireless network. For the relay channel, we propose a new cooperation scheme that exploits the wireless feedback gain. This scheme combines the benefits of decode-and-forward and compress-and-forward strategies and avoids the idealistic feedback assumption adopted in earlier works. Our analysis of the achievable rate of this scheme reveals the diminishing feedback gain at both the low and high signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Inspired by the proposed feedback strategy, we identify a greedy cooperation framework applicable to both the multicast and conference channels. Our performance analysis reveals several nice properties of the proposed greedy approach and {{the central role of}} cooperative source-channel coding in exploiting the receiver side information in the wireless network setting. Our proofs for the cooperative multicast with side-information rely on novel nested and independent binning encoders along with a list decoder. Comment: 52 page...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{multi-cell}} processing for the uplink of {{a cellular}} system is {{studied in the}} presence of orthogonal channels of fixed capacity between mobile stations in adjacent cells (conferencing). It is shown that a rate-splitting transmission strategy, where part of the message is exchanged on the <b>conferencing</b> <b>channels</b> and then transmitted cooperatively to the base stations, is capacity-achieving for an asymptotically large conferencing capacity. This strategy can be regarded as able to perform convolutional pre-equalization of the signal encoding the common messages in the spatial domain, where the number of taps of the finite-impulse response equalizer depends on the number of conferencing rounds. Analysis in the low signal-tonoise ratio regime and numerical results validate the advantages of conferencing as a complementary technology to multi-cell processing. uplink <b>channel</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>channels</b> Nm− 1 Ym−...|$|R

This letter investigates {{the effect of}} conferencing between the relays in a particular class of diamond networks with source-to-relay and <b>conferencing</b> <b>channels</b> modeled as noiseless bit-pipes of given capacities. A lower bound to the capacity for this network and an upper bound that is tighter than the cut-set bound are presented. Such network with specific multiple access channel (MAC) types are studied and the minimum confer-encing link capacity needed to achieve full cooperation for each MAC is ascertained. It is found that such minimum conferencing link capacity for the Gaussian MAC must be equal {{to the difference between}} the full cooperation capacity and the backhaul capacity. However, such result does not hold in general as the binary adder MAC illustrates a counter-example.

In this paper, we introduce a special type of group authentication using secret sharing, which provides an efficient way to authenticate multiple users belonging to the same group without the chairman.

30|$|This paper {{considers}} an enhancement to multicell processing for the uplink of {{a cellular}} system, whereby the mobile stations {{are allowed to}} exchange messages on orthogonal channels of fixed capacity (conferencing). Both conferencing among mobile stations in different cells {{and in the same}} cell (inter- and intracell conferencing, resp.) are studied. For both cases, it is shown that a rate-splitting transmission strategy, where part of the message is exchanged on the <b>conferencing</b> <b>channels</b> and then transmitted cooperatively to the base stations, is capacity achieving for sufficiently large conferencing capacity. In case of intercell conferencing, this strategy performs convolutional pre-equalization of the signal encoding the common messages in the spatial domain, where the number of taps of the finite-impulse response equalizer depends on the number of conferencing rounds.

30|$|Most of {{the current}} {{proposals}} for the enhancement of cellular-based wireless networks, such as the IEEE 802.16 j standard are based on cooperative technologies. Among such solutions, multicell processing, where cooperation is at the BS level, is receiving an increasing attention for its significant potential enabled by the high-capacity backbone connecting the BSs. In this paper, we have looked at an extension to this technology, where besides multicell processing, partial cooperation is allowed at the MS level as well. In particular, additional system resources {{are assumed to be}} available to provide <b>conferencing</b> <b>channels</b> of finite capacity between nearby MSs. Two limiting scenarios have been considered: one in which conferencing is allowed between MSs belonging to adjacent cells (as is reasonable for small cells) and another where conferencing is possible only among MSs belonging to the same cell. In both cases, a transmission scheme based on rate splitting and cooperative transmission has been proven to be optimal when the conferencing capacity is large enough.|$|R
