50|$|By the 1997/98 season every ski {{company was}} {{producing}} parabolic designs, and only parabolic designs. In spite of fire-sale prices on older designs, parabolics accounted for 70% of all ski sales by 1999. Over time {{these would be}} known as <b>carving</b> <b>skis,</b> super-sidecuts, hourglass skis, and finally shaped skis. Modern designs tend to have less radical sidecut than the SCX, and lengths have increased somewhat as well, but the SCX remains revolutionary in its effects on design.|$|E
50|$|For the 2012-13 season, the FIS {{increased}} the sidecut radius to 35 m and the minimal length to 195 cm. Many athletes criticized this decision. Often David Dodge was cited. Dodge argues that FIS used studies {{which do not}} comprise a scientific proof. He states that {{it is well known}} that if one tips the ski 7° more the 35 m ski will have the same turning radius as the 28 m ski. He states as well that knee injuries are decreasing since the 1990s, when <b>carving</b> <b>skis</b> started to be used.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of innovations in sport often is met with opposition from society, {{or in other}} words, incomprehension from the supporters of previous premises, in terms of understanding the new methods and the like. The manifestation of a certain dose of resistance is most frequently done by voicing unsubstantiated criticism {{by means of the}} media. We are primarily referring to the incomprehension of new methods and principles of work, which leads to prejudice among poorly or insufficiently informed individuals. This was the reason why, at first, during the 1990 ’s, a prejudice against <b>carving</b> <b>skis</b> was born, which could confuse the inexperienced and uninformed, and should therefore be clarified. Carving is much easier to learn than classic skiing. There is pleasure to be gained from the very fact that <b>carving</b> <b>skis,</b> due to their structure, have no problem entering and going through a turn, the ease of which {{can be seen in the}} relaxed body posture during that time. The term “carving” refers to the shape of the skis, which remind one of an hourglass shape. Depending on how far the tip and tail of the skis are from the mid section of the skills, we can determine various carving ski types, from the mildest to the most extreme, including: carving plus skis, all-round <b>carving</b> <b>skis,</b> classic skis, turn skiing, telemark – free skiing...|$|E

40|$|Ideal carving {{occurs when}} a snowboarder or skier, {{equipped}} with a snowboard or <b>carving</b> <b>skis,</b> describes a perfect carved turn in which {{the edges of the}} ski alone, not the ski surface, describe the trajectory followed by the skier, without any slipping nor skidding. In this article, we derive the ideal-carving equation which describes the physics of a carved turn under ideal conditions. The laws of Newtonian classical mechanics are applied. The parameters of the ideal-carving equation are the inclination of the ski slope, the acceleration of gravity, and the sidecut radius of the ski. The variables of the ideal-carving equation are the velocity of the skier, the angle between the trajectory of the skier and the horizontal, and the instantaneous curvature radius of the skier's trajectory. Relations between the slope inclination and the velocity range suited for nearly ideal carving are discussed, as well as implications for the design of <b>carving</b> <b>skis</b> and raceboards.

40|$|This {{short article}} {{is not meant}} to be {{understood}} as a paper on the foundations of physics, but purely concerned with the application of Newtonian mechanics to the dynamics of skiing. We neglect relativistic corrections, as well as quantum mechanical effects. In addition, we should mention that the paper contains a lengthy didactic presentation of a specific example of vector calculus. Nevertheless, rather general statements governing the dynamics of a skier’s trajectory can be obtained on the basis of an elementary analysis. Ideal carving occurs when a snowboarder or skier, equipped with a snowboard or <b>carving</b> <b>skis,</b> describes a perfect carved turn in which the edges of the ski alone, not the ski surface, describe the trajectory followed by the skier, without any slipping nor skidding. In this article, we derive the ideal-carving equation which describes the physics of a carved turn under ideal conditions. The laws of Newtonian classical mechanics are applied. The parameters of the ideal-carving equation are the inclination of the ski slope, the acceleration of gravity, and the sidecut radius of the ski. The variables of the ideal-carving equation are the velocity of the skier, the angle between the trajectory of the skier and the horizontal, and the instantaneous curvature radius of the skier’s trajectory.

40|$|The carving {{skiing is}} not the same as the {{application}} of the carving skiing or skis in the classic alpine disciplines. The Carving World Cup is one of the best indicators of that. The main features, so called ski-telemark, are the features of <b>carving</b> <b>skis</b> as well, but now more emphasized. In contrast to earlier four skiing categories, there are at least eight of them at the moment. The greater number of the categories, the more precise selection of skis is. The development of new technology has definitely affected the skiing technique itself and new changes thus have made better results and qualitative skiing, which altogether resulted in modification of the old schools and their adjustment to new challenges...|$|E

It is impossible to carry out {{an investigation of the}} alpine skiing technique in laboratory conditions. Because of that it is only possible to carry it out during a competition. In this paper we selected special parts of the trail based on the predetermined goal to determine the carving slalom skis efficiency. Besides this we determined certain markers of the slalom technique that represent biomechanical situational kinematical space parameters: length with five and angle with six variables. Besides the investigation results, after the statistical processing, we found that the certain kinematical situational variables of slalom technique at <b>carving</b> <b>skis</b> have different mutual relations...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{injuries}} to the lower extremity occur in skiing and snowboarding. Due {{to the difficulty of}} collecting 3 D kinematic and kinetic data with high accuracy, a possible relationship between injury statistic and joint loading has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to compare ankle and knee joint loading at the steering leg between <b>carved</b> <b>ski</b> and snowboard turns. Kinetic data were collected using mobile force plates mounted under the toe and heel part of the binding on skies or snowboard (KISTLER). Kinematic data were collected with five synchronized, panning, tilting, and zooming cameras. An extended version of the Yeadon model was applied to calculate inertial properties of the segments. Ankle and knee joint forces and moments were calculated using inverse dynamic analysis. Results showed higher forces along the longitudinal axis in skiing and similar forces for skiing and snowboarding in anterior-posterior and mediolateral direction. Joint moments were consistently greater during a snowboard turn, but more fluctuations were observed in skiing. Hence, when comparing joint loading between <b>carved</b> <b>ski</b> and snowboard turns, one should differentiate between forces and moments, including the direction of forces and moments and the turn phase...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: During {{the past}} five decades {{recreational}} alpine skiing has become increasingly safer. The numerous annual media reports on ski injuries have to be interpreted {{on the basis of}} the tremendous numbers of skiers. These favourable changes seem primarily be due to the introduction of short <b>carving</b> <b>skis,</b> more rigid and comfortable ski boots, the use of protective gear like helmets, and the optimized preparation of ski slopes. The associated health benefits from skiing, especially arising from its association with a healthier life style, and possibly also from effects related to hypoxia preconditioning and increasing subjective vitality by natural elements clearly outweigh the health hazards. Technical improvements will likely help further reducing the injury risk. At least hypothetically, each individual skier could help to prevent injuries by the development of an appropriate physical fitness and responsible behaviour on ski slopes thereby optimizing the risk-benefit ratio of alpine skiing...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: New {{equipment}} and techniques in winter sports, such as <b>carving</b> <b>skis</b> and snowboards, have brought up new trauma patterns into {{the spectrum of}} leisure trauma. The injuries resemble high-energy trauma known from road crashes. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the incidence of acute traumatic descending aortic rupture in recreational skiing-crashes. MATERIAL: Between January 1995 and December 2004, 22 patients were admitted to our hospital for aortic rupture. Four patients had skiing crashes (18. 2 %). Mean age was 31 years, all patients were male. In two cases, aortic rupture was associated with fractures of the upper and lower extremities. One patient additionally had a cerebral contusion with an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. In two patients, isolated aortic rupture was diagnosed. RESULTS: Two patients were treated by graft interposition, and one by endograft. One patient arrived under mechanical resuscitation without blood pressure. He died at admission. He had been observed for 5 hours in another hospital, complaining of severe intrascapular back pain, before transport to our trauma unit for unknown bleeding. In the other three cases, treatment was successful. CONCLUSION: Rescue services and paramedics should be aware of this new type of injury. Acute aortic rupture has to be considered as possible injury in high velocity skiing crashes...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the behavior of the skis on snow depending on sex, type of ski and the level of training of the technical skier. Material: in the research participated 57 skiers, generally of age 26 +- 8. 62 years (34 males and 23 females) at the ski center of Parnassos (Greece). The evaluation of the ski behavior on snow came up via the scores on Test 1 to Test 5 in practice, to the rating scale from 0 to 10 respectively. The participants, after performing daily training with their skis completed the questionnaire. The questionnaire included the following elements: sex, height, weight, the type of skis and the type of TEST as: 1 - 2) behavior of skis in long and short turning radius, respectively, 3) grip of the ski edges in turn, 4) stability of ski riding, 5) usage of general muscle strength (fatigue). Results: The correlation between the first four tests (Test 1 - 4) was significant at statistical significance level, apart from test 5, which shows reduced physical fitness of the skier. Also the majority of skiers prefer parabolic skis (carving ski), although the racing skis were highly rated. Conclusions: The widespread (<b>carving</b> <b>skis)</b> are skis with medium score in both of all five tests in comparison to the Race ski. Finally, as expected, the highest score was given by the athletes (r = 0. 69 - 0. 99). It is recommended for further research of the correct selection of the ski in relation to: the physical fitness of the skier, prevention and injuries...|$|E

40|$|The alpine skiing has {{undergone}} major changes and adjustments due to both technological innovations {{of materials and}} update of theoretical and methodological concepts on all levels of specific training. The purpose: the introduction of technological innovation {{in the field of}} materials specif ic to <b>carving</b> <b>ski</b> causes a review of methodology, aiming at bringing the execution technique to superior indices in order to obtain positive results. The event took place in Poiana Brasov between December 2014 and March 2015, on an 800 m long slope and comp rised a single experimental group made of four males and four females, cadet category, that carried out two lessons per day. The tests targeted the technique level for slalom skiing and giant slalom skiing, having in view four criteria: leg work, basin mov ement, torso position and arms work. As a result of the research and of the statistic - mathematical analysis of the individual values, the giant slalom race registered an average improvement of 3. 5 points between the tests, while the slalom race registered 4 points. In conclusion, the use of a specific methodology applied scientifically, which aims to select the most efficient means of action specific to children’s ski, determines technical improvement at an advanced level...|$|R

50|$|Ski {{design has}} evolved {{enormously}} since {{the beginnings of}} the modern sport in mid-19th-century Norway. Modern skis typically have steel edges, camber, side cut, and possibly reverse camber. During the 1990s side cut became more pronounced {{to make it easier to}} <b>carve</b> turns. Alpine <b>skis</b> typically have fixed-heel bindings. Specialised types of alpine skis exist for certain uses, including twin-tip skis for freestyle skiing, alpine touring ski, and monoski.|$|R
50|$|Sidecut is {{the subtle}} {{hourglass}} {{shape of the}} ski, viewed from the top. Skis have had some sidecut since before 1808, when it was invented by Norwegian artisans. Since that time, the straight ski with parallel edges is only used as a light cross country ski and for modern jumping skis. In alpine skis, sidecut shape has grown gradually deeper over the decades. Today deep sidecuts are used to help <b>skis</b> <b>carve</b> short, clean turns.|$|R
