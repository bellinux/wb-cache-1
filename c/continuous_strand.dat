2500|$|In the Late Republican era, Cicero speculated in Stoic {{terms on}} a {{distinction}} between res divina ("divine matters"), which were spiritual and godly, and res humanae ("human affairs"), which were material and temporal. Balancing intellectual skepticism with his role as augur and senator, Cicero concludes {{that it is better}} to honour the gods, even if there is no incontrovertible evidence of their existence. Religio was a matter of transactional reciprocity (do ut des, [...] "I give, that you may give"), and piety was a system of offering honors and receiving benefactions. State religion provided a bridge between the divine will and the ordering of human affairs, with the city as earthly home to the gods and the center of Roman order. Cult to the State gods would benefit the community: cult offered by individuals to their personal deities sought only their own interest. The religions and offices of the state were entwined: its senior priesthoods were held by its senior magistrates. This represented a <b>continuous</b> <b>strand</b> in Rome's religious, social and political life, from the days of the kings, then of the rex sacrorum, then of the pontifex maximus and later the emperor, the highest magistrates had access to the most powerful gods of Rome. Public religion at Rome incorporated local and regional cults from the earliest period; as the empire expanded, gods and cults of both allies and the conquered were imported. The simultaneous preservation and subordination of others' religions facilitated unity under Rome rule and fostered mutual religious tolerance within the hierarchy.|$|E
40|$|The RuvC protein of Escherichia coli {{resolves}} Holliday junctions during {{genetic recombination}} and the postreplicational repair of DNA damage. Using synthetic Holliday junctions that are constrained to adopt defined isomeric configurations, {{we show that}} resolution occurs by symmetric cleavage of the continuous (noncrossing) pair of DNA strands. This result contrasts with that observed with phage T 4 endonuclease VII, which cleaves the pair of crossing strands. In the presence of RuvC, the pair of <b>continuous</b> <b>strands</b> (i. e., the target strands for cleavage) exhibit a hypersensitivity to hydroxyl radicals.

40|$|The junction-resolving enzyme endonuclease I is {{selective}} for {{the structure of}} the DNA four-way (Holliday) junction. The enzyme binds to a four-way junction in two possible orientations, with a 4 : 1 ratio, opening the DNA structure at the centre and changing the global structure into a 90 ° cross of approximately coaxial helices. The nuclease cleaves the <b>continuous</b> <b>strands</b> of the junction in each orientation. Binding leads to pronounced regions of protection of the DNA against hydroxyl radical attack. Using all this information together with the known structure of the enzyme and {{the structure of the}} BglI–DNA complex, we have constructed a model of the complex of endonuclease I and a DNA junction. This shows how the enzyme {{is selective}} for the structure of a four-way junction, such that both <b>continuous</b> <b>strands</b> can be accommodated into the two active sites so that a productive resolution event is possible...|$|R

5000|$|At the Lyocell mill, {{rolls of}} pulp are broken into one-inch squares and {{dissolved}} in N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, giving a solution called [...] "dope." [...] The filtered cellulose solution is then pumped through spinnerets, devices {{used with a}} variety of manmade fibres. The spinneret is pierced with small holes rather like a showerhead; when the solution is forced through it, <b>continuous</b> <b>strands</b> of filament come out. The fibres are drawn in air to align the cellulose molecules, giving the Lyocell fibres its characteristic high strength. The fibres are then immersed into a water bath, where desolvation of the cellulose sets the fibre strands; the bath contains some dilute amine oxide in a steady state concentration. Then the fibers are washed with de-mineralised water. The Lyocell fibre next passes to a drying area, where the water is evaporated from it.|$|R

In fact there was a long period, from 1587 well into the 17th century, when this division among Catholic priests in England was prominent. The idea that there was a <b>continuous</b> <b>strand</b> of anti-Jesuit agitation in these troubles was launched early by Robert Parsons, but is not now accepted in unqualified form.|$|E

500|$|As DNA {{around the}} double-strand break is cut back, the {{single-stranded}} 3' overhangs being produced are coated with the RPA protein, which prevents the 3' overhangs from sticking to themselves. [...] A protein called Rad52 then binds {{each of the}} repeat sequences {{on either side of}} the break, and aligns them to enable the two complementary repeat sequences to anneal. [...] After annealing is complete, leftover non-homologous flaps of the 3' overhangs are cut away by a set of nucleases, known as Rad1/Rad10, which are brought to the flaps by the Saw1 and Slx4 proteins. [...] New DNA synthesis fills in any gaps, and ligation restores the DNA duplex as two <b>continuous</b> <b>strands.</b> [...] The DNA sequence between the repeats is always lost, as is one of the two repeats. [...] The SSA pathway is considered mutagenic since it results in such deletions of genetic material.|$|R
40|$|Lambda {{site-specific}} recombination proceeds {{by a pair}} of sequential strand exchanges that first generate and then resolve a Holliday junction intermediate. A family of synthetic Holliday junctions with the branch point constrained {{to the center of the}} 7 bp overlap region was used to show that resolution of the top strands and resolution of the bottom strands are symmetrical but stereochemically distinct processes. Lambda integrase is sensitive to isomeric structure, preferentially resolving the pair of strands that are crossed in the protein-free Holliday junction. At the branch point of stacked immobile Holliday junctions, the number of purines is preferentially maximized in the crossed (versus <b>continuous)</b> <b>strands</b> if there is an inequality of purines between strands of opposite polarity. This stacking preference was used to anticipate the resolution bias of freely mobile junctions and thereby to reinforce the conclusions with monomobile junctions. The results provide a strong indication that in the complete recombination reaction a restacking of helices occurs between the top and bottom strand exchanges...|$|R

25|$|Chewing gum {{can come}} in a variety of formats ranging from 1.4-6.9 grams/piece and {{products}} can be differentiated by the consumers’ intent to form bubbles or the sugar/ sugarless dichotomy. Chewing gum typically comes in three formats: tablets, coated pellets, and sticks/ slabs. Bubble gum typically come in three formats as well: tablets, hollow balls, and cubes or chunks. Stick, slab, and tab gums typically come in packs of about 5-17 sticks and their medium size allows for softer texture. Pellet gums, or dragée gums, are pillow shaped pieces that are almost always coated. Packaging of pellet gums can vary from boxes to bottles to blister packs. The coating of pellet gum allows for the opportunity for multiple flavor sensations, since coating is done in a layering process and different flavor attributes can be added to various layers.

50|$|In the {{replication}} process, RNase H {{removes the}} RNA primer (created by primase) from the lagging strand and then polymerase I fills in the necessary nucleotides between the Okazaki fragments (see DNA replication) in a 5'→3' direction, proofreading for mistakes as it goes. It is a template-dependent enzyme—it only adds nucleotides that correctly base pair with an existing DNA strand {{acting as a}} template. It is crucial that these nucleotides are in the proper orientation and geometry to base pair with the DNA template strand so that DNA ligase can join the various fragments together into a <b>continuous</b> <b>strand</b> of DNA. Studies of polymerase I have confirmed that different dNTPs can bind to the same active site on polymerase I. Polymerase I is able to actively discriminate between the different dNTPs only after it undergoes a conformational change. Once this change has occurred, Pol I checks for proper geometry and proper alignment of the base pair, formed between bound dNTP and a matching base on the template strand. The correct geometry of A=T and G≡C base pairs {{are the only ones}} that can fit in the active site. However, {{it is important to know}} that one in every 104 to 105 nucleotides is added incorrectly. Nevertheless, Pol I will be there to fix this error in DNA replication using its selective method of active discrimination.|$|E
