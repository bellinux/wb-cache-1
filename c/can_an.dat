5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was backed up by the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as <b>can</b> <b>an</b> advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E
25|$|The fort had {{a typical}} {{rectangular}} 'Playing Card' shape and had four gates, {{being surrounded by}} a ditch. Despite never having systematically excavated the site, archaeologists have found {{the remains of the}} headquarters buildings, a bathhouse and some barracks buildings through the use of geophysical survey. Remains of a nearby vicus have been found, and its traces can be seen through aerial photography. A cemetery was also discovered in the 20th century to the southwest of the fort, with examples of stone-lined burials and cremations sites. The fact that the fort is located on fields that have not been ploughed means its condition is remarkable, although stone robbing has taken its toll. A column, probably from the colonnade of the Commandant's House, {{can be found in the}} nearby All Saints' Parish Church, as <b>can</b> <b>an</b> altar dedicated to the goddess Garmangabis.|$|E
25|$|It is both biochemically and {{medically}} {{interesting how}} tarantula hawk venom works. How <b>can</b> <b>an</b> essentially non-toxic venom that causes so much pain, described as blinding, debilitating, and shockingly electric by Schmidt, subside in only three minutes in humans? Only the bullet ant is ranked {{higher than the}} tarantula hawk’s sting on Schmidt’s Sting Pain Index. How does it permanently paralyze a tarantula, yet keep it alive? It is also evolutionarily interesting and significant how such a toxin evolved. Selection pressure by potential vertebrate predators would have favored individuals with painful venom components, but not vertebrate-lethal components. At the same time, selection pressure against venom lethality towards prey and subsequent loss of prey to spoilage would be very strong. The tarantula hawk’s venom is a specific, evolutionarily tailored cocktail of compounds best suited to the wasps’ needs. Studying tarantula hawk venom may help us gain insight into treating human problems like chronic pain from injury or disease.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Calcineurin (<b>CaN)</b> is <b>a</b> {{phosphatase}} {{involved in}} synaptic plasticity. A haplotype of the PPP 3 CC gene, which encodes the gamma isoform of the catalytic subunit (<b>CaN</b> <b>A),</b> {{has been associated}} with schizophrenia. However, the distribution of <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> gamma is not established, nor whether its expression changes in schizophrenia. METHODS: <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> expression was analyzed in the hippocampal formation of 13 patients with schizophrenia and 12 controls. All three isoforms were examined, using in situ hybridization histochemistry, RT-PCR, and laser-assisted microdissection. <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> protein was assessed using ELISA and immunohistochemistry. <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> mRNAs were also measured in rats treated with haloperidol or chlorpromazine. RESULTS: CaN was prominent in excitatory neurons. <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> alpha and A beta isoforms were abundant in all subfields, but <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> gamma was not reliably detected in CA 1. <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> protein, and all three mRNAs, were decreased in schizophrenia. The mRNA reductions were present in all subfields measured, except CA 1. <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> mRNAs were unaltered in the antipsychotic-treated rats. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased CaN expression extends the evidence for aberrant hippocampal synaptic plasticity in schizophrenia, which particularly affects glutamatergic transmission, and which leaves CA 1 relatively unaffected. Reduced expression of PPP 3 CC may underlie its genetic involvement in the disorder...|$|R

The partition had gripped the Indian subcontinent with religious violence and the streets were filled with corpses. Some writers credit Gandhi's fasting and protests stopped the religious riots and communal violence. Others do not.

The prison coroner tells Scully that the first guard's lungs were completely infested with the larvae, belonging to the green bottle fly. Meanwhile, Mulder talks to Roque, who wants a transfer out of the prison in exchange for revealing the remaining three people on the list. Brodeur later finds Fornier's headless body in his office. While searching Neech's cell, Mulder discovers evidence of his obsession with reincarnation. Scully, of course, is skeptical. They later talk to Neech's fearful widow, Danielle Manley (April Grace), who is secretly seeing Parmelly. Roque is brought to the showers, where he is beaten to death by Brodeur after revealing he is the fifth person on the list.|$|E
500|$|In Somerset, turnpike roads {{began in}} 1707 with the {{establishment}} of the Bath Trust, but turnpikes did not reach the coalfield until the mid-1700s. The Bristol Trust, which passed close to the western boundary of the coalfield, established in 1727 was of little importance, as Bristol was never a significant market, having its own coalfield. Turnpikes facilitated the movement of coal, and John Billingsley enthused [...] "Nothing so much contributes to the improvement of a county as good roads. Before the establishment of turnpikes, many parts of the county were scarcely accessible. .... coal was carried on horses' backs to the distance of fifteen or twenty miles from the colliery; each horse carried about two hundred and half weight.

40|$|Calcineurin (<b>CaN),</b> <b>a</b> {{member of}} ser/thr protein phosphatase, was cloned from bovine retina. The peptide {{sequence}} of <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> subunit is consisted of 511 amino acid residues. A 10 amino acid (A-T-V-E-A-I-E-A-D-E-A) deletion before the autoinhibitory domain {{was observed in}} bovine retina <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> compared to bovine brain <b>CaN</b> <b>A.</b> The study on CaN activity and regulation demonstrated that different metal ions have different effects on its phosphatase activity. Ni 2 + {{was found to be}} the strongest stimulator while Zn 2 + was found to inhibit CaN phosphatase activity. Mn 2 + was a relatively less effective stimulator compared to Ni 2 +. Fe 2 + was also able to stimulate CaN phosphatase activity; in contrast, a previous study found Fe 2 + slightly inhibited bovine brain CaN activity. The residues at 97 - 201 were found to be essential for bovine retina <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> phosphatase activity. The residues at 407 - 456 also had an inhibitory effect on <b>CaN</b> <b>A</b> phosphatase activity in addition to the previously known auto inhibitory domain at 457 - 480.

500|$|Turn Based - Much like in Dungeons and Dragons {{this method}} of {{conflict}} resolution is taken in turns. This combat format is the primary system used in Theater-style LARPs. How turns work {{and what can be}} done during each turn is determined by the creator's of the game. Generally, who goes first is determined by some form of indicator and in the case of LARPs it is usually who acts first, this begins the engagement, essentially giving them an opportunity attack. Movement during a turn is determined by that character's movement speed, while actions are can be either consistent and unchanged rules or character specific. Each individual in the conflict has certain actions they can take on their turn. Chess is an example of a turn based game where who goes first is determined by the color of the pieces. That player now gets to make their movement, which in this case movement is synonymous to action. After their action resolves the other player's turn begins. This differs from the 'No-Touch' System, because a Turn Based LARP does not also mean no touching, although it <b>can.</b> <b>An</b> action from one character could end with their hand on the other character's shoulder. An example of a LARP that utilizes this system is the Otakon convention which also has its [...]|$|E
