25|$|Cross-breed animals : Genetic hybrids of {{wild and}} {{domestic}} parents. They may be forms intermediate between both parents, forms {{more similar to}} one parent than the other, or unique forms distinct from both parents. Hybrids <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> bred for specific characteristics or can arise unintentionally {{as the result of}} contact with wild individuals.|$|E
25|$|A void is when {{a player}} {{does not have any}} cards of a certain suit. Generally this is a highly {{advantageous}} situation, because it prevents the player from winning any points in that suit, and provides a means to dispose of poor cards. These <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> created with good passing strategy, or appear by themselves.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 205 million pregnancies occur {{each year}} worldwide. Over a third are {{unintended}} {{and about a}} fifth end in induced abortion. Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. In the United Kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus. A pregnancy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses. Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and doctor or a woman's personal preference.|$|E

50|$|In humans, coital vocalizations {{are linked}} to orgasm, hence {{occurring}} during copulation and serving {{as an expression of}} sexual pleasure. Vocalizations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used <b>intentionally</b> by women in order to boost the self-esteem of their partner and to cause quicker ejaculation.|$|R
5000|$|Abrasion is {{the process}} of scuffing, scratching, wearing down, marring, or rubbing away. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> imposed in a {{controlled}} process using an abrasive. Abrasion can be an undesirable effect of exposure to normal use or exposure to the elements.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{relative}} term, anticlimax requires {{a greater or}} lesser climax to precede it in order to have proper effect. An anticlimax <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> employed only for a jocular or satiric purpose. It frequently partakes of the nature of antithesis, as in: ...|$|E
50|$|A trust <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> {{created during}} the settlor's life (inter Vivos) by {{declaration}} or transfer. A deceased estate is a testamentary trust which automatically arises {{on the death}} of the testator. Courts may also create trusts, such as constructive trusts, as an equitable remedy.|$|E
5000|$|A spin is {{a special}} {{category}} of stall resulting in autorotation about the vertical axis and a shallow, rotating, downward path. Spins <b>can</b> <b>be</b> entered <b>intentionally</b> or unintentionally, from any flight attitude if the aircraft has sufficient yaw while at the stall point.|$|R
50|$|Mega-events that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> set to <b>intentionally</b> {{destabilize the}} playing field from time to time, to keep things interesting.|$|R
50|$|DNA {{fragmentation}} is {{the separation}} or breaking of DNA strands into pieces. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done <b>intentionally</b> by laboratory personnel or by cells, or can occur spontaneously. Spontaneous or accidental DNA fragmentation is fragmentation that gradually accumulates in a cell. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> measured by e.g. the Comet assay {{or by the}} TUNEL assay.|$|R
50|$|Microwave {{damage to}} tissues <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> {{exploited}} as a therapeutic technique, e.g. radiofrequency ablation and radiofrequency lesioning.

5000|$|... (I.E: Michael Hallock) Digression (parekbasis in Greek, egressio, digressio and {{excursion}} in Latin) is {{a section}} of a composition or speech that marks a temporary shift of subject; the digression ends when the writer or speaker returns to the main topic. Digressions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used <b>intentionally</b> as a stylistic or rhetorical device.|$|R
5000|$|Identity change <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used <b>intentionally</b> {{to guide}} {{organizational}} change. For example, rather than seeking {{to answer the}} question: [...] "who are we as an organization?" [...] an organization may ask [...] "is this who {{we want to be}} an organization?" [...] Albert and Whetten identified three main paths organizational identity may take over time: ...|$|R
50|$|Decarburization <b>can</b> <b>be</b> either {{advantageous}} or detrimental, {{depending on}} the application for which the metal will be used. It is thus both something that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done <b>intentionally</b> as a step in a manufacturing process, or something that happens as {{a side effect of}} a process (such as rolling) and must be either prevented or later reversed (such as via a carburization step).|$|R

50|$|In {{computer}} science, starvation is {{a problem}} encountered in concurrent computing where a process is perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work. Starvation {{may be caused by}} errors in a scheduling or mutual exclusion algorithm, but can also be caused by resource leaks, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> caused via a denial-of-service attack such as a fork bomb.|$|E
5000|$|The {{responses}} {{can have}} a variety of causes, from an involuntary reflex reaction to exposure or inexposure to light — in low light conditions a dilated pupil lets more light into the eye — or it may indicate interest in the subject of attention, or sexual stimulation. [...] The pupils contract immediately before REM sleep begins. A pupillary response <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> conditioned as a Pavlovian response to some stimuli.|$|E
50|$|The humiliation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> extended; <b>intentionally</b> or not; {{by leaving}} visible marks, such as scars, notably on body parts that are {{normally}} left visible. This {{also serves as}} a virtually indelible criminal record. This <b>can</b> even <b>be</b> the main intention of the punishment, {{as in the case of}} scarifications, such as branding. It invariably is essential in forms of mutilation, such as ear cropping, though the functional loss is even greater; pain may even <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> minimized as in the case of surgical amputation, eliminating the risk of accidental death. Tarring and feathering also serves as means of extended humiliation.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though some}} verbs in English {{may seem like}} they <b>can</b> only <b>be</b> done <b>intentionally,</b> there <b>are</b> ways to alter {{the way they are}} understood. When English {{speakers}} want to be clear about whether an action <b>was</b> done <b>intentionally</b> or not, adverbs such as “intentionally”, or “accidentally” are included in the sentence. Examples are shown below.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example is}} saying [...] "The Lord is a shoving leopard" [...] instead of [...] "The Lord is a loving shepherd." [...] While spoonerisms are {{commonly}} heard as slips of the tongue, they <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> used <b>intentionally</b> as {{a play on}} words.|$|R
50|$|The {{conditions}} {{identified by}} Eoyang are necessary {{and sufficient to}} create patterns that emerge and can be perceived {{in all kinds of}} complex adaptive systems. Depending on the interactions of those conditions, the emergence process and its outcomes can be fast or slow, direct or meandering, and ambiguous or clear. The same conditions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> changed to influence the current situation and emerging future patterns of the system. The three conditions are described as the Eoyang CDE Model.|$|E

5000|$|The tube is a {{distortion}} of spacetime that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>intentionally</b> created (using hypothetical technology) {{in the wake}} of travel near the speed of light. The Krasnikov tube allows for a return trip that takes you back to the time right after you left.This several light-year long artificial [...] "tube" [...] might arguably constitute a megastructure, but unlike most megastructures it's not constructed of physical matter such as titanium or plastic, but instead is just a {{distortion of}} spacetime.Experiencing the effect requires that the traveler race along the tube at speeds close to that of light.|$|E
25|$|Invasive species <b>can</b> <b>be</b> transported <b>intentionally</b> or accidentally. Many {{invasive}} species originate in shipping areas {{from where they}} are unintentionally transported to their new location. Sometimes human populations intentionally introduce species into new landscapes to serve various purposes, ranging from decoration to erosion control. These species can later become invasive and dramatically modify the landscape. It {{is important to note}} that not all exotic species are invasive; in fact, the majority of newly introduced species never become invasive.|$|R
500|$|Every diamond {{contains}} atoms {{other than}} carbon in concentrations detectable by analytical techniques. Those atoms can aggregate into macroscopic phases called inclusions. Impurities are generally avoided, but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> introduced <b>intentionally</b> {{as a way}} to control certain properties of the diamond. Growth processes of synthetic diamond, using solvent-catalysts, generally lead to formation of a number of impurity-related complex centers, involving transition metal atoms (such as nickel, cobalt or iron), which [...] affect the electronic properties of the material.|$|R
