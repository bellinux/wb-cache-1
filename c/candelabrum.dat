5|$|The high altar stone reredos are by John Loughborough Pearson of 1899. The {{three rows}} of choir stalls are {{mostly from the}} late 19th century with Flamboyant traceried ends. There are also 28 misericords dating from 1515–1526, {{installed}} by Robert Elyot, Abbot of St. Augustine's, with carvings largely based on Aesop's Fables. In the Berkeley chapel is a very rare <b>candelabrum</b> of 1450 from the Temple church in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The rare finger pillory at {{the west}} end immobilised {{offenders}} without exposing them to the public degradation associated with the stocks. In the centre aisle hangs a large brass <b>candelabrum</b> donated by Leonard Piddocke, High Bailiff of Leicester, in 1733. It is surmounted by a brass dove and was made by William Parsons of London. Some of the branches were stolen in 1776, but soon recovered.|$|E
5|$|The chancel, {{which has}} a ceiling {{decorated}} by C. E. Kempe, has three windows {{in the style of}} the late 12th century, and a priest's door built into the south side circa 1250. A south porch was built in 1621 at the behest of Dr Robert Burton, whose arms are carved in the gable above the date. A <b>candelabrum</b> given by Ann Kendall in 1705 hangs in the chancel. The chancel ceiling was decorated with a pattern of gold stars on a blue background in 1914. Two years later, an altar was erected at the east end of the north aisle, and an aumbry placed in the north wall of the chancel. The royal arms of William IV are displayed in the tower.|$|E

50|$|Londoño was {{replaced}} by Mario Ángel, and he by Antonio Ángel in 1956. Antonio Ángel bought the via crucis, the lamps and the <b>candelabrums.</b> On March 18 of 1957, the Diocese of Sonsón was created (today, the Diocese of Sonsón-Rionegro), and the parish {{became a part of}} the new diocese.|$|R
500|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like 'Be Our Guest' provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansbury's performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singer's delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disney's first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during 'Be Our Guest'... looked pretty bad and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "'Be Our Guest'... is the closest thing in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly 'Under the Sea' extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman's review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, 'Be Our Guest,'... sorry to say, is no 'Under the Sea'." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the <b>Candelabrum's</b> Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, 'Be Our Guest,' in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them, is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, 'Under the Sea.' But it's just under par." ...|$|R
5|$|The park's {{predominant}} {{environment is}} open grass plain with scattered Acacia bushes. The western uplands {{of the park}} have highland dry forest with stands of Olea africana, Croton dichogamus, Brachylaena hutchinsii, and Calodendrum. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. Themeda, cypress, Digitaria, and Cynodon species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked Acacia xanthophloea. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river {{in the south of}} the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly Acacia and Euphorbia <b>candelabrum.</b> Other tree species include Apodytes dimidiata, Canthium schimperiana, Elaeodendron buchananii, Ficus eriocarpa, Aspilia mossambicensis, Rhus natalensis, and Newtonia species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include Euphorbia brevitorta, Drimia calcarata, and Murdannia clarkeana.|$|E
25|$|Among other sculptural {{work is the}} Easter <b>candelabrum</b> in the apse, {{finished}} in 1515 by Andrea Briosco and considered his masterwork. The high altar area features the bronze Madonna with Child and six statues of Saints by Donatello, who also executed four reliefs with episodes of life of St. Anthony.|$|E
25|$|The {{stained glass}} windows are heavily {{oriented}} towards abstract forms. Together with the Torah ark, they form {{the figure of a}} geometrical seven-branched <b>candelabrum</b> or menorah. The other sanctuary walls are pale beige and extremely simple in comparison. During the day, the interior is illuminated by natural light entering through the translucent walls overhead. At night, the entire building glows from interior artificial lighting.|$|E
25|$|Under Louis the Pious in the 9th century, a stone {{column was}} dug up at Obermarsberg in Westphalia, Germany and {{relocated}} to the Hildesheim cathedral in Hildesheim, Lower Saxony, Germany. The column was reportedly then {{used as a}} <b>candelabrum</b> until at least the late 19th century. In the 13th century, {{the destruction of the}} Irminsul by Charlemagne was recorded as having still been commemorated at Hildesheim on the Saturday after Laetare Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Then further back, {{higher than}} the <b>candelabrum,</b> and much {{higher than the}} altar, rose the Moloch, all of iron, and with gaping {{apertures}} in his human breast. His outspread wings were stretched upon the wall, his tapering hands reached down to the ground; three black stones bordered by yellow circles represented three eyeballs on his brow, and his bull's head was raised with a terrible effort as if in order to bellow.|$|E
25|$|The Onias {{temple was}} not exactly similar to the Temple at Jerusalem, being more {{in the form of}} a high tower; and as regards the {{interior}} arrangement, it had not a <b>candelabrum,</b> but a hanging lamp. The building had a court (τέμενος) which was surrounded by a brick wall with stone gates. The king endowed the temple with large revenues—a fact that may have suggested to the writer of the letters mentioned above the wealth of wood and sacrificial animals.|$|E
25|$|The south panel {{depicts the}} spoils {{taken from the}} Temple in Jerusalem. The golden <b>candelabrum</b> or Menorah is the main focus and is carved in deep relief. Other sacred objects being carried in the triumphal {{procession}} are the Gold Trumpets, the fire pans for removing the ashes from the altar, and the Table of Shew bread. These spoils were likely originally colored gold, with the background in blue. In 2012 the Arch of Titus Digital Restoration Project discovered remains of yellow ochre paint on the menorah relief.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantine Christian {{observance}} of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, begins on Thursday {{night with the}} Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels. Scattered throughout this Matins service are twelve readings from {{all four of the}} Gospels which recount the events of the Passion from the Last Supper through the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus. Some churches have a <b>candelabrum</b> with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.|$|E
25|$|For decades, {{part of the}} {{palatial}} {{complex of}} al-Sinnabra was misidentified as a Byzantine era (c. 330-620 CE) synagogue because of a column base engraved with a seven-branched <b>candelabrum.</b> This thesis was questioned by Ronny Reich in 1993. Donald Whitcomb suggested the complex was the qasr of al-Sinnabra in 2002, and excavations carried out in 2010 showed his analysis to be correct. Constructed in the 7th century by Mu'awiya {{and one of his}} successors, Abdel Malik, who also commissioned the building of the Dome of the Rock in the Old City of Jerusalem, it likely represents the earliest Umayyad complex of this type yet to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|The lights can be candles or oil lamps. Electric {{lights are}} {{sometimes}} used and are acceptable {{in places where}} open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special <b>candelabrum</b> referred to as either a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term) or a menorah (the traditional name, simply Hebrew for 'lamp'). Many families use an oil lamp (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah. Like the candle Chanukiah, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shamash light.|$|E

500|$|In 1669 a new King's Sun Dial {{was erected}} for Charles II, {{designed}} by Father Francis Hall, a Jesuit priest. It {{was an extremely}} elaborate construction that Hall detailed in a book, Explication of the Diall, that he published in 1673 to explain how it operated. It stood [...] high and was constructed of stone, brass and wood, with gilded ironwork and painted glass panels to accompany its 270 component dials. It resembled [...] "a fountain of glass spheres, or a giant <b>candelabrum</b> with tiered, branching arms ending in crystal globes", which showed not only the {{hours of the day}} but [...] "many things also belonging to geography, astrology, and astronomy, by the sun's shadow made visible to the eye." ...|$|E
2500|$|P.L.O. Guy and Pesach Bar-Adon, two Israeli archaeologists {{excavated}} the compound, falsely {{identifying a}} building {{there as a}} 5th-6th century synagogue, {{because of the presence}} of a column base engraved with a seven-branched <b>candelabrum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Formerly {{there was}} an {{imposing}} seven-branched brass <b>candelabrum</b> {{in front of the}} Ark, but {{on the eve of the}} German invasion of the city during World War I, it was sent off to Moscow. There also once was a 'Chair of Elijah" [...] in the northwest corner on which the rite of Brit milah was performed.|$|E
2500|$|P.L.O. Guy and Pesach Bar-Adon, two Israeli archaeologists {{excavated}} the compound, falsely {{identifying a}} building {{there as a}} 5th-6th century Palestinian synagogue, {{because of the presence}} of a column base engraved with a seven-branched <b>candelabrum.</b> The [...] "synagogue" [...] was incorporated into the Beth Yerah National Park which served as a popular tourist destination during the 1950s and 1960s, but has since been closed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fate of the}} menorah used in the Second Temple is {{recorded}} by Josephus, who states that it was brought to Rome and carried along during the triumph of Vespasian and Titus. The menorah was deposited afterwards in the Temple of Peace in Rome. The relief on the wall at the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts a scene of Roman soldiers carrying away the spoils of the Second Temple, in particular, the seven-branched menorah, or <b>candelabrum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Other {{traditional}} {{features include}} a continually lit lamp or lantern, usually electric in contemporary synagogues, called the [...] (...) , the [...] "Eternal Light", {{used as a}} reminder of the western lamp of the menorah of the Temple in Jerusalem, which remained miraculously lit perpetually. Many have an elaborate chair named for the prophet Elijah, which is only sat upon during the ceremony of Brit milah. Many synagogues have a large seven-branched <b>candelabrum</b> commemorating the full Menorah. Most contemporary synagogues also feature a lectern for the rabbi.|$|E
2500|$|There is also {{usually a}} {{constantly}} lighted lamp, Ner tamid, or a <b>candelabrum,</b> lighted during services, near a spot {{similar to the}} position of the original Menorah. At the center of the synagogue is a large elevated area, known as the bimah, where the Torah is read. This is equivalent to the Tabernacle's altars upon which incense and animal sacrifices were offered. On the main holidays the priests, kohanim, gather {{at the front of the}} synagogue to bless the congregation as did their priestly ancestors in the Tabernacle from Aaron onwards (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{festival is}} {{observed}} by the kindling {{of the lights}} of a unique <b>candelabrum,</b> the nine-branched menorah (also called a Chanukiah/Hanukiah), one additional light on each night of the holiday, progressing to eight on the final night. The typical menorah consists of eight branches with an additional visually distinct branch. The extra light, with which the others are lit, is called a shamash ( [...] , [...] "attendant") and is given a distinct location, usually above or below the rest. Other Hanukkah festivities include playing dreidel and eating oil-based foods such as doughnuts and latkes. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.|$|E
2500|$|The Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, {{with its}} arcaded façade and {{incomplete}} square campanile (begun in 1279 by the archbishop Romano Capodiferro) {{dates from the}} 9th century. It was rebuilt in 1114, the façade inspired by the Pisan Gothic style. Its bronze doors, adorned with bas-reliefs, are notable example of Romanesque art which may belong {{to the beginning of}} the 13th century. The interior is in the form of a basilica, the double aisles carried on ancient columns. There are ambones resting on columns supported by lions, and decorated with reliefs and coloured marble mosaic, and a <b>candelabrum</b> of 1311. A marble statue of the apostle San Bartolomeo, by Nicola da Monteforte, is also from the 14th century. [...] The cathedral also contains a statue of St. Giuseppe Moscati, a native of the area.|$|E
2500|$|The nave roof is arch-brace and hammerbeam {{in design}} and is dated 1650. [...] It was covered in lath and plaster during the 18thcentury and its {{structure}} was brought to light again in the 1891 restoration. [...] Over the south aisle is a single framed roof dating from 1380, {{which is the only}} one of its type in the county. [...] The octagonal font dates from the 15thcentury. [...] Most of the furniture and fittings were removed during restorations, but the two-tier brass <b>candelabrum</b> dating from the 18thcentury is still present. [...] In the chancel is a Flemish reredos from around 1500 and a copper memorial tablet to Henry Hardware who died in 1584. The east window of 1892 is by Kempe. The west window was donated in 2006 and was designed by Fiona Banner and Roy Coomber.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1992 {{documentary}} series Legacy, historian Michael Wood walked down a small lane in Kaifeng {{that he said}} {{is known as the}} [...] "alley of the sect who teach the Scriptures", that is, of the Jews. He mentioned that there are still Jews in Kaifeng today, but that they are reluctant to reveal themselves [...] "in the current political climate." [...] The documentary's companion book further states that one can still see a [...] "mezuzah on the door frame, and the <b>candelabrum</b> in the living room." [...] Similarly, in the documentary Quest for the Lost Tribes, by Canadian filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici, the film crew visits the home of an elderly Kaifeng Jew who explains the recent history of the Kaifeng Jews, shows some old photographs, and his identity papers that identify him {{as a member of the}} Jewish ethnic group. A recent documentary, Minyan in Kaifeng, documents and covers the present-day Kaifeng Jewish community in China during a trip to Kaifeng that was taken by some Jewish tourists.|$|E
2500|$|The Cathedral of Assunta e Sant'Erasmo {{was erected}} over a more ancient church, Santa Maria del Parco, and consecrated by Pope Paschal II in 1106: {{it had a}} nave with six aisles {{separated}} by columns with Gothic capitals. In 1778, however, two of the aisles were suppressed and the Gothic lines hidden. In the 13th century Moorish arches were added over the capitals. In 1663 the crypt was decorated in Baroque style. The interior houses a banner from the Battle of Lepanto, donated by Pope Pius V to Don John of Austria, who used it as his admiral's flag. The main sight {{of the church is}} however the marble Paschal <b>candelabrum,</b> standing 3.50 m tall, from the late 13th century: it is in Romanesque style, decorated with 48 reliefs in 4 vertical rows, telling the Stories of the Life of Jesus. There are also paintings by Giacinto Brandi and Giovanni Filippo Criscuolo. The cathedral contains the relics of St. Erasmus, transferred from Formia; the remarkable campanile, in Arab-Norman style, dates from the 12th century. At the base are slabs and [...] parts of columns from ancient Roman edifices.|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Liberace {{worked to}} refine his act. He added the <b>candelabrum</b> as his trademark, {{inspired}} by a similar prop in the Chopin biopic A Song to Remember (1945). He adopted [...] "Liberace" [...] as his stage name, making a point in press releases that it was pronounced [...] "Liber-Ah-chee". He wore white tie and tails for better visibility in large halls. Besides clubs and occasional work as an accompanist and rehearsal pianist, Liberace played for private parties, including those at the Park Avenue home of millionaire oilman J.Paul Getty. By 1947, he was billing himself as [...] "Liberace—the most amazing piano virtuoso of the present day". He {{had to have a}} piano to match his growing presence, so he bought a rare, oversized, gold-leafed Blüthner Grand, which he hyped up in his press kit as a [...] "priceless piano". (Later, he performed with an array of extravagant, custom-decorated pianos, some encrusted with rhinestones and mirrors.) [...] He moved to the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood in 1947 and was performing at local clubs, such as Ciro's and The Mocambo, for stars such as Rosalind Russell, Clark Gable, Gloria Swanson, and Shirley Temple. He did not always play to packed rooms, and he learned to perform with extra energy to thinner crowds, to maintain his own enthusiasm.|$|E
2500|$|Scarpia {{is eating}} supper {{in a room}} lit only by two candles and a <b>candelabrum</b> on his table. There is a prayer stool and a {{crucifix}} in an alcove near his bed. He orders Tosca, who has been locked in another room of the castle, {{to be brought to}} him. When she arrives, he tells her that Cavaradossi is to be hanged at dawn. He also tells her of his intense attraction to her and offers to spare Cavaradossi if she agrees to sleep with him. Tosca calls him a wild animal and repels his advances in disgust, which only serves to increase his desire. Scarpia then takes her to the window and shows her the scaffold awaiting her lover. Tosca [...] finally says that she will agree to his terms, but only after she has proof that Cavaradossi will be spared. Scarpia calls in Spoletta and in front of Tosca instructs him to stage a mock execution by firing squad with blanks in the riflemen's guns. After Spoletta leaves, Tosca demands that Scarpia also give her a document granting safe conduct out of the Roman States. As soon as he signs the document and starts to kiss her, she grabs a knife from the supper table and stabs Scarpia to death. Tosca removes the safe conduct from his hand and starts to leave, but then turns back. She places the two lighted candles on each side of Scarpia's body and puts the crucifix on his chest before quietly slipping out of the room.|$|E
60|$|But Gaston de Stainville {{was fully}} alert now; with sudden vigour he {{jumped to his}} feet and brought his fist {{crashing}} down on the table so that the <b>candelabrum,</b> the mugs, and decanters of wine shook under the blow.|$|E

60|$|The {{floor was}} spread with {{a carpet of}} the ruddy purple of porphyry, very soft and silent to the feet.

It was all in gilded bronze and the workmanship--as I was presently to learn--of that great artist and rogue Benvenuto Cellini. From this <b>candelabrum</b> there fell upon the board a soft golden radiance that struck bright gleams from crystals and plate of gold and silver.|$|E
60|$|Long--long I read--and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously {{the hours}} flew by {{and the deep}} midnight came.
