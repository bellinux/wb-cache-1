It is an important concept in surface phase formation, epitaxial growth, heterogeneous catalysis, and other topics in surface science. As such, the principles of surface diffusion are critical for the chemical production and semiconductor industries. Real-world applications relying heavily on these phenomena include catalytic converters, integrated circuits used in electronic devices, and silver halide salts used in photographic film.|$|E
5|$|Two {{special classes}} of protein {{deal with the}} ionic {{gradients}} found across cellular and sub-cellular membranes in nature- ion channels and ion pumps. Both pumps and channels are integral membrane proteins that pass through the bilayer, but their roles are quite different. Ion pumps are the proteins that build and maintain the chemical gradients by utilizing an external energy source to move ions against the concentration gradient to an area of higher <b>chemical</b> <b>potential.</b> The energy source can be ATP, {{as is the case}} for the Na+-K+ ATPase. Alternatively, the energy source can be another chemical gradient already in place, as in the Ca2+/Na+ antiporter. It is through the action of ion pumps that cells are able to regulate pH via the pumping of protons.|$|E

In the case of ordered phases, however, the situation is less straightforward, because the Helmholtz energy is a functional involving internal order parameters. Because of this, the <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials</b> are usually obtained numerically from the calculated integral Helmholtz energy. In this paper, we show how the component <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials</b> can be obtained analytically in ordered phases via the use of virtual cluster <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials.</b> Some examples are given which illustrate {{the simplicity of the}} method...|$|R
25|$|The <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> is {{explained}} here {{since it is}} the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> (Skaar, 1933). The <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium will occur at the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in <b>chemical</b> <b>potential,</b> and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).|$|E

Examples: (semiconductor physics) distinct quasi-Fermi levels (electron <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials)</b> in the conduction band and valence band; (spintronics) distinct spin-up and spin-down chemical potentials; (cryogenics) distinct parahydrogen and orthohydrogen <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{driving force}} of {{moisture}} movement is <b>chemical</b> <b>potential.</b> However, {{it is not always}} easy to relate <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> in wood to commonly observable variables, such as temperature and moisture content (Keey et al., 2000). Moisture in wood moves within the wood as liquid or vapour through several types of passageways, based {{on the nature of the}} driving force, (e.g. pressure or moisture gradient), and variations in wood structure (Langrish and Walker, 1993), as explained in the next section on driving forces for moisture movement. These pathways consist of cavities of the vessels, fibres, ray cells, pit chambers and their pit membrane openings, intercellular spaces and transitory cell wall passageways.|$|E
25|$|This formula, {{apart from}} the first vacuum energy term, is a special case of the general formula for {{particles}} obeying Bose–Einstein statistics. Since there is no restriction on {{the total number of}} photons, the <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> is zero.|$|E

25|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts {{is similar to}} that in mitochondria and takes the required energy from the proton motive force (PMF). However, chloroplasts rely more on the <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton <b>chemical</b> <b>potential</b> (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane electrical potential (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher membrane potential due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient. To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting chemiosmotic potential between the lumen and stroma is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the ATP synthase. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in ATP synthase, ADP + Pi are combined into ATP. In this manner, the light-dependent reactions are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.|$|E

It is shown that the WTPI method fails to accurately compute the <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials</b> of water and methanol in the liquid phase at low temperatures, while accurate <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials</b> in the liquid phase are computed using CFCGE MC method. For the CFCGE MC method, the statistical uncertainty for computed <b>chemical</b> <b>potentials</b> of water and methanol in the liquid phase are considerably smaller compared to the WTPI method.
