40|$|In many {{naval ships}} of fiber {{composite}} sandwich construction, an X-joint exists where the end bulkhead of the superstructure {{is attached to}} the deck, with an internal bulkhead placed in the same vertical plane below the deck. This joint is subjected to alternating tensile and compressive loading in the vertical direction for respectively hogging and sagging bending deformation of the hull girder. When the core material is polymer foam, such joints are often strengthened by the insertion of a higher density core material in the deck panel in the immediate region of the joint. The paper aims to improve the basis for the design of such X-joints, focusing on the prevention of crushing of the core under compressive load while ensuring adequate damage tolerance for the case of tensile load. Extensive material tests are reported, strain distributions are investigated by both laboratory tests and numerical modeling, and design guidance for <b>core</b> <b>inserts</b> is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and manufacturing of ejection systems in injection moulds {{can be a}} complex task, particularly when the parts have long ejection paths. During the injection of tubular- or box shape parts, the shrinkage is constrained by the mould. The mouldings shrink against the <b>core,</b> <b>inserts</b> or pins, thus, during ejection, {{it will be necessary}} to overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage. Understanding the ejection forces could be a useful contribution to improve ejection systems designs and guarantee the structural integrity of the mouldings. This information could be even more useful in the processing of thin-walled parts which are more prone to damage during ejection. Frictional forces could be decreased by using specific coatings in the mould core and by optimization of the processing parameters. This study describes the use of DLC and WS 2 coatings and the effect of mould temperature in the ejection forces of tubular mouldings in poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and polystyrene (PS). The studies were based on tubular cup shaped mouldings (60 mm diameter, 60 mm length, 0. 5 mm thickness and 0. 35 º draft angle) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and manufacture of injection molds for high quality technical parts are complex tasks involving {{the knowledge of}} the injection molding process and the material changes induced by processing. In the case of some specific shapes (boxes, tubular fittings), the shrinkage is partially restricted by the mold. The molding shrinks against the <b>core,</b> <b>inserts</b> or pins. Thus, upon ejection, {{it will be necessary to}} overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage. The knowledge of the ejection force is a useful contribution to optimizing the design of molds with these features, and to guaranteeing the structural integrity of the moldings. A study on the effect of conditions on the ejection force required for deep tubular moldings is described for the cases of three common thermoplastic polymers. The studies were based on tubular moldings (60 mm diameter, 146 mm length, and 2 mm. thickness). The injection unit cell consisted of a 1 MN clamp force injection molding machine, thermal regulator, and material dryer. During processing, pressure, temperature and ejection force evolutions were recorded. The results show that the processing conditions noticeably influence the ejection force.

40|$|The {{development}} and manufacturing of ejection {{systems in the}} micro injection molding process can be a complex task, particularly when the parts have several micro holes, {{as in the case}} of multi layer microfluidic devices. During the injection of such parts, the shrinkage is constrained by the mold. Since the moldings shrink against the <b>core,</b> <b>inserts</b> or pins, it is necessary to overcome the frictional forces resulting from the shrinkage during ejection. Decreasing the ejection forces significantly contributes to improve ejection systems designs and guarantees the structural integrity of the moldings, especially for micro parts, which are more prone to damage during ejection. In this paper, the relationship between the texture characteristics of the micro milled molds and the ejection forces is analyzed. A particular mold geometry was designed and studied for this purpose, and its effectiveness was experimentally evaluated. The relation between the micro milling process parameters, such as the feed per tooth and the depth of cut, and the achieved surface texture characteristics is pointed out providing a direct link between quality of micro milling process and quality of micro injection process that is not easy to find in the specific literature domain. Some preliminary testing that involved the use of an ultra high precision milling machine, a focus variation optical microscope and a micro injection molding system has been used to assess how the finishing quality of the milled mold affects the ejection forces...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} effective {{methods to}} improve weldability and electrode life in {{resistance spot welding}} (RSW) of zinc coated advanced high strength steel. Six kinds of electrodes were investigated {{to determine the effect}} of electrode design/material on electrode life and welding performance. The variables were material (Class 2 and Class 3), electrode shape (Dome and Parabolic), and coating on the electrode surface (Ni/TiC coating). Weld qualities were evaluated with mechanical tests, such as tensile shear and peel test, and analyzed using electrical weld signals. Since electrode life and weldability is strongly related to electrode surface degradation, the electrode surface was printed using carbon paper to clearly record the progression of the electrode life cycle. After finishing the electrode life test, the metallurgy of the electrodes was analyzed using standard cross sectioning techniques, optical microscopy, hardness and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. A new type of electrode, with <b>core</b> <b>inserts,</b> is examined for improvements to weldability and increase electrode life when welding zinc coated advanced high strength steel. By using a refractory material insert, the electrode exhibited a local high resistance which promoted weld nugget growth. This type of electrode made a thicker and larger weld nugget, and it improved weldability and mechanical properties, especially with regards to cross tension (CT) strength. The effect and mechanism of inserted electrode were verified with commercial FEA software. The results of different weld current flow, nugget formation, and heat distribution were explored. Additionally, welding signal analysis was performed to verify the performance of the electrode. This type of electrode was also life tested with various diameters and insert materials to measure the effects of these changes...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} the benefit of design flexibility afforded by the Arcam free-form fabrication process in the direct manufacture of injection mould inserts with complex cooling channel configurations and the process efficiency and quality gains achieved through using such inserts. Design/methodology/approach - The manufacturing process of a flood cooled injection mould insert using the Arcam EBM S 12 layered manufacturing process is presented. The insert is then evaluated against two other inserts (one un-cooled and one traditionally baffle cooled (BC)) in the manufacture of test components, with the temperature of the insert and components recorded. The process conditions were adjusted (reduced cooling time) to increase the core and component temperatures to identify the operational limits of the inserts. Thermal imaging was employed to visualize the thermal distribution within the BC and flood cooled (FC) inserts. Findings - The cooling efficiency of the FC insert was found to be significantly higher than that of the other two inserts, and the homogeneity of the heat distribution of the FC insert was more even than the BC insert. It was possible to manufacture non-deformed components using the FC insert with zero cooling time (ejection immediately after removal of holding pressure), this was not possible with the BC insert. Research limitations/implications - Provides a basis for the development of more efficient and thermally homogeneous inserts through the Arcam EBM process. Practical implications - Provides a technology/process for the manufacture of highly efficient <b>core</b> <b>inserts</b> for injection moulding, offering the industry a competitive advantage through the potential for time and cost savings and higher quality components.

The experimental programme included investigation of crack initiation and propagation, as well as of fatigue endurance of conventional and modified sandwich beams.

40|$|Abrasive flow machining(AFM) is an {{effective}} method that can remove the recasting layer produced by wire electrical discharge machining(WEDM). However, the surface roughness will not be easily uniform when a complex hole is polished by this method. CFD numerical method is aided to design good passageways to find the smooth roughness on the complex hole in AFM. Through the present method, it reveals that the shear forces in the polishing process and the flow properties of the medium in AFM play the roles in controlling the roughness on the entire surface. A power law model was firstly set up by utilizing the effect of shear rates on the medium viscosities, and the coefficients of the power law would be found by solving the algebraic equation from {{the relations between the}} shear rates and viscosities. Then the velocities, strain rates and shear forces of the medium acting on the surface would be obtained in the constant pressure by CFD software. Finally, the optimal mold core put into the complex hole could be designed after these simulations. The results show that the shear forces and strain rates change sharply on the entire surface if no mold <b>core</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the complex hole, whereas they hardly make any difference when the core shape is similar to the complex hole. Three experimental types of mold core were used. The results demonstrate that the similar shape of the mold <b>core</b> <b>inserted</b> into the hole could find the uniform roughness on the surface. © 2009 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{relates to}} a newly {{developed}} peel stopper concept for sandwich structures. The proposed concept is {{a specially designed}} <b>core</b> <b>insert,</b> which {{has the ability to}} confine face sheet debonding/delamination (peeling) by deflecting a delamination crack front away from the face/core interface into the bulk of the sandwich core, and thereby constraining the debonding/delamination to a limited prescribed area. In this paper various peel stopper designs are analysed for their ability to deflect cracks away from propagating along a face–core interface. The crack deflection ability of the studied peel stopper designs leads to design guidelines, which describes the minimum requirements regarding the relation between the two interface toughnesses. The analysis further reveals that compliant peel stopper wedges are preferred because they lead to the lowest interface toughness ratio requirement. This has been confirmed through an experiment with a sandwich beam subjected to three-point bending loading. The experiment has shown that the ability of a peel stopper to deflect cracks is highly dependent on the stiffness of the wedge...|$|R
