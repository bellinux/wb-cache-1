5|$|According to a biographical page {{in one of}} the issues, Simon and Kirby <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> {{had spent}} ten years researching what became Boys Ranch, {{traveling}} to Texas, Wyoming, and Arkansas. They were influenced by the films of early western actor and director William S. Hart. They had previously created the successful kid-gang features the Newsboy Legion and Boy Commandos for DC Comics.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Ryan {{had already}} pardoned four death row inmates: Madison Hobley, Aaron Patterson, Leroy Orange and Stanley Howard, who {{were among the}} ten who <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were coerced into confessing by Burge and his {{officers}} and had been wrongfully convicted. In the unusual proceeding, the governor took the extraordinary step of a direct pardon release rather than a court proceeding.|$|E

5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867. Four {{residents}} of Elmira, New York, <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> {{had seen him}} there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, or someone who resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) {{on the day of}} the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|While admitting {{none of the}} {{defendants}} {{were involved in the}} bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. The defendants <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had no knowledge of the bomber at all.|$|E
5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally <b>claimed,</b> <b>they</b> are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, salmon was a reliable food source for Native Americans living along the Rogue. Salmon migrations were so huge that early settlers <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> {{could hear the}} fish moving upstream. These large runs continued into the 20thcentury despite damage to spawning beds caused by gold mining in the 1850s and large-scale commercial fishing that began shortly thereafter. The fishing industry fed demands for salmon in the growing cities of Portland and San Francisco and for canned salmon in England.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were worried about the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2003, {{only two}} weeks after the fall of Baghdad, a dozen Turkish special forces were arrested in Da Quq (a tribal village 45 minutes north of Kirkuk). According to Time, a weekly world news magazine, they were wearing {{civilian}} clothes and intended to infiltrate Iraq, lagging behind a humanitarian convoy, in order to destabilize the region to a level where Turkey could reasonably send its own peacekeeping force. However, they were intercepted by American forces, who <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had received prior knowledge of the group.|$|E
25|$|The {{founders of}} the Committee for a Marxist International (CMI) <b>claim</b> <b>they</b> were {{expelled}} from the CWI, when the CWI abandoned entryism.

5|$|St. Clair {{continued}} his preparations for invading the northwest {{despite the fact}} that, by now, he admitted he was unfit for combat due to his ill health. Like Harmar, he was also unpopular in Kentucky, and Scott had to conduct a draft to raise the militiamen needed for St. Clair's expedition. He and most other officers in Kentucky <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were too ill to lead the men; most actually feared losing the respect of Kentuckians through their association with St. Clair. Colonel William Oldham was the highest-ranking soldier willing to lead the Kentuckians.|$|E
5|$|The {{report of}} the journey, which {{included}} sharp criticism of the governor of Saratov, was not well received at court. The Forsters <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had not received fair payment for their work and had to move house. They chose to settle in England in 1766. The father took up teaching at the Dissenter's Academy in Warrington and also translation work. At the age of only thirteen, the young Forster published his first book: an English translation of Lomonosov's history of Russia, which was well received in scientific circles.|$|E
5|$|The {{whaleboat}} {{managed to}} rendezvous with Catalpa the following day, which then {{headed out to}} sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette {{caught up with the}} whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.|$|E

5|$|Al-Kilabi led {{his army}} along the Jaxartes valley to Ferghana, and laid siege to it while devastating the {{surrounding}} countryside. At this point, the Umayyad army {{became aware that}} the Turgesh khagan Suluk was advancing against them with an army stronger than their own. Abandoning the siege, the Muslim army retreated so hastily towards the south that it was <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> covered a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel. On the second day, after the Arabs crossed the river Wadi al-Subuh, the Turgesh army caught up with them, and attacked a secondary camp pitched by Abdallah ibn Abi Abdallah separately from the main Arab force. The Arabs and their Sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties—the brother of the ruler of Samarkand, Ghurak, being among the slain—but managed to repel the attack.|$|E
5|$|Because the Dreamcast had a {{much smaller}} user base than PlayStation platforms, Capcom knew the series could not survive on the platform. This led to {{bringing}} an extended cut, titled Code: Veronica X in the West and Code: Veronica Kanzenban in Japan, to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 in 2001. The extended cut was announced in November 2000. It has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about Wesker's involvement with Umbrella. The rest of the game remains mostly unchanged, although Capcom <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> made some graphical enhancements. Capcom printed special DVDs of Wesker's Report for the North American PlayStation 2 release. They were sold on Capcom's website and given to customers who purchased the game at specialty retailers such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.|$|E
5|$|Between 1808 and 1812 {{another group}} of ascetic Jews, known as Perushim, immigrated to Palestine from Lithuania. They were disciples of the Vilna Gaon and had settled {{in the city of}} Safed to the north. Some had wished to settle in Jerusalem and reclaim the Ashkenazic Compound. They were worried, however, that {{descendants}} of the Arab creditors still held the old promissory notes relating to the century-old debts incurred by he-Hasid's followers and that a new group of Ashkenazic immigrants would possibly inherit responsibility for repayment. The descendants of a group of Hasidim who made aliyah in 1777 also presented a problem. They apparently objected to any effort by the Perushim {{to take control of the}} synagogue ruin, claiming it had never belonged to the Perushim or their ancestors. The Hasidim <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had closer ties with the original owners and that their rights to the parcel of land were greater.|$|E

5|$|Bryant and Milam were {{questioned}} by Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They admitted {{they had taken}} the boy from his great-uncle's yard but <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had released him the same night in front of Bryant's store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers {{and went into the}} cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{retribution}} {{for their}} actions, the mutineers decided {{to navigate the}} ship toward Spanish waters. One reason the master's life was spared was that Turner could not navigate the ship properly without his help. The Hermione sailed to La Guaira, where they handed the ship over to the Spanish authorities. The mutineers <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had set the officers adrift in a small boat, as {{had happened in the}} mutiny on the Bounty some eight years earlier. The Spanish gave the mutineers just 25 dollars each in return, and presented them with the options of joining the Spanish army, heavy labour, or refitting their ship. The Spaniards took Hermione into service under the name Santa Cecilia; her crew included 25 of her former crew, who remained under Spanish guard.|$|E
5|$|Huseby's demands were {{to talk to}} Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke, {{both from}} the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was {{unsatisfied}} with his treatment after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or <b>claimed</b> <b>they</b> had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was {{moved closer to the}} terminal building. The passengers were picked up by a bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later. Only the five crew members remained.|$|E
