In addition, two of the largest underdeveloped gas fields are in the Arctic region, which poses opportunities for further development in the Northern territories. Petroleum has been located in the Canada Basin, but the remoteness, deep water, and ice conditions pose a risk for major investment. From this, there are a large amount of available resources to be extracted from the Arctic region. Government investment is necessary to stimulate a new Northern economy. Another additional resource in the Arctic Circle is the Northwest Passage becoming a shipping route in the future.

40|$|Reservoirs {{serve to}} {{compensate}} naturally fluctuating water availability and socio-economically driven water demand. To achieve this, flood water is retained and stored water is released to bridge periods of low flow. The required storage capacity when planning new dams and the operating rules of existing dams are determined {{on the basis}} of the observed flows at the site of the reservoir. The flow properties depend on the hydrology of the catchment area, which in turn is influenced by the climatic boundary conditions. Changes in climate therefore directly influence the input data used in reservoir design and the subsequent reservoir performance. A significant change in climate conditions is expected in the future due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This raises the question of the impact of climate change on the performance of reservoirs and how adaption measures can be planed and chosen. The performance of reservoirs is evaluated probabilistically by considering the consequences and the probability of failure events. A distinction is made between failures due to floods and failures due to low flows. Probabilistic methods for evaluating the performance of flood protection provided by dams are well-established, whilst the corresponding method to evaluate the performance of dams that protectagainst low flows is newly developed. Combining these two methods makes it possible to determine the overall performance of a dam by means of the integrated water management risk for floods and low flows. The applied methods of stochastic generation of inflow boundary conditions allow us to quasi-continuously capture the potential impact of projected climate change and to map it using the climate impact function, which represents the relationship between <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change</b> of statistical properties of the inflow and the change in the performance of the studied reservoirs. The climate impact function assesses of the robustness of the reservoir. Robustness describes how sensitively the performance of the reservoir responds to changes in the inflow. Comparing the climate impact functions derived for different operation rules enables us to find adaption measures which preserve the performance of the reservoir for a <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change</b> in the inflow boundary conditions...|$|R

Against a background of <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change,</b> we now have a good and increasing evidence of the way the natural estuarine, coastal and marine system will respond (Elliott et al, 2015). However, more importantly Barbier (2015) highlights the way in which poor, rural coastal communities will be affected and will need to respond or will need help from the developed world to respond. It is axiomatic that while those communities are having less impact than more developed countries on the causes of climate change they are more affected and so have to respond to its consequences, what have been called exogenic unmanaged pressures. Hence they need to rely on mechanisms, techniques, technologies and approaches to help them cope with such change (see also Wolanski and Elliott 2015) ...|$|R

Assessments of water supply vulnerability to potential changes in streamflow require methods capable of generating {{a wide range of}} possible streamflow sequences. This paper presents a method to generate synthetic monthly streamflow sequences that reproduce the statistics of the historical record and that can express <b>climate-induced</b> <b>changes</b> in user-specified streamflow characteristics. The streamflow sequences are numerically simulated through random sampling from a parametric or a nonparametric distribution fitted to the historical data while shuffling the values in the time series until a sequence matching a set of desired temporal properties is generated. The desired properties are specified in an objective function which is optimized using simulated annealing. The properties in the objective function can be manipulated to generate streamflow sequences that exhibit <b>climate-induced</b> <b>changes</b> in streamflow characteristics such as interannual variability or persistence. The method is applied to monthly streamflow data from the Thames River at Kingston (UK) to generate sequences that reproduce historical streamflow statistics at the monthly and annual time scales and to generate perturbed synthetic sequences expressing changes in short-term persistence and interannual variability.

40|$|The future {{management}} of commercially exploited species is challenging because techniques {{used to predict}} the future distribution of stocks under climate change are currently inadequate. We projected the future distribution and abundance of two commercially harvested abalone species (blacklip abalone, Haliotis rubra and greenlip abalone, H. laevigata) inhabiting coastal South Australia, using multiple species distribution models (SDM) and for decadal time slices through to 2100. Projections are based on two contrasting global greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The SDMs identified August (winter) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) as the best descriptor of abundance and forecast that warming of winter temperatures under both scenarios may be beneficial to both species by allowing increased abundance and expansion into previously uninhabited coasts. This range expansion is unlikely to be realised, however, as projected warming of March SST is projected to exceed temperatures which cause up to 10 -fold increases in juvenile mortality. By linking fine-resolution forecasts of sea surface temperature under different climate change scenarios to SDMs and physiological experiments, we provide a practical first approximation of the potential impact of <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change</b> on two species of marine invertebrates in the same fishery. © 2012 Russell et al. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|While current {{projections}} of future climate change associated with increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases {{have a high}} degree of uncertainty, the potential effects of climate change on forests are of increasing concern. A number of studies based on forest simulation models predict substantial temperatures associated with increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, the structure of these computer models may cause them to overemphasize the role of climate in controlling tree growth and mortality. We propose that forest simulation models be reformulated with more realistic representations of growth responses to temperature, moisture, mortality, and dispersal. We believe that only when these models more accurately reflect the physiological bases of the responses of tree species to climate variables can they be used to simulate responses of forests to rapid changes in climate. We argue that direct forest responses to climate change projected by such a reformulated model may be less traumatic and more gradual than those projected by current models. However, the indirect effects of climate change on forests, mediated by alterations of disturbance regimes or the actions of pests and pathogens, may accelerate <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change</b> in forests, and they deserve further study and inclusion within forest simulation models...|$|R

Decapods are important predators in the plankton and the benthos where they can influence productivity and structure communities. In the North Sea {{it has been suggested}} that a climate-driven increase in decapod abundance has been important in propagating the climate signal through the North Sea food web. We show that <b>climate-induced</b> <b>changes</b> in the Decapoda in the central and southern North Sea include the presence of new warm-water taxa, changes in the abundance and proportions of commercial species of shrimp, and an earlier occurrence of decapod larvae in the plankton compared with the period 1981 – 1983.

We modified a well-established model to assess and describe {{the vulnerability of the}} two major industries dependent on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to extreme weather events. The modification entailed distinguishing between the properties that determine exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for both the ecological and the social components of a natural resource system. We surveyed 145 commercial fishers and 62 tourism operators following a severe tropical cyclone and a major flooding event that extensively affected the region in 2011. Exposure of these industries included direct risk to life and infrastructure and indirect risk from loss of important ecosystem services. Our study found that many commercial fishers and marine-based tourism operators were sensitive to changes in the GBR's condition and limited in their adaptive capacity. However, those with smaller businesses, higher levels of occupational identity, place attachment, formal networks, and strategic approaches also had higher levels of adaptive capacity. These results suggest that resource users with higher sensitivity to change are not necessarily the most vulnerable; sensitivity may be offset by adaptive capacity. That is, while exposure and sensitivity determine the potential impact of a <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change,</b> adaptive capacity may be a major influence on the impacts that eventuate.

We recorded N 2 O fluxes, nitrification and denitrification, microbial population size involved in these processes and community structure of nitrite reducers (nirK) in a grassland exposed for 4 years to elevated atmospheric CO 2 (+ 200 ppm), elevated temperature (+ 3. 5 °C) and reduction of summer precipitations (− 20 %) as part of a long-term, multifactor climate change experiment. Our results showed that both warming and simultaneous application of warming, summer drought and elevated CO 2 had a positive effect on N 2 O fluxes, nitrification, N 2 O release by denitrification and the population size of N 2 O reducers and NH 4 oxidizers. In situN 2 O fluxes showed a stronger correlation with microbial population size under warmed conditions compared with the control site.

First, there has been an increase in rainfall intensity and prolonged no-rain periods (summarized in Groisman et al. 2013; see also Zhai et al. 2004 and Chen and Zhai 2014), which at times may occur in the same region.

In this study, the two approaches are integrated by determining the change in terrestrial properties necessary to match inferred change in terrestrial carbon storage. In addition, a useful mathematical framework is developed for understanding the important features of the terrestrial carbon sink. The Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) biosphere model, a terrestrial carbon cycle model that uses a calibrated, semimechanistic net primary production model and a mechanistic plant and soil carbon turnover model, is employed to explore carbon turnover dynamics in terms of the specific features of terrestrial ecosystems that are most important for the potential development of a carbon sink and to determine the variation in net primary production (NPP) necessary to satisfy various carbon sink estimates. Given the existence of a stimulatory mechanism acting on terrestrial NPP, net ecosystem uptake is expected to be largest where NPP is high and the turnover of carbon through plants and the soil is slow. In addition, it was found that (1) long-term, <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change</b> in heterotrophic respiration is not as important in determining long-term carbon exchange as is change in NPP and (2) the terrestrial carbon sink rate is determined not by the cumulative increase in production over some pre-industrial baseline, but rather by the rate of increase in production over the industrial period...|$|R

The inception of stalagmite growth at 137. 4 ± 1. 4 kyr before present (BP) indicates the presence of drip water and cave air temperatures of above 0 °C, and is related to a <b>climate-induced</b> <b>change</b> in the thermal state (from cold- to warm-based) of the glacier above the cave. The cessation of stalagmite growth between 133. 1 ± 0. 7 and 131. 9 ± 0. 6 kyr BP is most likely related to distinct drop in temperature associated with Heinrich stadial 11. The resumption of stalagmite growth at 131. 9 ± 0. 6 kyr BP is accompanied by an abrupt increase in temperature and precipitation as indicated by distinct shifts in the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition as well as in trace element concentrations. The mid-point of T-II is around 131. 8 ± 0. 6 kyr BP in the Schafsloch Cave record is significantly earlier compared to the age of 129. 1 ± 0. 1 kyr BP in the Sanbao Cave record from China. The different ages between both records can be best explained by the competing effects of insolation and glacial boundary forcing on seasonality and snow cover extent in Eurasia...|$|R
