5|$|In {{an effort}} to move city and county {{government}} functions {{out of the state}} capitol, the city purchased a plot of land to build on in 1832. They chose a spot on the edge of De Witt's public square, along Eagle Street at the eastern terminus of Lion Street (later renamed Washington Avenue); the land was bought from St. Peter's Church for $10,295.95 ($ in modern dollars). The design of the new city hall was done by Albany architect Philip Hooker. The cornerstone was laid by Mayor John Townsend amid a Masonic ceremony, however the date of this event is in dispute. The building was completed in 1832 {{at a cost of about}} $92,000 ($ in modern dollars). The new city hall was a Greek Revival structure, built of white marble with an entrance porch supported by four Doric columns. On the roof was a gilded dome. The interior was simple, with little ornamentation, though a full-length statue of Alexander Hamilton stood in the center of the upper hall, between the Court room and the Common Council Chamber. Upon one side of this hall was a bas-relief of DeWitt <b>Clinton,</b> <b>with</b> a view of a primitive canal-boat in the distance, and on the opposite wall was a similar figure of Sir Walter Scott. The building was destroyed by fire on February 10, 1880. Plans for a replacement city hall quickly developed.|$|E

According to Gallup's First quarter survey in April, President Obama received a 63% approval rating.

25|$|The {{incumbent}} president, George W. Bush, of the Republican Party, was ineligible to {{be elected}} to a third term due to term limits in the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, but the Democratic nomination was marked by a sharp contest between Obama and initial front-runner Senator Hillary <b>Clinton,</b> <b>with</b> Obama not securing the nomination until early June. Early campaigning had focused heavily on the Iraq War and the unpopularity of outgoing Republican President George W. Bush, but all candidates focused on domestic concerns as well, which grew more prominent as the economy experienced {{the onset of the}} Great Recession and a major financial crisis that peaked in September 2008.|$|E

25|$|Before the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Parker {{commanded}} a battle group {{consisting of the}} consolidated 1st, 5th, and 9th Virginia Regiments in Peter Muhlenberg's brigade. However, shortly before the engagement, {{he was assigned to}} lead a picked detachment under Charles Scott in Charles Lee's Advance Guard. Scott's command also included three detachments under Richard Butler, Joseph Cilley, and Mordecai Gist. After a hesitant advance, Lee's troops began retreating after they were suddenly attacked by Sir Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>with</b> as many as 10,000 troops. Parts of Lee's command put up a stout battle near a hedgerow before withdrawing to reorganize. The detachments of Parker and Cilley stayed behind to screen the left front of Washington's main body which was by then on the field.|$|E
25|$|Development {{continued}} in the 1880s, with some earlier construction being demolished {{to make way for}} newer houses. Builders began moving beyond the Italianate style, experimenting with the Richardsonian Romanesque and Queen Anne styles. Hope Baptist Church, at the west end of the McPherson Terrace row {{on the north side of}} Clinton west of Judson, is the foremost Romanesque building in the district. The Queen Anne style is responsible for the oriel windows found at 5 Wilson Street (on the North Pearl corner), the row of 152½, 154 and 154½ (identical buildings with arched windows on the first story) and 168 <b>Clinton,</b> <b>with</b> a projecting gabled pavilion. The two styles blend in a row faced in stone between Lexington and Robin streets. The Gothic Revival style made an appearance in 1883 when the former St. Luke's Methodist Church was built at the northwest corner of the Lexington intersection.|$|E
25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House Travel Office personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding <b>Clinton.</b> <b>With</b> the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E
