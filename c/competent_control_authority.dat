40|$|In the article, {{the author}} has proven that state <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> had an {{important}} function in the organizational structure of the government authorities of our country. The author also drives {{attention to the fact}} that, in the Soviet period, government leaders implemented the idea of a system of <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> that were to a substantial extent composed of blue collars. An extensive network of <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> operating on location was active in the 80 ies of the 20 th century. The historical experience of regional <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> is considered in article, and Moscow <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> are taken as an example. The author demonstrates that the Moscow City Committee, regional committees, groups and posts of people's control organized at enterprises and other organizations drove particular attention to the issues of construction, the building industry as a whole and to the accomplishments of the municipal economy; they also supervised over the implementation of ecological and nature protection actions, monitored the condition and repairs of public health service buildings; they resolved the issues of education, culture, available housing, housing preparation for the winter season, etc. Actions taken in the aftermath of inspections held by people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> were aimed at the improvement of the ecological condition of Moscow, and they resolved the problems of urban construction. Multiple assignments performed by people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> made it possible to substantially improve the quality of their inspections and to combine the controlling efforts {{within the framework of the}} municipal economy. Coordination of combined inspections promoted reduction in the overall number of inspections. The present-day building sector of the Russian capital can benefit from the experience of Moscow people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities,</b> their well-coordinated <b>controlling</b> activities within the construction industry and the prior accomplishments of the municipal economy. Отмечено, что государственный контроль занимал важное место в структуре органов власти нашей страны, создавалась широкая сеть органов контроля на местах, которая в 1980 -е гг. была разветвленной и имела массовый характер. На примере г. Москвы показано, что органы народного контроля уделяли особое внимание вопросам строительства и благоустройства городского хозяйства.

We focus on problems of “coverage ” (ensuring that all regions in the scene are seen) and “change estimation ” (finding and learning an unknown object in an otherwise known and static scene), propose a measure of <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> and empirically relate it to the expected risk and its proxy (conditional entropy of the posterior density). We then show that a “passive ” agent can provide no guarantees on performance beyond what is afforded by the priors, and that an “omnipotent ” agent, capable of infinite <b>control</b> <b>authority,</b> can achieve arbitrarily good performance (asymptotically).

40|$|The forcing {{capabilities}} of systems composed of many actuators are analyzed in this paper. Multiactuator systems can generate higher forces in some directions than in others. Techniques are developed {{to find the}} force in the weakest direction. This corresponds to the worst-case output and {{is defined as the}} 'minimum control authority'. The minimum <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> is a function of three things: the actuator configuration, the actuator controller {{and the way in which}} the output of the system is limited. Three output limits are studied: (1) fuel-flow rate, (2) power, and (3) actuator output. The three corresponding actuator controllers are derived. These controllers generate the desired force while minimizing either fuel flow rate, power or actuator output. It is shown that using the optimal controller can substantially increase the minimum <b>control</b> <b>authority.</b> The techniques for calculating the minimum <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> are applied to the Gravity Probe-B spacecraft thruster system. This example shows that the minimum <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> can be used to design the individual actuators, choose actuator configuration, actuator controller, and study redundancy...|$|R
