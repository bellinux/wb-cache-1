5|$|When steels with exactly 0.8% carbon (known as a {{eutectoid}} steel), are cooled, the austenitic phase (FCC) of {{the mixture}} attempts {{to revert to}} the ferrite phase (BCC). The carbon no longer fits within the FCC austenite structure, resulting in an excess of carbon. One way for carbon to leave the austenite is for it to precipitate out of solution as cementite, leaving behind a surrounding phase of BCC iron called ferrite with {{a small percentage of}} carbon in solution. The two, ferrite and cementite, precipitate simultaneously producing a layered structure called pearlite, named for its resemblance to mother of pearl. In a hypereutectoid composition (greater than 0.8% carbon), the carbon will first precipitate out as large inclusions of cementite at the austenite grain boundaries until the percenage of carbon in the grains has decreased to the eutectoid composition (0.8% carbon), at which point the pearlite structure forms. For steels that have less than 0.8% carbon (hypoeutectoid), ferrite will first form within the grains until the remaining composition rises to 0.8% of carbon, at which point the pearlite structure will form. No large inclusions of cementite will form at the boundaries in hypoeuctoid steel. The above assumes that the <b>cooling</b> <b>process</b> is very slow, allowing enough time for the carbon to migrate.|$|E

25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant and Tōkai {{nuclear power}} stations, {{consisting}} of a total eleven reactors, were automatically shut down following the earthquake. Higashidōri, also on the northeast coast, was already shut down for a periodic inspection. Cooling is needed to remove decay heat after a Generation II reactor has been shut down, and to maintain spent fuel pools. The backup <b>cooling</b> <b>process</b> is powered by emergency diesel generators at the plants and at Rokkasho nuclear reprocessing plant. At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini, tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems at Fukushima Daiichi, including three large explosions and radioactive leakage. Subsequent analysis found that many Japanese nuclear plants, including Fukushima Daiichi, were not adequately protected against tsunamis. Over 200,000 people were evacuated.|$|E
25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is generated on site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the <b>cooling</b> <b>process.</b> The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once-through cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|Heat stroke {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to heat stroke. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the <b>cooling</b> <b>process.</b> Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the role of latent <b>cooling</b> <b>processes</b> for tropical cyclones, we have performed sensitivity simulations with both the axisymmetric cloud-resolving model HURMOD and the fully three-dimensional COSMO model of the German Weather Service. As an idealised initial state, a convectively unstable vortex with superimposed entropy anomalies has been assumed. While (growth rate and maximum wind speeds become unnaturally large in simulations without latent <b>cooling</b> <b>processes,</b> {{the presence of these}} processes proves to be necessary to maintain convection outside the eyewall and turns out to be responsible for a delayed development of the tropical cyclone. The latter result is in accordance with the findings of Gray, based on observations. Furthermore, intensity fluctuations of the mature tropical cyclone only occur in HURMOD when latent <b>cooling</b> <b>processes</b> are simulated. An analysis of CAPE, CIN and DCAPE reveals that convection Outside the eyewall explains these intensity fluctuations by mixing low-entropy air into the boundary layer. while without latent <b>cooling</b> <b>processes</b> significant convective inhibition due to drying by absence of evaporation and cyclone-scale subsidence suppresses vertical mixing. HURMOD does not exhibit a threshold amplitude but it sea-surface temperature threshold for tropical cyclogenesis, while the latter only occurs with latent <b>cooling</b> <b>processes.</b> However. a threshold depending on the initial vortex amplitude, together with a stronger response to latent <b>cooling</b> <b>processes,</b> is found in the COSMO model simulations. This seems to be caused by non-axisymmetric disturbances which may circumvent cyclogenesis for a small initial vortex amplitude. Copyright (C) 2009 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|R

25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low voltage conditions on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the <b>cooling</b> <b>process</b> while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E
500|$|For GTAW {{of carbon}} and {{stainless}} steels, {{the selection of}} a filler material is important to prevent excessive porosity. Oxides on the filler material and workpieces must be removed before welding to prevent contamination, and immediately prior to welding, alcohol or acetone should be used to clean the surface. Preheating is generally not necessary for mild steels less than one inch thick, but low alloy steels may require preheating to slow the <b>cooling</b> <b>process</b> and prevent the formation of martensite in the heat-affected zone. [...] Tool steels should also be preheated to prevent cracking in the heat-affected zone. Austenitic stainless steels do not require preheating, but martensitic and ferritic chromium stainless steels do.

Pure argon is used for thin workpieces, but helium can be introduced as thickness increases.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{confined}} semiconductor nanoparticles, such as colloidal quantum dots, nanorods and nanoplatelets have broad extended {{absorption spectra}} at energies above their bandgaps.

During their existence, the hot electron and hole that comprise the exciton may start to cool as they relax to the band edge by phonon mediated or Auger <b>cooling</b> <b>processes</b> or a combination of these. Alongside these <b>cooling</b> <b>processes,</b> there is the possibility that the hot exciton may split into two or more lower energy excitons in what is termed carrier multiplication (CM).

2500|$|Starting in 1844, Rodman {{began running}} {{experiments}} {{to overcome the}} size limitations of cast iron cannon due {{to the way they}} were made. Up to that time, all cannon barrels made of iron were cast solid and then cooled only on their outside, resulting in uneven cooling when the metal contracted toward the barrel's outer surface.

Made in this way, the cannons could crack during the <b>cooling</b> <b>process,</b> break apart during shipment, or worse burst as they were fired. Although it took him years, Rodman developed a way to solve these drawbacks. He found that if he cast the iron around a hollow core and then applied a steady stream of water within the barrel for cooling, a much more reliable and stronger product was made. His method, and the result, has been described as: [...] "Water circulating through the tube cooled the bore while coals were piled against the mold to keep the outer surface hot.

40|$|Context. Various {{observations}} of magnetic {{fields in the}} intra–cluster medium (ICM), {{most of the time}} restricted to cluster cores, point towards a field strength of a fewµG (synchrotron radiation from radio relics and radio halos, inverse Compton radiation in X-rays and Faraday rotation measure of polarised background sources). Both the origin and the spatial structure of galaxy cluster magnetic fields are still under debate. In particular, the radial profile of the magnetic field, from the core of clusters to their outskirts, is important for cosmic ray propagation within the cosmic web. Aims. In this letter, we highlight the importance of <b>cooling</b> <b>processes</b> in amplifying the magnetic field in the core of galaxy clusters up to one order of magnitude above the typical amplification obtained for a purely adiabatic evolution. Methods. We performed a “zoom ” cosmological simulation of a 3 keV cluster, including dark matter and gas dynamics, atomic cooling, UV heating, and star formation using the newly developed MHD solver in the AMR code RAMSES. Results. Magnetic field amplification proceeds mainly through gravitational contraction. Shearing motions due to turbulence provide additional amplification in the outskirts of the cluster, while magnetic reconnection during mergers causes magnetic field dissipation in the core. Conclusions. <b>Cooling</b> <b>processes</b> have a strong impact on the magnetic field structure in the cluster. First, due to the sharp rise of the gas density in the centre, gravitational amplification is significantly higher, when compared to the non–radiative run. Second, <b>cooling</b> <b>processes</b> cause shearing motions to be much stronger in the core than in the adiabatic case, leading to additional field amplification and no significant magnetic reconnection. <b>Cooling</b> <b>processes</b> are therefore essential for determining the magnetic field profile in galaxy clusters.
