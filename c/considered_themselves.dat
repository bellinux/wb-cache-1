The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{promotes}} a more extreme ideology than Population Action International, {{a group that}} argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population {{to care for the}} Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the Church of Euthanasia, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> members of Earth First! or had donated to the group in the previous five years.|$|E

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on male feminists, {{separate}} organization and emotions. The purpose of the article is to understand the role of emotions in separate organization for (pro) feminist men. I find that guilt and pride {{are the most important}} emotions in my interviews. However, these emotions take different shapes according to the positions and the strategies the men adopt. If they <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to be superior to women, they tend to feel guilt and this guilt {{can be used as a}} productive emotion. If they <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to be subordinated, they tend to see guilt as an obstacle and try to escape guilt. If they <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to be different from other men, they tend to see guilt as something other men feel. However, all of them end up in feeling pride about being part of a feminist movement. Those who <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to be subordinated and those who <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to be different from other men tend to be proud over their own engagement in separate organizations. Those who <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to be superior to women tend to be most proud about the fact that they belong to the same movement as feminist women...|$|R
50|$|Certain Christian {{denominations}} <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> to have restored primitive Christianity {{and do not}} <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> part of Protestantism.

5|$|Jewish {{religion}} was unusual in that Jews acknowledged only one God, they <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> chosen by him, {{and they wanted}} Gentiles to accept their God as the only God. Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books {{said to have been}} given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented {{only a small fraction of}} the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II and {{his successors}} {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E

Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve Corporation, added that it was an easy decision for the company to make, as they had high expectations for Left 4 Dead and <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> having a long-term relationship with Turtle Rock. After being acquired by Valve, Turtle Rock served as Valve's in-house satellite development team, and was renamed Valve South.|$|E
50|$|Demographic studies often show wide {{diversity}} of religious beliefs, belonging, {{and practices in}} both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion, 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, and 17% are agnostics; as for self-identification of religiosity, 18% <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> religious, 37% <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> spiritual but not religious, and 42% <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> neither spiritual nor religious, while 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.

5|$|The Assembly was {{a product}} of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the {{theology}} of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E
5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were inferior to men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> to be inferior to men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E
5|$|The first dent to morale {{came after}} about a week when the volunteers were first issued ranks in the Rhodesian Army. In {{the eyes of some}} of the French-speaking soldiers, the ranks {{assigned}} appeared to have been chosen almost at random by their superiors, and did not reflect their actual respective levels of training, ability and experience. Some men who <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> to have been overlooked began to have problems with discipline. The brazen attitude of most of the company's soldiers jarred strongly with that of their Rhodesian commanders, who had high standards regarding presentation and dress which many of the Frenchmen had little inclination to meet.|$|E
40|$|Our naturalistic {{study of}} bargoers showed that many {{intoxicated}} individuals <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> and their intoxicated friends too impaired to drive; however, few, especially men, <b>consider</b> <b>themselves</b> or their friends {{too drunk to}} consent to sex.

5|$|The {{officer corps}} formed {{part of the}} social elite in Canada, and <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> to be much closer to the prestigious, regular {{military}} than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers' mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. The officers were made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.|$|E
5|$|After being {{formally}} closed, {{the remaining}} team members including Ashton, and Robb decided to restart Turtle Rock {{as an independent}} company on March 17, 2010. On the same day, Turtle Rock Studios put up a new website announcing they had reformed and were once again working on video games. They released an iPhone automotive maintenance app named Garage Buddy and began hiring for a full-scale project. Upon the company's reestablishment, Booth left the company, and Robb and Ashton were requested to share the position of studio head. Ashton initially declined it, but eventually accepted and partnered with Robb to lead the studio. Both of them <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> developers not managers, and they found the task of running Turtle Rock a tough challenge. At that time, there were about 13 staff members in the studio. The team later rented a warehouse and re-designed it to accommodate them.|$|E
5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> {{the leading}} members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E

5|$|Cossacks {{were first}} semi-nomadic, then also settled East Slavic {{people of the}} Dnieper River area, who practiced brigandage and plunder, and, renowned for their {{fighting}} prowess, early in their history assumed a military organization. Many of them were, or originated from run-away peasants from the eastern and {{other areas of the}} Commonwealth or from Russia; other significant elements were townspeople and even nobility, who came from the region or migrated into Ukraine. Cossacks <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> free and independent of any bondage and followed their own elected leaders, who originated from the more affluent strata of their society. There were tens of thousands of Cossacks already early in the 17th century. They had frequently clashed with the neighboring Turks and Tatars and raided their Black Sea coastal settlements. Such excursions, executed by formal subjects of the Polish king, were intolerable {{from the point of view}} of foreign relations of the Commonwealth, because they violated peace or interfered with the state's current policy toward the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also {{had to contend with}} {{the other side of the}} arguments, from those who <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E
5|$|Most {{migrants}} {{were people}} from the lower economic strata who had {{been left out of}} government and economic jobs; their lands had been confiscated due to heavy taxation under the Portuguese in Goa. As a consequence of the wealth and privileges which these Goan migrants enjoyed in Mangalore, they began feeling superior to their landless kindred in Goa. Their captivity at Seringapatam (1784–1799), where many died, were killed, or were forcibly converted to Islam, {{led to the formation of}} a separate and common Mangalorean Catholic cultural identity among members of the group, who hitherto had <b>considered</b> <b>themselves</b> an extension of the larger Goan Catholic community. They no longer self-identified as Goan Catholics. After their years of captivity, prosperity under the British and under Italian Jesuits, followed by migration for employment to Bombay, Calcutta, Poona, the Persian Gulf Arab states, and the English-speaking world, enabled the community to restore their identity. The overwhelming majority of Mangalorean Catholics are of Goud Saraswat Brahmin lineage. Historian Alan Machado Prabhu estimates that almost 95 per cent of Mangalorean Catholics have Goan origins.|$|E
