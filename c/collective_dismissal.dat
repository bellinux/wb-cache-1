50|$|The summary {{measure for}} <b>collective</b> <b>dismissals</b> is {{attributed}} just 40% {{of the weight}} assigned to regular and temporary contracts. The rationale {{for this is that}} the <b>collective</b> <b>dismissals</b> indicator only reflects additional employment protection triggered by the collective nature of the dismissal. In most countries, these additional requirements are quite modest. Moreover, summary measures for <b>collective</b> <b>dismissals</b> are only available since the late 1990s. An alternative overall index, so-called Version 1, has been thus calculated as an unweighted average of the summary measures for regular and temporary contracts only. While more restrictive than the previous one (so-called Version 2), this alternative measure of the overall EPL strictness allows comparisons {{over a longer period of}} time (since the late 1980s compared with the late 1990s).|$|R

Therefore, we would expect to find higher wage losses among workers with permanent contracts. Using the Social Security records and controlling for job tenure, occupational industry and other covariates, the results confirm that permanent workers subject to collective dismissals suffer higher and more permanent wage cuts than those with temporary contracts.|$|E

Not only was there a major reform of the disability system, but also a 2 -year continuation of wage payments for sick workers was introduced, the health insurance system was changed, early retirement schemes were abolished, the maximum duration of unemployment benefits was shortened and employment protection changed. From 2006 onwards, {{there is no longer}} a pure last-in-first-out (lifo) rule in case of <b>collective</b> <b>dismissal,</b> but lifo by age group. As a result, older workers are more often displaced. The reforms in the unemployment benefits are most important for our research topic. The maximum duration was shortened, and entrance to unemployment benefits was relaxed in cases of displacement by mutual consent. For most unemployed workers, this reform reduced the period of benefit entitlement, sometimes the reduction was as strong as 22 months, although it did increase the entitlement period for some other groups by at most 2 months. Previous empirical evidence shows that this reform increased job-finding rates, but led to a decrease in the quality of the jobs found (De Groot and van der Klaauw 2014).|$|E

Optimal deregulation takes various forms depending on the deregulation costs, the strength of reform interactions, and the perspective of the policymaker.

40|$|The Romanian Labour Code – Act no 53 / 2003 – {{has been}} {{modified}} {{several times during}} its application. The most important modifications were aiming at the following aspects: the termination of the labour contract (especially the individual and <b>collective</b> <b>dismissal</b> and the rightful termination of the contract), the individual labour contract for a limited duration, the work time and the rest time. These modifications were punctual and determined by the necessity of assuring {{a balance between the}} position of the employees and the one of the employers. A lot of critics have been formulated by the representatives of the employers after the Labour Code got in force. They consider that the actual regulation is too restrictive for them. It is still extremely favourable for the employees, who are protected by the Code even in situations which are not necessary to assure this protection (professional evaluation, individual dismissal, disciplinary procedure and liability). These were the reasons which determined a constant pressure from the employer’s trade unions in relation with the Government in order to modify those parts of the Code which are too favourable to the employees. The draft of the modification act includes the following major aspects: the written form of the individual labour contract; the non-competition clause; the unilateral modification of the individual labour contract by the employer; the individual dismissal; the work time; the collective bargaining and the collective contracts; the material liability of the employee; the labour jurisdiction...|$|E

The decision to devise and to implement technological change has traditionally been considered as a managerial prerogative, which is sometimes subject to a contractual or statutory duty to give advanced notice.

They have made some interesting and even bold proposals to improve the protection of workers in such contexts. New technologies also tend to modify the parameters of both industrial health and safety laws and workers compensation acts by introducing new types of problems. Collective agreements often include provisions which recognize various degrees of union implication in the processes of planning or implementing change.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses new {{data on employment}} protection legislation (EPL) in the successor states of the former USSR - the CIS and Baltic states - over 25 years from 1985 to 2009. We use the OECD methodology (OECD EPL, version II) for assessing the strictness of national labor laws with respect to employers' firing costs. In addition to the overall OECD EPL index, we present detailed statistics for 18 (22) sub-indicators used for its computation. The new data allow us to make several important observations. In particular, the data {{do not support the}} widely held view that labor regulations in the former USSR with respect to firing costs were extremely rigid and were subsequently liberalized by the 15 successor states over the course of transition to a market economy. Rather, the dynamics of the EPL index in the region resembles an inverted U-shaped pattern with the peak of labor market rigidity occurring in the mid- 1990 s in the CIS countries and a decade later in the Baltic States. In terms of major sub-indicators, we observe a rather unusual pattern: gradual liberalization of permanent contracts on the background of increasing regulation of temporary contracts and <b>collective</b> <b>dismissals.</b> This is in sharp contrast with the OECD economies, where liberalization of temporary contracts has been the major trend in the recent decades. By now, the ex-USSR states as a group do not differ that much from the EU- 15 and OECD countries in terms of the overall EPL index, although they differ considerably in terms of contributions to the overall EPL of its thee major components, namely, regulation of permanent contracts, temporary contracts, and <b>collective</b> <b>dismissals.</b> We also show that our EPL data are correlated with a number of variables characterizing economic development, progress in market-oriented reforms, and political regimes prevailing in the countries studied, which suggests potential of using the new dataset in further politico-economic research...|$|R
