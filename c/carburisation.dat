40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} the {{formation}} of nanocrystalline iron carbide in the reaction of nanocrystalline iron with pure methane, or CH 4 /H 2 (2 : 1) gas mixture under atmospheric pressure, at 580 O C has been studied. The <b>carburisation</b> process has been controlled by a thermobalance. The rate of the <b>carburisation</b> process depended on the chemical composition of the iron surface and on the process conditions. As a result of the process, iron carbide is obtained together with unconverted α-iron or a carbon deposit. The optimal conditions to produce iron carbide only can be reached when the reaction rate is lowered, by the dilution of methane with hydrogen, or by a modification of the surface of the nanocrystalline iron.

The influence of both thermal exposure and <b>carburisation</b> at 800 $^{°}$C and above on the room temperature tensile properties of INCOLOY 800 H, INCONEL 617, HASTELLOY X and NIMONIC 86 has been studied and {{the results have been}} compared with literature data. It is shown that the room temperature ductility of INCOLOY 800 H is much less sinsitive to <b>carburisation</b> than that of the nickel-base alloys. This is attributed to the greater volume fraction of carbide formed in the nickel-base alloys for a particular bulk carbon content. In the nickel-base alloys carbide volume fractions are higher than in iron-base alloys due to the lower solubility of carbon and to the formation of M$_{ 6 }$C carbides. The ductility of reformer and intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) tubes after long service times in a process heat high temperature reactor has been estimated using <b>carburisation</b> rates found in corrosion experiments. The data indicate that a reformer tube of INCOLOY 800 H should retain a room temperature ductility equivalent to 5 % tensile elongation - a normal minimum requirement in conventional engineering design over the anticipated service life of 140000 h. For the IHX tubes, the impurity concentrations in the primary coolant must be carefully controlled in order to avoid embrittlement by <b>carburisation.</b> Alternatively, a design concept to allow the use of low ductility tubes will be required.
