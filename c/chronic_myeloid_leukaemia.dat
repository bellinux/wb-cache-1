In contrast, treatment of Kasumi 1 myeloblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitor - Trichostatin A - produced a large incidence of resistant cells in S+G 2 phase which were characterised by a large increase of MDNoBs.

40|$|Summary Background Roughly 80 % of {{patients}} with acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> have high activity of Bruton's tyrosine-kinase (BTK) in their blast cells compared with normal haemopoietic cells, rendering the cells sensitive to the oral BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in vitro. We aimed to develop the biological understanding of the BTK pathway in acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> to identify clinically relevant diagnostic information that might define a subset {{of patients}} that should respond to ibrutinib treatment. Methods We obtained acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> blast cells from unselected patients attending our UK hospital between Feb 19, 2010, and Jan 20, 2014. We isolated primary acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> blast cells from heparinised blood and human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} to establish the activity of BTK in response to CD 117 activation. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of ibrutinib on CD 117 -induced BTK activation, downstream signalling, adhesion to primary bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, and proliferation of primary acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> blast cells. We used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare results between groups. Findings We obtained acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> blast cells from 29 patients. Ibrutinib significantly inhibited CD 117 -mediated proliferation of primary acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> blast cells (p= 0 · 028). CD 117 activation increased BTK activity by inducing phosphorylated BTK in patients with CD 117 -positive acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia.</b> Furthermore, ibrutinib inhibited CD 117 -induced activity of BTK and downstream kinases at a concentration of 100 nM or more. CD 117 -mediated adhesion of CD 117 -expressing blast cells to bone-marrow stromal cells was significantly inhibited by Ibrutinib at 500 nM (p= 0 · 028) Interpretation As first-in-man clinical trials of ibrutinib in patients with acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> commence, the data suggest not all patients will respond. Our findings show that BTK has specific pro-tumoural biological actions downstream of surface CD 117 activation, which are inhibited by ibrutinib. Accordingly, we propose that patients with acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> whose blast cells express CD 117 should be considered for forthcoming clinical trials of ibrutinib.

40|$|AIMS: To {{determine}} {{the distribution of}} tenascin in normal and pathological bone marrow. METHODS: 48 different bone marrow lesions were studied immunohistochemically using a monoclonal antibody to tenascin. RESULTS: Tenascin immunoreactivity was found in lesions with increased fibrosis and high numbers of reticular fibres. The strongest immunoreactivity was found in myelofibrosis. Bone marrow from acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>myeloid</b> and lymphatic <b>leukaemias</b> showed weak or moderate immunoreactivity. In hyperplasias inconsistent reticular tenascin immunoreactivity was found; in normal bone marrow, only a few scattered positive fibres were occasionally seen. CONCLUSIONS: Tenascin was generally observed in conditions in which megakaryocytic hyperplasia was a feature. This {{is in line with}} the notion that tenascin synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts is stimulated by TGF-beta which is synthesised by the megakaryocytic lineage. Tenascin also contains EGF-like repeats. It might therefore function as a growth promoter and in this way could also stimulate synthesis of other matrix components. On the other hand, tenascin could function as an adhesive molecule to some cells of the bone marrow. The presence of tenascin in many pathological states of the bone marrow suggests that it may have a role in their pathogenesis and that it also could be a potential marker of disease...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the frequency and clinical characteristics of ocular complications and their risk factors, as well as autologous serum tears (AST) for the treatment of dry eye in these patients. Data from the files of 124 patients who had undergone allogeneic haematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HPCT) were evaluated. In addition, 33 HPCT patients were examined and their data were compared with controls. Analysis of tears and AST was performed. Dry eye manifestation occurred in 32 % of patients and was positively correlated with age over 27 years (P = 0. 05), peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant (P = 0. 002), chronic graft-versus-host disease (P = 0. 0027), and <b>chronic</b> or acute <b>myeloid</b> <b>leukaemia</b> (P = 0. 001). Dry mouth and Schirmer test < 5 mm were predictive factors for dry eye in HPCT patients (P = 0. 002 and odds ratio 3. 9 and P = 0. 007, odds ratio = 5. 9, respectively). Microbiological analysis revealed that six of 11 AST samples were contaminated after 30 days of use. The present study supports the role of potential risk factors for ocular complications and key elements to detect alterations in the tear film from HPCT patients. In addition, AST contamination must be considered after longer periods of use. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
