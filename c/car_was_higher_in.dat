This study estimates {{minute ventilation}} of cyclists, car and bus passengers, {{as part of}} a study on health effects of commuters ' exposure to air pollutants. Methods: Thirty-four participants performed a submaximal test on a bicycle ergometer, during which heart rate and minute ventilation were measured simultaneously at increasing cycling intensity. Individual regression equations were calculated between heart rate and the natural log of minute ventilation. Heart rates were recorded during 280 two hour trips by bicycle, bus and car and were calculated into minute ventilation levels using the individual regression coefficients. Results: Minute ventilation during bicycle rides were on average 2. 1 times higher than in the car (individual range from 1. 3 to 5. 3) and 2. 0 times higher than in the bus (individual range from 1. 3 to 5. 1).

40|$|Abstract Serotonergic {{signaling}} {{is considered}} critical for an appropriate adaptation to stress. We have previously observed that in healthy volunteers, prefrontal serotonin transporter (SERT) binding is {{positively associated with}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) -axis output {{in terms of the}} cortisol awakening response (CAR). Here, we tested (1) if such a correlation persists in a human model of chronic serotonin depletion, namely in 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'Ecstasy') users, and (2) if CAR differed between MDMA users (N = 18) and non-using healthy volunteers (N = 32). Participants underwent SERT brain imaging with [11 C]DASB-PET, and performed home-sampling of CAR, defined as the area under curve with respect to cortisol increase from awakening level. When adjusting for age and group, CAR was positively coupled to prefrontal SERT binding (p = 0. 006) and MDMA users showed significantly higher CAR than the control group (p = 0. 0003). In conclusion, our data confirm the recently described positive association between prefrontal SERT binding and CAR, this time in a human model of serotonin deficiency. Also, we find that <b>CAR</b> <b>was</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> MDMA users relative to non-users. We suggest that the inhibitory control on HPA-axis output is less efficient in the off-balance state established by recent MDMA use, most likely through mechanisms other than those that can be compensated by lowering SERT levels...|$|E

The use of individual regression equations instead of average regression equations resulted in substantially better predictions of individual minute ventilations. Conclusion The comparability of the gender-specific overall regression equations linking heart rate and minute ventilation with one previous American study, supports that for studies on the group level overall equations can be used. For estimating individual doses, the use of individual regression coefficients provides more precise data. Minute ventilation levels of cyclists are on average two times higher than of bus and car passengers, consistent with the ratio found in one small previous study of young adults. The study illustrates the importance of inclusion of minute ventilation data in comparing air pollution doses between different modes of transport. </p...|$|E

30|$|The main {{conclusion}} from accident type comparisons {{was a huge}} {{potential for}} reducing head-on fatalities, as well as single vehicle fatalities, in Finland. Specifically, head-on and single accidents {{are the two most}} dangerous accident types in both Finland and Sweden, causing {{more than half of all}} fatalities in each country. Importantly, they are also the two accident types with the greatest safety potential for Finland. If their population risk were the same as in Sweden, 30 head-on fatalities and 23 single accident fatalities would be prevented in Finland. Furthermore, the safety potential for Finland for fatalities <b>in</b> <b>cars</b> <b>is</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> accidents with heavy goods vehicles. We acknowledge that the results of this comparison might be slightly biased, since Finland does not omit suicides from its road accident statistics as Sweden has done since 2010. However, the safety potential for Finland, even considering head-on accidents alone (30 fatalities yearly), <b>is</b> substantially <b>higher</b> than the total number of fatalities excluded in Sweden as suicides (on average 21 in 2009 – 2013). Overall, we can reasonably assume that most of the difference is attributable to the extensive network of middle-barrier roads in Sweden. They would probably offer the most extensive safety benefit for Finland also. Another key factor is that the Swedish road safety policy does not allow high speed limits such as 100  km/h on main roads with no middle barrier. In Finland the speed of 100  km/h is used on many roads without middle barriers, especially from April to October when wintertime speed limits are not in force [13].|$|R

40|$|Stress causes {{activation}} of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and results in the secretion of corticosteroids, which facilitate behavioral adaptation and promote the termination of the stress response. These actions exerted by cortisol are mediated by two brain corticosteroid receptor types: the high af?nity mineralocorticoid (MR) and the low affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Dexamethasone is a potent GR agonist with affinity to MR. Administration of dexamethasone in the evening results in a significant suppression of the morning cortisol awakening response (CAR). Here we tested the involvement of MR variants in this effect of dexamethasone in 218 young healthy subjects (125 females, all using oral contraceptives). For this purpose we determined two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MR gene, the previously described MRI 180 V (rs 5522) and the MR- 2 G/C (rs 2070951), which both affect in vitro the transactivational capacity of the MR in response to either cortisol or dexamethasone. Administration of a low dose dexamethasone (0. 25 mg) at 2300 h resulted in a significant suppression of the cortisol awakening response (CAR). Both SNPs modulated {{the suppression of the}} CAR after dexamethasone significantly and in a sex specific manner. Suppression of the <b>CAR</b> <b>was</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> the female MR- 2 G/C GG subjects while in male GG subjects the dexamethasone suppression of the <b>CAR</b> <b>was</b> attenuated compared to the MR- 2 G/C GC and CC groups. For the MRI 180 V, male AA subjects showed after dexamethasone a higher CAR than AG subjects while this effect was not observed in females. The SNPs had no significant influence on the CAR without prior dexamethasone treatment. The association of the CAR with functional MR gene variants only in dexamethasone treated subjects suggests the involvement of MR in dexamethasone induced suppression of morning cortisol...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to providing increased adhesion, <b>car</b> aerodynamics <b>are</b> frequently designed {{to compensate for the}} inherent increase in oversteer as cornering speed increases. When a car corners, it must rotate about its vertical axis as well as translate its center of mass in an arc. However, in a tight-radius (lower speed) corner the angular velocity of the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> <b>high,</b> while <b>in</b> a longer-radius (<b>higher</b> speed) corner the angular velocity is much lower. Therefore, the front tires have a more difficult time overcoming the car's moment of inertia during corner entry at low speed, and much less difficulty as the cornering speed increases. So the natural tendency of any <b>car</b> <b>is</b> to understeer on entry to low-speed corners and oversteer on entry to high-speed corners. To compensate for this unavoidable effect, car designers often bias the car's handling toward less corner-entry understeer (such as by lowering the front roll center), and add rearward bias to the aerodynamic downforce to compensate in higher-speed corners. The rearward aerodynamic bias may be achieved by an airfoil or [...] "spoiler" [...] mounted near the rear of the car, but a useful effect can also be achieved by careful shaping of the body as a whole, particularly the aft areas.|$|R

METHODS: Descriptive study of hospital admission statistics in England, 1999 - 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: national average monthly admissions for injury; severity of injury, defined as death in hospital or a hospital admission lasting four days or more. RESULTS: Admissions for <b>car</b> occupants <b>were</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> the winter months but seasonal variation <b>was</b> not great (<b>highest</b> and lowest months: December, 16 % above monthly average; June, 5 % below). There was a summer peak and winter trough in admissions for adult cyclists (June, 34 % above average; December, 27 % below) and motorcyclists (August, 33 % above average; January, 43 % below). Admissions for child pedestrians <b>were</b> <b>highest</b> <b>in</b> late spring and lowest in mid-winter (May, 24 % above average; December, 28 % below).

It explains how auctions with no reserve prices emerge as equilibrium mechanisms in a broad variety of environments, including environments in which buyers valuations are correlated. The basic theme is that competition promotes simple mechanisms. There are many ways to sell goods to people whose values you don’t know. Auctions are one way, but there are many others. If you buy a car or house, the seller will often engage in a complicated negotiation process that typically involves auction like tricks designed to sort the low and high value buyers. For example, a <b>car</b> dealer <b>is</b> happy to match lower prices you find at other dealers, but will warn you that his <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand, the <b>car</b> you want may no longer be available when you get back.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{view that}} a high sales tax rate reduces trade by driving a wedge between the purchase and sale price may not apply to internet commerce for two reasons.

The second reason <b>is</b> that a <b>high</b> sales tax may lower the before-tax price if sellers absorb part of the tax.

In multivariate analysis, the perception of living in a region susceptible to winter smog, being aware of smog warnings, or the belief in the human contribution to CC did not significantly influence the use of a remote car starter. The use of remote car starters encourages idling which produces increased atmospheric pollution and GHG production and it should be more efficiently and vigorously managed by various activities. A five-minute daily reduction in idling is equivalent to reducing the total car emissions by 1. 8 %. This would constitute a “no-regrets” approach to CC as it can simultaneously reduce GHG, air pollution and their health impacts...|$|R

Also in January 2017 the electrified passenger car segment {{for the first time ever}} surpassed combined sales of cars with conventional diesel or gasoline engines. Sales of plug-in hybrids, all-electric cars and conventional hybrids achieved a combined market share of 51.4% of new car sales that month. [...] Also, Norway was the first country in the world to have all-electric cars topping the new car sales monthly ranking.|$|R
50|$|Early on, despite pole for Richards at Calder, and a {{surprising}} second at Symmons Plains, a track {{known as a}} power circuit thanks to its long, curving back straight, the new M3's hampered by having to use the less sophisticated 325i suspension due to the unavailability of parts from Europe where the <b>car</b> had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> demand. This changed for Round 6 at Surfers when Richards had a brand new 1987 spec M3. One the one Australian circuit in the series that most resembled the fast, flowing circuits of Europe for which the <b>car</b> <b>was</b> originally built, Richards drove away for an easy win. Although he failed to finish the next race at Sandown due to a rare engine failure after he had damaged the sump in a first lap incident while avoiding an out of control car, this brought him within reach of the Nissan Skyline of young charger Glenn Seton. The ATCC {{went down to the}} last race at Oran Park where after a slow Start, Richards moved through the field and after a battle with Seton, emerged victorious and won his second ATCC.|$|R
30|$|Based {{on the two}} {{indicators}} defined above, we {{will now}} try to estimate the share of households at risk of accessibility poverty. Lacking precise data for any particular country, the estimate {{should be seen as}} first and foremost a thought experiment. As we will draw on data and studies from countries like France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, the thought experiment is mostly relevant for the situation in wealthy Northern European countries. These countries are relatively comparable regarding the two indicators for transport poverty risk. First, they have largely comparable levels of <b>car</b> ownership, which <b>is</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> comparison to e.g. Eastern European countries but low in comparison to particularly the US. Second, the countries have somewhat comparable levels of income, which <b>are</b> (substantially) <b>higher</b> than what can be found in countries of South and Eastern Europe. We will draw on a range of figures, but acknowledge that {{more research is needed to}} produce reliable figures on the prevalence of accessibility poverty risk in any particular country. Note furthermore that for reasons of readability only, we have opted to mostly present single numbers only rather than a range of possible values. Clearly, given the available data, it is impossible to arrive at any precise estimate.|$|R
