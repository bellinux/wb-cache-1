50|$|Scrimshaw {{can also}} be {{three-dimensional}} artifacts that are hand carved by the scrimshander. They carved useful tools such as a jagging wheel. The jagging wheel is a multi-purpose tool used to pierce and trim a pie crust. <b>Corset</b> <b>busks</b> were carved from bone or ivory.|$|E
50|$|Pieces {{intended}} as gifts to wives and sweethearts included <b>corset</b> <b>busks</b> (inserted in a slit {{at the front}} of a woman's corset to firm the bodice), small picks (used to pierce holes in cloth or as hair decorations), pie crimpers, knitting needles, a butter print, a sewing box, and a yarn-winding swift.|$|E
50|$|The spoon busk {{allowed a}} greater {{reduction}} in waist size without producing a bulge of flesh {{at the bottom}} edge of the corset. This was a problem experienced when <b>corsets</b> with straight <b>busks</b> of even width were tightly laced: as {{the flesh of the}} abdomen was, essentially, squeezed out of place and appeared where there was no pressure. The wide, dished part of a spoon busk accommodated the abdomen, {{and at the same time}} compressed and controlled it. <b>Corsets</b> with spoon <b>busks</b> usually descended to a point lower than the level of the hips at the front.|$|R
5000|$|The early 19th century {{brought a}} very {{different}} style of corset (still called [...] "stays"). A return to the natural or classical form was embraced by fashion {{and for the first}} time in corset history the bust was separated. To achieve and enhance the separation of the bust the [...] "busk" [...] was used. The busk was essentially a large rigid [...] "Popsicle stick" [...] shaped bone inserted into a casing down the center front of the <b>corset.</b> These <b>busks</b> were made from either wood, ivory, bone, or baleen and were often elaborately carved and given as gifts. It was most often the only bone within corsets of this type as other required shaping was provided by cut of the pattern and enhanced with cording (cotton or similar cords within casings). The cording of the early 19th-century corsets (stays) was often very elaborate, and there are many beautiful corded stays to be found in museums.|$|R
5000|$|The corsets of the 16th through 18th centuries (called [...] "stays", [...] "bodies" [...] or [...] "corps") were {{intended}} to mold the upper torso into a rigid cone like shape. The earliest corsets had a wooden busk placed down the center fronts of the <b>corsets.</b> (These early <b>busks</b> were different from the newer, steel busks which have clasps to open and close.) Corsets of the 17th and 18th centuries were most often heavily boned {{with little or no}} space between the bone channels. This was necessary to force the body to conform to the desired shape of the era. At the time, the most popular materials used for the boning were Giant reeds or whalebone.|$|R
