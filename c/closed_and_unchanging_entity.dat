Since {{the twentieth century}} an interesting and fruitful dialogue {{has been going on}} between the two religions. This article describes and discusses possible themes for a Buddhist–Christian dialogue on issues of environmental philosophy.

Research into {{the experiences of}} female police officers has consistently demonstrated a relentless struggle by these women to be accepted equally within the service and generally provides a very bleak outlook {{in the world of}} policing. However, research on •women in the police is becoming increasingly dated and with racism at the heart of police and public debate it is imperative to determine the contemporary experiences of policewomen. This is a qualitative study in which in-depth interviews were carried out with policewomen at various levels of the organisation to grasp a true understanding of their daily lives and working practices. Findings from this research seem to reflect some of those from the literature but on the whole demonstrate a more positive picture for policewomen with real change taking place...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{designed}} as a concise presentation of the way, in which the linguistic theory of sphoṭa, proposed by Bhartṛhari (5 th cent. CE), has influenced the idea of emotive suggestion (rasa dhvani) - {{one of the most}} prominent Indian aesthetic concepts, created by Ānandavardhana (9 th cent. CE). Firstly, the most important facets of Bhartṛhari’s theory are presented, beginning with the essence of relation between sphoṭa - a singular <b>and</b> <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity</b> capable of conveying meaning - and its audible, differentiated, and temporal manifestation - dhvani. Next step lies in describing the theory of Ānandavardhana, in which dhvani becomes a factor carrying the suggested meaning (vyañjanā) of a single word and of a whole utterance; and eventually - a factor that can also convey the emotive suggestion of a literary work as a whole. It is proven that there exists a close relation between grasping the meaning of a statement through sphoṭa, and understanding the emotive overtone of a literary work through the power of suggestion (rasa dhvani) ...|$|R

Realizing interconnectedness and the changing nature of reality is a step toward liberation from the false view, which sees the world and the self as separate <b>and</b> <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities.</b> By realizing oneness with ourselves and the outside of ourselves, we experience liberation from the fear and anxiety of the discriminating view of the world, one that fractures reality into separate, unchanging units, brings. When we perceive the illusion of the isolated, unchanging self, we reach a level of wisdom the author calls [...] "non-discrimination mind". This state of seeing shows us that there is nothing out there to get, nothing to strive for, nothing to fear, as all these are an illusion springing from a fractured perception of reality. Reality is already perfect, unified, and our struggle is to see that truth, and be liberated from our chains of false perception that fractures everything into separate units. There is, in other words, no difference between the perceiver and the object being perceived; there is no separation between the self and the world.|$|R
40|$|Users of {{psychedelic}} drugs often {{report that}} {{their sense of}} being a self or ‘I’ distinct {{from the rest of}} the world has diminished or altogether dissolved. Neuroscientific study of such ‘ego dissolution’ experiences offers a window onto the nature of self-awareness. We argue that ego dissolution is best explained by an account that explains self-awareness as resulting from the integrated functioning of hierarchical predictive models which posit the existence of a stable <b>and</b> <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity</b> to which representations are bound. Combining recent work on the ‘integrative self' and the phenomenon of self-binding with predictive processing principles yields an explanation of ego dissolution according to which self-representation is a useful Cartesian fiction: an ultimately false representation of a simple and enduring substance to which attributes are bound which serves to integrate and unify cognitive processing across levels and domains. The self-model is not a mere narrative posit, as some have suggested; it has a more robust and ubiquitous cognitive function than that. But this does not mean, as others have claimed, that the self-model has the right attributes to qualify as a self. It performs some of the right kinds of functions, but it is not the right kind of entity. Ego dissolution experiences reveal that the self-model plays an important binding function in cognitive processing, but the self does not exist...|$|R

40|$|This Handbook {{explores the}} history of {{mathematics}} under a series of themes which raise new questions about what mathematics has been and what it has meant to practice it. It addresses questions of who creates mathematics, who uses it, and how. A broader understanding of mathematical practitioners naturally leads to a new appreciation of what counts as a historical source. Material and oral evidence isdrawn upon {{as well as an}} unusual array of textual sources. Further, the ways in which people have chosen to express themselves are as historically meaningful as the contents of the mathematics they have produced. Mathematics is not a fixed <b>and</b> <b>unchanging</b> <b>entity.</b> New questions, contexts, and applications all influence what counts as productive ways of thinking. Because {{the history of}} mathematics should interact constructively with other ways of studying the past, the contributors to this book come from a diverse range of intellectual backgrounds in anthropology, archaeology, art history, philosophy, and literature, as well as history of mathematics more traditionally understood. The thirty-six self-contained, multifaceted chapters, each written by a specialist, are arranged under three main headings: 'Geographies and Cultures', 'Peoples and Practices', and 'Interactions and Interpretations'. Together they deal with the mathematics of 5000 years, but without privileging the past three centuries, and an impressive range of periods and places with many points of cross-reference between chapters. The key mathematical cultures of North America, Europe, the Middle East, India, and China are all represented here as well as areas which are not often treated in mainstream history of mathematics, such as Russia, the Balkans, Vietnam, and South America. A vital reference for graduates and researchers in mathematics, historians of science, and general historians...|$|R
40|$|Taxonomic classifications {{simultaneously}} represent hypotheses of taxon {{identity and}} relationships to taxonomists, <b>and</b> real, <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities</b> to users of taxonomic information. Taxonomic changes, while representing scientific progress, {{can be a}} source of frustration for users. A method for assessing confidence in the taxonomy of a group of organisms would assist users of the taxonomy. A method is presented for determining the degree of development of a taxonomy, a concept termed ‘taxonomic resolution’. The method was applied to six groups of southern African mygalomorph trapdoor spiders, namely Stasimopus Simon 1892 (Ctenizidae Thorell 1877), Ancylotrypa Simon 1889 (Cyrtaucheniidae Simon 1889), four genera of Idiopidae Simon 1889 assessed as a single group, Galeosoma Purcell 1903, the families Migidae Simon 1889 and Microstigmatidae Roewer 1942, and the burrowing scorpion genus Opistophthalmus C. L. Koch 1837 (Scorpionidae Latreille 1802). The method was {{based on the assumption that}} species delimitation in a group of organisms, the taxonomy of which is based on morphological characters, depends on whether the sample of material examined is adequate for assessing variation in those characters. Five assessment criteria were identified and scored for a group of species using the taxonomic literature. Estimates of the number of species remaining to be discovered and described in each group were also included in the assessment. The results obtained for the trapdoor spiders ranged from 15 to 29 %, indicating a potentially significant degree of uncertainty in the taxonomy. Results for Migidae and Microstigmatidae were 51 and 78 % respectively, whereas the result for Opistophthalmus was 93 %. The applied value of a measure of taxonomic resolution, the limitations of the method, and a strategy for developing a more generally applicable method are discussed.

40|$|The present {{paper was}} planned for {{this issue of}} our journal, which Geoffrey Leech and I {{intended}} to devote to Politeness phenomena across cultures. It is based on his article titled “Politeness: Is there an East-West Divide?” (2005) which he suggested as a theoretical framework and includes results of our discussions held during our personal meetings and our epistolary exchange. Unfortunately {{the final version of}} the paper was never read by Geoffrey Leech for the reasons we all sadly know. Nevertheless I decided to publish it as a tribute to him in the knowledge that the result was not going to have the degree of excellence it would have had if he were still with us today. I therefore apologise for any mistakes or misinterpretations of his thoughts that might be found in the paper. The aim of this article is to sum up the main ideas of Politeness Theory presented earlier in Leech 1983, 2003, 2005, and other publications and discuss how that theory applies (or fails to apply) to other languages, with the main emphasis on the Russian language and culture. The term ‘maxim’ used in Principles of Pragmatics (Leech 1983) is avoided here as much as possible, as it implies some kind of moral imperative, rather than a pragmatic constraint. Instead, a single constraint, which comprehends all the maxims (the Maxims of Tact, Generosity, Approbation, Modesty, Agreement, Sympathy), and is called the Grand Strategy of Politeness (GSP), is used. The GSP says: In order to be polite, S expresses or implies meanings which place a high value on what pertains to O- his/her wants, qualities, obligation, opinion, feelings (O = other person[s], [mainly the addressee, i. e. H = hearer]) or place a low value on what pertains to S (S = self, speaker). The essential point is that these are not separate, independent constraints or maxims: they are instances of the operation of the GSP as ‘super-maxim’ which is an overarching framework for studying linguistic politeness phenomena in communication. The following hypothesis will be put forward, and supported by limited evidence: that the GSP provides a very general explanation for communicative politeness phenomena in Western languages such as English, Eastern languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean, and Slavonic languages such as Russian as well with a few examples from other languages. This is not to deny the importance of quantitative and qualitative differences in the settings of social parameters and linguistic parameters of linguistic politeness in such languages. A framework such as the GSP provides the parameters of variation within which such differences can be studied. We do not imply that ethnic cultures are homogeneous <b>and</b> <b>unchanging</b> <b>entities,</b> <b>and</b> do not disregard the fact that generalizations about any culture can be dangerous as things may be different in different sub-cultures or discourse systems within the same ethnic culture. Therefore we are speaking here in very general terms, as we believe that there is a common core which distinguishes one communicative culture from another. Further still there are some general characteristics of behaviour which can be observed in different cultures (1). Hence this article argues that, despite differences, each of the languages and cultures discussed herein constitute a more or less unified system in terms of politeness norms and strategies, and that the GSP can be used as a tertium comparationis to study politeness phenomenon across languages and cultures...|$|R
