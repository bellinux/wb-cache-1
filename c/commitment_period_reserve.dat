40|$|This paper {{examines}} three compliance {{mechanisms of}} the Kyoto Protocol: (i) the restoration rate, (ii) the <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> <b>reserve</b> rule, and (iii) the suspension mechanism, all potentially constraining {{greenhouse gas emissions}} trading across time and space. The joint effect of these mechanisms on prices and costs is studied in a twoperiod model under various assumptions about the competitiveness of the permit market and US participation. The analytical {{results indicate that the}} restoration rate can make discounted permit prices decrease over time. With the <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> <b>reserve,</b> marginal costs may not only be lower, but also higher than the permit prices. The suspension rule will under quite general circumstances not affect prices and costs; only shift non-compliance from future sellers to future buyers. The numerical results suggest that with imperfect permit markets and non-participation of the US in the Kyoto Protocol in 2010, none of the three rules becomes binding. compliance; market power; emissions trading; Kyoto Protocol...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Kyoto Protocol {{adopted in}} 1997 has three {{flexible}} mechanisms {{in order to}} prevent the earth from global warming. One of them is emissions trading. Saijo and Kusakawa (2002) designed some trading systems and conducted emissions trading experiments in order to evaluate them. Such human-based experiments, however, have several basic problems. First, any single experimental result might depend on a particular set of subjects. Second, a considerable number of repetitions are needed to have statistically robust results. In order to avoid these drawbacks, we construct an agent-based emissions trading simulation model that does not use human subjects, but artificial computer agents. It is relatively easy to repeat many simulations with many different parameters when we use the simulation method. Our focus is learning through the trading and we employ the Genetic Algorithm (GA). We evaluate two trading designs: the penalty against non-compliance and the <b>Commitment</b> <b>Period</b> <b>Reserve</b> (CPR) adopted in the Marrakesh accords. The former has a question how much penalty should be imposed on countries with non-compliance. We have two cases. Case 1 is that the penalty is fixed, and Case 2 is that the penalty depends on the average contract price of emissions permits. We found that in Case 1 all countries tried to comply with their target, while in Case 2 demand countries had some incentive not to comply the protocol on purpose. The latter has a question whether we should adopt the CPR or not to the emissions trading system. We found that the CP...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present some {{numerical}} simulations with the MacGEM model {{to evaluate the}} consequences for the Kyoto Protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gases of the recent Bonn agreement and the nonratification by the USA. MacGEM is a global marginal abatement cost model for carbon emissions from fossil fuel use. Marginal abatement cost functions are estimated on data generated with the GEM-E 3 -World general equilibrium model {{under the assumption that}} abatement is produced in a cost efficient way in every individual country/region of the model. Nonparticipation of the USA causes the equilibrium carbon price in Annex B countries to fall by approximately 50 % since an important share of permit demand falls out and the global abatement objective is substantially eroded. With respect to the Bonn agreement, we focus on the <b>Commitment</b> <b>Period</b> <b>Reserve</b> (CPR) and carbon sinks. The CPR is a compliance mechanism requiring all Parties to maintain some fixed number of permits on their permit account. It entails a binding permit export ceiling for the former Soviet Union and central European countries. It raises the equilibrium carbon permit price by approximately 30 % and generates substantial monopoly rents for permit exporters. Finally, carbon sinks enhancement activities are accounted for by assuming that they represent free abatement options. These activities enable Parties to fulfil their reduction commitment at lower compliance costs and cause the equilibrium permit price to decreases even further. We conclude that the Bonn agreement has indeed eroded completely the Kyoto Protocol's emission targets but that it has the merit to have saved the international climate change negotiation framework. environmental economics; climate change; permit trade; Kyoto Protocol; carbon sinks...|$|E

40|$|The outcome {{from the}} December 2012 climate {{negotiations}} in Doha has clarified the rules regarding surplus units for the Kyoto Protocol. We summarize these new rules and estimate the resulting effective emissions {{during the second}} <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> using our unit trade model. Other options to deal with surplus emission allowances are employed as benchmarks to assess the Doha outcome. The effective emissions for developed countries as a group under the Doha outcome could be 10 – 11 % below 1990 levels or 4 – 5 % points below business-as-usual levels for the second <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> {{if we assume that}} non-Kyoto Protocol countries domestically achieve their targets. However, if mechanisms exist where non-Kyoto Protocol countries can trade units, their emissions could increase and effective emissions for developed countries could be 7 – 8 % below 1990 levels. In this low-ambition situation we find the main impact of the Doha surplus rules to be the introduction of the historical cap on emissions allowances. Without the effect of the cap, the Doha outcome allows the Parties to the second <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> to emit at business-as-usual levels until 2020, while still leaving surplus units {{at the end of the}} second <b>commitment</b> <b>period...</b>|$|R

In the first <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> of the Kyoto Protocol (2008 – 2012), this carbon stock effect of HWP is ignored, and forest harvesting is treated as an instantaneous emission of carbon dioxide. However, in the next <b>commitment</b> <b>period</b> of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change from 2013, the carbon stock changes resulting from HWP will be taken into account in the national greenhouse gas inventories. The Japan Wood Research Society called for a roundtable conference of eight research societies, industrial associations, and nongovernmental organizations that are involved with wood utilization. At the conference, accounting approaches for HWP were discussed and a consensus was reached that the stock change approach should be adopted in the next <b>commitment</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R

Unlike the Kyoto Protocol negotiations, which focused exclusively on developed country emissions, the ongoing negotiations on a post- 2012 climate change regime have also addressed developing country mitigation actions, without which a solution to the climate change problem is impossible. This has made the current negotiations as much between developed and developing countries as between the U. S. and the European Union. Key issues include: Legal Form; Regulatory approach; and Differentiation.

The Kyoto Protocol (KP) has been adopted to reduce both direct and indirect GHG emissions (UNFCCC 2008 a). The GHG data reported by UNFCCC contain estimates for the direct greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) {{as well as for the}} indirect greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) (UNFCCC 2013 b).
