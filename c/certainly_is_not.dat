25|$|Is it {{necessary}} for sisters to be set apart to officiate in the sacred ordinances of washing, anointing, and laying on of hands in administering to the sick? It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> Any and all sisters who honor their holy endowments, not only have right, but should feel it a duty, whenever called upon to administer to our sisters in these ordinances, which God has graciously committed to His daughters {{as well as to}} His sons; and we testify that when administered and received in faith and humility they are accompanied with almighty power.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} a major {{reference}} and research resource, but there were detractors. An editorial in The New York Times complained, “Popular it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto.” An article in The Sun of March 4, 1873, reported problems with the mutilation {{of some of the}} library's volumes. This was apparently done mostly for convenience: Instead of writing down extracts, readers cut out the sections with the information they needed.|$|E

500|$|In a 2005 Entertainment Weekly interview, Ward, who {{had never}} {{appeared}} in a medical show before, stated {{that when she was}} young, her mother was sick for over nine years and she {{spent a lot of time}} in hospitals. This being the reason that, on the set of House, she felt [...] "at home, in a strange way". While she was initially hired to appear only in [...] "Three Stories" [...] and [...] "Honeymoon", the chemistry between Ward and House lead actor Hugh Laurie was strong enough for Ward to return for a multiple-episode story arc in the second season of the show. On working with Ward, Laurie commented [...] "We're professionals who were lucky enough to be extremely well-equipped with a very sound, true script, the fact that Sela is immensely attractive and we got on well <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> an impediment." [...] Though Ward has expressed that she would like to return to the show, Shore told USA Today in 2006 that, although he was eager to write her back in, there were [...] "no specific plans" [...] to have the character return.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, Walton {{described}} her character as, [...] "Very {{much like a}} latter-day Scarlett O'Hara. She is very manipulative and feels she is strongly justified in her actions. Jill is an individual who {{has a lot of}} difficulty in seeing what she truly is." [...] Additionally, she said that once Jill [...] "she gets a plan in her head, nothing will divert her." [...] In 1998, Walton's co-star Jeanne Cooper described Jill as [...] "Wile E. Coyote". Walton conceded that the analogy is true, saying that Jill is in [...] "constant turmoil". She stated: [...] "She gets the anvil dropped on her head and falls off the cliff. She cries and then tells everyone her new plan and how she's going to rule the world. Then it's off the cliff again." [...] Walton has said that Jill can be [...] "can be such a shrew" [...] and [...] "gets her happiness where she can, and she <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> going to contain her anger. She lets it out, so it does not fester in there. She is on a roller coaster though, I will say that much." [...] In 2009, Walton stated that she had [...] "really missed Jill being bad", but upon the character crashing Katherine's wedding to Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman), she said that [...] "this is pretty bad". Walton stated in an interview in 2003 that she does like portraying the [...] "dark side" [...] of Jill, but rather her comedic side. She also described Jill as being [...] "so strong" [...] and [...] "such a survivor".|$|E
2500|$|It {{could well}} {{be argued that the}} tax {{involved}} here [...] is an [...] "excise tax" [...] based upon the receipt of money by the taxpayer. It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a tax on property and it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a capitation tax; therefore, it need not be apportioned.... Congress has the power to impose taxes generally, and if the particular imposition does not run afoul of any constitutional restrictions then the tax is lawful, call it what you will.|$|E

We do not {{know a great deal about}} Shakespeare's religious beliefs, and from the evidence of his writings it would be difficult to prove that he had any." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is often}} stated that [...] "the {{conjugate}} of a weak acid {{is a strong}} base". This statement can be misleading. Most weak acids that textbooks discuss have weak (not strong) conjugate bases. Truly, only the very weakest of acids have strong conjugate bases. For example, if a weak acid has a Ka = 10−5, then its conjugate base would have a Kb = 10−9 (from the relationship Ka × Kb = 10−14), which <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a strong base. A very weak acid with a Ka = 10−20 would indeed have a strong conjugate base.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the behest}} of Joseph Cogswell, John Jacob Astor placed a codicil in his will to {{bequeath}} $400,000 (equivalent of $ million in [...] ) {{for the creation of}} a public library. After Astor's death in 1848, the resulting board of trustees executed the will's conditions and constructed the Astor Library in 1854 in the East Village. The library created was a free reference library; its books were not permitted to circulate. By 1872, the Astor Library was described in a New York Times editorial as a [...] "major reference and research resource", but, [...] "Popular it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto".|$|E

2500|$|Foreign Policy {{journalist}} Thomas E. Ricks {{wrote in}} his blog on ForeignPolicy.com, {{that one of the}} additional reasons he saw for declining to intervene in Syria is that doing so against the will of the American people, as American Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power had recently advocated, is [...] "profoundly undemocratic." [...] Americans are not merely ambivalent about the situation, but they [...] "don't think it is their problem." [...] According to Ricks, [...] "the American system is founded on the belief that the people do indeed know what is best for them. So I conclude that Power's argument is itself yet another reason not to intervene in Syria -- if we have to erode our system to do it, it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> worth it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{recordings}} went public erupting in a media scandal, Hogan {{apologized for the}} remarks, which he said is [...] "language that is offensive and inconsistent with [...] own beliefs". Three black wrestlers {{who worked in the}} WWF and WCW with Hogan made supportive comments. Virgil commented [...] "Hogan has never given me a reason to believe he is a racist" [...] while Dennis Rodman said he [...] "most <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a racist" [...] and Kamala added [...] "I do not think Hogan meant harm by saying that. Hogan is my brother until he decides not to be". Black wrestlers working in the WWE made different comments. Mark Henry said he was pleased by WWE's [...] "no tolerance approach to racism" [...] response, and that he was hurt and offended by Hogan's manner and tone. Booker T said he was shocked and called the statements unfortunate.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} several {{reviews of the}} Encyclopedia. One of the harshest criticisms came from the American Library Association in 1987: [...] "The board {{considers}} the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential a problematic monument to idiosyncrasy, confusion, and obfuscation that <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> worth purchasing at any price." [...] Similarly, The Guardian [...] was extremely critical in a review article published in 1992, to which Anthony Judge recently responded via Transcend Media Service {{on the occasion of}} the publication [...] in The Wall Street Journal of a page-one sympathetic review of the Encyclopedia initiative, in December 2012. The work itself is keen on presenting, in various places, disclaimers, reservations or warning texts that anticipate criticisms and explain the strengths and weaknesses of its approaches, including the failure to advocate a position, or the sometimes excessive complexity in its methods or language. Most reviews are laudatory, however. Richard Slaughter emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the [...] "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject. As far as practice is concerned, the highest commendation perhaps is to be found in the words of Elise Boulding: [...] "Any one of us (...) can actively become a part in the world problem solving process by using this encyclopedia." ...|$|E
