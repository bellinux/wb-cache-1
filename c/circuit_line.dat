40|$|Etectroless {{copper plating}} has been {{proposed}} as a method for producing <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in printed <b>circuit</b> boards (PCB) (1). Fabrication of PCB's by electroless plating offers an important advantage over existing fabrication methods that employ partial or full etching of a blanket copper layer to define the <b>circuit</b> <b>lines.</b> Because isotropic hemical etching processes areused to pattern PCB <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in current fabrication methods, the sidewalls of the <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> are eroded as the desired thickness of copper {{is removed from the}} PCB substrate (1). Electroless deposition on the other hand is a totally additive process, so it is possible to form fine-pitch, high-aspect-ratio <b>circuit</b> <b>lines</b> with nearly rectangular cross sections.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{identifying}} the complete set of pairs of input patterns that may cause di#erent types of hazards at a <b>circuit</b> <b>line.</b> This problem has several applications in central VLSI CAD problems such as circuit synthesis and re-synthesis, timing analysis and verification, and delay testing.

Only the extreme conditions of the transient signals are examined in order to detect all possible hazards.

The minimum lines/spaces with good quality and reliability in our research is 25 / 45 µm. These test results will drive the further development and wider usage of the laser structuring technique.
