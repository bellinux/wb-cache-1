25|$|The rate of {{corrosion}} protective {{formation is}} temperature dependent. For example, at 27°C (i.e., a common inlet temperature in the Middle East), rapid film formation and good corrosion protection can be expected within a few hours. At 16°C, it could take 2–3 months for the protection to mature. But once a good surface film forms, corrosion rates decrease, normally to 0.02–0.002mm/yr, as protective layers develop {{over a period of}} years.

40|$|A {{predictive}} and self-consistent {{mathematical model}} incorporating the electrochemical, chemical and ionic migration processes characterizing the propagation stage of <b>crevice</b> and pitting <b>corrosion</b> in metals is described.

The high-temperature, high-salinity geothermal brines in the Salton Sea Known Geothermal Resources Area (KGRA) are a valuable source of energy and mineral values. The brine and steam produced from them are corrosive and cause early failure of many common materials of construction. Mass-loss and electrochemical corrosion measurements were conducted on over 60 metal alloys in brine and steam environments produced from geothermal well Magmamax No. 1, located at the Salton Sea KGRA, at temperatures from 1800 to 2150 C, and in synthetic Magmamax brine at 10520 and 23220 C.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{are widely}} used in {{aircraft}} industry which involves {{a large number of}} joint configurations, traditionally fabricated by riveting. Disadvantages of riveting are extra weight to the structure, stress concentration, <b>crevices</b> <b>corrosion</b> and loosening due to vibrations. Moreover, it is a time consuming and manpower intense task. Laser welding can be a potential tool which is superior to other joining techniques, such as, arc welding due its heat input nature and related microstructural effect. The present study is focused on improving metallurgical and mechanical characteristics of aluminium alloy (6061 -T 6) sheet butt welds obtained by common single pass CO 2 laser by refining the microstructure with extra laser pass/remelting. Initially, screening experiments were performed to enumerate the power density requirement for proper coupling of the laser beam in Gaussian as well as Donut beam profile, effect of shielding gas (He, Ar, and without shielding gas) flow rate, and welding speed which can yield stable keyhole, smooth weld surface and minimum weld defects (porosity, under bead, etc.). From the butt welded specimen, weldability of the alloy was studied in terms of joint strength, formability, fatigue and corrosion behaviour. The weld structure was verified with peak temperature and thermal profile analysis. The effect of the additional laser weld pass(bead on bead/remelting) on the existing butt weld was also studied by comparing the results of hardness, tensile tests, formability, fatigue test and corrosion study From the detailed characterization it was observed that with a particular process window only coupling of the laser with the material was possible and Helium showed best result compared to other shielding gas conditions used in the study. The microstructures revealed defect free welds and hardness data confirmed presence of heat affected zone (HAZ) and huge drop in overall hardness after welding. After post weld treatment (aging cycle) the hardness was increased marginally but base hardness could not be achieved and double bead weld showed marginally higher hardness due to finer structure. In both single and double pass welds sharp drop in tensile strength were observed due to cast structure, not availability of age hardening effect and possible micro porosity.

40|$|Objectives: Amalgam restorations are {{replaced}} by adhesively placed composite resin restorations at an increasing rate. After the removal of amalgam dentine often shows marked dark discoloration that is attributed to the penetration of corrosion products from overlying amalgams. it is questioned whether penetration of metals into dentine affects the dentine as a substrate for adhesive procedures. This study has been performed to clarify the origin of dark discoloration of dentine by metals from amalgam with special regards to corrosion products. Methods: A {{review of the literature}} has been performed using Medline database. As keywords dentine and amalgam, subsequently combined with penetration, interface, <b>crevice,</b> interaction, <b>corrosion,</b> were used. This was followed up by extensive hand search using reference lists of relevant articles. Results: Data in the literature have been gathered from extracted amalgam filled teeth and from artificially aged amalgam filled teeth. Corrosion studies have been performed in vivo aged teeth as well as in vitro. Sn is the main element, followed by Zn and Cu, that is consistently found in dentine underneath amalgam, as well as in amalgam corrosion products and in marginal seal deposits. Penetration of elements from amalgam has only been observed in discolored and in demineralised dentine. Conclusions: Darkly discolored dentine as found underneath amalgam restorations contains amalgam corrosion products and is demineralised. Therefore it must be considered a different substrate for clinical procedures than sound dentine. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of {{a stainless steel}} {{is dependent on the}} presence of an ultra-thin protective oxide film (passive film) on its surface, but it is possible under certain conditions for this oxide film to break down, for example in halide solutions or reducing acids. Areas where the oxide film can break down can also sometimes be the result of the way components are designed, for example under gaskets, in sharp re-entrant corners or associated with incomplete weld penetration or overlapping surfaces. These can all form crevices which can promote corrosion. To function as a corrosion site, a crevice has to be of sufficient width to permit entry of the corrodent, but narrow enough to ensure that the corrodent remains stagnant. Accordingly <b>crevice</b> <b>corrosion</b> usually occurs in gaps a few micrometres wide, and is not found in grooves or slots in which circulation of the corrodent is possible. This problem can often be overcome by paying attention to the design of the component, in particular to avoiding formation of crevices or at least keeping them as open as possible. <b>Crevice</b> <b>corrosion</b> is a very similar mechanism to pitting corrosion; alloys resistant to one are generally resistant to both. <b>Crevice</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{can be viewed as a}} less severe form of localized corrosion when compared with pitting. The depth of penetration and the rate of propagation in pitting corrosion are significantly greater than in <b>crevice</b> <b>corrosion.</b>|$|E
