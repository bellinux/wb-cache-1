5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus was quite {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth <b>count</b> <b>and</b> row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.|$|E

In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E

All biomarkers were analyzed again after 6 months. Leukocyte <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> concentrations of fibrinogen, CRP, MPO, and PAPP-A were significantly increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Leukocyte <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> concentrations of MPO were significantly increased in patients with unstable angina pectoris compared with controls. After 6 months, leukocyte <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> MPO concentrations were still increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction when compared to controls. Discriminant analysis showed that leukocyte <b>counts,</b> MPO, <b>and</b> PAPP-A concentrations classified study group designation for acute coronary events correctly in 83 % of the cases. In conclusion, combined assessment of leukocyte <b>counts,</b> MPO, <b>and</b> PAPP-A was able to correctly classify acute coronary events, suggesting {{that this could be}} a promising panel for a multibiomarker approach to assess cardiovascular ris...|$|R

Both platelet <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> the mean platelet volume were significantly decreased following the treatment. No significant differences were noted on the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell count. Conclusion. Platelet <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> mean platelet volume significantly decreased following isotretinoin treatment. Since the decrease of platelet <b>counts</b> <b>and</b> the mean platelet volume was seen concomitantly, it is concluded that the effect of isotretinoin was through the suppression of bone marrow...|$|R

5|$|A related {{study also}} noted a locking {{mechanism}} {{in the lower}} jaw shared between the two genera. In a separate paper, Currie noted the possibility that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but stated that the much higher tooth <b>count</b> <b>and</b> more prominent nasal crests in Alioramus suggest it is a distinct genus. Similarly, Currie uses the high tooth count of Nanotyrannus {{to suggest that it}} may be a distinct genus, rather than a juvenile Tyrannosaurus as most other experts believe. However, the discovery and description of Qianzhousaurus reveals that Alioramus is not a close relation to Tarbosaurus, instead belonging to a newly described family of tyrannosaurids; the Alioramini. Qianzhousaurus further reveals that similar long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed throughout Asia and would have shared the same environment while avoiding competition with larger and more robust tyrannosaurines by hunting different prey.|$|E
