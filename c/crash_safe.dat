40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} suspension development for a prototype Urban Personal Vehicle (PUNCH). The PUNCH is a <b>crash</b> <b>safe</b> prototype of an Urban Personal Vehicle developed at the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden. The urban personal vehicle is designed for the dense urban areas of today. It's a small, car-like vehicle with space for one driver (and {{maybe one or two}} passengers) that is to be driven at city speeds (sub 50 [km/h]). It needs to be nimble and easy to drive. The thesis starts by defining the requirements for this vehicle, limitations of project and the iterative process of suspension design. Thereafter the literature study is presented in the theory chapter. After that, the selection of design and parts is shown, design draft is made and analysed in a whole vehicle simulation computer programme. From the simulation results conclusions are made and recommendations for the physical fabrication and future work are given. The finished concept is a double wishbone suspension font and rear. The suspension has a predictable character without any sudden changes. The suspension characteristics are {{as close as possible to}} the given targets, but for some limitation due to packaging issues presented by the already existing frame. The suspension front and rear share many components, so the final design requires less unique manufacturing (at a later phase/future work). Some components (as brake assembly, wheel hubs & bearings) are taken straight from a common road car (simple, cheap, off the shelf components).

40|$|Naturalistic driving (ND) methods may be {{particularly}} useful for research on young driver crash risk. Novices are not safe drivers initially, but tend to improve rapidly, although the pace of learning is highly variable. However, knowledge is lacking {{about how best to}} reduce the learning curve and the variability in the development of safe driving judgment. A great deal has been learned from recent naturalistic driving (ND) studies that have included young drivers, providing objective information on the nature of crash risk and the factors that contribute to safety critical events. This research indicates that most learners obtain at least the amount of practice driving recommended and develop important driving skills. Unfortunately, most learners are not exposed during training to more complex driving situations and the instruction provided by supervising parents is mostly reactive and may not fully prepare teens for independent driving. While supervised practice driving is quite <b>safe,</b> <b>crash</b> rates are high during the first six months or so of independent driving then decline rapidly, but remain high for years relative to experienced drivers.

How do we digest the information that’s put forward by manufacturers? Does KKK-A- 1822 compliance mean the ambulance can endure a <b>crash?</b> What’s <b>safe</b> and what isn’t? What works and what doesn’t? And where do we go to find out? A Disconnect Since the 1960 s, when we left the Cadillac and went into the “box, ” we essentially lost the safety oversight of the automotive industry. What has been the status quo in the ambulance vehicle industry since then hasn’t matched what’s standard in the automotive and transportation industry. Extensive data now highlights some of the strengths and weaknesses of how we address the transportation safety aspects of EMS. Data currently demonstrate that per mile traveled per vehicle, ambulances are one of the most hazardous vehicles on the road. 1 Concept vehicles are on the market, but where are the data and automotive safety oversight to support these modifications? Automotive safety experts have raised serious concerns about the safety of these vehicles built outside the purview of technical experts in occupant protection and vehicle crashworthiness. 2 Would you dare to administer medication that was demonstrated by clinical experts to be unacceptably toxic? Would you use equipment that had been known for 10 years to be unsafe or, worse yet, lethal? No. The interior of this Dlouhy Sprinter from RETTmobil 2008 features a special elevating platform for the stretcher, secure lockdowns for equipment and folding seats. Notice the absence of hazards in the head strike zone. So why aren’t we holding ourselves to the same standard when it comes to the vehicles we ride in every shift? A Shift in Standards It might come as quite a surprise, but neither the KKK Ambulance Specification nor the Ambulance Manufacturers Division (AMD) Standards are standards of occupant crash protection or vehicle crashworthiness. In fact, in some areas, they even conflict with current technical automotive safety engineering practices. 3 KKK- or AMD- compliance doesn’t demonstrate that an ambulance is crashworthy or will protect occupants in the rear patient compartment in the event of photo courtesy Ken Beers/EMS safety foundation a crash.

40|$|Because of our {{increasing}} {{dependence on}} software {{in every aspect}} of our lives, it is crucial that our software systems are reliable, safe, and correct [...] - they must not <b>crash,</b> must be <b>safe</b> from attack, and must consistently compute the results we expect from them. As testing is insufficient to show the absence of errors and manual code review is tedious, costly, and error-prone, the only clear path to efficiently and reliably ensuring software quality is to develop automatic verification tools which require as little intervention from the programmer as possible. In this dissertation, we present Liquid Types, an automated approach to software verification based on inferring and checking expressive refinement types, data types which are augmented with logical predicates, which can be used to express and verify sophisticated program invariants. We show how Liquid Types divides the task of program verification between type-based and logic-based reasoning to infer precise invariants of unboundedly-large data structures. Further, we show how the Liquid Types technique is suited both to high-level, pure functional languages and low-level, imperative languages with mutable state, allowing for the verification of programmings running the full range from applications to systems programs. The Liquid Types technique has been implemented in type checkers for both the OCaml and C languages and applied to a number of challenging programs taken from the literature and from the wild. We highlight experimental results that show that the refinement type inference performed by Liquid Types can be used to verify crucial safety properties of real-world programs without imposing an undue verification-related overhead on the programme...|$|R
40|$|Roadside {{concrete}} barriers {{have been}} widely used to protect errant motorists from hitting roadside hazards or obstacles. Two concrete barrier profiles, vertical and safety-shape, have been used for this purpose. The safety-shape profile has been shown to produce excessive vehicle climbing which tends to increase rollover propensity. The vertical profile, on the other hand, does not cause vehicle climbing, but it does produce higher lateral forces which may produce higher injury levels. ^ The objective of this research is to investigate which barrier profile is the safest based on real-world vehicle <b>crash</b> data. The <b>safest</b> barrier profile is defined as the one that produces lower injury levels. Rollover propensity was also used as a second indicator of barrier performance since rollovers may also affect injury severity. ^ Eleven years of bridge-related crash data was collected from State maintained highways in the State of Iowa. Statistical procedures were used to conduct the data analysis which was sub-divided into two major tasks: rollover analysis and injury analysis. ^ It was found that rollovers are twice more likely to occur in crashes involving safety-shape barriers as compared to vertical barriers. It was also found that crashes that involved safety-shape barriers resulted in higher injury levels as compared to crashes that involved the vertical barriers. ^ Therefore, it is believed that the expanded use of vertical barriers would improve overall highway safety. However, this conclusion is based on limited data and a more comprehensive data set covering many more States besides Iowa is recommended for analysis in the future. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{there are}} many efforts in {{different}} countries to identify hazardous road locations through different models in Geographic Information System (GIS) software. Our goal was to identify hazardous locations {{on a part of}} Yazd-Kerman highway located in Yazd province. It was by using hot zone method in GIS, and the relationship between these locations and environmental and demographic variables was assessed. Methods: By using hot zone method, each road (Yazd-Kerman & Kerman-Yazd path) was divided into segments named Basic Spatial Units (BSUs). A BSU was defined as 1 Kilometer. For each BSU, variables such as number, time and cause of crashes, vehicle type, weather, age, sex and status of drivers were collected. The hazardous locations were classified in two definition groups as Hot Zones and Yellow Zones. Results: According to results, 17 % of total 212 -kilometer road was identified as hazardous locations. The most drivers engaged in crashes in these locations (34 %) were in age group of 31 - 40. Motorcars, trailers and trucks had the most crashes, respectively. The most frequently cause of crashes was non-attendance to front and miss control of vehicle. The most number of crashes were taken place in the sunny climate. Conclusion: Considering that hazardous locations increase near entrances, exits and junctions, it seems that paying attention to road design principles may cause a great reduction in the <b>crash</b> rate. A <b>safe</b> design also can reduce the effect of environmental factors such as weather, time and even vehicle type. Furthermore a good training program, especially for age 21 - 40, may have a great role in minimize the human errors in crash occurrence...|$|R
40|$|Speed is {{recognised}} {{as a key}} {{contributor to}} crash likelihood and severity, and to road safety performance in general. Its fundamental role has been recognised by making Safe Speeds {{one of the four}} pillars of the Safe System. In this context, impact speeds above which humans are likely to sustain fatal injuries have been accepted as a reference in many Safe System infrastructure policy and planning discussions. To date, there have been no proposed relationships for impact speeds above which humans are likely to sustain fatal or serious (severe) injury, a more relevant Safe System measure. A research project on Safe System intersection design required a critical review of published literature on the relationship between impact speed and probability of injury. This has led to a number of questions being raised about the origins, accuracy and appropriateness of the currently accepted impact speed–fatality probability relationships (Wramborg 2005) in many policy documents. The literature review identified alternative, more recent and more precise relationships derived from the US crash reconstruction databases (NASS/CDS). The paper proposes for discussion a set of alternative relationships between vehicle impact speed and probability of MAIS 3 + (fatal and serious) injury for selected common <b>crash</b> types. Proposed <b>Safe</b> System critical impact speed values are also proposed for use in road infrastructure assessment. The paper presents the methodology and assumptions used in developing these relationships. It identifies further research needed to confirm and refine these relationships.

40|$|Pre-pretensioner (PPT) seatbelts are {{equipped}} with an electrical pretensioner that tightens the belt in safety critical situations and liberates some webbing if the driver is able to avoid the hazard. These PPT seatbelts introduce new loading scenarios, posing a requirement to evaluate the biofidelity of present-day Anthropometric Test Devices (ATDs). This study evaluates the biofidelity of ATDs of different sizes in four predefined positions under PPT seatbelt loading also considering the habituation effect. Data from 5 th and 50 th percentile females, and 95 th percentile male volunteers and their corresponding ATDs- Hybrid III 5 th and 95 th percentile dummies, and a prototype BioRID 50 percentile female dummy were analyzed. Evaluation of the biofidelity was done by comparing the responses of volunteers and ATDs. Basic kinematics parameters were tracked with TEMA 3. 5 - 012 software and the seatbelt force, current and voltage signals {{were obtained from the}} transducer. Corridors were generated with the volunteer subjects’ mean response ± 1 standard deviation. Hybrid III family does not reproduce human-like motion of the head-neck complex under PPT loading due to the stiffness of the neck and torso. The 50 th percentile female BioRID dummy shows a reversed trend compared to the flexion-extension motion of the volunteers. Changes in stiffness and damping properties may lead to improvements in biofidelity of these dummies under low load conditions (PPT loading). In general, the small female volunteers are observed to have larger head-neck rotation amplitudes, which may contribute to higher whiplash risk in females. Large male volunteers show lower backset reduction and low T 1 kinematics compared to other sizes of volunteers. Some volunteers exhibit limited range of head-neck motion compared to others, which may be a result of neck muscle tension. Current studies about PPT seatbelts suggest that there is a scope to develop more powerful systems that may use higher forces to reposition the occupant before an impact. This study identifies injury assessment reference values for neck injuries and optimal force values for PPT development. Dynamic and static tests were conducted with H-III 6 C and the BioRID 50 F prototype. Two <b>safe</b> <b>crash</b> pulses, one with a maximum deceleration of 4 g at 56 ms and a delta V of 9 km/h and another with a mean acceleration of 6 g and a delta V of 28 km/h were used in child and adult ATDs respectively. Neck injury assessment reference values (NICprotraction and NIJ) were obtained from the dynamic tests and literature review. In static tests, neck injury criteria for higher seatbelt forces were obtained to compare them with the previous thresholds. Forces close to 600 N might be critical in children when seated slightly leaning forward. Some test results were discarded due to technical limitations, hence for future testing it is recommended to use sensors and data acquisition systems according to the low loading scenario...|$|R
40|$|Coaches {{and road}} safety : safety of coaches and cars compared. This report {{presents}} a study into {{the safety of}} coaches in traffic, commissioned by the Royal Dutch Association of Transport Companies (KNV). This study uses data supplied by several organisations in the Netherlands: Statistics Netherlands (CBS), the road crash registration by the police (BRON), the hospital register of road crash casualties (LBZ), and data from the KNV-brochure Core data 2015 of the Coach transport sector in the Netherlands (Kerncijfers 2015 van het Nederlandse touringcarvervoer). For international data the Community Road Accident Database (CARE) was used; this data is maintained by the European Commission. The available data does not distinguish between coaches and public transport buses. Therefore, we studied the umbrella category “buses” and compared its road safety with that of (passenger) cars. Within the umbrella category "buses" there may be differences between coaches and public transport buses. Public transport buses mainly drive in the city, where crashes are more frequent than on the motorway. Coaches probably drive {{a larger proportion of}} their journeys on motorways. In addition, vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and (light) moped riders in the city may come into contact with a public transport bus. On the motorway, where coaches probably drive a greater part of the time, these vulnerable road users are absent. Furthermore, public transport buses also carry standing passengers, which increases the risk of injury to the passengers in the case of hard braking or a collision. Coaches do not carry standing passengers. Furthermore, public transport buses travel the vast majority of their kilometres in the Netherlands and they travel a much greater total distance than coaches. Coaches also travel far fewer days a year than public transport buses. It is therefore most likely that coaches as a category are safer than the public transport buses and coaches combined in the category buses in this study. However, {{it is not easy to}} determine how much safer this would be. The comparison between buses and passenger cars was made for Dutch vehicles that had been involved in a serious crash in the Netherlands. For the number of road deaths we looked at the period 1993 - 2014. Fewer data was available for the number of serious road injuries and only the period 1993 - 2009 was studied. In absolute numbers, there are far fewer road deaths in crashes involving buses than in crashes involving passenger cars. This is due to the fact that passenger cars have a much greater mobility than buses. Also when we take this mobility into account, the risk (the number of road deaths per distance travelled) of dying as a bus passenger is smaller than the risk of dying as a car occupant. Averaged over the period 1993 - 2014 the risk of a fatal crash for a bus passenger is 0. 15 per billion km travelled as opposed to a risk of 2. 3 for a car occupant. However, the risk of dying in a crash with a bus as a crash opponent is greater than the risk of dying in a crash with a car as the crash opponent. For cars and buses as crash opponents, the average risk per billion km travelled is 30 road deaths in crashes involving a bus as opposed to 3. 9 road deaths in crashes involving a passenger car. This indicates that crashes with a bus as the crash opponent are fatal much more frequently than crashes with a passenger car: there are 18 times more road deaths among crash opponents of buses than among bus passengers, whereas on average there are 1. 1 road deaths per billion km travelled in crashes with a passenger car as the crash opponent and 1 road death among car occupants. When we look at serious road injuries, it is also much safer for the bus passenger than for the crash opponent. Averaged over the period 1993 - 2009 the risk of being a serious road injury as a bus passenger per billion km travelled is 2. 3 as opposed to 39 serious road injuries per billion km travelled among car occupants. With cars and buses as crash opponents the average number of serious road injuries is 190 per billion km travelled in crashes with a bus as the crash opponent as opposed to 25 with a car as the crash opponent. In this case the difference between buses and cars is reversed: there are more serious road injuries in crashes with a bus as the crash opponent (factor of 7. 9) than with a car as the crash opponent (factor of 2. 5). In brief: bus <b>crashes</b> are much <b>safer</b> for bus passengers than for crash opponents. This is much less the case for car crashes. Over the years all risk categories have shown a declining trend: bus rides as well as car trips are increasingly getting safer, for occupants as well as for crash opponents. The decline seems to be greater for road deaths than for serious road injuries, but this has not yet been investigated. For travellers, the risk of dying in a road crash is much smaller when they travel a distance by bus than when they travel the same distance by car: averaged over the years 1993 - 2014 the fatality rates of bus passengers and car occupants differ by a factor of 15. The risk of being seriously injured is also much smaller for bus passengers than for car occupants: a factor 17 averaged over the years 1993 - 2009. For the crash opponent the risk of a fatal crash with a bus is 7. 8 times higher than the average risk of a fatal crash with a car. On average the risk of serious injury in a crash with a bus is 7. 9 times higher than the risk of a serious injury in a crash involving a car. There may be a safety effect if bus transport were to result in fewer journeys by car. Part of this effect depends on the occupancy rate of both modes of transport. With an average occupancy rate of 10. 3 persons per bus and 1. 6 per car (on the basis of the mobility data), for example, it would not make traffic any safer: the net risk of a road death among the crash opponents of car or bus would still increase with a factor of 1. 2 if the car occupants would have travelled by bus. As was mentioned above, the outcome of this calculation strongly depends on the occupancy rate. At, for example, an occupancy rate of 30 for the coach, the outcome for a journey by coach will be much more favourable than that for the car rides that are involved. The uncertainty in the value of the occupancy rates is the main uncertain factor in this research. Based on the available international data, the number of road deaths in crashes involving buses and cars has also been compared between the EU countries plus Israel, Norway and Switzerland. As in the Netherlands, the average for these countries shows a downward trend in the number of road deaths during the period 2005 - 2014. When we look at the number of road deaths in bus crashes as opposed to car crashes in individual countries, the Netherlands take 8 th place, more favourable than the average of all countries involved during that period (2005 - 2014). These international differences in the ratios of bus and car crash casualties are probably caused by differences in the use of buses and cars. Therefore, we cannot make any claims with respect to these findings about differences in risk...|$|R
