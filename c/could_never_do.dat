Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she {{was grateful for the}} warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees a great deal of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E
5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> as a player, and guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E

We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean.

And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely {{modeled after the}} Imperial cult in Japan where the Showa Emperor was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, {{schoolchildren}} began their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed a prior.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} of The Office was {{released}} largely to critical acclaim and commercial success. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk {{wrote that the}} British version [...] "can't hold a candle to the American" [...] version during this season, due to the show coming [...] "into its own, becoming the best half-hour show on TV." [...] Furthermore, Rizzo wrote that the season was filled with [...] "fantastically real characters" [...] as well as [...] "one of the best-handled romances in TV history". Eric Goldman of IGN noted that season two transformed The Office [...] "from a very funny show into a truly brilliant show". Goldman praised the world-building of the season, writing that it [...] "does a wonderful job of developing {{the rest of the}} staff of Dunder-Mifflin , something the UK version <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> to this extent". He ultimately gave it a ten out of ten score. Josh Wolk, an Entertainment Weekly television critic, said that the show has [...] "perfecting workaday moments so hilariously and relatably awkward that it makes viewers both laugh and cringe".|$|E
500|$|Earlier {{versions}} of the story featured a sensate from Iraq and more about Whispers, the villain of the show. The show was transformed when the writers decided to limit the storytelling, {{with the exception of}} the opening scene of the first episode, to the perspective of the eight characters. This means that every scene set in San Francisco must be about Nomi, in Chicago about Will and so on. Since the show begins with the characters not knowing what is happening to them and without being able to cut e.g. to the villains like a traditional show, the audience starts with the same questions and confusion as the characters do. As the characters slowly begin to understand more about what's happening to them over the course of several episodes, the audience does as well, at the same pace. Straczynski notes this type of writing wouldn't work if they were writing for a traditional network. [...] "The first episode is written in a way that you <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> a pilot. With pilots you have to set up all the rules and explain everything to hook people in," [...] said Stranczynski. Instead, taking advantage of the binge-watching model Netflix promotes, the series was written as a continuous 12-hour movie, making it possible to tell the story at a different pace.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, while Television Without Pity {{gave it a}} C+. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named it the fourth best episode of the series, {{explaining}} [...] "The late season lark that officially launched a tradition for similar stunts, the musical film noir homage 'Brown Betty'... was an offbeat gem that expressed all of Fringes core themes — redemption, connection, rehumanization — and encapsulated the key relationships (the slow-moving Walter-Peter reconciliation; Peter and Olivia's carefully tended soul-deep romance) more poignantly than most on-point episodes of Fringe, and it left fans wanting the show to keep pushing the innovation. It <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> it enough." [...] In a similar list, Den of Geek named it the ninth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "it shouldn’t work, and yet it does, because although technically nothing happens, the episode shows us just how deep Walter has sunk into a metaphorical pit of despair and guilt, making himself the villain in his own story and despairing of ever being forgiven. It also gives the audience a refreshing break {{from some of the}} high level angst {{of the end of the}} season, allowing Peter and Olivia to act out a properly romantic storyline while their characters in the ‘real’ world have been torn apart. Also, there are singing corpses in it. Only on Fringe." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} {{cited as a}} factor in the success of the civil rights {{movement}} in the 1960s, however, in that it [...] "arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement". Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them. Civil Rights leader Andrew Young comments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it [...] "inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion" [...] and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as [...] "an act of humanity" [...] in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices. Alabama author Mark Childress compares it to the impact of Uncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novel [...] "gives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do,</b> because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Matt Groening, the lone episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he {{received}} an individual writing credit, though he has co-written for the episodes [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "The Telltale Head", and [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which {{tells the story of}} country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Show runner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a [...] "jerk" [...] in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that [...] "Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which we <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do,</b> we use secondary characters for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous {{to the ways in}} which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane.

Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the eastern}} part of the {{erstwhile}} Kamarupa kingdom, the Kachari (south bank of river Brahmaputra, central Assam) and the Chutiya (north bank of river Brahmaputra, eastern Assam) kingdoms arose, with some Bhuyan chiefs controlling the region just west of the Chutiya kingdom. The founder of the Chutiya kingdom Birpal formed his first capital in Swarnagiri (near present Subansiri river) in 1187 and later his son Ratnadhwajpal shifted the capital to Ratnapur [...] (present Majuli), absorbing the ancient Pal dynasty [...] in 1225 and finally to Sadiya in 1248. In the tract between the Kachari and the Chutiya kingdoms, a Shan group, led by Sukaphaa, established the Ahom kingdom. [...] The 16th century is crucial in the history of medieval period because of the consolidation of the Ahoms (who partially annexed the Chutiya kingdom and pushed the Kachari kingdom away from central Assam) in the east, the Koch in the west and the growth of Ekasarana Dharma of Srimanta Sankardev. [...] After the death of Nara Narayan of the Koch dynasty in the late 16th century, the Kamata kingdom broke into Koch Bihar in the west and Koch Hajo in the east. The rivalry between the two kingdoms resulted in the former allying with the Mughals and the latter with the Ahoms. Most of the 17th century saw the Ahom-Mughal conflicts, in which the Ahoms held the expansive Mughals at bay epitomized in the Battle of Saraighat of 1671, and which finally ended in 1682 with the defeat of the Mughals at Itakhuli in Guwahati. The Ahom kingdom reached its westernmost boundary till Manas River which it retains until 1826. Though the Ahom kingdom saw itself as the inheritor of the glory of the erstwhile Kamarupa kingdom and aspired to extend itself to the Karatoya river, it <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> so; though an Ahom general, Ton Kham under Swargadeo Suhungmung, reached the river once when he pursued a retreating invading army in the 16th century.|$|E

Turkish security policy in 1939 was {{based on the assumption that}} the Soviet Union would also join the [...] "peace front' with the expectation that the Soviets would bear the brunt of the fighting in Eastern Europe, and the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact threw such a wrench into Turkish planning that İnönü opted for neutrality. Papen had always been completely opposed to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, and Hitler's goal of undoing the eastern frontiers imposed on Germany by Versailles was also Papen's goal; only the possibility of a world war that might be caused by Germany attacking Poland in 1939 caused Papen to differ from Hitler. On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and two days on 3 September 1939 Britain and France declared war on Germany. Papen claimed later to have been opposed to Hitler's foreign policy in 1939 and was very depressed when he heard the news of the German attack on Poland on the radio as he maintained in his 1952 memoirs that he told his secretary on 1 September 1939 that [...] "this war is the worst crime and greatest madness that Hitler and his clique have ever committed...Nothing will be left but ruins."

2500|$|In 1850 {{he became}} head {{librarian}} at the Paris Conservatoire, the only official post {{he would ever}} hold, and a valuable source of income. During this year Berlioz also conducted an experiment on his many vocal critics. He composed a work entitled the Shepherd's Farewell and performed it in two concerts {{under the guise of}} it being by a composer named Pierre Ducré. This composer was of course a fictional construct by Berlioz. The trick worked, and the critics praised the work by 'Ducré' and claimed it was an example that Berlioz would do well to follow. [...] "Berlioz <b>could</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that!", he recounts in his Mémoires, was one of the comments. Berlioz later incorporated the piece into La fuite en Egypte from L'enfance du Christ. In 1852, Liszt revived Benvenuto Cellini in what was to become the [...] "Weimar version" [...] of the opera, containing modifications made with the approval of Berlioz. The performances were the first since the disastrous premiere of 1838. Berlioz travelled to London in the following year to stage it at Theatre Royal, Covent Garden but withdrew it after one performance owing to the hostile reception. It was during this visit that he witnessed a charity performance involving six thousand five hundred children singing in St Paul's Cathedral. Harriet Smithson died in 1854. L'enfance du Christ was completed later that year and was well-received upon its premiere. Unusually for a late Berlioz work, it appears to have remained popular long after his death. In October, Berlioz married Marie Recio. In a letter written to his son, he said that having lived with her for so long, it was his duty to do so. In early 1855 Le retour à la vie was revised and renamed Lélio. Shortly afterwards, the Te Deum received its premiere with Berlioz conducting. During a short visit to London, Berlioz had a long conversation with Wagner over dinner. A second edition of Treatise on Instrumentation was also published, with a new chapter detailing aspects of conducting.|$|E
