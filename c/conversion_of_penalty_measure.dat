Main part of this thesis is also the analysis of Italian law terminology from this part of law. The work is divided into several parts. The first part deals with brief historical development and fundamental sources of criminal law in both countries. The systems of Czech and Italian criminal sanctions are explained in detail in the second part. The third and fourth parts are concerned with only several kinds <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> and <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> protection. The detailed comparison of Czech and Italian criminal systems of criminal sanctions focused on their differences and similarities is analysed in the fifth part.

5000|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} Ryall {{during the}} 2014-15 A-League round 17 clash vs the Melbourne Victory {{when he was}} awarded a penalty following a possession contest with Victory player Gui Finkler. Initial replays appeared to show Ryall simulating contact with Finkler's leg. At the time, Melbourne Victory were leading 2-1, and the resulting <b>conversion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>penalty</b> kick allowed Sydney FC {{to get back into}} the game. The decision to award the penalty was heavily criticized by media commentators, managers, players, and pundits alike, with former player and Fox Sports commentator Mark Bosnich reacting angrily to the decision. Melbourne Victory player Kosta Barbarouses claimed he had [...] "lost respect" [...] for Ryall over the incident. Ryall also drew criticism from Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold, and CEO of the club Tony Pignata over his reaction following the awarding <b>of</b> the <b>penalty</b> where he appeared to clip Finkler over his head. On 19 February, Ryall was cleared of diving by the FFA Match Review Panel, with the board taking 2 hours to clear him following reviewing slowed down footage, which showed Ryall's leg being clipped by Finkler.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{analyzing}} the legal regime for {{the enforcement of}} fines and forfeiture measures as provided by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The institution of this category <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> and <b>measures</b> is unprecedented in international criminal law and has as major ambition of ensuring reparations for victims. The success of the restorative justice system under the Statute {{is dependent on the}} efficiency of the enforcement of fines and forfeitures ordered by the Court. Such success is actually based on domestic legal systems. Analysis of enforcement mechanisms of fines and forfeitures shows that the assistance of State authorities is vital in the enforcement of ICC decisions. To ensure effective enforcement of fines and forfeiture, the Statute enshrines the application of national legislation; which implicitly requires States Parties otherwise to adopt appropriate legislation, at least to undertake the adaptation of existing legislation. The satisfaction of this substantial requirement enables the States Parties to serenely execute their major obligations in this area (the obligation to give effect to fines or forfeitures ordered by the Court and the obligation {{to protect the rights of}} bona fide third parties) ...|$|R
40|$|The penalty kick in {{football}} is a seemingly simplistic play; however, it {{has increased in}} complexity since 1997 when the rules changed allowing goalkeepers to move laterally along their goal line before the ball was kicked. Prior to 1997 goalkeepers were required to remain still until the ball was struck. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the importance <b>of</b> the <b>penalty</b> kick in the modern game of football. A retrospective study of the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cup and the 2000, 2004 and 2008 European Championship tournaments was carried out, assessing the importance <b>of</b> the <b>penalty</b> kick in match play and shootouts and the effect of the time of the game on the shooter's success rate. This study demonstrated the <b>conversion</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> was 73 % in shootouts and 68 % in match play. Significantly more penalties were awarded late in the game: twice as many penalties in the second half than the first and close to four times as many in the fourth quarter vs. the first. Teams awarded penalty kicks during match play won 52 %, drew 30 % and lost 18 % of the time; chances of winning increased to 61 % if the penalty was scored, but decreased to 29 % if missed. Teams participating in either the World Cup or European Championship final match had roughly a 50 % chance of being involved in a penalty shootout during the tournament. Penalty shots and their outcome significantly impact match results in post 1997 football...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, the EITC will {{increase}} marriage penalties {{by at least}} $ 3. 1 billion (10. 4 percent) and reduce marriage bonuses by $ 439 million (1. 5 percent).

The {{paper is composed of}} five parts. Chapter One introduces Czechoslovak historical predecessors of the system <b>of</b> <b>penalty</b> points and examines the development of its current legal regulation in the Highway Traffic Act.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{approach to}} optimal criminal <b>penalties</b> <b>measures</b> the welfare effects {{of crime and}} punishment in dollar terms, ignoring differences in the marginal utility of money among people. This paper alternatively proposes using time as the unit of measure in determining optimal criminal <b>penalties,</b> <b>measuring</b> {{the costs and benefits}} of crime in hours or days instead of dollars. The policy implications differ substantially from those in the existing economic literature. Equal prison terms impose similar time costs on all individuals rather than being more costly for those with higher foregone earnings. Equal fines impose the same cost on all individuals in the dollar-based economic models but in a time-denominated system are costlier to those who require more time to earn the money to pay the fines. In principle, one can use either money or time in setting penalties. However, time-based penalties are more consistent with the fundamental and widely held principles of justice on which the U. S. legal system rests. Copyright 1995 Western Economic Association International. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{postponement}} of penal sentences due {{to illness}} {{is defined in}} article 16 of Law No. (5275) on the execution <b>of</b> <b>penalties</b> and security <b>measures</b> in Turkey. According to this article, the execution of a penal sentence is carried out if the disease or illness of a convicted criminal is mild and is treatable at a prison clinic or at a public hospital having separate out-patient or in-patient clinics for prisoners. On the other hand, if the convict is suffering from a serious or life-threatening disease and the execution may risk the convict's life, then execution of the sentence is delayed until the convict has suitably recovered. In Turkey, the decision to grant a stay in the execution of a penal sentence is given by the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office {{on the basis of}} medical reports prepared by the specialized health committees of public hospitals and approved by the Council of Forensic Medicine or directly prepared by the Council of Forensic Medicine. According to the law of the Council of Forensic Medicine, these reports are sent to the 3 rd Specialization Board of the Council of Forensic Medicine by the Prosecutor's Office and then a medical examination of the applicants is arranged. In the present paper, four cases are presented in order to show the working approach of the Council of Forensic Medicine. The first two cases exemplify medical conditions which entitle an ill convict to a stay in the execution of their prison sentence.
