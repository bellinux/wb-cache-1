5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the necessity for the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E
5|$|The union between Norway and Sweden, {{imposed by}} the Great Powers in 1814, had been under {{considerable}} strain through the 1890s, the chief issue in question being Norway's rights to its own <b>consular</b> <b>service.</b> Nansen, although not by inclination a politician, had spoken out on the issue on several occasions in defence of Norway's interests. It seemed, early in the 20th century that agreement {{between the two countries}} might be possible, but hopes were dashed when negotiations broke down in February 1905. The Norwegian government fell, and was replaced by one led by Christian Michelsen, whose programme was one of separation from Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago {{was the source of}} dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{provision}} of <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> is an obligation of every government to its {{citizens who are}} living abroad. In providing such services, efforts {{must be made to}} ensure that they are accessible to all citizens, wherever they may be. Under the current economic climate, maintaining an extensive network of embassies and consulates around the world is an expensive venture. It is against this background that governments must be innovative in providing services by ensuring that private and third sector organizations are involved, in order to complement their work of ensuring that <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> reach their citizens at affordable costs - wherever they are. Besides rendering <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> to South African (SA) citizens, consular offices can be a vital investment vehicle of the government abroad, by ensuring that much-needed investment is obtained. Furthermore, the <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> can serve as the first line of defence of a country, by ensuring that people who can cause harm to the country do not enter it. Despite the daunting challenges facing the post-apartheid government in SA, a number of changes have been undertaken to ensure that <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> are modernized. However, those changes have been inadequate and have fallen short of meeting the expectations of most South African citizens who are living abroad. This study makes a vital contribution on the concept of using partnership and outsourcing as tools for increased access to <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> in one of the critical missions of SA abroad - the United Kingdom, by showing that the traditional way of rendering <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> from a diplomatic mission is inadequate to reach potential customers scattered in parts of the host country. The study concludes with significant recommendations that, inter alia, include even using post offices and the internet to ensure that <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> reach all parts of the United Kingdom, where South Africans live. Given that <b>consular</b> <b>services</b> have inherent security implications, the study also notes that among factors that {{must be taken into account}} before outsourcing <b>consular</b> <b>services,</b> or even setting up a partnership, the chosen service providers must, amongst other things, be able to maintain and protect the confidentiality of their customers.

5|$|In 1872, the Sultanate of Sulu granted {{use of an}} area {{of land in the}} Sandakan Bay to William Frederick Schuck, {{a former}} agent of the German <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> who had lived on the Sulu island of Jolo since 1864. The arrival of German warship Nymph at the Sulu Sea in 1872 to {{investigate}} the Sulu-Spanish conflict made the Sultanate believe Schuck was connected with the German government. The Sultanate authorised Schuck to establish a trading port to monopolise the rattan trade in the northeast coast, where Schuck could operate freely, without the Spanish blockade. He continued this operation until this land also was ceded to Overbeck, with the Sultan receiving an annual payment of $5,000, by a treaty signed in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Like most of Borneo, {{this area}} was once {{under the control of}} the Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during the Brunei Civil War. Since the 18th century, Sandakan start to be ruled by the Sultanate of Sulu. In 1855, when Spanish power began to expand in the Philippine archipelago, they began to {{restrict}} the trade of foreign nations with Sulu by establishing a port in Zamboanga and issuing a ruling which declared that ships wanting to engage in trade with the Sulu Archipelago must first visit the Spanish port. In 1860, the Sultanate of Sulu became important to the British as their archipelago could allow the British to dominate trade routes from Singapore to Mainland China. But in 1864, William Frederick Schuck, a German ex-member for the German <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> arrived in Sulu and met Sultan Jamal ul-Azam, who encouraged him to remain in Jolo. Schuck associated himself with the Singapore-German trading firm of Schomburg and began working in the interest of the Sultan and Datu Majenji, who was an overlord in the island of Tawi-Tawi. While he continued his voyage to Celebes, he decided to open his first headquarters at Jolo. Large quantities of arms, opium, textiles and tobacco from Singapore were shipped to Tawi-Tawi in exchange for slaves from the Sultanate.|$|E

25|$|In Africa {{as a young}} man, Casement first {{worked for}} {{commercial}} interests before joining the British Colonial Service. In 1891 he was appointed as a British consul, a profession he followed for more than 20 years. Influenced by the Boer War and his investigation into colonial atrocities against indigenous peoples, Casement grew to distrust imperialism. After retiring from <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> in 1913, he became more involved with Irish republicanism and other separatist movements. He sought to obtain German support and weapons for an armed rebellion in Ireland against British rule during World War I.|$|E

Through his friendship with men such as Bulmer Hobson, a member both of the Volunteers and of the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), Casement established connections with exiled Irish nationalists, particularly Clan na Gael.|$|E

25|$|The Reorganization Act of 5 April 1906 regularized <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> with fixed tenures of office, fixed salaries, {{a system}} of promotion, and seven {{position}} classes including consuls general and consuls. This changed the prevailing trend, and in June 1908, the post of consular agency was raised {{to the rank of}} a consulate. In December 1908, with the recommendation by the U.S. Department of State, Nathaniel B. Stewart was appointed as the first representative of the American government with the title of Consul in Madras, who served the next two years. An office was established with the official status as a consulate {{on the third floor of}} a building owned by Parrys & Co., located on No. 1 China Bazaar Road, now known as Netaji Subash Chandra Bose Road, at Parry's Corner. Later, the office moved to a building between Rajaji Salai and Moore Street. When the building was demolished and built as a modern six-storied building, now known as Dare House, the U.S. Consulate continued its tenancy by occupying the fourth floor of the building in October 1940.|$|E
25|$|With the four-party Michelsen's Cabinet {{appointed}} in 1905, Parliament voted {{to establish a}} Norwegian <b>consular</b> <b>service.</b> This {{was rejected by the}} king and on 7 June Parliament unanimously approved the dissolution of the union. In the following dissolution referendum, only 184 people voted in favor of a union. The government offered the Norwegian crown to Denmark's Prince Carl, who after a plebiscite became Haakon VII. The following ten years, Parliament passed a series of social reforms, such as sick pay, factory inspection, a ten-hour working day and worker protection laws. Waterfalls for hydroelectricity became an important resource in this period and the government secured laws to hinder foreigners from controlling waterfalls, mines and forests. Large industrial companies established in these years were Elkem, Norsk Hydro and Sydvaranger. The Bergen Line was completed in 1909, the Norwegian Institute of Technology was established the following year and women's suffrage was introduced in 1913—as the second country in the world. From the 1880s to the 1920s, Norwegians carried out a series of polar expeditions. The most important explorers were Fridtjof Nansen, Roald Amundsen and Otto Sverdrup. Amundsen's expedition in 1911 became the first to reach the South Pole.|$|E
500|$|In February and March Nansen {{published}} {{a series of}} newspaper articles which placed him firmly in the separatist camp. The new prime minister wanted Nansen in the cabinet, but Nansen had no political ambitions. However, at Michelsen's request he went to Berlin and then to London where, {{in a letter to}} The Times, he presented Norway's legal case for a separate <b>consular</b> <b>service</b> to the English-speaking world. On 17 May 1905, Norway's Constitution Day, Nansen addressed a large crowd in Christiania, saying: [...] "Now have all ways of retreat been closed. Now remains only one path, the way forward, perhaps through difficulties and hardships, but forward for our country, to a free Norway". He also wrote a book, Norway and the Union with Sweden, specifically to promote Norway's case abroad.|$|E

500|$|On 23 May the Storting {{passed the}} Consulate Act {{establishing}} a separate <b>consular</b> <b>service.</b> King Oscar refused his assent; on 27 May the Norwegian cabinet resigned, but the king would not recognise this step. On 7 June the Storting unilaterally {{announced that the}} union with Sweden was dissolved. In a tense situation the Swedish government agreed to Norway's request that the dissolution should be put to a referendum of the Norwegian people. This was held on 13 August 1905 and resulted in an overwhelming vote for separation, at which point King Oscar relinquished the crown of Norway while retaining the Swedish throne. [...] A second referendum, held in November, determined that the new independent state should be a monarchy rather than a republic. In anticipation of this, Michelsen's government had been considering the suitability of various princes as candidates for the Norwegian throne. Faced with King Oscar's refusal to allow anyone from his own House of Bernadotte to accept the crown, the favoured choice was Prince Charles of Denmark. In July 1905 Michelsen sent Nansen to Copenhagen on a secret mission to persuade Charles to accept the Norwegian throne. Nansen was successful; shortly after the second referendum Charles was proclaimed king, taking the name Haakon VII. He and his wife, the British princess Maud, were crowned in the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim on 22 June 1906.|$|E
