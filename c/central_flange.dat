50|$|Before {{surgical}} {{intervention in}} adolescents, symptoms can be relieved by the combined oral contraceptive pill taken continuously {{to suppress the}} menstrual cycle or NSAIDs to relieve pain. Surgical treatment of the imperforate hymen by hymenotomy typically involves making cruciate incisions in the hymen, excising segments of hymen from their bases, and draining the vaginal canal and uterus. For affected girls who wish (or whose parents wish) to have their hymens preserved, surgical techniques to excise of a <b>central</b> <b>flange</b> of the hymen can be used. The timing of surgical hymen repair is controversial: some doctors believe {{it is best to}} intervene immediately after the neonatal period, while others believe that surgical repair should be delayed until puberty, when estrogenization is complete.|$|E
50|$|A spring rider or spring rocker is a bouncy, {{outdoors}} playing device {{consisting of}} a metal spring beneath a plastic or wooden <b>central</b> beam or <b>flange,</b> with 1 to 4 plastic or fiberglass seats above it. When a person sits on it, the structure moves and bounces. Spring riders are common in many playgrounds. They are often designed {{to look like an}} animal or a motorbike.|$|R
40|$|Flexible (simple) shear {{connections}} {{commonly used}} in steel-framed buildings are very economical and are relatively easy to fabricate. These connections are used for shear resistance, but {{recent studies have shown}} that they are capable of sustaining an interaction of rotational and axial load demand necessary for steel-framed building structures to help resist collapse in the event of unanticipated damage scenarios. The objective {{of this paper is to}} outline and discuss an experimental effort designed to evaluate the robustness of flexible WT connections. The experimental program included twelve full-scale tests of a system consisting of two wide flange beams connected to a <b>central</b> wide <b>flange</b> column stub by means of the WT connections. Three, four, and five bolt configurations were tested. The system was subjected to a quasi-dynamic loading scenario simulating the loss of a central support column. The experimental testing provides important information regarding the ability of these connections to sustain large rotational demands in conjunction with axial tension forces generated through geometric stiffness (catenary) effects when subjected to rapidly applied vertical loads...|$|R
50|$|In April 1935 four {{locomotives}} were {{reassigned to}} the Naples shed, for {{service on the}} new Rome-Naples line, and by July 1936 all twelve had been concentrated in Rome; however, both the E.326 and the E.428 suffered irregularities at speed that forced a temporary reduction of their top speed to 105 km/h. The E.428's issues were successfully solved, but those of the E.326 (which also tended to derail when going through a crossed switch) lingered; the FS tested several modifications to the chassis, including radically modifying the bogies, reducing the <b>central</b> driving wheels' <b>flanges</b> and fitting pneumatic cylinders to the bogies, but the irregularities remained {{and so did the}} reduction to their top speed. These issues, together with the increased availability of E.428, and the appearance of the ETR.200 for long-distance express trains, meant that from 1936 the E.326 were largely relegated to secondary services, and were reassigned to Bologna.|$|R
