The parliament appoints an ombudsman to promote and protect human rights and liberties established by the constitution, parliamentary legislation and treaties adopted by Croatia.

5|$|Although {{it is not}} {{a public}} holiday, 15 January is marked as the day Croatia won {{international}} recognition by Croatian media and politicians. On the day's 10th anniversary in 2002, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> minted a 25 kuna commemorative coin. In the period following the declaration of independence, the war escalated, with the sieges of Vukovar and Dubrovnik, and fighting elsewhere, until a ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to stabilization and a significant reduction of violence. The war effectively ended in August 1995 with a decisive victory for Croatia as a result of Operation Storm. Present day borders of Croatia were established when the remaining Serb-held areas of Eastern Slavonia were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995, with the process concluded in January 1998.|$|E

40|$|As {{the scale}} of tourism grows, the {{resource}} use threatens to become unsustainable. Withought environmental responsibility the levels of cheaper mass tourism will increase, forcing more “nature-based ” tourism {{to move on to}} new destinations. This scenario is opposite to the “Croatian Tourism Development by 2010 ” strategy. With a favourable geographic position, almost at the heart of Europe, Istria has always represented a bridge connecting the Middle European continental area with the Mediterranean. This area is the most visited Croatian tourist region with 27 % of all visitors and 35 % of time spent in all of Croatia. The <b>Croatian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank’s</b> preliminary figures for 2007 show that international tourism generated 18. 4 % of Croatian GDP. For these reasons the Istrian tourism industry can not ignore environmental issues in its management and requires the informed participation of all relevant stakeholders (according to the Agenda 21 for tourism industry). Properly planned tourism development, combined with environmental protection, produces the concept of sustainable tourism. Environmentally sustainable form of tourism represents a step forward from "sea and sun " mass tourism developed at the coastal part of Istria. There are a myriad of definitions for Sustainable Tourism, including eco-tourism, green travel, environmentally and culturally responsible tourism, fair trade and ethical travel. Mentioned selective tourism forms are adopted as the concept of the present and future Istrian destination development...|$|R

2500|$|Croatia's currency, the kuna, {{has used}} the euro (and prior to {{that one of the}} euro's major predecessors, the Deutsche Mark) as its main {{reference}} since its creation in 1994, and a long-held policy of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> has been to keep the kuna's exchange rate with the euro within a relatively stable range. Prior to Croatia becoming a member of the EU on 1 July 2013, Boris Vujčić, governor of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank,</b> stated that he would like the kuna to be replaced by the euro as soon as possible after accession. [...] In its first assessment under the convergence criteria in May 2014, the country satisfied the inflation and interest rate criteria, but did not satisfy the public finances and ERM membership criteria. The European Central Bank expects Croatia to be approved for ERM-II membership at the earliest in 2016, leading to a subsequent euro adoption at the earliest in 2019. [...] According to a eurobarometer poll in April 2015, 53 percent of Croatians are in favor of introducing the euro (a decrease of 2 percent from 2014), whereas 40 percent are opposed (an increase of 1 percent from 2014).|$|E

2500|$|When the <b>Croatian</b> <b>National</b> <b>Bank</b> {{turned down}} BayernLB's {{original}} bid {{to take over}} the local arm of Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International, this drew strong criticism from Stoiber, who said the decision was [...] "unacceptable" [...] and a [...] "severe strain" [...] for Bavaria's relations with Croatia. Croatia was seeking to join the European Union at the time. The central bank’s board later reviewed and accepted BayernLB's offer of 1.6 billion euros. The investment in Hypo Group Alpe Adria was part of a series of ill-fated investments, which later forced BayernLB to take a 10 billion-euro bailout in the financial crisis.|$|E
