A {{local newspaper}} stated, [...] "Word {{has just been}} received that Redoubt, one of the volcanoes at Cook's Inlet had an eruption on January 18, and the country for [...] around was covered with ashes and lava. The news comes from Sunrise, but nothing definite has been ascertained as to whether any damage was done, for no boats have as yet been {{in the neighborhood of}} the volcano." [...] There were many other news reports on the eruption, one describing the eruption as [...] "a terrific earthquake which burst the mountain asunder leaving a large gap," [...] which could possibly suggest the <b>crack</b> <b>formation</b> in the volcano's crater, however, it is unlikely. Supposedly, the volcano was ejecting [...] "flames" [...] from its caldera, and the eruption terrified natives in the area.

2500|$|A key {{safety feature}} of the aircraft's main gear box (MGB) is an {{emergency}} oil spraying sub-system present in the lubrication system; this is designed to exceed the JAR 29 Standard's requirements of a 30-minute running time {{in the event of}} the loss of MGB oil pressure, and has demonstrated up to 50-minute running time. The engine also incorporates a [...] "blade shedding" [...] system to ensure engine integrity during an overspeed instance. Energy absorbent self-sealing fuel tanks are contained in the aircraft's sponsons, along with other equipment such as downward-facing illumination and navigation lighting fixtures. The transmission can accommodate more power than the maximum output of the engines; however two aircraft were lost in 2012 due to the cracking of the bevel gear shaft, a gearbox component. In response, the design of the transmission was modified in 2013, and the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was upgraded to provide real-time monitoring of the bevel gear shaft against the threat of <b>crack</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the method of}} monitoring of <b>cracks</b> <b>formation</b> based on analysis of light impulses that appear during the <b>cracks</b> <b>formation.</b> The light impulses appear simultaneously in the ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) wave-length ranges. However, during the plastic deformation, where the building of micro cracks with narrow width is dominant, the light appears frequently in the UV-wavelength range. With the cracks growth the width become wide-ranging and the spectrum of light shifts to the NIR-wavelength range. This spectral shift was used to estimate the stage of <b>cracks</b> <b>formation</b> as degree of damage. The fracture of tested material can be predicted based on estimated degree of damage...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of statistical data {{has shown that}} about 60 % {{of all types of}} road surface destructions and damages in the Republic of Belarus are attributed to cracks (separate, frequent and cracks network). The process of <b>cracks</b> <b>formation</b> in the asphalt concrete pavement is rather complicated and it is affected by a number of factors. The most important and determining factors are character and value of traffic loads, temperature action, road pavement structure, properties of materials used for its layers. Some regularities of the <b>cracks</b> <b>formation</b> and development in the asphalt-concrete layers of the pavement have been established {{on the basis of the}} physical and mathematical modeling. Application of a finite  element  method for  calculations  has made it possible to determine  numerical values of compressive and tensile stresses arising due to temperature action and traffic load, deflection of road pavement constructive layers.

50|$|Polymer {{fracture}} is {{the study}} of the fracture surface of an already failed material to determine the method of <b>crack</b> <b>formation</b> and extension in polymers both fiber reinforced and otherwise. Failure in polymer components can occur at relatively low stress levels, far below the tensile strength because of four major reasons: long term stress or creep rupture, cyclic stresses or fatigue, the presence of structural flaws and stress-cracking agents.Formations of submicroscopic cracks in polymers under load have been studied by x ray scattering techniques and the main regularities of <b>crack</b> <b>formation</b> under different loading conditions have been analyzed. The low strength of polymers compared to theoretically predicted values are mainly due to the many microscopic imperfections found in the material. These defects namely dislocations, crystalline boundaries, amorphous interlayers and block structure can all lead to the non-uniform distribution of mechanical stress.|$|E
50|$|High {{temperatures}} {{soften the}} asphalt binder, allowing heavy tire loads to deform the pavement into ruts.
