60|$|The simplest, {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} kinds, is a very compact, heavy, greenish-black rock, having an angular, irregular fracture, with some points just hard enough to scratch glass, and infusible. This variety passes into others of paler green tints, less hard, but with a more <b>crystalline</b> <b>fracture,</b> and translucent on their edges; and these are fusible into a green enamel. Several other varieties are chiefly characterised by containing innumerable threads of dark-green serpentine, and by having calcareous matter in their interstices. These rocks have an obscure, concretionary structure, and are full of variously coloured angular pseudo fragments. These angular pseudo fragments consist of the first-described dark green rock, of a brown softer kind, of serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which, perhaps, is related to serpentine rock. There are other vesicular, calcareo-ferruginous, soft stones. There is no distinct stratification, but parts are imperfectly laminated; and the whole abounds with innumerable veins, and vein-like masses, both small and large. Of these vein-like masses, some calcareous ones, which contain minute fragments of shells, are clearly of subsequent origin to the others.|$|E
60|$|Near Illapel, {{after passing}} for some {{distance}} over granite, andesite, and andesitic porphyry, {{we come to}} a greenish stratified feldspathic rock, which I believe is altered clay-slate, conformably capped by porphyries and porphyritic conglomerate of great thickness, dipping at an average angle of 20 degrees to N.E. by N. The uppermost beds consist of conglomerates and sandstone only a little metamorphosed, and conformably covered by a gypseous formation of very great thickness, but much denuded. This gypseous formation, where first met with, lies in a broad valley or basin, a little southward of the mines of Los Hornos: the lower half alone contains gypsum, not in great masses as in the Cordillera, but in innumerable thin layers, seldom more than an inch or two in thickness. The gypsum is either opaque or transparent, and is associated with carbonate of lime. The layers alternate with numerous varying ones of a calcareous clay-shale (with strong aluminous odour, adhering to the tongue, easily fusible into a pale green glass), more or less indurated, either earthy and cream-coloured, or greenish and hard. The more indurated varieties have a compact, homogeneous, almost <b>crystalline</b> <b>fracture,</b> and contain granules of crystallised oxide of iron. Some of the varieties almost resemble honestones. There is also a little black, hardly fusible, siliceo- calcareous clay-slate, like some of the varieties alternating with gypsum on the Peuquenes range.|$|E
6000|$|At the {{northern}} end of Quiriquina Island, in the Bay of Concepcion, at least eight rudely parallel dikes, which have been guided to a certain extent by the cleavage of the slate, occur within the space of a quarter of a mile. They vary much in composition, resembling in many respects the dikes at Low's Harbour: the greater number consist of feldspathic porphyries, sometimes containing grains of quartz: one, however, was black and brilliant, like an augitic rock, but really formed of feldspar; others of a feldspathic nature were perfectly white, with either an earthy or <b>crystalline</b> <b>fracture,</b> and including grains and regular octagons of quartz; these white varieties passed into ordinary greenstones. Although, both here and at Low's Harbour, the nature of the rock varied considerably in the same dike, yet I cannot but think that at these two places and {{in other parts of the}} Chonos group, where the dikes, though close to each other and running parallel, are of different composition, that they must have been formed at different periods. In the case of Quiriquina this is a rather interesting conclusion, for these eight parallel dikes cut through the metamorphic schists in a N.W. and S.E. line, and since their injection the overlying cretaceous or tertiary strata have been tilted (whilst still under the sea) from a N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. line; and again, during the great earthquake of February 1835, the ground in this neighbourhood was fissured in N.W. and S.E. lines; and from the manner in which buildings were thrown down, it was evident that the surface undulated in this same direction.

They {{were based on a}} GKVI- 300 high-voltage narrow-pulse generator Morozov et al. (2011). It is possible using these two approaches to decrease the period of the harmonic load up to 100 ns. The study of fracture surfaces of aluminum and copper samples after the test was carried out on an optical microscope Axio-Observer-Z 1 -M in a dark field, and study of the cross sections structure - in the bright field or C-DIC. The structure has been studied in cross sections after appropriate etching. Grain size and the number of pores on the surface of cross sections were determined after etching. Microhardness was measured on a PMT- 3 device with a load of 20 g. The optical micrographs of aluminum demonstrate that the long pulse causes almost fully ductile fracture. In the case of the short pulse, the number of fibers decreases: the fracture surface exhibits the signs of both ductile cup fracture and brittle <b>crystalline</b> <b>fracture</b> with cracks, which are sometimes rather deep. In addition, the short pulse results in twinning, which seems surprising for aluminum featuring a high stacking fault energy. It is seen that under short loading dynamic recrystallization occurs.

Results clearly indicate that the most conductive parts of each fan were where the grout has penetrated the most during grouting. They also show that the reduction of the transmissivity in the rock by means of grouting is about four orders of magnitude within the studied rock volume of a fan. This sealing takes place easily on planar fractures where the transmissivity is high (a few conductive fractures that give the major contribution to the borehole transmissivity) and what is left unsealed is a highly channelized system. This channelized system will be extremely difficult to hit by future boreholes, which will make post-grouting a very complex task...|$|R

With increasing Al additions, the grain morphology in the as-processed microstructures varied from elongated to bimodal to equiaxed, {{with a change}} {{in the nature of the}} grain-boundary film from amorphous to partially crystalline to fully <b>crystalline.</b> <b>Fracture</b> toughness and cyclic fatigue tests on these microstructures revealed that although the 7 wt. % Al containing material (7 ABC) was extremely brittle, the 3 and particularly 5 wt. % Al materials (3 ABC and 5 ABC, respectively) displayed excellent crack-growth resistance at both ambient (25 C) and elevated (1300 C) temperatures. Indeed, no evidence of creep damage, in the form of grain-boundary cavitation, was seen at temperatures at 1300 C or below. The enhanced toughness of the higher Al-containing materials was associated with extensive crack bridging from both interlocking grains (in 3 ABC) and uncracked ligaments (in 5 ABC); in contrast, the 7 ABC SiC showed no such bridging, concomitant with a marked reduction in the volume fraction of elongated grains. Mechanistically, cyclic fatigue-crack growth in 3 ABC and 5 ABC SiC involved the progressive degradation of such bridging ligaments in the crack wake, with the difference in the degree of elastic vs. frictional bridging affecting the slope, i. e., Paris law exponent, of the crack-growth curve. In addition an investigation of fracture resistance in non-transforming ceramics toughened by grain bridging mechanism is presented using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). Linear superposition theorems are used for the superposition of crack opening displacements, as well as stress intensity factors, resulting from the external tractions and the internal compressive bridging stresses. Specifically weight functions are used to relate the CODs, stress intensity factors, and tractions and the bridging stress.

In an approximately 10 × 10 × 1. 5 km 3 hypothetical study area, up to 1000 major and intermediate fracture zones are generated from surface lineament analyses and subsurface surveys.

The results demonstrate that, in general, groundwater lifetime expectancy increases with depth and it is greatest inside major matrix blocks. Various sources and aspects of uncertainty are considered, specifically geometric and hydraulic parameters of permeable fracture zones. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the existence and location of permeable fracture zones and the relationship between fracture zone permeability and depth from ground surface are the most significant factors for lifetime expectancy distribution in such a crystalline rock environment.

Anthropogenic gas tracers as CFC, SF 6, 85 Kr, 36 Cl or 3 H {{have been widely used}} to study shallow groundwaterswith residence time of less than 70 yrs. For longer groundwater residence time (100 - x 1000 yr), 39 Ar, 14 C, 36 Cland 4 He have been used. 4 He can cover an age range of 100 to thousands years. The main difficulty is to estimatethe production rate through U and Th decay and the others fluxes : atmosphere, crust and mantellic. In many casesU-Th production is not sufficient to explain the 4 He concentrations observed in the aquifer. Other 4 He fluxescan then be estimated through the use of other tracers: 14 C, 36 Cl or modeling. Fracturing may also enhance 4 Heconcentrations in groundwater.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of redox conditions in sparsely <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> rocks {{is an important}} and largely unresolved issue {{with respect to the}} assessment of the long-term geochemical conditions in deep geological repositories for nuclear wastes (e. g. [1 - 4]). The ingress of oxygen (i. e. oxygen-rich waters), especially in disruptive scenarios (e. g. due to faulting or earthquakes) or due to intrusion of glacial meltwaters (during/after glaciation events), into the repository may result in redox zonation and may create oxidizing conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} emplaced wastes. The penetration of oxygen can in consequence adversely affect the long-term repository performance due to (i) enhanced corrosion of metallic waste containers, (ii) increased matrix corrosion of and radionuclide release from the disposed spent fuel, which is a very stable waste form under the prevailing strongly reducing conditions, and (iii) an increase in the mobility of certain radionuclides (e. g. uranium, plutonium, technetium) that would be retained in the repository near-field under reducing conditions. However, the presence of (FeII-bearing) reduced minerals (such as pyrite, chlorite, and biotite) in the rock matrix or in fracture fillings may lead to oxygen consumption along the flow path and provide sufficient redox buffering to sustain strongly reducing conditions in the repository environment. The (coupled) reactive transport simulation of redox transients and radionuclide behaviour into fractured rocks is computationally demanding and usually requires significant simplifications, since these simulations usually suffer stiffness and require a high spatially discretization as well as small time steps, for example due to (i) fast reaction kinetics, (ii) significantly different timescales of various hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical processes, (iii) the heterogeneous flow field and the heterogeneous distribution of minerals in fractures and the rock matrix, and (iv) the development of reaction fronts and high concentration gradients. In this work, the reactive behaviour of oxygen in crystalline rocks and its consequences for radionuclide migration is investigated by means of High Performance Reactive Transport Modelling (HP-RTM) at sub-millimetre scale (mineral scale). The models use discrete fracture networks representing the micro-porosity of the rock, and a discrete representation of minerals thus avoiding an averaged equivalent porous media approach. A key scientific interest of these simulations is the evaluation of the validity of the macroscropic (continuum) approach, accepted and normally used to simulate this problem, by comparing with the computed results obtained in the sub-millimetre scale simulations with a realistic representation of the micro-fractures (discrete description) in the rock matrix. The numerical tool used for the HP-RTM is named iDP (interface DarcyTools-PFLOTRAN). PFLOTRAN [5] is a next-generation, open source, reactive flow and transport simulator for modelling subsurface processes that has been developed by a consortium of National Research Laboratories of the Department of Energy of USA. PFLOTRAN has been built on top of well-known frameworks like MPI, PETSc and HDF. It has demonstrated peta-scale performance in simulations of uranium migration in the superfund Hanford 300 Area as part of the SciDAC- 2 programme [6, 7]. On the other hand, DarcyTools [8] is one of the best codes available to simulate groundwater flow in <b>crystalline,</b> <b>fractured</b> rocks. DarcyTools has been developed by SKB, the Swedish Agency for nuclear waste management. Just like PFLOTRAN, DarcyTools is based on the finite volume method and uses MPI for its parallelization. These two simulation tools are combined by iDP, providing a common framework for coupling groundwater flow and geochemical processes in <b>crystalline,</b> <b>fractured</b> rocks. iDP is written in a modular, cross-platform and extensible way using Fortran and Python. This work illustrates the use of iDP for improving the fundamental understanding of key processes for radionuclide transport in the geosphere. The simulations have been performed at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre, using JUQUEEN, one of the biggest supercomputers in the world. Numerical experiments demonstrate that reactive transport simulations scale properly up to thousands of computational cores, pointing out that HP-RTM is a very powerful methodological tool for future performance assessment exercises for deep geological repositories.

40|$|A {{region of}} high heads within the Borrowdale Volcanic Group (BVG; a <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> rock) beneath {{the coastal plain}} of West Cumbria, England (UK), is {{identified}} as a possible relic left over by the Late Devensian ice sheet. It was found during investigations in the 1990 s. Contemporary modelling work failed to produce a satisfactory explanation of the high heads compatible with the ‘cold recharge’ isotopic signature of the groundwater. This study has reassessed the original hydraulic testing results. By plotting density-adjusted heads versus their depth below the water table {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the borehole in which they were measured, a depth profile resembling a ‘wave’ was revealed with a peak value located at 1, 100 m depth. The possibility that this wave represents relic heads from the last major ice sheet has been assessed using one-dimensional mathematical analysis based on a poroelastic approach. It is found that a wet-based ice sheet above the West Cumbrian coast was probably thick enough and sufficiently long-lasting to leave such relic heads providing that the hydraulic diffusivity of the BVG is in the order of 10 ? 6 m s? 1. Initial assessment 20 years ago of the long-interval slug tests suggested that such low values are not likely. More recent interpretation argues for such low values of hydraulic diffusivity. It is concluded that ice sheet recharge is the most likely cause of the raised heads, that the BVG contains significant patches of very low conductivity rock, and that long-interval single-hole tests should be avoided in <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> rock...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Vertical {{settlements}} with magnitudes reaching 12 cm {{were measured}} in <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> rock sever-al hundred metres above the Gotthard highway tunnel in central Switzerland. Such magnitudes of surface subsi-dence were unexpected, especially in granitic gneisses {{and appear to}} be related to large-scale consolidation of fractures resulting from fluid drainage and pore pressure changes following tunnel construction. This paper focus-es on the mechanisms involved in the development of such surface displacements and presents the preliminary results of 2 -D discontinuum (i. e. distinct-element) and 2 -D continuum modelling (i. e. finite-element). Results show that settlements are most sensitive to horizontal joints, as would be expected, but that vertical fractures also contribute to the settlement profile through a ‘Pois...|$|R
40|$|An {{appraisal}} of the groundwater potential {{as well as its}} potability in Oke-Oyi area and its environs was undertaken. This was done in order to provide information on the evaluation of groundwater system in the area {{as well as on the}} physico-chemical quality of the groundwater for domestic and Agricultural purposes. The Study entails analysing pumping test data in order to compute the hydraulic characteristics of seven boreholes in the area. Fifteen groundwater samples were also collected from boreholes and hand-dug wells in the area and analysed for their physical and chemical properties. The two aquifer units in the area are weathered overburden aquifer and <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> aquifer. The boreholes tapping these aquifers have yields that range fro...|$|R
40|$|In situ stope {{leaching}} is {{an innovative}} mining system {{that reduces the}} surface impacts of conventional underground mining. As in any leaching operation, stope leaching requires hydrologic site characterization and control of leaching solutions. Several tracer tests, using sodium chloride (NaCl) in various concentrations, were conducted by the U. S. Bureau of Mines (USBM) in an underground experimental stope to simulate a leaching environment. The tests were conducted in <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> rock that was partially water-saturated. As tests progressed, the surrounding fractures became more saturated. A predominant flow direction away from the stope was found during testing. Testing procedures, results, and a remediation plan for in situ leaching based on field observations are presented in this report...|$|R
40|$|Mannitol is an {{essential}} excipient employed in orally disintegrating tablets due to its high palatability. However its fundamental disadvantage is its fragmentation during direct compression, producing mechanically weak tablets. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to assess the <b>fracture</b> behaviour of <b>crystalline</b> mannitol in relation to the energy input during direct compression, utilising ball milling as the method of energy input, whilst assessing tablet characteristics of post-milled powders. Results indicated that <b>crystalline</b> mannitol <b>fractured</b> at the hydrophilic (011) plane, as observed through SEM, alongside a reduction in dispersive surface energy. Disintegration times of post-milled tablets were reduced due to the exposure of the hydrophilic plane, whilst more robust tablets were produced. This was shown through higher tablet hardness and increased plastic deformation profiles of the post-milled powders, as observed with a lower yield pressure through an out-of-die Heckel analysis. Evaluation of crystal state using x-ray diffraction/differential scanning calorimetry showed that mannitol predominantly retained the β-polymorph; however x-ray diffraction provided a novel method to calculate energy input into the powders during ball milling. It can be concluded that particle size reduction is a pragmatic strategy to overcome the current limitation of mannitol fragmentation and provide improvements in tablet properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this task (part of {{deliverable}} D 6. 1) is to study the immobilization/ remobilization of Pu under simulated near-field condi¬tions: Fe as iron coupon mimic the canister material, and magnetite as the relevant <b>crystalline</b> rock <b>fracture</b> filling Fe(II) minerals found at for example ÄSPÖ Hard Rock Laboratory. In collaboration between ITU and Studsvik, solutions of hexavalent Pu were exposed to iron coupons, either freshly polished Fe(0) or pre-corroded and coated with Fe 3 O 4, under anoxic conditions. Plutonium and Fe concentration in solution {{as a function of}} time was monitored by sector field inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS) and γ-spectrometry. Plutonium precipitate on the iron phases were characterized by scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) and α-track analysis. It can be concluded that only 1 % of the added amount of Pu(VI) was reduced by Fe 3 O 4 after a contact time of 4 months. There was no Pu(VI) reduction on the Fe coupons. Considering the small negative DG-values and the small amount of Pu(VI) reduced on the magnetite surface it can be concluded that it is a relatively slow reduction reaction. JRC.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{sequence}} of purely advective transport models that demonstrate the influence of small-scale geometric inhomogeneities on contaminant transport in <b>fractured</b> <b>crystalline</b> rock. Special weight {{is placed on the}} role of statistically generated variable fracture apertures. The fracture network geometry and the aperture distribu-tion are based on information from an in situ radionuclide retardation experiment performed at Grimsel test site (Swiss Alps). The obtained breakthrough curves are fitted with the advection dispersion equation and continuous-time random walks (CTRW). CTRW is found to provide superior fits to the late-arrival tailing and is also found to show a good correlation with the velocity distributions obtained from the hydraulic models. The impact of small-scale heterogeneities, both in fracture geometry and aperture, on transport is shown to be considerable...|$|R
40|$|A {{suite of}} {{molecular}} methods targeting 16 S rRNA genes (i. e., DGGE, clone and high-throughput [HTP] amplicon library sequencing) {{was used to}} profile the microbial communities in deep Fen-noscandian <b>crystalline</b> bedrock <b>fracture</b> fluids. Variation among bacterial 16 S rRNA genes was ex-amined with two commonly used primer pairs: P 1 /P 2 and U 968 f/U 1401 r. DGGE using U 968 f/ U 1401 r mostly detected β-, γ-proteobacteria and Firmicutes, while P 1 /P 2 primers additionally detected other proteobacterial clades and candidate divisions. However, in combination with clone libraries the U 968 f/U 1401 r primers detected a higher bacterial diversity than DGGE alone. HTP amplicon sequencing with P 1 /P 2 revealed an abundance of the DGGE bacterial {{groups as well as}} many other bacterial taxa likely representing minor components of these communities. Ar-chaeal diversity was investigated via DGGE or HTP amplicon sequencingusing primers A 344 F/ 519 RP. The majority of archaea detected with HTP amplicon sequencing belonged to uncultured Thermoplasmatales and Pendant 33 /DHVE 3, 4, 6 groups. DGGE of the same samples detected mostly SAGMEG and Methanosarcinales archaea, but almost none of those were revealed by HTP amplicon sequencing. Overall, our results show that the inferred diversity and composition of mi...|$|R
40|$|Active {{microbial}} {{communities of}} deep <b>crystalline</b> bedrock <b>fracture</b> water were investigated from seven different boreholes in Olkiluoto (Western Finland) using bacterial and archaeal 16 S rRNA, dsrB, and mcrA gene transcript targeted 454 pyrosequencing. Over a depth range of 296 – 798 [*]m below ground surface the microbial communities changed according to depth, salinity gradient, and sulphate and methane concentrations. The highest bacterial diversity {{was observed in}} the sulphate-methane mixing zone (SMMZ) at 250 – 350 [*]m depth, whereas archaeal diversity was highest in the lowest boundaries of the SMMZ. Sulphide-oxidizing ε-proteobacteria (Sulfurimonas sp.) dominated in the SMMZ and γ-proteobacteria (Pseudomonas spp.) below the SMMZ. The active archaeal communities consisted mostly of ANME- 2 D and Thermoplasmatales groups, although Methermicoccaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, and Thermoplasmatales (SAGMEG, TMG) were more common at 415 – 559 [*]m depth. Typical indicator microorganisms for sulphate-methane transition zones in marine sediments, such as ANME- 1 archaea, α-, β- and δ-proteobacteria, JS 1, Actinomycetes, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and MBGB Crenarchaeota were detected at specific depths. DsrB genes were most numerous and most actively transcribed in the SMMZ while the mcrA gene concentration was highest in the deep methane rich groundwater. Our results demonstrate that active and highly diverse but sparse and stratified microbial communities inhabit the Fennoscandian deep bedrock ecosystems...|$|R
