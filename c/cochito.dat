5000|$|The vaquita ( [...] ; Phocoena sinus) is a {{rare species}} of {{porpoise}} endemic to {{the northern part of}} the Gulf of California. The word vaquita is Spanish for [...] "little cow". Other names include <b>cochito</b> (Spanish for [...] "little car"), desert porpoise, vaquita porpoise, Gulf of California harbor porpoise, Gulf of California porpoise, and gulf porpoise. Since the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) is believed to have gone extinct in 2006, the vaquita has taken on the title of the most endangered cetacean in the world. It has been listed as critically endangered since 1996. The population was estimated at 600 in 1997, below 100 in 2014, approximately 60 in 2015 and approximately 30 in November 2016, leading to the conclusion that the species will soon be extinct unless drastic action is taken.|$|E

40|$|The vaquita (Spanish for 2 ̆ 2 little cow 2 ̆ 2), or Gulf of California harbor {{porpoise}} (Phocoena sinus), has {{the most}} limited range of any marine cetacean and is probably the rarest. It has been caught incidentally in gill nets set commercially for totoaba (Totoaba macdonaldi), large fish that were over-exploited in the upper Gulf of California until they, too, were endangered. In 1975. the Mexican Government announced a total indefinite closure on fishing for totoaba, Between the time this porpoise was described as new to science (1958) and its listing by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service as Endangered (early 1985), the vaquita was known from only 26 confirmed records (partial remains found on beaches) and a few sightings of live animals. (Note: the vernacular name 2 ̆ 2 <b>cochito</b> 2 ̆ 2 was cited when this animal was listed, but biologists have since learned that 2 ̆ 2 vaquita 2 ̆ 2 is the term used by most local fishermen.)
