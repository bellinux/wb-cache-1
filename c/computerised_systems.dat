25|$|Upon its {{introduction}} to service, the Nimrod {{was hailed as}} possessing advanced electronic equipment such as onboard digital computers; the increased capability of these electronic systems allowed the RAF's fleet of 46 Nimrod aircraft to provide equal coverage {{to that of the}} larger fleet of retiring Avro Shackletons. The design philosophy of these <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> was that of a 'man-machine partnership'; while onboard computers performed much of the data sift and analysis processes, decisions and actions on the basis of that data remained in the operator's hands. To support the Nimrod's anticipated long lifespan, onboard computers were designed to be capable of integrating with various new components, systems, and sensors that could be added in future upgrades. After a mission, gathered information could be extracted for review purposes and for further analysis.|$|E

25|$|The Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FSAC) and Financial Sector Reform Programme (FSRP) {{were formed}} in 1990, upon {{contracts}} with the World Bank. These programs sought to remove government distortions and lessen the financial repression. Policies made use of the McKinnon-Shaw hypothesis, which stated that removing distortions augments efficiency in the credit market and increases competition. The policies therefore involved banks providing loans on a commercial basis, enhancing bank efficiency and limiting government control to monetary policy only. FSRP forced banks to have a minimum capital adequacy, to systematically classify loans and to implement modern <b>computerised</b> <b>systems,</b> including those that handle accounting. It forced the central bank to free up interest rates, revise financial laws and increase supervision in the credit market. The government also developed the capital market, which was also performing poorly.|$|E

5000|$|Vertical-format Edmondson card-size {{tickets were}} the final {{manifestation of the}} Edmondson in the UK. The NCR21 system was used at Southern Region station booking offices from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s, until supplanted by the early {{generation}} of <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> including INTIS and APTIS. Vertical-format Edmonsons were validated in NCR21 cash registers—this is the machine printed date/fare/machine number on the ticket front. Some NCR24 machines were later bought from Dutch Railways for use on the Southern and these were distinguishable from NCR21 because the machine data—in a slightly different format—appeared upside down on tickets. To interest collectors, even the smaller stations would carry pre-printed ticket stock for single and return, adult and child journeys to numerous local stations and London, with [...] "blank" [...] stock also available for use for journeys for which no printed stock was available.|$|E

Farmers {{who are using}} software note they can save time, the software supports their farm management work, and it also enables them to use management approaches requiring more detailed information. Farmers who are not using <b>computerised</b> <b>systems,</b> but are considering this possibility, explain they are facing other priorities relative to improving their information systems. They {{are aware of the}} computer and software advantages, and they have a positive feeling towards computing technology. Some of them, however, feel insecure about their ability to use computers. Farmers not considering <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> believe computer technology is useless for their particular situations. Some farmers think <b>computerised</b> <b>systems</b> are unable to solve their actual farm problems, others feel themselves too old to learn the new technology.
