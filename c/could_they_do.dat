500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but I will not have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what was coming, and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, what else <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E
2500|$|Upon his {{recovery}} from the bout of illness and associated treatment, Reed resumed his education at Syracuse University in 1960, studying journalism, film directing, and creative writing. He was a platoon leader in ROTC and was later expelled from the program for holding an unloaded gun to his superior's head. In 1961, he began hosting a late-night radio program on WAER called Excursions On A Wobbly Rail. Named after a song by pianist Cecil Taylor, the program typically featured doo wop, rhythm and blues, and jazz, particularly the free jazz developed in the mid-1950s. Many of Reed's guitar techniques, such as the guitar-drum roll, were inspired by jazz saxophonists, such as Ornette Coleman. Reed's sister Merrill offered the following recollection of her brother's time spent at Syracuse: [...] " [...] started a band, {{he had his own}} radio show. [...] He reportedly libeled some student on his radio show; the kid's family tried to sue my father. And there were other extracurricular possibly illegal activities of which the university didn't approve. I believe they tried to kick him out. But he was a genius; what <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> [...] He stayed and he graduated." [...] Reed graduated with honors from Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences with a B.A. in English in June 1964.|$|E
2500|$|It may be possible, then, {{that our}} intuitions {{about the role}} of our {{conscious}} [...] "intentions" [...] have led us astray; it may be the case that we have confused correlation with causation by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in neurostimulation, brain damage, but also research into introspection illusions. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for moral responsibility. Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is [...] "intuitive": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues [...] "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else <b>could</b> <b>they</b> <b>do?</b> The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion". Philosopher Walter Jackson Freeman III nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes [...] "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly {{trying to keep up with}} what we do." [...] To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.|$|E
