At present I stand high in the favour of Nero, but that favour may fail me at any day, and my life at the palace is becoming unbearable; but besides, it is impossible that this orgy of crime and debauchery can continue. The vengeance of heaven cannot be much longer delayed. The legions in the provinces are utterly discontented and well nigh mutinous, and even if Rome continues to support Nero the time cannot be far off when the legions proclaim either Galba, or Vespasian, or some other general, as emperor, and then the downfall of Nero must come.

According to Gaidai, Varley has won {{him with her}} ingénue charms, but she later opined that one particular episode might {{have proved to be}} the decisive one....So I came to the Mosfilm. Read a script fragment. Did the donkey episode. Then Gaidai asks me, somewhat diffidently: 'And now, Natasha, <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> perhaps to undress - down to a swimming suit?' 'Sure', I said, and did. Everybody just went: 'Aahh!' It is now that for actresses undressing is business-as-usual. In those years the Soviet cinema, as well as the Soviet people, were so much more shy. But for me the swimming-suit was a kind of circus uniform, I got used to it. So we shoot the episode with a swimming-suit, and I think it was the one that made all the difference.|$|E

5000|$|BPI Entertainment News Wire {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, writing, [...] "Say No More is a sonically adventurous album on which Walker offers more pop tendencies than usual, without sacrificing his country pedigree. He sings with passion throughout, especially on piano-based ballads like Real the soulful You Deliver Me, and the conversational <b>Could</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ask</b> <b>You</b> Not to Dance. This is a diverse package that effectively demonstrates Walker's versatility and maturity." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of AllMusic described the album by writing [...] "Say No More {{is a fine}} album from an artist who has proved his staying power time and time again." [...] Jerry Sharpe of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette gave the album a four star rating and wrote, [...] "All told, it's a nice mixture masterfully performed. Consider this a [...] "don't miss" [...] disc for Walker fans." [...] Mike Clark of Country Standard Time gave the album a negative review by writing, [...] "Neither pop nor country, this is easily Walker's least satisfying CD.

He writes {{as if he was}} so accustomed to conquer, that he has a poor opinion of his victims. Nothing’s new except their faces, says he: “every woman is the same.” He says this in his first comedy, which he wrote languidly(70) in illness, when he was an “excellent young man”. Richelieu at eighty could have hardly said a more excellent thing.|$|R

Were it not the case, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not plead for these schools; above all at this time, when the battle between ancient superstition and modern enlightenment in this land seems fast coming to a crisis and a death struggle. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to help any school on earth in which I had not fair proof that the teachers taught, on physical and human as well as on moral subjects, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God.|$|R

What can we do for a living? Great God! What can we do? Why, I am so useless that even when my poor boy earned 25 pounds for his picture, I felt we were bound to send it to Sarah Mason, and you may fancy when this came to Mrs. Mackenzie's ears, what a life my boy and I led. I have never spoken of these things to any mortal soul--I even don't speak of them with Clive--but seeing your kind and honest face has made me talk--you must pardon my garrulity--I am growing old, Arthur.

40|$|Narrator: A teacher {{approaches}} a man after an educational conference. She {{has a large}} bag of materials on one arm that she {{picked up at the}} vendor stands. She is excited to meet Dr. Timothy Rasinski, a literacy researcher and leader. Teacher: Dr. Rasinski, I was wondering if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. My students seem to be having some issues with fluency. Their automaticity, when reading a text, is lacking. I can tell that many of them have a rather limited sight word vocabulary and struggle with prosody and expression. I know about how fluency and comprehension walk hand-in-hand. I'm just {{not sure what to do}} now. Dr. Rasinski: You make a good point here about the connection between comprehension and fluency. Fluency, the ability for readers to read quickly, effortlessly, and efficiently with good expression is a key component of effective literacy instruction. Teacher: Yes, I agree. I see the link every day with my students. Sadly, sometimes, I see my students struggle with comprehension due to lack of fluency. We do paired readings and repeated readings to build fluency. These do help but do you have any other suggestions that might be more fun and exciting? Dr. Rasinski: Why, yes! I think you might consider trying Reader’s Theater. It’s an authentic and entertaining activity that helps students improve their word recognition, fluency, and comprehension. Teacher: I don't know if this is for me. I don’t have a great deal of time to put on a theatrical play with props and costumes. Dr. Rasinski: That’s the great part about Reader's Theater! It requires no props, costumes, or scenery unless the teacher and students want to include them. Teacher: This sounds great. What are the steps? Dr. Rasinski: Let me share with you how this strategy works...|$|R
6000|$|He {{proposed}} to sail {{here and there}} about the Channel, wherever it might please the wind to take him. Friends would accompany him, but not in any number. The yacht was not {{large enough to accommodate}} comfortably {{more than one or two}} guests at a time. Every now and then, the vessel would come to an anchor in the bay of the little coast town of Sandyseal, to accommodate friends going and coming and (in spite of medical advice) to receive letters. [...] "You may have heard of Sandyseal," [...] the Captain wrote, [...] "as one of the places which have lately been found out by the doctors. They are recommending the air to patients suffering from nervous disorders all over England. The one hotel in the place, and the few cottages which let lodgings, are crammed, as I hear, and the speculative builder is beginning his operations at such a rate that Sandyseal will be no longer recognizable in a few months more. Before the crescents and terraces and grand hotels turn the town into a fashionable watering-place, I want to take a last look at scenes familiar to me under their old aspect. If you are inclined to wonder at my feeling such a wish as this, I can easily explain myself. Two miles inland from Sandyseal, there is a lonely old moated house. In that house I was born. When you return from America, write to me at the post-office, or at the hotel (I am equally well known in both places), and let us arrange for a speedy meeting. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to come and see me in my birth-place.
