5|$|<b>Capacitive</b> discharge: {{this is a}} nonthermal plasma {{generated}} by the application of RF power (e.g., 13.56MHz) to one powered electrode, with a grounded electrode held at a small separation distance {{on the order of}} 1cm. Such discharges are commonly stabilized using a noble gas such as helium or argon.|$|E
5|$|Its {{impedance}} is 1.8ohms at 20kHz, to over 60ohms at 150Hz, and its load {{is highly}} <b>capacitive.</b> It does not consume {{large amounts of}} power {{so much as it}} feeds it back to the amplifier in opposition at some points during each cycle. This is very demanding on amplifiers' stability.|$|E

5|$|The HTC First is a {{mid-range}} smartphone {{which uses}} a dual-core, 1.4GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with support for LTE, a 2000 mAh battery, 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of non-expandable storage. The First uses a 4.3-inch 720p Super LCD display, and includes a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, and a 1.6-megapixel front-facing camera. The HTC First's exterior uses a rounded, minimal design with three <b>capacitive</b> buttons below its screen, and was available in black, light blue, red, and white color finishes.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{during its}} E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Xbox One S, {{a revision of}} the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor. Its new casing is 40% smaller than the original design, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The <b>capacitive</b> power and eject keys were replaced by physical buttons, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved {{to the front of}} the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally. Xbox One S requires a USB adapter to attach a Kinect sensor, as it no longer includes the proprietary port used on the original model. A free USB adapter was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox One S online, but this promotion ended in March 2017. Although Microsoft stated that it would eventually bundle the adapter with standalone Kinect units, it is instead sold separately.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, one {{important}} research avenue {{was trying to}} increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was {{to start with a}} lumped element prototype filter and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum Q of five (see Band-pass filters below for an explanation of Q). In 1957, Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on quarter wave impedance transformers and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave, corresponding to a Q of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The <b>capacitive</b> gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.|$|E
5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the <b>capacitive</b> gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

25|$|The HP TouchPad has a 9.7inch, 1024×768 pixel, Gorilla Glass {{multitouch}} <b>capacitive</b> touch screen. Interaction can be by finger or a <b>capacitive</b> stylus, {{available for}} separate purchase. The TouchPad's virtual keyboard can be configured {{to one of}} four preset sizes, and has a number row {{on top of the}} common QWERTY layout. The TouchPad also features an InvenSense 3-axis gyroscope.|$|E
25|$|Some {{combinations}} of <b>capacitive</b> and inductive load can {{interact with the}} coils and mass of a rotor and cause reduced or reverse motion.|$|E
25|$|The <b>capacitive</b> {{effects are}} limited by using raised source and drain {{geometries}} that make most of the contact area border thick dielectric instead of silicon.|$|E
25|$|As {{frequency}} approaches infinity, the <b>capacitive</b> impedance (or reactance) approaches {{zero and}} the ESR becomes significant. As the reactance becomes negligible, power dissipation approaches PRMS = VRMS² /RESR.|$|E
25|$|The Mighty Mouse is made {{of white}} plastic and has a {{recessed}} Apple logo on the mouse's face. The mouse has four functional controls: a left <b>capacitive</b> sensor, a right <b>capacitive</b> sensor, a track ball with a pressure sensor and side squeeze sensors. The track ball enables users to scroll a page or document in any direction, including diagonally. Instead of mechanical buttons, the touch-sensitive topshell (mentioned below) and the pressure sensing trackball allow the mouse to detect which side is being touched or whether the trackball is being held in.|$|E
25|$|At sin(ωt) = -1, the {{capacitor}} has {{a maximum}} (or peak) current whereby I0 = ωCV0. The ratio of peak voltage to peak current {{is due to}} <b>capacitive</b> reactance (denoted XC).|$|E
25|$|On January 23 Di Ventra, Pershin and Chua {{extended}} {{the notion of}} memristive systems to <b>capacitive</b> and inductive elements, namely capacitors and inductors whose properties depend on the state {{and history of the}} system.|$|E
25|$|A1152: Under {{increasing}} pressure {{to sell a}} generic two button mouse with a scroll wheel, Apple decided to develop a mouse (in 2005) with touchpad-like <b>capacitive</b> controls instead of buttons, and featured a tiny integrated trackball {{in place of a}} scrollwheel.|$|E
25|$|They find use as {{converters}} {{to change}} voltage, current or frequency, to store or deliver abruptly electric energy or {{to improve the}} power factor. The rated voltage range of these capacitors is from approximately 120nbsp&Vnbsp&AC (<b>capacitive</b> lighting ballasts) to 100nbsp&kV.|$|E
25|$|Optionally, a <b>capacitive</b> {{electrode}} (top load) (E) in {{the form}} of a smooth metal sphere or torus attached to the secondary terminal of the coil. Its large surface area suppresses premature air breakdown and arc discharges, increasing the Q factor and output voltage.|$|E
25|$|Electrical {{circuits}} containing dominantly resistive loads (incandescent lamps, heating elements) have a {{power factor}} of almost 1.0, but circuits containing inductive or <b>capacitive</b> loads (electric motors, solenoid valves, transformers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and others) {{can have a}} power factor well below 1.|$|E
25|$|Conventionally, {{capacitors}} {{are treated}} as if they generate reactive power and inductors as if they consume it. If a capacitor and an inductor are placed in parallel, then the currents flowing through the capacitor and the inductor tend to cancel rather than add. This is the fundamental mechanism for controlling the power factor in electric power transmission; capacitors (or inductors) are inserted in a circuit to partially compensate for reactive power 'consumed' by the load. Purely <b>capacitive</b> circuits supply reactive power with the current waveform leading the voltage waveform by 90degrees, while purely inductive circuits absorb reactive power with the current waveform lagging the voltage waveform by 90degrees. The result {{of this is that}} <b>capacitive</b> and inductive circuit elements tend to cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Di Ventra, Pershin and Chua {{extended}} {{the notion of}} memristive systems to <b>capacitive</b> and inductive elements {{in the form of}} memcapacitors and meminductors, whose properties depend on the state and history of the system, further extended in 2013 by Di Ventra and Pershin.|$|E
25|$|For film capacitors, the {{dissipation}} factor tanδ will be {{specified in the}} relevant data sheets, instead of the ESR. The {{dissipation factor}} {{is determined by the}} tangent of the phase angle between the <b>capacitive</b> reactance XC minus the inductive reactance XL and the ESR.|$|E
25|$|Some feedback, {{positive}} or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable—introduced, for example, by parasitic elements, such as inherent capacitance between {{input and output}} of devices such as transistors, and <b>capacitive</b> coupling of external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce parasitic oscillation and turn an amplifier into an oscillator.|$|E
25|$|Where V denotes voltage in phasor form, {{with the}} {{amplitude}} as rms, and I denotes current in phasor form, with the amplitude as rms. Also by convention, the complex conjugate of I is used. This is done such that a leading current (<b>capacitive</b> load, negative reactance), results in negative reactive power.|$|E
25|$|All Windows Phone devices include <b>capacitive</b> multi-touch screens, FM radios, Wi-Fi, {{and certain}} other {{features}} {{included on the}} Zune HD. The user interface of the Zune devices, particularly the Zune HD, served as {{the inspiration for the}} user interface of Windows Phone. Microsoft refers to the design language of this user interface as Metro.|$|E
25|$|A DC-blocking {{capacitor}} may {{be inserted}} {{in series with}} the input resistor when a frequency response down to DC is not needed and any DC voltage on the input is unwanted. That is, the <b>capacitive</b> component of the input impedance inserts a DC zero and a low-frequency pole that gives the circuit a bandpass or high-pass characteristic.|$|E
25|$|The first {{electronic}} ignition (a cold cathode type) was tested in 1948 by Delco-Remy, while Lucas introduced a transistorized ignition in 1955, {{which was used}} on BRM and Coventry Climax Formula One engines in 1962. The aftermarket began offering EI that year, with both the AutoLite Electric Transistor 201 and Tung-Sol EI-4 (thyratron <b>capacitive</b> discharge) being available. Pontiac became the first automaker to offer an optional EI, the breakerless magnetic pulse-triggered Delcotronic, on some 1963 models; it was also available on some Corvettes. The first commercially available all solid-state (SCR) <b>capacitive</b> discharge ignition was manufactured by Hyland Electronics in Canada also in 1963. Ford fitted a Lucas system on the Lotus 25s entered at Indianapolis the next year, ran a fleet test in 1964, and began offering optional EI on some models in 1965. Beginning in 1958, Earl W. Meyer at Chrysler worked on EI, continuing until 1961 and resulting in use of EI on the company's NASCAR hemis in 1963 and 1964.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 {{researchers}} {{announced an}} SMFC application that extracts energy and charges a battery. Salts dissociate into positively and negatively charged ions {{in water and}} move and adhere to the respective negative and positive electrodes, charging the battery and {{making it possible to}} remove the salt effecting microbial <b>capacitive</b> desalination. The microbes produce more energy than is required for the desalination process.|$|E
25|$|Slew rate is {{the maximum}} {{rate of change}} of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). Many {{amplifiers}} are ultimately slew rate limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome <b>capacitive</b> effects {{at some point in}} the circuit), which sometimes limits the full power bandwidth to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.|$|E
25|$|The <b>capacitive</b> shunt method, {{described}} in an application note by Analog Devices, senses {{the change in}} capacitance between a transmitter and receiver that are {{on opposite sides of}} the sensor. The transmitter creates an electric field which oscillates at 200–300kHz. If a ground point, such as the finger, is placed between the transmitter and receiver, some of the field lines are shunted away, decreasing the apparent capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Decoupling {{capacitors}} {{need not}} always be discrete components. Capacitors used in these applications may be built into a printed circuit board, between the various layers. These are {{often referred to as}} embedded capacitors. The layers in the board contributing to the <b>capacitive</b> properties also function as power and ground planes, and have a dielectric in between them, enabling them to operate as a parallel plate capacitor.|$|E
25|$|Dipoles {{that are}} {{much smaller than the}} {{wavelength}} of the signal are called short dipoles. These have a very low radiation resistance (and a high <b>capacitive</b> reactance) making them inefficient antennas. More of a transmitter's current is dissipated as heat due to the finite resistance of the conductors which is greater than the radiation resistance. However they can nevertheless be practical receiving antennas for longer wavelengths.|$|E
25|$|Probes with 10:1 {{attenuation}} {{are by far}} {{the most}} common; for large signals (and slightly-less <b>capacitive</b> loading), 100:1 probes are not rare. There are also probes that contain switches to select 10:1 or direct (1:1) ratios, but one must be aware that the 1:1 setting has significant capacitance (tens of pF) at the probe tip, because the whole cable's capacitance is now directly connected.|$|E
25|$|The self-resonant {{frequency}} is {{the lowest}} frequency at which impedance passes through a minimum. For any AC application the self-resonant frequency is the highest frequency at which a capacitor {{can be used as}} a <b>capacitive</b> component. At frequencies above the resonance, the impedance increases again due to ESL: the capacitor becomes an inductor with inductance equal to capacitor's ESL, and resistance equal to ESR at the given frequency.|$|E
25|$|The antenna is an {{integral}} part of the tuned circuit and its reactance contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have <b>capacitive</b> reactance. Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant parasitic capacitance in the coil) to form the tuned circuit with the coil.|$|E
25|$|The iPhone 7's {{overall design}} {{is similar to}} the iPhone 6S, but {{introduces}} new color options, water and dust resistance, a new <b>capacitive,</b> static home button, and removes the 3.5mm headphone jack. The device's internal hardware also received upgrades, including a heterogeneous quad-core system-on-chip with improved system and graphics performance, and upgraded 12megapixel rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models and an additional telephoto lens on the iPhone 7 Plus model to provide enhanced zoom capabilities.|$|E
