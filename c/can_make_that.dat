(...) His analysis reminds the reader that it is the drudgery of staff work that often wins and loses wars; it is a tribute to the author's abilities that he <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> fact not only clear but highly interesting.|$|E

It has [...] "catchy" [...] melody phrases during the verses and a synth trumpet {{at the end of}} the first chorus, as well as Armstrong's strings present in the background. It also contains sustained notes on the instrumental sections, a characteristic for the songs on Ray of Light. Doubled acoustic guitar chords give an organic vibe during the beginning of the second verse, following a brief coda. The song also infuses computer blips and techno effect sounds, which Orbit achieved by using a Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer. The producer explained that [...] "here's something about [...] transient peaks that are very spiky. And you <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> machine scream. Its two filters are very severe".|$|E
