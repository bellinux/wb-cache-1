Glaze {{is a type of}} glass coating that is applied to coat the ceramic object. This is an interesting layer to be studied because the success of glaze applications in ceramics is influenced by many factors. Glaze applications on ceramic objects have a very high level of difficulty. The difficulty is seen in glaze formulas, application techniques, firing temperature, shrinkage of dry matter and the successful achievement of color after glazing the combustion process. This research is to determine whether the clay character influence on the success rate of the color will appear. The research method uses the experimental method. This method is considered more appropriate to determine the level of success of an experiment relating to the material containing chemical elements. The research is done in the studio ceramics P 4 TK Art and Culture of Yogyakarta. The clay used is a type of stoneware clay which has five classes of characters. They are as follows: 1. Pacitan soil, wet soil that has a reddish color, 2. Singkawang soil, wet soil that has a whitish colour, 3. Sukabumi has a brightly colored ground and wet floor is beige, with 4. Sukabumi, the dark ground, wet soil that has a dark brown color, 5. Bojonegoro soil, wet soil that has a light brown color. The five characters color glazing that shall be applied on the surface of clay are: 1. young Greens, 2. Pink, and 3. Greenish blue, 4. Brown 5. Dark blue. The character of clay has relatively large contribution to the emergence of color glaze in accordance to the purpose or the plan, especially when using a formula based on the glossy glaze. Glaze formula will tend to be stable when there is a combination of stain with a glade oxide. Stable formula can also be found on the matched glaze because its glaze was close or not transparent. Coloring oxides are very sensitive to the character of soil. temperature change is cobalt and fee, experiment that required in advance when the formula contains two types of oxide glaze.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} increase in the delivery of all ceramic restorations especially with the global explosion of CAD CAM technology. Frequently, the ceramic restorations require refinements to the surfaces with abrasives prior to or after cementation. If adjustments are made to a glazed or non-glazed surface after cementation, only mechanical polishing is an option to restore the surface texture. Surface roughness of ceramic restorations influences the aesthetics, functional and biological parameters of the restoration [1, 2]. A relatively rough surface can negatively influence the strength [3, 4] and longevity of a restoration [5, 6], increase friction [7] and rate of wear of the restoration [8] and opposing tooth structure [9], promote gingival inflammation [10], adverse soft tissue reactions [11], and the accumulation of stains and plaque on the surface [12 - 14]. Recent low fusing ceramics have properties which improve the surface characteristics and allows a relatively smoother surface to be achieved either by glazing or polishing [15, 16].

30|$|The {{manufacture}} of bioceramic scaffolds with the FDM technique can be subdivided into two processes: the fused deposition of ceramics (FDC) and the lost mould technique (Leong et al. 2003; Smay and Lewis 2012). The former {{is a direct}} printing technique; the latter is an indirect method. The FDC technique was developed by Cornejo et al. (2000). It uses filament as a precursor to fabricate 3 D green ceramic parts. The filament is a composite of thermoplastic polymer, ceramic powder and binder. The thermoplastic polymer and binder are removed during post-processing, and the sintering of the <b>finished</b> <b>ceramic</b> parts is conducted to improve their mechanical properties. The FDC process can be utilised to create ceramic components for scaffolding and bone tissue engineering applications (Danforth et al. 1998; Onagoruwa et al. 2001; Iyer et al. 2008). The lost mould technique uses an FDM machine to produce polymer moulds with a negative structure of the intended network, and then the ceramic slurry is cast into the mould. Once the ceramic slurry solidifies, the finished object will be heated to remove the polymer mould, followed by a sintering process to consolidate the ceramic structure (Bose et al. 1999; Hattiangadi and Bandyopadhyay 2000; Kalita et al. 2003; Bernardo 2010).|$|R

40|$|Provenancing {{of ancient}} {{ceramics}} {{is a highly}} important scientific tool for archaeological studies. In general, ceramics are not made from the original clay as it is found in deposits. To produce the needed physical properties in the finished product, the clay has to be either tempered by adding sands or biological materials, or levigated, to remove the coarse fraction. Thus, the chemical composition of the <b>finished</b> <b>ceramic</b> differs from {{the composition of the}} original clay bed. To overcome this obfuscation, any information that can be gained about the temper is useful. In a small series, several pieces of ceramic were produced from known clay and tempers and the resulting ceramics analysed by neutron activation analysis (NAA). As many attempts to physically separate the temper from the clay matrix have failed, ?-spot analysis of temper inclusions was performed at the microbeam particle induced X-ray Emission (?-PIXE) facility in Rossendorf and with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) at the Aberystwyth University in Wales. It could be shown that from a small number of measurements, a general impression of the temper used could be gained. Furthermore the ?-spot methods and the bulk data gained from INAA are highly comparable, extending the set of elements that can be measured. With this information, the influence of the temper on the bulk composition of the finished product can be estimated, which potentially adds crucial information to subsequent dilution calculations.
