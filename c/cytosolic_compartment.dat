LA-N- 2 cells were labeled with [14 C-methyl]choline for 24 hr, harvested, and incubated in Hepes/BSA/saline buffer for varying periods of time. The radioactive compound {{present in the}} cytosol and released into Hepes/BSA/saline buffer medium in {{the presence or absence}} of TPA was phosphorylcholine. There was a gradual increase in the appearance of radioactivity in the medium and this corresponded to a gradual decline in the radioactivity present in the <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartment</b> with a statistically significant P value of less than. 005. Identical results were obtained with prelabeled cells subsequently incubated with TPA. There was no significant change in the amount of radioactivity associated with lipid suggesting that the phosphorylcholine may be released directly from the <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartment</b> into the medium rather than originating through a phospholipase-C catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. This possibility received support from experiments in which cells were electropermeabilized in the presence of radioactive phosphorylcholine. It was found that the introduced [14 C]phosphorylcholine was released intact into the incubation medium from the <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartment.</b> The incorporation of [14 C]choline, [14 C]ethanolamine, and [14 C]serine by LA-N- 2 cells into their corresponding phospholipids was investigated in {{the presence or absence of}} TPA.

There were no detectable differences between TPA exposed and control cells in the distribution of radioactivity in free choline, phosphorylcholine, or CDP-choline of [14 C] choline labeled cells. This indicates that the increased lipid labeling was not accompanied by enhanced labeling of the intermediates of the de novo pathway.

Here we investigated the possibility that free oligosaccharides originating in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are transported directly into the cystosol. Incubation of permeabilized cells {{in the absence of}} ATP at 37 degrees C led to the intravesicular accumulation of free Man 9 GlcNAc 2 which was generated from dolichol-linked oligosaccharide in the ER. This oligosaccharide remained stable within the permeabilized cells unless ATP was added to the incubations at which time the Man 9 GlcNac 2 was partially converted to Man 8 GlcNAc 2, and both these components were released from an intravesicular compartment into the <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartment</b> of permeabilized cells. In contrast, when permeabilized cells, primed with either free triglucosyl-oligosaccharide or a glycotripeptide, were incubated with ATP both these structures remained associated with the intravesicular compartment.

40|$|Many {{different}} receptors {{can stimulate}} cAMP synthesis in the heart, {{but not all}} elicit the same functional responses. For example, it has been recognized {{for some time that}} prostaglandins such as PGE 1 increase cAMP production and activate PKA, but they do not elicit responses like those produced by β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonists such as isoproterenol (isoprenaline), even though both stimulate the same signalling pathway. In the present study, we confirm that isoproterenol, but not PGE 1, is able to produce cAMP-dependent stimulation of the L-type Ca 2 + current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. This is despite finding evidence that these cells express EP 4 prostaglandin receptors, which are known to activate Gs-dependent signalling pathways. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors that are either freely diffusible or bound to A kinase anchoring proteins, we demonstrate that the difference is due to the ability of isoproterenol to stimulate cAMP production in cytosolic and caveolar compartments of intact cardiac myocytes, while PGE 1 only stimulates cAMP production in the <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartment.</b> Unlike other receptor-mediated responses, compartmentation of PGE 1 responses was not due to concurrent activation of a Gi-dependent signalling pathway or phosphodiesterase activity. Instead, compartmentation of the PGE 1 response in cardiac myocytes appears to be due to transient stimulation of cAMP in a microdomain that can communicate directly with the bulk <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartment</b> but not the caveolar compartment associated with βAR regulation of L-type Ca 2 + channel function...|$|E

Post-transcriptional accumulation of mitochondrial proteins observed with hsp 90 inhibitors is also seen in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. Detailed studies of the OSCP subunit of mitochondrial F 1 F 0 -ATPase revealed the presence of mono- and polyubiquitinated OSCP in mitochondrial fractions. We demonstrate that processed OSCP undergoes retrotranslocation to a trypsin-sensitive form associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane.

Plasmin is a potent serine protease that is thought to function in the degradation of the extracellular matrix surrounding the targeted host cell, thereby facilitating pathogen invasion.

40|$|Specific {{degradation}} of proteins {{is essential for}} virtually all cellular processes and is carried out predominantly by the proteasome. The proteasome is important for clearance of damaged cellular proteins. Damaged proteins accumulate over time and excess damaged proteins can aggregate and induce the death of old cells.

We followed two key parameters of this process: the distribution of proteasomes in nuclear and <b>cytosolic</b> <b>compartments,</b> {{and the formation of}} cytoplasmic aggregate-like structures called proteasome storage granules (PSGs). Whereas replicative young cells efficiently relocalized proteasomes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and formed PSGs, replicative old cells were less efficient in relocalizing the proteasome and had less PSGs. By using a microscopy-based genome-wide screen, we identified genetic factors involved in these processes. Both relocalization of the proteasome and PSG formation were affected by two of the three N-acetylation complexes.

Zn 2 + delivery by Zn-CQ transiently attenuated CA 1 long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices prepared 2 h after i. p. injection of Zn-CQ into rats, when intracellular Zn 2 + levels was transiently increased in the CA 1 pyramidal cell layer, followed by object recognition memory deficit. Object recognition memory was transiently impaired 30 min after injection of ZnCl 2 into the CA 1, but not after injection into the dentate gyrus that did not significantly increase intracellular Zn 2 + in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus.
