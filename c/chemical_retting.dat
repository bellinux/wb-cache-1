50|$|The fibers {{must then}} be {{loosened}} from the stalk. This is achieved through retting. This {{is a process}} which uses bacteria to decompose the pectin that binds the fibers together. Natural retting methods take place in tanks and pools, or directly in the fields.

50|$|Retting is {{the process}} of extracting fibers from the long lasting life stem or bast of the bast fiber plants. The {{available}} retting processes are: mechanical retting (hammering), <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> (boiling & applying chemicals), steam/vapor/dew retting, and water or microbial retting. Among them, the water or microbial retting is a century old but the most popular process in extracting fine bast fibers. However, selection of these retting processes depends on the availability of water and the cost of retting process.|$|E
40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed. More controllable retting procedures to produce quality fibers from flax are sought by applying chelators at high pH and enzyme chelating formulations at lower pH. Using the Fried Test as an in vitro method for evaluating fiber separation from shive, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) at 8 mM levels and sodium tripolyphosphate at 50 mM levels, both with 25 mM NaOH, effectively ret flax stems. Sodium gluconate, trisodium phosphate, and sulfuric acid are ineffective as retting agents. In 50 g laboratory scale retting trials, <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> at high pH with EDTA or sodium tripolyphosphate produces fine fiber yields (as produced through the Shirley Analyzer) {{that are about}} half that with enzyme chelator formulations; fibers are coarser with chemical versus enzyme retting. <b>Chemical</b> <b>retting</b> is influenced by chelator type and level, sodium hydroxide levels, and plant condition and maturity. These factors plus resultant fiber properties require consid-eration when optimizing <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> with chelators at high pH. Disadvantages of the current commercial method o...|$|E
40|$|Extracting flax fibers {{from the}} stems of Liriiirn usitatissitiizim plants has {{traditionally}} been a costly, labor-intensive process, largely restricted to Europe and Asia. The naturally long, strong fibers are typically processed on wet spinning machines that are not available in the United States. However, the resurgent popularity of flax has promoted an interest in devising more economical methods of producing and processing the fibers dornesti-cally. This preliminary study investigates the use of flax fibers extracted by mechanical, <b>chemical,</b> and enzymatic <b>retting</b> as well as traditional (dew) retting methods. The exper-imental fibers show promise for spinning on common cotton machinery in blends with cotton. The research has produced a series of medium-count, experimental apparel-grade yams with an attractive appearance and acceptable hand.

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of specimen size on the mechanical properties of bamboo. Single bamboo fibers and bamboo fiber bundles obtained from both <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> and mechanical retting were tested. The tensile strength of chemically retted single bamboo fiber was 47.6  % higher than that of the mechanically retted fibers. The tensile strength of the chemically retted fiber bundles was over 2.1 times higher than that of the mechanically retted one, while the tensile modulus was almost 1.4 times higher. For the <b>chemical</b> <b>retting,</b> the fiber bundles were 65.7  % less in tensile strength compared to the single fiber, 12.3  % less for the tensile modulus, and 9.7  % less for the elongation. For the mechanical retting, the tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation of fiber bundles were 68.8, 52.3 and 60.9  % lower than that of the single fibers, respectively. Compared with single bamboo fibers and bamboo fiber bundles, the tensile strength of bamboo strips was reduced by 67.7 and 3.3  %, respectively. The modulus of bamboo fiber bundles was 42.7  % less compared to the single bamboo fibers, and 16.9  % higher compared to the bamboo fiber bundles. The mechanical properties of bamboo strips were lower than that of samples made from outer portion of the bamboo, but higher than that of samples made from inner portion of the bamboo.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of fibre quality in bast fibres {{is related to}} the amount of gum (lignin, hemicellulose, wax and pectin) left in the fibre after the retting process. Large amounts of gums present represent poor separation of fibre. Efficiency of retting can be monitored by measuring the residual gum content of the retted fibre. This paper investigated the use of ultrasonic vibration combined with <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> as a pre-treatment to improve accuracy of traditional residual gum content test. Work was conducted on chemically retted hemp fibre. Pre-treatment conditions were analysed by determining the best chemical combination, chemical concentration and treatment time.

The work proposed a new method for determining the residual gum content of hemp fibre. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the properties of the chemically retted kenaf bast fiber impregnated with the inorganic nanoparticles. High quality kenaf bast fibers were obtained from a <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> process. An in situ inorganic nanoparticle impregnation (INI) process was used to introduce the CaCO 3 nanoparticles into the retted kenaf bast fibers. It was found that some of the lignin-based components in the retted fibers were further removed during the INI treatment. From the characterization results, the inorganic nanoparticles CaCO 3, with different shapes and sizes, appeared at the surface of the impregnated fiber after treatment. Heterogeneous CaCO 3 nanoparticle distribution was observed on the INI treated fibers. The CaCO 3 contents were different at different locations along the impregnated fiber. The presence of CaCO 3 inorganic nanoparticles at the fiber surface increased the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness by 5. 8 % and decreased the hydrophilic nature of the retted fibers, evidenced by a 59. 4 % decrease in adhesion force between the fiber and hydrophilic AFM tip. In addition, the impregnation of CaCO 3 dramatically increased the Young’s modulus of the fiber by 344 %...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{introduce}} new natural fiber {{to be used}} in the production of geotextile net for mitigation of soil erosion. Fiber extraction from the stalks was the main challenge faced during the processing of stalks to ropes. Thus, an investigation on the extraction procedures of corn (Zea mays L.) stalk under biological and <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> was undertaken. Results indicated significant differences among percent fiber yield as affected by the retting methods used with values of 15. 07 %, 12. 97 %, 11. 60 %, and 9. 01 %, for dew, water, chemical (1 day after harvest and 15 days after harvest), respectively, with the corresponding average extracting duration of 70, 82, 89, and 94 minutes. Physical characterization of the developed corn stalk geotextile net resulted to average mass per unit area of 806. 25 g/m 2 and 241 % water absorbing capacity. The effect of corn stalk geotextile net in mitigating soil erosion was evaluated in a laboratory experiment for 30 o and 60 o inclinations with three treatments: bare soil (A 1), corn stalk geotextile net (A 2) and combined cornstalk geotextile net and vegetation cover (A 3). Results revealed that treatment A 2 and A 3 significantly decreased sediment yield and an increase in terms of soil loss reduction efficiency.

40|$|Grading of {{flax fibre}} in Canada, {{and in all}} other flax-producing countries, is done by {{professional}} graders who judge the flax by appearance (cleanness, glossiness, length of fibre, colour), by handle or feel (weight, softness), and by strength (breaking a few strands of fibre in the hands). Because this method is based on human judgment, two graders may award different grades to samples of the same fibre. It was felt that if some scientific method for ascertaining grades could be obtained, {{it would be a}} valuable contribution. Hence, a series of chemical determinations was made on flax fibre of various grades produced by water and dew retting in an attempt to assess the quality of flax fibre by chemical analysis. Concurrently, use was made of the Pressley Cotton Fibre Strength Tester {{to determine whether or not}} this machine could be adapted to flax fibre and yarn to differentiate between grades by means of physical tests. An investigation was made also of various types of <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> procedures. Because of the speed with which flax straw can be retted by chemical solutions, an attempt was made to determine if fibre of quality equal to that obtained by water and dew retting could be produced thereby.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effect of}} eight {{different}} retting methods on decorticated hemp skins were analyzed. The methods were taken from six publications that looked at the retting of different bast fibres such as ramie, flax and kenaf. The fibres were batch retted in a package dye-vat at 100 oC under 2 bar of pressure. The rinsed fibres were opened twice using a Shirley cotton trash separator. The opened fibre was assessed for fibre width, fibre width variation, colour and handle. It {{was found that the}} fibre that had undergone <b>chemical</b> <b>retting</b> with 7 % Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and 0. 5 % Sodium Sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) had the best diameter (18. 39 micron) and the best coefficient of variation of diameter (57. 32 %). The fibre that was processed with 7 % Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and 0. 5 % Sodium Sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) had the whitest colour (YI D 1925 = 31. 61). The method treated with 1 % Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and 1 % Sodium Sulphite (Na 2 SO 3) had the softest handle and the method treated with 1 % Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) and pre-rinsed with 0. 3 % Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) showed the best conversion of decorticated skins into spin able fibre (33. 9 % of dry green skins).

40|$|Due {{to light}} weight, renewability, {{sustainability}} and generally moderate costs, natural fibers are addressed {{for the production}} of composites for application in packaging, automotive and other indus- tries. Several approaches are under investigation to improve compatibility with polymer matrices and improve mechanical performances of composites with natural fibers. The retting process is the major limitation to efficient and high-quality natural fiber production. The conventional retting is normally done chemically by treatment of decorticated fibers with hot alkaline solutions. Such a process requires high energy input and produces hazardous wastes. Microbiological and enzymatic methods represent a reliable replacement, however their application on ramie (Boehmeria nivea (L.) Gaud.) has not yet been optimized and tuned for use on a large scale. Consequently, the aim of this work was to evaluate the role of microbiological retting on the morphological, chemical and physical–mechanical properties of the derived ramie fibers for application in biocomposites. The decorticated ramie fibers, obtained by mature crop stands grown at the experimental station of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Environment (DAFE) of the University of Pisa, were subjected to a water based microbiological degumming performed with the use of two selected strains of Clostridium felsineum L. at 30 ◦C for 7 days. The results obtained with this method were compared with those recorded adopting the conventional chemical process with NaOH water solution at 100 ◦ C for 2 h. The morphological, chemical (hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and ash) and physico-mechanical (tensile strength, elastic modulus and elongation at break) properties of retted ramie fibers were investigated. The fibers produced were evaluated {{for the production of}} compos- ites by using polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) as polymeric matrix, as targeted in the EC running project OLI-PHA. Significant differences were observed between the two types of degumming in terms of yield and quality of the fibers. Even if the highest fiber yields were recorded with <b>chemical</b> <b>retting,</b> the perfor- mances of fibers modified by microbiological treatments were comparable with those of the composite prepared with fibers modified by chemical treatment. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed a good removal of non-cellulosic gummy material from the surface of ramie fibers. According to the mechanical properties, the ramie fibers obtained by both degumming processes, were suitable for use in PHAs composites...|$|E
