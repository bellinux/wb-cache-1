40|$|Imagine a state {{proclaiming that}} it will claim {{jurisdiction}} over, and apply its laws to, any website that can be accessed from a computer located in its territory. The response would perhaps be outrage from some. Others would point to the ineffective nature of such a rule, and yet others would perhaps view the model as infeasible. Indeed, when the Advocate-General’s office of Minnesota in the mid 90 ’s issued a statement that: ‘[p]ersons outside of Minnesota who transmit information via the Internet knowing that information will be disseminated in Minnesota are subject to jurisdiction in Minnesota courts for violations of state criminal and civil laws’, it was met with strong criticism. Against this background, persons unfamiliar with private international law (or as the discipline is referred to in common law systems, conflict of laws) might {{be surprised to find}} that many, not to say most, states’ private international law rules do in fact provide for jurisdictional claims over any website that can be accessed in its territory, in relation {{to a wide range of}} legal matters. Similarly, many, not to say most, states’ private international law rules do provide for the court to apply the law of the state where the court is located in many situations where jurisdiction is being exercised over a foreign website.

In doing so, the four interconnected elements of private international law; jurisdiction, choice of law, the courts’ option of declining jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement are examined.

40|$|Statistics {{available}} from the European Commission indicate that the implementation of EC directives on the environment is a problem. There is a gap between adoption and {{transposition into national law}} as well as partial failure in implementation and enforcement. There is a concurrent identified gap in the literature on comparative implementation research addressed in this thesis, the main objective of which is to analyse the origins of the environmental implementation problem and to develop and test a model of EC environmental implementation which can be used to explain and understand the origins of the current situation. The literature suggests that implementation may be considered as the fulfilling of a dual task. First, the introduction into national law of measures adopted by the EC and second, the installation of a framework at Member State level, which sees to it that the adopted measures are applied and enforced. A model of the EC policy-making and implementation process, based on Easton's systems approach and borrowing from Sabatier and Mazmanian's work on implementation, is employed to structure the analysis. Hypotheses based on four identified composite model variables are tested against evidence from four case studies; the Drinking Water Directive and the Birds Directive in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Of the four investigated model variables, the 'degree of institutional change' shows the best correlation to the degree of implementation success. In the Netherlands a serious obstacle to implementation has been the constitutional system of that Member State. Under the threat of various legal measures against it by the Commission, the Netherlands has amended its constitutional provisions for law-making in order to speed up the process of implementing EC legislation. A similar important change has taken place in the United Kingdom, which was forced to alter its regulatory system on the supply and control of drinking water. The most significant impact of Community effort in environmental matters has been to encourage the convergence and strengthening of national regulation; non-implementation has been a stimulus for the strengthening of Community structures and generated ideas for possible future <b>Community</b> <b>instruments.</b> The model developed and tested has not only proven useful in helping structure the analysis but it has also been of some contributory value in explanation. It has enabled comparison of implementation across environmental policy sectors and across Member States, thus offering potential for further studies in this area...|$|E

40|$|The rulings in the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) cases {{annotated}} {{here are}} part of lengthy litigation brought by the PMOI before national and European courts in order to challenge national and European authorities’ decisions to include the organization in the EU terrorist list and to freeze its assets at Community level. All courts which have heard the matter have declared the listing of the PMOI unlawful either because of serious procedural failures, or {{because of lack of}} evidence as to its current connection with terrorist activities. In relation to the EU list, the CFI had already declared in December 2006 that in including the applicants the Council had failed to respect their basic procedural rights. Following the first decision, and in order to comply with the CFI ruling, the Council sought to remedy these procedural failures, while maintaining the group on the list. As a result, the PMOI had to bring new proceedings to challenge new decisions that confirmed its inclusion in the list, and the cases annotated here concern these more recent challenges. In both rulings, the CFI annulled the Council decision as far as the applicant was concerned, albeit on different grounds. In the first case, the applicant had been included {{at the request of the}} British Government, while in the second case the applicant had been included at the request of the French Government. The PMOI saga unveils in considerable detail the deep flaws in the EU terrorist listing system. While the CFI’s approach had been very cautious in the first two cases, showing a substantial deference to Council’s decisions as to who should be defined as a terrorist, in the third, and – it is to be hoped – final, case the Court’s ruling seems to show impatience with the Council’s cavalier attitude to judicial protection and the rule of law. For the first time, the CFI indicates its willingness to carry out not only a review of compliance with the procedural rights of those listed, but also of compliance with the legal conditions required by the <b>Community</b> <b>instruments,</b> and to a certain extent of the substantive reasons that led to inclusion. These two cases are of paramount constitutional importance in relation to both the EU system of proscription and the constraints imposed on the Council in defining an individual or an organization as involved in terrorist activity.

40|$|This Thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interpretation}} of the ’directed activities’ connecting factor in the context of cross-border electronic commerce in tangible goods. The connecting factor is used as a condition for applying the private interna-tional law consumer protection rules of Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 (the Brussels Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 593 / 2008 (the Rome I Regulation). The two-part connecting factor gives that a consumer contract is eligible for protection only if two cumulative conditions are met. Firstly, the business must have directed its activities to consumer’s jurisdiction or several jurisdictions including that. Secondly, the contract must falls within the scope of such activities. Before addressing the main purpose, it is reviewed what kind of consumer protection these Regulations offer. In addition, the significance of these rules is observed {{in the light of the}} recent developments in fields of procedural and substantial EU consumer law. The perspective of this study is European. The connecting factor is a product of the Europeanized private international law and it is specifically designed to provide protection for consumer engaging in e-commerce. In order to facilitate consumer trust in e-commerce, the circumstances in which consumers can resort to the protective rules should be clearly defined. However, the practical application of the connecting factor has been ambiguous. The main purpose of this study is to identify those legal facts which are relevant when determining if the requirements set down in the connecting factor are satisfied. In addition, the aim is to clarify how much evidential value these facts can bear in practical situations. The analysis is illustrated with examples of situations in which a consumer can, could or cannot enjoy the protection. The methodological focus is on analyzing the relevant case law of the ECJ. The interpretation established in the case law is complemented by analyzing the preparatory works for the relevant <b>community</b> <b>instruments</b> and Advocate Generals’ Opinions. In addition, visions created in academic debate are reviewed in order to see if they are in line with the autonomous interpretation. This study is mainly concerned with consumers’ interests and claims that consumers should be able to foresee their legal position before concluding a contract. In addition, the study acknowledges that consumers’ interests must be balanced against professionals’ interests. The main finding of this study is that, despite the recent case law and academic debate, the practical application of the connecting factor relies on case-by-case evaluation. Thus it is challenging to create clear guidelines for its application. Firstly, when considering if a website accessible in consumer’s jurisdiction constitutes an activity directed to that country, the evaluation should take into account website features and the professional’s overall activity. Consumers can enjoy the protection only if it is apparent that the professional was minded to conclude contracts with customers from consumer’s jurisdiction. Secondly, when determining whether the contract falls within the scope of the directed activities, the evaluation is based on the circumstances which led to the conclusion of the contract and in which the contract is concluded. It is discovered that, if the contract is concluded through the website, it generally falls within the scope of protection. However, if the contract is concluded by other means, there must be evidence indicating that there is a link between the directed activity and the contract. The general finding is that this fact-specific case-by-case evaluation will continue to cause uncertainty for consumers and professionals engaging in cross-border e-commerce...|$|E
40|$|The European {{electricity}} {{sector is}} undergoing radical changes in every {{segment of the}} power industry, from generation to supply. Ambitious policy goals set at European level to enhance the competitiveness, security and sustainability of the EU's energy system have called for {{major changes in the}} regulatory, technological, and market structure fields. The distribution sector is particularly affected by these changes. The increasing penetration of local renewable generation and the emergence of demand response enabling solutions are placing new requirements on the distribution networks, posing challenges to the reliability and efficiency of system operation. At the same time however, these new applications can also create opportunities to manage the distribution grids in a more flexible and efficient way. Smart grid concepts and technologies have an important role to play to address these new challenges and opportunities. A variety of solutions are already being tested in Europe, with encouraging results. Identifying the best technical, economic and social options requires a deep understanding of their impact on the physical distribution networks. Such knowledge is also necessary to evaluate the viability of replicating and scaling up pilot experiences already successfully implemented in Europe. At present, there is little publicly available information on the European distribution system operators (DSOs) and the networks they operate. Such lack of knowledge is partly attributable to the DSOs' reluctance to share data that can be considered as assets of commercial value, but it is also due to the vast number and heterogeneity of the distribution systems in Europe. The situation varies radically from country to country, due to historical as well as geographical, legal, political and economic reasons. In some Member States there is only one DSO, while in others there are tens or hundreds of them operating their networks on a regional or even municipal basis. Differences concern also other aspects, e. g. the scope of the DSO activities, the level of unbundling, the operated voltage levels and other key technical information on the networks. In the last years, the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) has expanded its role as an independent observer of the energy system developments and transitions. Particularly, a big effort has been put in collecting, processing and analysing data on the power sector (from smart grid project costs and benefits to consumer engagement strategies, from power system techno-economic features to integrated regional systems/markets). This activity is aimed at providing stakeholders with tools and analyses to better understand the rapidly changing scene, enabling early identification of developments and opportunities and supporting evidence-based policy making. This report presents the latest JRC data brokering effort – the DSO Observatory project - focused on European distribution system operators and their distribution networks. The aim of the report is to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the challenges that the transition to a new energy system is posing to European distribution system operators and to elaborate sound solutions to address them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive data collection exercise on European distribution systems published so far. Based upon this inventory, detailed reference network models (RNM) are developed to analyse the impact of distributed energy resources (DER) penetration and network automation on the technical performance of the distribution networks and to make available to the wider scientific <b>community</b> <b>instruments</b> to perform realistic simulations and analyses. The starting point of the DSO Observatory project was the collection of technical and structural data from the DSOs. Given the vast number of DSOs in Europe, the data collection exercise was limited to the bigger ones, i. e. the 190 DSOs that have to comply with the unbundling requirements set out in the EU Electricity Directive (i. e. the DSOs serving more than 100, 000 customers, also referred to in the report as "larger DSO"). An online survey was launched in January 2015 with the aim of collecting several clusters of data, relating to types of ownership and unbundling, network structures and designs, amounts and types of connected distributed generation, and reliability of supply indicators. 79 out of the 190 larger DSOs responded to the survey. The representativeness of the obtained sample is quite high: the respondents manage over 70 % of the electricity supplied by all DSOs serving over 100, 000 customers. Together, the 79 DSOs distribute more than 2, 000 TWh of electricity to over 200 million customers per year, covering a total area of more than 3 million square km. The collected data were used to build 36 indicators, divided in three categories, i. e. network structure, network design and distributed generation. These indicators allow for comparison of the parameters and criteria used by DSOs when designing and sizing their network installations. They help to shed some light on the different characteristics of some of the major European distribution networks and to support research activities by reducing the amount of resources that are typically devoted to compiling input data and building case studies. The project however also aimed at providing a tool to enable more sophisticated technical and economic assessment of different policy and technological solutions. For this purpose, 10 of the 36 indicators were chosen to create reference network models, i. e. large-scale network distribution planning tools that allow designing realistic distribution networks useful for simulation activities. RNMs allow the design of networks that supply the expected demand while taking into consideration the need to minimize the total investment and associated operational costs and to meet the defined reliability and quality of supply criteria. By providing a realistic distribution network, RNMs offer the possibility to reliably simulate the impact of different scenarios on the grid without the need to have access to the actual network data. Two large-scale representative networks, one rural and one urban, were selected to carry out the simulation analyses. The networks were used to analyse the impact of increasing levels of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration, solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind in particular, on the technical performance of the grid. The impact on network voltages and network overloads was then monetised by means of a penalty cost function. The analyses show that the number and size of PV units, as well as their concentration/distribution on the network are all relevant parameters. By way of illustration, results highlight that limiting the size of the generation units would allow mitigating voltage and congestion problems, maximizing renewable penetration with no need of additional network investments. A careful consideration of the local conditions of each distribution area as well as of the different connection patterns - including unit sizes, technologies and location within the network - is therefore of paramount importance to minimize adverse impacts on the network. Another way to mitigate the voltage spread introduced by the increasing penetration of PV connected to the distribution network has been studied considering the installation of storage units where the PV are located. However from the carried analysis a spread voltage reduction is only observed when big storage units are installed for each PV unit. The high costs per kWh estimated for batteries in the storage market suggest however that other solutions should be considered to mitigate voltage spread in the distribution network. Finally a reliability analysis is reported, showing how the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) could be reduced by increasing the installation of tele-controlled switches in the distribution network. The analyses presented in the report provide an illustrative example of the potential applications of the representative networks built within the DSOs Observatory project. Other applications are however possible and this report can be seen as a first step of an exercise that will continue in the future. The JRC will carry on in its scientific and policy support activities to better understand and address the challenges DSOs have to face in the transition to the new energy system. JRC.
