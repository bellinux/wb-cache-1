5|$|Lactifluus volemus {{is closely}} related to L.corrugis, and {{generally}} similar in appearance. L.corrugis usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: L.corrugis has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8µm—with a <b>coarser</b> surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species Lactifluus austrovolemus {{is closely related}}, but has more crowded gills, while L.lamprocystidiatus can only be reliably distinguished from L.volemus by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both L.austrovolemus and L.lamprocystidiatus are known only from Papua New Guinea. Lactifluus hygrophoroides also resembles L.volemus, but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coarse</b> {{structures}} are an abstract construction describing {{the behavior of}} a space at a large distance. In this thesis, a variety of existing results on <b>coarse</b> {{structures are}} presented, with the main focus being <b>coarse</b> embeddability into Hilbert spaces. The end goal is to present a hierarchy of three <b>coarse</b> invariants, namely <b>coarse</b> embeddability into a Hilbert space, a property of metric spaces known as Property A, and a finite-valued asymptotic dimension. After outlining the necessary prerequisites and notation, the first main part of the thesis is an introduction to the basics of <b>coarse</b> geometry. <b>Coarse</b> structures are defined, and it is shown how a metric induces a <b>coarse</b> structure. <b>Coarse</b> maps, equivalences and embeddings are defined, and some of their basic properties are presented. Alongside this, comparisons are made to both topology and uniform topology, and results related to metrizability of <b>coarse</b> spaces are outlined. Once the basics of <b>coarse</b> structures have been presented, the focus shifts to <b>coarse</b> embeddability into Hilbert spaces, which has become a point of interest due to its applications to several unsolved conjectures. Two concepts are presented related to <b>coarse</b> embeddability into Hilbert spaces, the first one being Property A. It is shown that Property A implies <b>coarse</b> embeddability into a Hilbert space, and that it is a <b>coarse</b> invariant. The second main concept related to <b>coarse</b> embeddability is asymptotic dimension. Asymptotic dimension is a <b>coarse</b> counterpart to the Lebesgue dimension of topological spaces. Various definitions of asymptotic dimension are given and shown equivalent. The <b>coarse</b> invariance of asymptotic dimension is shown, and the dimensions of several example spaces are derived. Finally, it is shown that a finite asymptotic dimension implies <b>coarse</b> embeddability into a Hilbert space, {{and in the case of}} spaces with bounded geometry it also implies Property A...|$|R

5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of fine particles and an outer layer of <b>coarser</b> particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E

Since <b>coarser</b> and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in ash fall deposits at distal locations.

The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes. As one descended the social ladder, bread became <b>coarser,</b> darker, and its bran content increased. In times of grain shortages or outright famine, grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts, dried legumes, acorns, ferns, and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter.|$|E

There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint.

5|$|Slow {{transportation}} and food preservation techniques (based on drying, salting, smoking and pickling) made long-distance trade of many foods very expensive. Because of this, the nobility food was {{more prone to}} foreign influence than the cuisine of the poor; it was dependent on exotic spices and expensive imports. As each level of society imitated the one above it, innovations from international trade and foreign wars from the 12th century onwards gradually disseminated through the upper middle class of medieval cities. Aside from economic unavailability of luxuries such as spices, decrees outlawed consumption of certain foods among certain social classes and sumptuary laws limited conspicuous consumption among the nouveaux riches. Social norms also dictated that the food {{of the working class}} be less refined, since it was believed there was a natural resemblance between one's labour and one's food; manual labour required <b>coarser,</b> cheaper food.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} dromaeosaurid with {{definitive}} evidence of feathers was Sinornithosaurus, reported from China by Xu et al. in 1999. Many other dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been found}} with feathers covering their bodies, some with fully developed feathered wings. Microraptor even shows evidence of a second pair of wings on the hind legs. While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine-grained sediments, some fossils found in <b>coarser</b> rocks show evidence of feathers {{by the presence of}} quill knobs, the attachment points for wing feathers possessed by some birds. The dromaeosaurids Rahonavis and Velociraptor have both been found with quill knobs, showing that these forms had feathers despite no impressions having been found. In light of this, it is most likely that even the larger ground-dwelling dromaeosaurids bore feathers, since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage, and relatively large dromaeosaurids, like Velociraptor, are known to have retained pennaceous feathers. Though some scientists had suggested that the larger dromaeosaurids lost some or all of their insulatory covering, the discovery of feathers in Velociraptor specimens has been cited as evidence that all members of the family retained feathers.|$|E

T Coronae Borealis {{is one of a handful}} of stars called recurrent novae, which include T Pyxidis and U Scorpii. An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866; its second recorded outburst was in February 1946. T Coronae Borealis is a binary star with a red-hued giant primary and a white dwarf secondary, the two stars orbiting each other over a period of approximately 8 months. R Coronae Borealis is a yellow-hued variable supergiant star, over 7000 light-years from Earth, and prototype of a class of stars known as R Coronae Borealis variables. Normally of magnitude 6, its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months. These declines in magnitude come about as dust that has been ejected from the star obscures it. Direct imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000AU from the star, corresponding with a stream of fine dust (composed of grains 5nm in diameter) associated with the star's stellar wind and <b>coarser</b> dust (composed of grains with a diameter of around 0.14µm) ejected periodically.|$|E
