Bersten describes the device as [...] "almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee" [...] and Moriondo as [...] "certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso [...] machine, if not the earliest." [...] Unlike true espresso machines, it was a bulk brewer, and did not brew coffee for the individual customer. Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from Milan, came up with a number of improvements to the espresso machine. He patented a number of these, the first of which was applied for on the 19th of December 1901. It was titled [...] "Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage" [...] (Patent No. 153/94, 61707, granted on the 5 June 1902).

40|$|Abstract: Recently, both {{small and}} large {{commercial}} <b>coffee</b> <b>brewers</b> have begun offering cold-brew coffee drinks to customers with the claims that these cold-water extracts contain fewer bitter acids due to brewing conditions (Toddy website, 2016) while still retaining the flavor profile. Dunkin Donuts’ website suggests that the cold-water and long brewing times allow the coffee to reach “ [...] . its purest form. ” With very little research existent on the chemistry of cold brew coffee consumers are left to the marketing strategies of Starbucks and other companies regarding the contents of cold-brew coffee. This research analyzes the caffeine and chlorogenic acid (3 -CGA) content of cold-brew coffee {{as a function of}} brewing time, grind size, and roasting temperature of coffee beans sourced from the Kona region of Hawaii using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Coarse and medium grinds of both dark and medium roasts were analyzed by mixing 350 mL of filtered water with 35 g of coffee grinds under constant stirring at 20 °C. Sampling was performed every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes for the next ten to twelve hours, with a final sample being drawn at 24 hours. Equilibrium concentrations for both 3 -CGA and caffeine were reached following 600 minutes. The caffeine concentrations ranged from 935 mg/L to 1475 mg/L. Variation was seen as a function of roasting temperature, and less so grind size. The 3 -CGA concentrations were found to range from 345 mg/L to 547 mg/L. In both cases, the medium roast coarse grind coffee produced the highest concentrations of caffeine and 3 -CGA while dark roast coarse grind produced the lowest concentrations of caffeine and 3 -CGA. Hot brew experiments agreed well with caffeine and 3 -CGA extraction concentrations in both dark roast coffees, showing very similar final concentrations. The medium roast coffees showed deviation from the hot brew coffees with respect to caffeine, indicating the need for additional experimentation to determine the role of water temperature in the availability of caffeine during extraction...|$|R

Since then, the show's focus has shifted to individual characters instead of family groupings. Notable characters introduced subsequently include Carol Meehan, Tracey Kavanagh, Ray O'Connell, and Jo Fahey. Another change {{in recent years has}} been the introduction of ethnic minority characters such as Lana Dowling and the Udenze family. However, the Udenzes moved back to England after the father Gabriel was burnt to death in a fire, and Lana Dowling was kidnapped and murdered. In 2009 an Israeli character was introduced to the show – Avi Bar Lev, Avi hails from the town of Haifa in Israel. In 2013, Ama Chisenga, a devout Christian nurse from Zambia came to Carrigstown, and faced trouble with documentation for immigration.

50|$|Bunn-O-Matic {{also came}} out with a {{different}} drip-brew machine. In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water. When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200207 °F or 9397 °C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element. When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a funnel and tube which delivers the cold water {{to the bottom of the}} boiler. The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the spray head, where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, water displacement method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs. Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler. Additionally, the water displacement method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic <b>coffee</b> <b>brewer,</b> which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.|$|E
40|$|Using Intelligent Control Methodology Home coffee {{machines}} {{have improved}} over {{time with the}} addition of features such as self-activating timers and crude temperature controlled heating elements. However, home <b>coffee</b> <b>brewer</b> development has stagnated and has yet to achieve full automation status. Present coffee machines leave the user burdened with the mundane and messy task of preparing the coffee maker every time. Also, should the user decide to prepare less than an entire pot, he/she must estimate the correct amount of water and coffee to add. This can lead to a weak or strong brew, giving undesirable results. In order to make another pot, the user is then forced to clean the used coffee grounds and remove any unused coffee. The objective of this thesis is to design and construct a functional, fully automated coffee maker. The coffee maker, with its need for user input, varying grounds and water volume necessity, and sequential method of operation, is a prime candidate for fuzzy control implementation. The main focus of this project is a controller, which is implemented on a standard 486 computer running Linux Red Hat 7. The system is included in this project, but only as a means to test the functionality and efficiency of the controller. User input includes the amount of coffee desired, the strength of that coffee, and the ratio of regular to decaffeinated. These input variables can be effectively and easily defined by fuzzy membership functions. Also, when the coffee maker is not making coffee, the processor monitors water temperature for the next time it is needed and performs any necessary cleaning. Results demonstrate that the water and coffee temperatures can be kept within a tolerance of three degrees Fahrenheit. The open-loop coffee-dispensing controller is validated by expert evaluation since taste is the deciding factor. The efficiency of the water controller is determined by the accuracy of the volume of water obtained. Overshoot and steady-state-error are kept within strict tolerances for this specific application...|$|E

30|$|Lignocellulosic wastes are {{produced}} in large amounts by different industries including forestry, pulp and paper, agriculture and food, {{in addition to}} different wastes from municipal solid waste (MSW), and animal wastes (Sims 2003, Kim and Dale 2004, Kalogo et al. 2007, Champagne 2007, Wen et al. 2004). Those derived from agricultural activities include materials such as straw, stem, stalk, leaves, husk, shell, peel, lint, seed/stones, pulp or stubble from fruits, legumes or cereals (rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, barley), bagasses generated from sugarcane or sweet sorghum milling, spent <b>coffee</b> grounds, <b>brewer’s</b> spent grains, and many others. These potentially valuable materials were treated as waste in many countries in the past, and still are today in some developing countries, which raises many environmental concerns (Palacios-Orueta et al. 2005). Significant efforts, {{many of which have}} been successful, have been made to convert these lignocellulosic residues to valuable products such as biofuels, chemicals and animal feed (Howard et al. 2003). Banana peel, an agro waste {{can be used as a}} substrate for ethanol production owing to its rich carbohydrate, crude proteins and reducing sugars. Moreover, banana peels are affordable and renewable low cost raw material which makes it potential feedstock for ethanol production (Bhatia and Paliwal 2010). Similarly pineapple is the second harvest of importance after bananas, contributing to over 20 % of the world production of tropical fruits (Coveca 2002). Thailand, Philippines, Brazil and China are the main pineapple producers in the world supplying nearly 50 % of the total output. Other important producers include India, Nigeria, Kenya, Indonesia, México and Costa Rica and these countries provide most of the remaining fruit available (50 %). Isitua and Ibeh 2010 assayed the feasibility of obtaining ethanol from pineapple waste with the purpose of obtaining a valuable product from the residues of the juice and canning industries.|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of this thesis (Chapters 1 - 9) presents the broader picture of waste management and thermal treatments (situation, trends and novel concepts) {{with a strong}} focus on nitrogen (N) in Chapter 6 (a summary of this chapter {{can be found on}} page 42). A new insight on N-functionalities is presented, mostly based on plant physiology publications widely ignored by the bioenergy world. N in biomass is found in a variety of chemical compounds and not only in protein compounds. An extensive literature survey concerning N-chemistry during pyrolysis of model compounds and biomass has also been done. A critical light is cast on these studies. Paper I (or P-I) ([Becidan 2004]) presents preliminary results using the experimental set-up and shows its potential in thermal studies. The study of N-release was twofold: NOx release during combustion of biomass and NOx precursors (NH 3 and HCN) release during pyrolysis of sewage sludge. The main results confirm known trends: N-release during combustion decreases with increasing fuel-N content; N-release as NH 3 and HCN during pyrolysis is clearly dependent on temperature with increasing release with increasing temperature and NH 3 as the main component at all conditions. Paper II (or P-II) ([Skreiberg 2004]) presents modelling work realised to assess the potential for reduction of NOx emission formed from fuel-N by implementing staged air combustion. The results obtained from these chemical analysis of ideal reactors (Plug Flow Reactor and Perfectly Stirred Reactor) {{can be seen as a}} simplified CFD approach. The reduction potential is depending on a variety of factors and will therefore have to be assessed on a case-to-case basis. However, some conclusions can be drawn: (1) PSR mixing conditions are more favourable than PFR flow; (2) increasing fuel-N content will increase the relative NOx reduction potential; (3) increasing fuel-N fraction of NH 3, or HNCO, compared to HCN will increase the NOx reduction potential; (4) increasing amounts of CO, and H 2, will increase the NOx reduction potential, but it depends also on the fuel-N compounds; (5) one primary air stage is sufficient, unless also the fuel supply is staged. It is possible to further increase the NOx reduction with more primary air stages at some conditions, but the increase is limited; (6) increasing overall excess air ratio will decrease the NOx reduction potential; (7) increasing residence time will only significantly increase the NOx reduction potential until the main chemistry is completed. However, the time for completion of the main chemistry is significantly longer in a PSR compared to a PFR, and the effect of an increasing residence time is much more pronounced at optimum conditions in a PSR; (8) temperature is an important parameter. However, for a specific set of other parameters there exists an optimum temperature. The temperature in the primary air stage should be high enough to complete the main chemistry. The temperature needed to complete the main chemistry, and the fuel-N chemistry, in a PSR is higher than in a PFR for the same residence time. The temperature in the secondary air stage should be as low as possible, but high enough to ensure complete combustion. Paper III (or P-III) ([Becidan 2007 a]) looks at the products distribution and the main pyrolysis products of thermally thick and scarcely studied biomass residues samples. For all fuels, higher temperatures favour gas yield at the expense of char and liquid yields. High heating rate also promotes gas yield. The main gas components were CO 2, CO, CH 4, H 2, C 2 H 2, C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 4. An increase in temperature and heating rate leads to increasing yields for all the gases up to 825 - 900 °C where CO 2 and hydrocarbons yields show a clear tendency to stabilise, increase slightly or decrease slightly depending on the fuel. The gas release dynamics reveal important information about the thermal behaviour of the various components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) of the biomass and are consistent with studies using TGA. The gross calorific value of the gas produced increases with increasing temperature reaching a plateau at 750 - 900 ºC. This study provides valuable data of the thermal behaviour of thermally thick biomass samples which is of interest for further work in the area of combustion, gasification and pyrolysis in fixed beds. The study confirms the potential of those unexploited residues for production of energy carriers through pyrolysis. Paper IV (or P-IV) ([Becidan 2007 b]) proposes a more extensive study of N-release from 3 biomass residues (<b>coffee</b> waste, <b>brewer</b> spent grains, fibreboard). This study of N-behaviour during biomass pyrolysis of thermally thick samples provided several findings. At high heating rate, NH 3 and HCN are the two N-containing compounds, NH 3 being the main one at all conditions; NH 3 release increases with increasing heating rate and temperature to reach a maximum at 825 - 900 °C while HCN yield increases sharply with temperature without reaching a plateau in the temperature range studied. N-selectivity, N release pattern and N-compounds thermal behaviour are affected by the fuel properties, in all probability including N-functionalities. While the total N-conversion levels to (HCN+NH 3) are similar for all fuels at high heating rate, the differences are very significant at low heating rate (more than 2 -fold for NH 3 and 3 -fold for HCN). This can be related to the different fuel properties including N-functionalities. Several attempts have been made previously to correlate N-functionalities and N-release during pyrolysis. However no clear dependence has ever been established for biomass. Furthermore, the intricate and versatile nature of N in biomass samples and its interactions with emicellulose, cellulose and lignin prior to and during pyrolysis are difficult to elucidate. A mechanism of cross-linking between a protein side group and cellulose during pyrolysis was proposed. Further work should focus on the use of the data obtained for improved modelling of biomass pyrolysis. In order to obtain more mechanistic insights the study of model compounds seems more appropriate but may have limited validity because of the intricate structure of “real” biomass. These two types of studies are therefore complementary to obtain a good overview of N-release. Paper V (or P-V) ([Becidan 2007 c]) presents the kinetics of decomposition of the three afore-mentioned biomass residues. The results can be summarised as such: (1) The samples were studied at five different T(t) temperature programs. The temperature programs covered a wide range of experimental conditions: the experiments exhibited 10 – 14 times variation in time span, mean reaction rate and peak reaction rate. The experiments on a given sample were described by the same set of model parameters. The optimal parameters were determined by the method of least squares. Three models were proposed that described equally well the behavior of the samples in the range of observations. (2) A model built from three distributed activation energy reactions was suitable to describe the devolatilisation at the highly different T(t) functions of our study with only 12 adjustable parameters. The other two models contained simpler mathematical equations (first order and nth order partial reactions, respectively), accordingly their use may be more convenient when the coupling of kinetic and transport equations are needed. On the other hand, the simpler models needed higher numbers of parameters to describe the complexity of these wastes (3) The reliability of the proposed models was tested in three ways: (i) the models provided good fits for all the five experiments of a sample; (ii) the evaluation of a narrower subset of the experiments (the three slowest experiments) provided approximately the same parameters as the evaluation of the whole series of experiments; (iii) the models proved to be suitable to predict the behavior of the samples outside of those experimental conditions at which the model parameters were determined. Check (iii) corresponded to an extrapolation to ca. four-time higher reaction rates from the domain of the three slowest experiments. (4) The evaluated experiments included “constant reaction rate” (CRR) measurements. This type of temperature control involves a continuously changing heating rate. The simultaneous evaluation of linear, stepwise and CRR experiments proved to be advantageous in the determination of reliable kinetic models. (5) The samples had very different chemical compositions. Nevertheless, the same models described them equally well. Accordingly, the models and the strategies for their evaluation and validation can be recommended for a wider range of biomass studies. Paper VI (or P-VI) ([Becidan 2007 d]), this study on thermally thick biomass samples pyrolysis has investigated (1) temperature field, (2) weight loss at two scales (TGA and macro-TGA). The main findings are: (a) Qualitative evaluation of the thermal history: three temperature regimes have been identified: (1) exponentially increasing temperature, (2) linearly increasing temperature (3) 2 -slope increasing temperature with a flattening period. The regime at a given point will depend on the sample weight, the reactor temperature and the location in the sample. (b) Quantitative evaluation of the thermal history: significant temperature gradients were measured, with a maximum radial gradient of 167 °C/cm for coffee waste at a reactor temperature of 900 °C. This will affect the pyrolysis process. (c) The step-by-step pyrolysis chemistry was described and discussed (10 °C/min heating rate). By use of a novel concept, i. e. intra-sample heating rate, the exothermic step of pyrolysis was shown. It is related to char and/or char-forming reactions. (d) The comparative study of weight loss in TGA and macro-TGA (10 °C/min heating rate, never done before to our knowledge) was performed to investigate the “scaling effect”. Pyrolysis time and pyrolysis rate differences were characterised and quantified. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
