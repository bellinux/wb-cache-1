When his mother Lois {{tells him that}} his pain will ultimately pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward {{to the point where}} his teething will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their other son Chris to his soccer match, then <b>come</b> <b>right</b> back to look after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and sounds like a man.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Russia and Romania {{destroyed}} all vessels along the Danube and mined the river, thus ensuring that Russian forces could cross the Danube at any point without resistance from the Ottoman navy. The Ottoman command did not appreciate the significance of the Russians' actions. In June, a small Russian unit crossed the Danube close to the delta, at Galați, and marched towards Ruschuk (today Ruse). This made the Ottomans even more confident that the big Russian force would <b>come</b> <b>right</b> through the middle of the Ottoman stronghold.|$|E
25|$|For all his {{impressive}} {{build and}} strength, and his shrewd skill, George Geary proved a quite nervous starter in the cricket world. He played {{a few times}} for Leicestershire in 1912, and in 1913 established himself as the leading bowler of what became a very weak bowling side in good weather owing to the tragic illness of Tom Jayes. The last year before the First World War saw Geary <b>come</b> <b>right</b> to the front with 114 wickets for just over 20 runs apiece, far ahead of any other bowler in the team.|$|E

25|$|In 2016, Cal went 5-7, wining only 3 {{out of the}} 9 Pac-12 games. A {{highlight}} of that season was the team's win over UCLA, making {{it the first time}} that Dykes was able to lead the team to beat one of Cal's three traditional rivals - Stanford, UCLA and USC. On January 8, 2017 Sonny Dykes was fired. He finished at Cal with a four-year record of 19–30. The firing came as a surprise as his contract was previously extended and most coaching changes <b>come</b> <b>right</b> after the end of a season and not the following year. Two of the stated concerns were Dykes' commitment to the program as following the 2016 Dykes was interviewed by Baylor University for their head coaching positions, and the significant decreases in home game attendance - thirty percent less season tickets were renewed for 2017 than for the previous year.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his poor}} eyesight, Berry wore contact lenses when he played. Because the lenses would often slip {{when he did}} rapid eye {{movements}} toward the ball, he tried many different lenses, which led sportswriters to believe {{he must have had}} major eye problems. [...] "I tried all kinds of lenses till we got what we wanted," [...] he said. [...] "I even had tinted lenses for sunny days, so I could watch the ball <b>come</b> <b>right</b> across the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|At 8:15 am Missouri {{crossed the}} danger bearing into the shoal water. At this time Commander Peckham {{sent a message}} to Captain Brown stating [...] "Ship heading into Danger shoals. Recommend you <b>come</b> <b>right</b> immediately!", but this message was relayed by [...] "talkers" [...] (men charged with {{relaying}} messages for officers to different stations) and the talker who was supposed to pass Peckham's message to Brown had a tendency to mumble badly. At the same time Peckham was attempting to alert Brown of the impending grounding, Morris again approached Brown and recommended coming right to avoid the shoal water. Captain Brown did not recall being informed of this, and made no reply to Morris. At this point Morris took a bearing on Thimble Shoals, and alarmed at the impending grounding Morris frantically returned to the captain waving his arms and shouting [...] "Come right! There's shoal water ahead!" [...] A disbelieving Captain Brown dismissed Morris pleas by stating that it was his belief that the navigator did not know where they were. To verify Morris' claims of impending shoal water, Brown asked Commander Millet to check Morris's position. As a precautionary move, Brown then ordered Quartermaster Travis, Missouris helmsman, to alter course to 058, but this order came too late.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the Browns, the Braves were contenders {{all the way}} to the end of the 1948 season. In a {{game against}} the Philadelphia Phillies on 3 September, and with the Braves tied for the NL lead, Heath hit a two-run home run and the Braves went on to win the game, 3–1, and stayed in first place for the {{remainder}} of the regular season. With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on 29 September but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. [...] "I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't. I looked at my foot, which was twisted all the way around, and honestly I thought it would <b>come</b> <b>right</b> off", Heath said the next day from a local hospital. After playing in the majors for parts of 12 years, he would be forced to miss the World Series as it was later diagnosed he fractured his ankle. He called the broken ankle [...] "the biggest disappointment of my life." [...] A widely published newspaper photograph of the play showed Heath sliding toward the plate, mouth open in shock, with his leg bent mid-ankle with the lower ankle rotated ninety degrees to the upper ankle. He was quoted asking himself [...] "Why did I slide?" [...] when he was carried off the field on a stretcher and later put in an ambulance. In 1964, Heath said: ...|$|E

It's an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, {{they are going to have}} the last word." [...] His remark was met with cold silence; one observer thought that Chief Justice Burger [...] "was going to <b>come</b> <b>right</b> off the bench at him. He glared him down." ...|$|E

Reed's Sir Joseph Porter would jump overboard only to re-enter clutching a rubber life-ring, while ... his Ko-Ko would be found furiously – and anachronistically – pedalling across the stage in a toy car." [...] On the other hand, he was sometimes criticised for these instances of dropping character and adding anachronisms. He explained, [...] "An encore is a different thing [...] a bit of fun {{between me and the}} audience [...] then I <b>come</b> <b>right</b> back into character again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Matterhorn is {{mentioned}} in a guide-book to Switzerland by Johann Gottfried Ebel, {{which was published}} in Zürich {{towards the end of the}} eighteenth century, and translated into English in 1818. The mountain appeared in it under the three names of Silvius, Matterhorn, and Mont Cervin, and was briefly described as one of the most splendid and wonderful obelisks in the Alps. On Zermatt there was a note: [...] "A place which may, perhaps, interest the tourist is the valley of Praborgne (Zermatt); it is bounded by huge glaciers which <b>come</b> <b>right</b> down into the valley; the village of Praborgne is fairly high, and stands at a great height above the glaciers; its climate is almost as warm as that of Italy, and plants belonging to hot countries are to be found there at considerable altitudes, above the ice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Journalist author Bob Woodward in {{his book}} on the CIA reports his meeting with Helms in 1980. Apparently the edginess of Helms was not nervousness, but {{indicated}} an exquisite awareness of his surroundings, wrote the investigative reporter. In 1989 Woodward called Helms [...] "one of the enduring symbols, controversies and legends of the CIA". Kissinger observed that Helms [...] "was tempered by many battles" [...] and [...] "was strong as he was wary." [...] Urbane and tenacious, [...] "his smile did not always include his eyes." [...] Former CIA official Victor Marchetti admired Helms for his office foresight, noting [...] "that not {{a single piece of}} paper existed in the agency which linked Helms to... the Bay of Pigs." [...] Intelligence author Keith Melton describes Helms as a professional, always impeccably dressed, with a 'low tolerance for fools'; an elusive man, laconic and reserved. About Helms author Edward Jay Epstein writes, [...] "I found him to be an elegant man with a quiet voice, who could <b>come</b> <b>right</b> to the point." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was backed}} by [...] "One of the Survivors" [...] for its UK release, where {{it came out in}} June; for its August release in the US, [...] "Sweet Lady Genevieve" [...] was substituted. The single was given little {{promotion}} {{on either side of the}} Atlantic, and failed to chart, but was well received by the American rock press. Alan Betrock of Rock Marketplace wrote: [...] "The new Kinks record has to bring smiles onto a lot of faces. ... 'Sitting in the Midday Sun' sounds like it could have <b>come</b> <b>right</b> off of Village Green and melodically and lyrically is quite fine." [...] Reception in the UK was mixed. Melody Maker praised [...] "Sitting in the Midday Sun", noting its [...] "lazy summer sound," [...] and calling it [...] "another winning tune from Raymond Douglas Davies and the boys." [...] New Musical Express was mixed: [...] "One of those lightweight singles The Kinks put out when they're waiting for Ray Davies to come up with something truly remarkable. It's an adequately pleasant little summer song that will do what it's supposed to do." [...] Disc called it [...] "one of the week's better releases".|$|E

U.S. Navy policy {{was to use}} its best combat pilots to train newer pilots, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese practice of keeping their best pilots flying combat missions. Ensign Edward L. [...] "Whitey" [...] Feightner, who served with O'Hare in July 1942, later said that one of the best pieces of information O'Hare passed on to him, was [...] "If you ever jump one of these Zeros and you surprise him, remember, the first thing he's going to do is a loop. Don't follow him into it! By the time you go into it a second time, he'll be behind you. The first thing you should do when he starts up the loop is make a hard right turn and keep turning. You'll <b>come</b> <b>right</b> around, and when he bottoms out of the loop, you'll be right on his tail!" [...] O'Hare also related [...] "First of all, remember, in today's world, whenever you take off and engage the enemy, you're going to be outnumbered. If you want to survive this War, you have to look behind you every chance you get. Even when you pull the trigger, be sure to look behind because there's gonna be someone back there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nearly {{two years}} later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's {{championship}} game, Carey {{said it was}} a [...] "personal honor" [...] and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he {{said it was a}} [...] "great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is [...] "in the grasp and control" [...] of the defense. Carey determined that [...] "grasp and control" [...] was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, [...] "I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see [...] head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a sudden he spun out and then he started to <b>come</b> <b>right</b> back at me." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} the section recounting the setting up of the Tabernacle in Parashah Pekudei, in which, {{beginning}} with [...] nearly every paragraph concludes, [...] "Even as the Lord commanded Moses," [...] is followed by [...] "And the Lord called to Moses." [...] The Midrash compared this {{to the case of}} a king who commanded his servant to build him a palace. On everything the servant built, he wrote the name of the king. The servant wrote the name of the king on the walls, the pillars, and the roof beams. After some time the king entered the palace, and on everything he saw he found his name. The king thought that the servant had done him all this honor, and yet the servant remained outside. So the king had called that the servant might <b>come</b> <b>right</b> in. So, too, when God directed Moses to make God a Tabernacle, Moses wrote on everything he made [...] "Even as the Lord commanded Moses." [...] God thought that Moses had done God all this honor, and yet Moses remained outside. So God call Moses so that he might enter the innermost part of the Tabernacle. Therefore, [...] reports, [...] "And the Lord called to Moses." [...] Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman said in the name of Rabbi Nathan that [...] "as the Lord commanded" [...] is written 18 times in the section recounting the setting up of the Tabernacle in Parashah Pekudei, corresponding to the 18 vertebrae of the spinal column. Likewise, the Sages instituted 18 benedictions of the Amidah prayer, corresponding to the 18 mentions of the Divine Name in the reading of the Shema, and also in Psalm [...] Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba taught that the 18 times [...] "command" [...] are counted only from [...] "And with him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan," [...] {{until the end of the}} Book of Exodus.|$|E
