50|$|Alluvial gold {{deposits}} {{could be}} worked {{and the gold}} extracted without needing to crush the ore. Washing tables were fitted below the tanks to collect the gold-dust and any nuggets present. Vein gold needed crushing, and they probably used crushing or stamp mills worked by water-wheels to <b>comminute</b> the hard ore before washing. Large quantities of water were also needed in deep mining to remove waste debris and power primitive machines, {{as well as for}} washing the crushed ore. Pliny the Elder provides a detailed description of gold mining in book xxxiii of his Naturalis Historia, most of which has been confirmed by archaeology. That they used water mills on a large scale elsewhere is attested by the flour mills at Barbegal in southern France, and on the Janiculum in Rome.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Fractures of the orbital-maxillo-zygomatic complex {{are among}} the most common {{fractures}} affecting the facial skeleton. Goal of surgical treatment is the realignment of fracture lines for a complete functional and aesthetic rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: From January 2008 to January 2011 in the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery of Complesso Integrato Columbus of the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome, 25 patients, affected by <b>comminute</b> fractures of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus associated with fractures of the orbital-maxillary complex were selected. The synthesis of the larger fracture fragments was performed by plates and screws (1. 5 mm) while a biocompatible glue (N-Butyl- 2 -Cyanoacrylate-Glubran 2 ®) was applied to treat the <b>comminute</b> fractures of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus. Results and Conclusion: The aim of our article is to report our experience and {{a review of the literature}} on application of-Butyl- 2 -Cyanoacrylate for treatment of <b>comminute</b> fractures of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus.

30|$|Within the {{limitations}} of this study of short follow-up periods of mandibular implant-retained overdenture and maxillary complete denture, the results lead to that both bilateral balanced occlusion and canine guidance occlusion can be used successfully in implant-retained overdentures without affecting masticatory function. However, the procedures involved in construction of dentures with bilateral balanced occlusion are more complex and time consuming. Greater muscle activity of both muscles is shown when chewing hard food due to higher muscle force needed to <b>comminute</b> hard food compared to soft food.|$|E
40|$|New Zealand forest {{operations}} are primarily based on large scale pine plantation clear-cuts. Previous {{studies have shown}} that relatively large volumes of woody biomass residues accumulate at the landings. This includes not only the branches and tops, but a very aggressive value recovery program focusing on quality results in a large volume of relatively short large diameter off-cuts. Through a program supported by the NZ Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA), four field studies were carried out to assess productivity characteristics and logistical options to optimise the recovery of landing biomass. The first field trial looked at using a tub grinder to <b>comminute</b> very large, but contaminated volumes of biomass from a superskid, whereby a comparison was made between fresh and old residues. The second looked at recovering short logs from the biomass piles and loaded directly by excavator into a bin truck, or stacked for a self-loading truck. The third focussed on longer logs trucked to a centralised landing area: the resulting stack covered for drying and subsequently chipped. For the latter study, an additional trial was set up to assess moisture content change over time of timber stacked, with treatments of covered and larger logs split. At time of writing the fourth trial had yet to commence. The results to date indicate that the difficulty of recovering the biomass from the landings significantly impact the ability to <b>comminute</b> cost-effectively. Sieving tests of the comminuted biomass indicated high levels of contamination, with large percentages of fines. While system costs were comparably moderate, production levels were low given the size and potential of the equipment used...|$|E
