5|$|The {{number of}} {{individuals}} in a colony varies. A mature nest of several years old can hold between 11,000 and 64,000 ants, while other colonies can house around 300,000. In some cases, enormous colonies can {{have as many as}} a million ants. Observed colonies are known to contain nearly 70,000 larvae and 64,000 workers; some can have 20,000 males and over 1,000 virgin queens, but others may have more virgin queens than males. The ratio of worker ants to the number of the larvae in colonies ranges from one worker for every two larvae or two larvae for every worker. The population of a nest can be affected or altered by several factors: human interference can severely damage or completely destroy nests which potentially devastates the nest population, and overshadowing is the main cause of a nest's demise. As well as that, neighbouring nests may increase in population if damaged or abandoned sites are taken over. Meat ants also rely on their nests to withstand <b>climatic</b> <b>stress</b> in summer and winter, as foraging activity and food sources are sometimes limited in summer, and in winter plant growth is almost impossible and workers are unable to survive cold temperatures. As a result, meat ants overwinter, which is a process where some organisms wait out the winter season due to cold conditions making everyday activity and survivability almost impossible; populations may be affected greatly.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward to explain the rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance following the Cretaceous.

Plant tolerance to <b>climatic</b> <b>stresses,</b> plant nutrition, biotic interactions and diversification may have played a role in later stages of angiosperm expansion within temperate and harsh environments.

40|$|The {{region of}} Moravian-Silesian Beskids {{has been in}} recent years {{affected}} by expressive yellowing of Norway spruce stands, {{which leads to a}} gradual drying and dieback of individual trees. The analysis of stress factors in the region of Silesian Beskids demonstrated a persisting occurrence of predisposition factors whose synergic action has a potential to provoke gradual decline, degradation and dieback of forest stands. The damaging of forest stands is apparently very complex. In the situation when chemical stress adds to <b>climatic</b> <b>stress,</b> the <b>climatic</b> <b>stress</b> assumes the role of predisposition factor. Damages to forest stands occur particularly in locations with exceeded limits of acid deposition critical load. It also follows out from the analysis that <b>climatic</b> <b>stress</b> induced by insufficient precipitation in years 1992, 1993 and 2003 in the studied locality of Silesian Beskids can be considered one of main predisposition factors of health condition worsening and damage to Norway spruce stands with a flat and often disturbed root system e. g. by increased soil acidification, established in upper soil horizons. The analysis of the occurrence of temperature reversals showed that frost shock is one of potential stress factors affecting the health condition of Norway spruce stands in the spring and in the autumn. The process of disturbance manifested by yellowing with the symptoms of chlorosis and necrosis of the youngest needle years is further entered by the synergic action of the ground ozone concentrations and the increasing intensity of UV-A and UV-B radiation. Trigger factors for local defoliation can be for example one-time extreme air temperature fluctuations in early spring or recurrent spells of drought and damage to assimilatory organs of the tree species due to ozone, UV radiation or direct and indirect synergic effect of acidic depositions of hydrogen ions in the soil environment...|$|E

40|$|Research {{into the}} climate change and {{migration}} nexus has often focussed solely on how people move {{in response to the}} impacts of variability and change in climate. This notion often ignores the nature of migration as a tried and tested livelihood choice amid a variety of socio-economic and environmental opportunities and limitations. This paper closely looks at the behavioural aspects of migration decision-making in Bangladesh in the context of changes in its economy, and, increasingly, exposure to the impacts of climate variability and change. We find that villagers in areas particularly affected by increasing <b>climatic</b> <b>stresses</b> and shocks are diversifying their traditional livelihood strategies by migrating. Environmental factors, including <b>climatic</b> <b>stresses</b> and shocks, often make such shifts even more necessary. Although the migrants’ primary motivation is better income, in effect, migration becomes an effective form of adaptation. Based on a qualitative study in three geographically distinct places of Bangladesh, we propose that migration is a socially acceptable behaviour that occurs in the context of perceived environmental change and climate variability. Migration decisions are mediated by a set of ‘behavioural factors’ that assesses the efficacy of different responses to opportunities and challenges, their socio-cultural acceptance and the ability to respond successfully. This understanding has policy relevance for climate change adaptation, in terms of both how migrants are perceived and how their movements are planned for...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change has}} been {{emphasised}} {{as one of the}} most pressing challenges, particularly for those communities who are dependent on climate sensitive activities and resources for their livelihoods. Concerns have been raised regarding the sustainability of pastoralist livelihoods in the drylands as climate change will increase climatic variability and the frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts, which already are putting significant pressure on local pastoralist populations. Building on a case study of the Waso Boran in Northern Kenya, this thesis explores how <b>climatic</b> <b>stress</b> and other stress factors affect local livelihoods. Most local actors interviewed led up until recently semi-nomadic pastoralist lives, but were compelled to settle and diversify their livelihoods due to large livestock losses following the effects of recent drought events. By more closely investigating drought as a risk and taking a historical perspective, drivers and characteristics of pastoralist vulnerability are examined. It is found that current patterns of vulnerability are very much linked to the historical developments that have shaped and altered Waso Boran livelihoods, which increasingly have been oriented towards resources and activities outside of pastoralism. As droughts elicit a range of other risks, such as conflicts and disease, pastoralist vulnerability is engendered through a multitude of stress factors which need to be addressed in order to reduce vulnerability. The current livelihood strategies pursued by settled pastoralists are further explored, notably with respect to the prospects of reducing social vulnerability to <b>climatic</b> <b>stress.</b> While diversification appeared as a favoured strategy, diversification is hampered due to the lack of alternatives to climate sensitive activities. Informants thus continue to having to depend on their livestock, notably for income, and thus remain vulnerable to <b>climatic</b> <b>stress.</b> Seeing that sedentarisation and diversification do not entail a break with pastoralism, but settled pastoralists remain very much tied to the pastoralist economy, climate change adaptation will need to create enabling conditions for both diversification and livestock keeping...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rural {{livelihoods}} {{relying on}} agriculture {{are particularly vulnerable}} to climate change. Climate models project increasingly negative effects on maize and sorghum production in sub-Saharan Africa. We present {{a case study of}} the role of genetic resources and seed systems in adapting to <b>climatic</b> <b>stress</b> from the semi-arid agroecological zone in Tanzania. Results: Crop adaptation, switching to more drought-tolerant crop species or varieties, is an important adaptation strategy within a diverse portfolio of livelihood responses to <b>climatic</b> <b>stress.</b> Crop adaptation involves the adoption of improved maize varieties combined with continued use of local varieties of both maize and sorghum. Regression modelling shows that households receiving the extension service and owning livestock are more likely to switch to drought-tolerant varieties as a response to <b>climatic</b> <b>stress</b> than those without access to these assets. The seed system in the study area consists of both formal and informal elements. The informal channels supply the highest quantities of both sorghum and maize seeds. Recycling of improved varieties of maize is common and the majority of households practice seed selection. Detailed assessment of the three different categories of genetic resources – local, improved and farmer-recycled varieties – reveals that drought tolerance is more frequently reported as a reason for growing local varieties than for growing improved varieties of maize and sorghum. The significantly later maturity reported for local varieties compared to the improved varieties bred to have a short growing cycle indicates that households distinguish between drought-tolerance and drought-avoidance traits. Conclusions: Seed system perspectives on crop adaptation offer insights into the complex ways crop adaptation is realized at the livelihood level. The integration of informal and formal seed system elements is important for the adaptive capacity of agriculture-based livelihoods. Our findings highlight the value and importance of location-specific information about crop variety use for arriving at realistic recommendations in impact and adaptation studies.
