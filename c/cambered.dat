5|$|Ivall's Cottage, a Grade II listed {{building}} since 1985, is located opposite the post box {{near the village}} green. The cottage was originally built during the 16th century, with late 18th century and early 19th century additions with contemporary extensions at the sides. The cottage is built from red brick and flint in Flemish bond, with <b>cambered</b> openings {{on the ground floor}} with a part-thatched, part-tiled roof. The roof is hipped at the west end, with lower eaves at the rear intercepted by eyebrow dormers.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nineteenth- and to {{a lesser}} extent twentieth-century attitudes often {{suggested}} that any well-constructed pre-modern road surface must be Roman, late twentieth-century archaeologists were more open to evaluating the structure within the context of a wider span of historical periods. After an early allowance by Phillips in 1853 that the causeway could be British rather than Roman there was little further investigation of such a possibility. In 1994, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England began a review of the date or origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor from the camps to which it is historically related, and the causeway does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network. Several writers around the turn of the millennium began to express doubt about the established narrative for the structure as a Roman road. Twenty-first century archaeologists then found several exemplars of other <b>cambered,</b> metalled roads that pre-date the Roman presence in Britain, and hence set precedence for the possibility of a pre-Roman origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Several sources from the mid-1990s onwards have suggested that the structure may be a pre-Roman (Iron Age) road of uncertain route or purpose.|$|E

50|$|Of {{the major}} protagonists in the Legends of <b>Camber</b> of Culdi trilogy, <b>Camber</b> {{is clearly the}} leader. While {{characters}} such as Joram, Evaine, and Rhys often defer to his patriarchal authority, <b>Camber's</b> other colleagues and allies respond to his intelligence, experience, and keen analytical judgment. Although others share in his goals and objectives, it is <b>Camber's</b> actions and decisions that have {{the greatest impact on}} the overall social and political events in the novels. When Rhys and Joram discover the existence of a Haldane heir in <b>Camber</b> of Culdi, one of their first actions is to seek <b>Camber's</b> guidance on the matter, and it is ultimately <b>Camber's</b> participation in the plot (specifically giving Deryni-like powers to Cinhil) that enables it to succeed. In Saint <b>Camber,</b> <b>Camber's</b> assumption of Alister Cullen's identity allows him to befriend Cinhil and provide the guidance the new king needs to become a successful ruler. And after Cinhil's death in <b>Camber</b> the Heretic, <b>Camber</b> continues to use his Cullen identity to provide invaluable leadership to the developing Deryni resistance movement. While <b>Camber</b> rarely works alone in his endeavors, it is often his counsel and direction that the other protagonists follow.|$|R

5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} seven Grade II listed buildings and one Grade II* listed building—the Church of All Saints. Some of the oldest parts of the church date from the 13th century, although the structure was virtually rebuilt afresh in 1877. The church roof consists of red tiles with a small broach spire and a wooden turret. The walls are made of flint with stone dressed buttresses and the windows date from the Restoration period. Other listed buildings in the vicinity include Southwood Farmhouse, Manor Farmhouse and the Upper Farmhouse. Southwood Farmhouse is two storeys high and dates from the 18th century. Its walls are made of red brick with <b>cambered</b> floor openings and its roof is steeply tiled. Manor Farmhouse lies {{to the south of}} the village and consists of a near-identical design with Southwood Farmhouse, although it was probably constructed in the early 19th century. The Upper Farmhouse lies in the centre of the village and is a house of mixed periods. The building itself dates from the 17th century, though expansions were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. The house has interior framing and a Victorian lighting system. Its taller expansions were made in the 18th century, and in between the expansions lies a 19th century gable with a brick porch at its north side.|$|E

50|$|Throughout {{the course}} of The Legends of <b>Camber</b> of Culdi, <b>Camber</b> is in {{conflict}} with the Festillic rulers of Gwynedd, King Imre Furstán-Festil and his sister, Princess Ariella. <b>Camber</b> has a strained relationship with King Cinhil Haldane, who blames <b>Camber</b> for taking him from his priestly vocation. Many of <b>Camber's</b> decisions result in heated arguments with his son, Joram. By the end of the trilogy, <b>Camber</b> is in danger from the ambitious human nobles and priests who seek to suppress Deryni throughout Gwynedd.|$|R
50|$|<b>Camber</b> {{returns to}} Valoret with the victorious Gwyneddan army, {{but he is}} {{increasingly}} plagued by headaches from Cullen's memories, which he must assimilate into his own memories {{if he is to}} avoid madness. Evaine, Rhys, and Joram assist <b>Camber</b> in the necessary procedure, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the king. Unable to stop the process, <b>Camber's</b> disguise momentarily slips, leaving Cinhil stunned by the brief appearance of the supposedly dead <b>Camber.</b> Nonetheless, Evaine and <b>Camber</b> complete the procedure, which allows <b>Camber</b> to better perform his public role as Cullen. The following night, <b>Camber</b> again drops his disguise long enough to appear as a vision to his despondent former squire, Lord Guaire d'Arliss. <b>Camber</b> spends much of the next week fulfilling the role of Vicar General of the Michaelines, but it is Cullen's impending promotion to Bishop of Grecotha that concerns him most. The night before the ceremony, at Joram's behest, <b>Camber</b> reveals his identity to his old friend Archbishop Anscom of Valoret. Anscom agrees to consecrate <b>Camber</b> as a priest, which will enable him to legally perform the duties of a bishop. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, Anscom ordains <b>Camber</b> in the presence of his children, and <b>Camber</b> becomes Bishop of Grecotha later that day.|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} phase, a general {{clean-up}} of the airframe {{was performed to}} reduce drag. New aerodynamic fairings were developed using fiberglass honeycomb sandwich for the rear fuselage, a <b>cambered</b> vertical stabilizer was developed which, in cruise flight, aerodynamically unloaded the tail rotor.

25|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of wave drag on aircraft in the transonic speed range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly <b>cambered</b> aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. The {{supercritical airfoil}} was invented and designed by NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb in the 1960s. Testing successfully commenced on a United States Navy Vought F-8U fighter through wind tunnel results in 1971.|$|E
25|$|Wings with an {{asymmetrical}} {{cross section}} {{are the norm}} in subsonic flight. Wings with a symmetrical cross section can also generate lift by using a positive angle of attack to deflect air downward. Symmetrical airfoils have higher stalling speeds than <b>cambered</b> airfoils of the same wing area but are used in aerobatic aircraft as they provide practical performance whether the aircraft is upright or inverted. Another example comes from sailboats, where the sail is a thin membrane with no path-length difference between {{one side and the}} other.|$|E

40|$|Inaccurate {{prediction}} of long-term <b>camber</b> in precast prestressed concrete beams (PPCB) creates discrepancies in bridge construction {{which results in}} increased costs and construction challenges. Although {{emphasis is placed on}} erection and long-term <b>camber,</b> these challenges have been found to originate from the difference between the estimated design and measured <b>camber</b> at the transfer of prestress and will continue to increase with time. The estimate of the instantaneous <b>camber</b> is influenced by factors such as the method used for determining the <b>camber</b> as well as the assumed modulus of elasticity and initial prestress, while the measured <b>camber</b> can be affected by the measurement technique, quality of formwork and construction, and uniformity of concrete. To systematically study and eliminate the construction challenges associated with <b>camber</b> of precast girders, a research project was undertaken to examine the differences between the measured and designed <b>camber</b> of Iowa girders from fabrication through erection. This thesis focuses on the causes of error found with instantaneous <b>camber</b> by examining the designer 2 ̆ 7 s prediction method and variables used for design, the construction practices used for producing a PPCB, and the precasters <b>camber</b> measurement method adopted by the precast industry. While the discrepancy between the measured and designed <b>camber</b> was found to be dependent on the girder type, the designed <b>camber</b> was underestimated due to inaccurate variables used for material properties and the design prestress force. In depth analysis was conducted to investigate different methods of <b>camber</b> prediction and to determine the effects that material properties have on <b>camber.</b> Evaluation of the historical <b>camber</b> measurements that were previously recorded using the current measurement technique revealed that <b>camber</b> is over predicted the majority of the time. Further examination of historical data exposed insufficient data that did not accurately capture the instantaneous <b>camber.</b> For this reason, precasters fabrication procedures were observed and instantaneous <b>camber</b> was measured by the project team from over 100 girders. Observations and independent <b>camber</b> measurements taken by the research team led to the identification of discrepancies between predicted and measured instantaneous <b>camber.</b> Results found that friction, bed deflections, inconsistent top flange surfaces due to the finish that is applied, and inconsistent top flange surfaces due to the beam depth not being uniform {{along the length of the}} beam currently produce an average error of 17. 6...|$|R

25|$|The road {{began as}} a leveled dirt road upon which small stones and mortar were laid. Gravel was laid upon this, which was finally topped with tight fitting, {{interlocking}} stones to provide a flat surface. The historian Procopius said that the stones fit together so securely and closely that they appeared to have grown together rather than to have been fitted together. The road was <b>cambered</b> in the middle (for water runoff) and had ditches {{on either side of}} the road which were protected by retaining walls.|$|E
25|$|Roman roads (Latin: viae Romanae; singular: Via Romana meaning Roman way) were {{physical}} infrastructure {{vital to the}} maintenance {{and development of the}} Roman state, and were built from about 300 BC through the expansion and consolidation of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, and civilians, and the inland carriage of official communications and trade goods. Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases. These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, <b>cambered</b> for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills, or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework. Sections could be supported over marshy ground on rafted or piled foundations.|$|E
25|$|The road {{began in}} the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the clivus Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the {{builders}} used the via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road {{at the time was}} a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, <b>cambered,</b> drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The via Appia {{is believed to have been}} the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth that you could not distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.|$|E

25|$|The full Grand Prix Circuit {{begins on}} the Brabham Straight, an off-camber, {{slightly}} curved stretch, before plunging into the right-hander at Paddock Hill Bend. Despite {{the difficulty of}} the curve, due to the straight that precedes it, {{it is one of the}} track's few overtaking spots. The next corner, Druids, is a hairpin bend, negotiated after an uphill braking zone at Hailwood Hill. The track then curves around the south bank spectator area into the downhill, off-camber Graham Hill Bend, and another, slightly bent stretch at the Cooper Straight, which runs parallel to the pit lane. After the straight, the circuit climbs uphill though the decreasing-radius Surtees turn, before moving onto the back straight where the track's top speeds can be reached. The most significant elevation changes on the circuit occur here at Pilgrim's Drop and Hawthorn Hill, which leads into Hawthorn Bend. The track then loops around the woodland with a series of mid-speed corners, most notably the dip at Westfield and Dingle Dell and the blind Sheene curve. From there the track then emerges from the left hand and <b>cambered</b> Stirlings Bend onto the short straight to Clearways and rejoins the Indy Circuit for Clark Curve with its uphill off-camber approach to the pit straight and the start/finish line.|$|E
25|$|The DH.6 was {{specifically}} {{designed as a}} military trainer, {{at a time when}} it was usual for obsolete service types to be used in this role. Geoffrey de Havilland seems to have had two design criteria in mind. The first was that it should be inexpensive and easy to build, and above all, simple to repair after the mishaps common in training units. The top and bottom wings were square-cut and interchangeable, hence roundels often located in unusual positions. They were heavily <b>cambered,</b> and braced with cables rather than streamlined wires. On the original version of the type there was no stagger. Even the fin and rudder, on the prototype of the usual curved de Havilland outline, were cut square on production machines. The fuselage structure was a straight box with no attempt at refinement of outline – instructor and pupil sat in tandem on basketwork seats in a single cockpit, spartan even by the standards of the time. The standard engine was the readily-available 90hp (67kW) RAF 1a. Because of its use in the B.E.2 the engine was familiar to RFC mechanics. No cowling was used, and upswept straight exhaust pipes were fitted. When stocks of the RAF 1a ran short, other engines were fitted, including the 80hp (60kW) Renault.|$|E

They adopted the basic design of the Chanute-Herring biplane hang glider ("double-decker" [...] as the Wrights called it), which flew well in the 1896 experiments near Chicago, and used aeronautical data on lift that Lilienthal had published. The Wrights designed the wings with camber, a curvature of the top surface. The brothers did not discover this principle, but took advantage of it. The better lift of a <b>cambered</b> surface compared to a flat one was first discussed scientifically by Sir George Cayley. Lilienthal, whose work the Wrights carefully studied, used <b>cambered</b> wings in his gliders, proving in flight the advantage over flat surfaces.|$|E
40|$|MasterIn {{hot rolling}} process, <b>camber</b> {{is one of}} the most {{significant}} defects where <b>camber</b> is flatness asymmetries produced by non-uniform distribution of rolling pressure. This kind of defect may cause not only the clogging of finishing mill, but also visible defects such as strip edge folds, edge cracks, holes, and scrapes in the process. In order to reduce <b>camber</b> for hot rolled steel strips, it is important to measure the exact <b>camber</b> value with information of the overall shape. This paper describes a computer vision system with new algorithm for obtaining the optimal cutting line, overall strip shape, and <b>camber</b> value from two area scan Charge Coupled Cameras (CCD) in hot rolling process. The proposed algorithm consists of three parts: cutting line detection, image stitching, and <b>camber</b> detection. The cutting line detection part determines the optimal cutting line of the head and tail part of strip for endless hot rolling process. The image stitching part obtains the overall shape of a hot rolled steel strip with continuous image sequence obtained by two area scan cameras. The <b>camber</b> detection part measures head <b>camber,</b> tail <b>camber,</b> and whole <b>camber</b> of the steel strip. Through the proposed algorithm, the system satisfies time constraints for detecting the <b>camber</b> of the steel strip...|$|R
