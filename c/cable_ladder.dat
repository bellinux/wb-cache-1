50|$|In the First Round of Flight of Fear, Natty {{was ahead}} of James due to Team Sting's 10 second head start. Natty was in the lead for {{a third of the}} challenge, but James caght up with and taken the lead. However, James' couldn't reach the <b>cable</b> <b>ladder,</b> meaning Natty was back in the lead, but James finally reaches the <b>cable</b> <b>ladder.</b> James then {{struggled}} to keep hold of the <b>cable</b> <b>ladder</b> while trying to untie a cog. Natty then struggled to reach the fixed ladder and James lost momentum and was lowered back down. Natty again can't reach the fixed ladder, pushing James into the lead again, meaning James zoomed down the ladder and threw his cog into the tub, and James won the advantage for Claw in the Second Round.|$|E
50|$|Island {{challenge}} - In the First Round, {{the captains}} {{will have to}} climb up the fixed ladders attached {{to one of the}} trees, before swinging across to angle cable ladders to collect Giant Cogs. They then have to deliver these cogs into collection tubs {{at the base of the}} tree, and the captain who gets all 8 Cogs in their collection tubs first, wins. In the Second Round, one team member will have to climb up an angled <b>cable</b> <b>ladder,</b> collecting Giant Cogs one at a time, before passing them to their teammate who is climbing a matching <b>cable</b> <b>ladder</b> on the other side of the Forest Clearing. To make these passes, they have to swing towards each other. Once the cogs have been passed across, the second team member has to deliver it in the collection tub at the base of their angled ladder. If the Cog hits the ground it is out of play, and if an adventurer completely loses momentum and can not reach either ladder, they will be lowered right back to the ground. Both teams have 8 minutes to deliver as many cogs as possible, and whichever team has the most cogs in their collection tub when the time runs out wins.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{management}} both {{supports and}} contains cables during installation, and makes subsequent maintenance or {{changes to the}} cable system easier. Products such as <b>cable</b> trays, <b>cable</b> <b>ladders,</b> and <b>cable</b> baskets are used to support a cable through cabling routes.|$|R
5000|$|Exploration into pit caves ("vertical caving", {{also called}} [...] "pit caving") {{requires}} {{the use of}} equipment such as nylon kernmantle rope or <b>cable</b> <b>ladders.</b> More specialized caving techniques such as the single rope technique (SRT) are common practice and the preferred method of pit exploration for cavers worldwide. The SRT involves the use of 9-11 mm nylon static rope and mechanical descenders/ascenders.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission of}} this {{specialist}} force (or Schwarm) was to secure and maintain climbing paths and routes in high-Alpine terrain, {{as well as}} to make military supply routes practicable. For this, they were equipped with wire <b>cables,</b> rope <b>ladders,</b> iron bars and other equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Over The Edge: A pair of planks {{are hanging}} {{from the top of}} a 25-story building. A 10-foot <b>cable</b> <b>ladder,</b> with a flag at the bottom, is {{attached}} to the end of each plank. When T. J. Lavin sounds the horn, players from each team have to make their way onto the planks and down the ladder, retrieve their team flag, then make their way back up the ladder and touch a truss {{at the start of the}} plank, which will stop a team time. If a player falls off the ladder or refuses to compete (due to a fear of heights), a 15-minute penalty will be added to the slowest time. The team with the fastest average time wins.|$|E
40|$|At Akzo Nobel Stockvik {{there is}} a cable-culvert where many cables run. There is no {{oversight}} of the culvert and no impact-analysis {{in case of a}} fire. Electricity is fed through the culvert to AGA-Gas. Penetrations made from the culvert to other areas are not documented and the risk of the spread of smoke and heat to other rooms is possible. The report aims {{to assess the impact of}} a fire in the culvert and perform calculations on various fire scenarios in the culvert. The results from these should be used as an input-file in the computer program Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). The work has been limited to the culvert and related areas. The FDS simulations are used solely to calculate the spread of smoke and temperatures. The work has been performed in different steps by a predetermined method. This was developed through discussions between the supervisor, Björn Sundström, and writer, Anton Hörnqvist. The flow consists of an object visit with photographing and measuring of the culvert. Thereafter, subsequent literature studies, calculations and assumptions. The calculations were used as input file in FDS. Literature studies focuses mainly on statistics on fires caused by electricity and cables. This includes different causes of errors leading to fires in cables. The results of the visual examination was made by a 3 -D model. Since there are no drawings of this culvert the model has been used as the orientation of the culvert. The model has later been divided into sections for easier reference to the specific area. The inspection also revealed a number of shortcomings regarding safety. These have been summarized in a checklist. An impact assessment was performed by using personnel in the field. This showed that a number of areas would be without electric power supply in case a fire should occur in the cable culvert. The most severe consequences would be power loss for AGA gas and the SKW:s (Stahl-Metallurgie Holding AG) finishing operations. Calculations were made to obtain a heat release rate curve. Quickly it was found that due to the windows along with the limited amount of oxygen it would be likely that the fire would become ventilation controlled. Therefore two heat release rate curves were calculated. One scenario was that the fire would continue until all the oxygen in the culvert was used, and then burn itself off. The second scenario was that the windows bursts and therefore leads to the continuation of the fire, but with the limited amount of oxygen supplied through the windows. In Scenario 1 the maximum power of 2. 8 MW is developed. In scenario two the effect of the fire decreases, when the fire get ventilation controlled, down to 1. 8 MW. The calculated heat release rate curve was used as an indata-file in the program Fire Dynamics Simulator. In the program two simulations were conducted for two different scenarios. The first simulation shows how long the fire will continue with available oxygen. The second simulation shows a scenario with broken windows leading to the fire becoming ventilation controlled. Results from the simulations were compared with the calculations. Assumptions were made on the fuel content of the wires. The amount of polyethylene was assumed to be two-thirds and the rest polyvinylchloride. To assess the effect of these assumptions calculations were made with cables consisting fully of each fuel content. This sensitivity analysis showed that there became differences in the results but the consequences for the area remained the same. Adoption of time until the fire reaches its maximum was based on tests conducted in a large study of the Swedish Technical Research institution (SP). This study showed that the given test setup, horizontal scenario, reaches its maximum effect after about 15 minutes. In the sensitivity analysis a lower time than this was used, which lead to a higher maximum power. But this change is not expected to affect the consequences of the fire. The discussion dealt with why the analyse-term estimated heat release rate curve did not fit with the simulated in FDS. The discussion also provides a list for improvement. • A complete cleanup of the culvert and removal of remains. • Supervision process for the culvert needs to be established. There could be a quick overview in conjunction with other inspections, to continuously maintain a clean environment in the culvert. • Repair of the broken lights. • Inventory and removal of non-utilized cables in the culvert. • Cable and pipe section between B and C should be reviewed to ensure that the fire spread not will reach the container hall (see BBR 5 : 56) • Cover plates over <b>cable</b> <b>ladder</b> with high voltage cables can be installed to reduce the possibility of fire, to protect the cables if a fire still occurs and to delay the ignition time. • A contingency plan for the culvert should be established. This should include a drawing over the culvert. • Water and sewage pipes should be located outside of the culvert. Even old unused sewage pipes should be removed because they may contain fluid, which could lead to short circuiting of high voltage cables if it starts to leak. • Some form of detection in the transformer housing could be justified. From here, the whole area is supplied with electricity and urgency of protecting this should be high on a priority list. As it is today, there is no detection.

50|$|St Patricks Head - Travel {{east from}} St Marys and, {{as the road}} starts to rise, take the turn to the right up Irish Town Road. The road quickly becomes dirt. Follow the signs. It is a not an easy walk (there are places where metal <b>cables</b> and <b>ladders</b> are used to help the climber) but the view is {{spectacular}} and well worth the effort.|$|R
50|$|In a radio antenna, {{the feed}} {{line is the}} cable or other {{transmission}} line that connects the antenna with the radio transmitter or receiver. In a transmitting antenna, it feeds the radio frequency (RF) current from the transmitter to the antenna, where it is radiated as radio waves. In a receiving antenna it transfers the tiny RF voltage induced in the antenna by the radio wave to the receiver. In order to carry RF current efficiently, feed lines are made of specialized types of cable called transmission line. The most widely used types of feed line are coaxial <b>cable,</b> twin-lead, <b>ladder</b> line, and at microwave frequencies, waveguide.|$|R
5000|$|The peak can be {{attained}} by a route which, while easy, requires good experience, called the [...] "Variation for the Summit". This departs from a bivouac shelter called Fiamme Gialle, at {{a height of}} 3,005 metres, which is reached by the Bolver-Lugli via ferrata, not technically demanding, but tiring. This mountain route, equipped with fixed <b>cables,</b> stemples, <b>ladders,</b> and bridges, was constructed {{by a group of}} mountain guides from San Martino di Castrozza, known in the mountaineering world as the Eagles of San Martino, to mark the centenary in 1970 of the first ascent of the peak on 3 June 1870 by Edward Robson Whitwell and his guides Santo Siorpaes, of nearby Cortina d'Ampezzo, and Christian Lauener of Lauterbrunnen.|$|R
50|$|Pulley {{wheels are}} {{fixed to the}} {{horizontal}} beam assembly so that the wheels turn between the coupled wooden beams. A wheel is fitted to {{each end of the}} beam. Steel cable runs through the pulley wheels. A hook is suspended {{at the end of the}} <b>cable.</b> A steel <b>ladder</b> is fitted to the side of the mast and a safety rail runs almost the full length of the horizontal beam.|$|R
60|$|In {{the years}} which followed, many bold men took {{advantage}} of the huge rope ladder which he had put in place; but one winter <b>ladder,</b> <b>cables</b> and all were carried away by the snow and ice. True, most of the eye-bolts, twisted and bent, remained. But few men had since essayed the hazardous undertaking, and of those few more than one gave up his life on the treacherous heights, and not one succeeded.|$|R
5000|$|A Dutch sand <b>ladder</b> is a <b>cable</b> or rope <b>ladder</b> with rungs {{usually made}} of wood, {{lying on a}} sandy slope to allow persons to ascend or descend with minimal erosion. The bottom end is {{anchored}} and the top end is designed for easy disconnection so that the ladder can be lifted up to shake loose any sand that has accumulated on the rungs. The ability to be easily maintained and reset makes sand ladders useful trail features for steep sand dunes or other easily eroded areas where permanent structures are infeasible or impractical.|$|R
50|$|Originally, a suite {{was planned}} for the Disney family and executives, but since Walt Disney died nearly five years before the park opened, it {{remained}} unfinished, and eventually was turned successively into a telephone call center, a dressing room, and is currently a lavish Dream Suite hotel room for specially selected guests. There are three elevators inside the castle. One is for guest use and goes between the lobby of Cinderella's Royal Table, and the second floor where the restaurant is. The second is for restaurant staff use, and is located in tower 2 {{to the left of}} the drawbridge. It has landings in the Utilidors, the mezzanine level in a break room, and on the second floor in the kitchen. The third elevator is in tower 20, and services the Utilidors, the breezeway, the kitchen of Cinderella's Royal Table, and the Cinderella Castle Suite. The suite is about 30 ft below the level where the cable is attached to tower 20. Access to the <b>cable</b> is by <b>ladder.</b> From January 2007 to December 2009 the suite was used as a prize for the Disney Dreams Giveaway at the Walt Disney World Resort during the Year of a Million Dreams celebration.|$|R
5000|$|Via ferrata is [...] "a {{mountain}} route equipped with fixed <b>ladders,</b> <b>cables,</b> and bridges {{in order to}} be accessible to climbers and walkers"; that is it is a serious form of scrambling, which has climbing aids built in on the route that help make it safe. The essence of a modern via ferrata is a steel cable which runs along the route and is periodically (every 3 to 10 m) fixed to the rock. Using a via ferrata kit, climbers can secure themselves to the cable, limiting any fall. The cable can also be used as aid to climbing, and additional climbing aids, such as iron rungs (stemples), pegs, carved steps and even ladders and bridges are often provided. Thus via ferratas allow otherwise dangerous routes to be undertaken without the risks associated with unprotected scrambling and climbing or the need for climbing equipment such as ropes. Such routes allow the relatively inexperienced a means of enjoying dramatic positions and accessing difficult peaks, normally the preserve of the serious mountaineer; although, as {{there is a need for}} some equipment, a good head for heights and basic technique, the via ferrata can be seen as a distinct step up from ordinary mountain walking.|$|R
40|$|Readout cables {{extend from}} the ladder {{end to the}} outer barrel radius in the region where the F-disks are mounted. In this region it is {{difficult}} to know what the gas temperature will be due to the power dissipating components on the F-disks and power from all the cables. This region is convectively cooled by the barrel bulkhead and the F-disk cooling channel. Power dissipated in the cable will not only warm the surrounding gas but will warm the hybrid to which it is attached on the ladders and disks. Just how much power goes into the hybrid will be estimated here. Physically, the cable is composed of two layers of copper which are separated and encased by 3 layers of kapton. The central kapton layer is 0. 001 -inch thick, the outer two kapton layers are 0. 0005 -inch thick, and the two copper layers are 0. 0006 -inch thick. Mike Matulik estimated the power dissipation of the cables for the 3. 6, and 9 chip ladders. These estimates are based on the assumed cross-sectional area of copper in the cable and the current these cables will carry, for a 12 -inch cable length. The assumed powers are 14, 49, and 114 mW, respectively. The cable power dissipation is modeled using the finite difference technique. To determine the allowable node size for this simulation a 5 -inch cable was simulated, with the same cross-sectional area and nominal power dissipation approximately equal to the power dissipated in the 6 chip <b>ladder</b> <b>cable.</b> Node sizes of 25, 50, and 100 mils are considered. Considering Figures 1 and 2, 100 mil nodes will be used for future simulations, considered adequately small to simulate the cable...|$|R
40|$|Dredge cutting forces {{produced}} by {{the movement of the}} cutterhead through the sediment have been measured with the laboratory dredge carriage located at the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory. The sediment bed that was used for the dredging test was considered to be relatively smooth and the sediment used was sand with a d 50 = 0. 27 mm. Forces on the dredge carriage were measured using five 13. 3 kN (3000 lb) one directional load cells placed on the dredge ladder in various places so the transmitted cutting forces could be obtained. The objectives for this study are to determine the vertical, horizontal, and axial forces that are {{produced by}} the cutterhead while testing. So, to find these cutter forces, a static analysis was performed on the carriage by applying static loads to the cutterhead in the vertical, horizontal, and axial directions, and for each load that was applied, readings were recorded for all five of the load cells. Then, static equilibrium equations were developed for the dredge carriage ladder to determine loads in the five load cells. Also, equilibrium equations can be applied to a dredging test to find the cutterhead forces by taking the measured data from the five load cells and applying the known forces to the equations, and the cutterhead forces can be determined. These static equilibrium equations have been confirmed by using a program called SolidWorks, which is modeling software {{that can be used to}} do static finite element analysis of structural systems to determine stresses, displacement, and pin and bolt forces. Data that were gathered from the experimental procedure and the theoretical calculations show that the force on the dredge cutterhead can be determined. However, the results from the static equilibrium calculations and the results from the SolidWorks program were compared to the experiment procedure results, and from the comparison the procedure results show irregularities when a force of approximately 0. 889 kN (200 lb) or above is applied to the cutterhead in a north, south, west, or east orientation. The SolidWorks program was used to determine the results for displacements of the dredge carriage ladder system, which showed that large displacements were occurring at the location of the cutterhead, and when the cutterhead displaces it means that the carriage ladder is also moving, which causes false readings in the five load cells. From this analysis it was determined that a sixth force transducer was needed to produce more resistance on the ladder; and the cell # 1 location needed to be redesigned to make the ladder system as rigid as possible and able to produce good testing results. The SolidWorks program was used to determine the best location where the sixth force transducer would give the best results, and this location was determined to be on the lower south-west corner oriented in the direction east to west. The static equilibrium equations were rewritten to include the new redesigned cell # 1 location and the new location of the sixth load cell. From the new system of equations, forces on the cutterhead can be determined for future dredging studies conducted with the dredge carriage. Finally, the forces on the laboratory cuttersuction dredge model cutterhead were scaled up to the prototype 61 cm (24 in) cuttersuction dredge. These scaled up cutting forces on the dredge cutterhead can be utilized in the design of the swing winches, swing <b>cable</b> size, <b>ladder</b> supports, and ladder...|$|R
