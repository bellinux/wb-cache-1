The vaquita is an evolutionarily distinct animal and has no close relatives.

The EDGE of Existence Programme is a conservation effort that attempts to help conserve endangered animals that represent large portions of their evolutionary trees.

40|$|Abstract: The {{significant}} impact of construction projects on a nation {{has been characterized}} in literature in terms of infrastructure development and job creation. These projects are nevertheless associated with various risks {{that need to be}} managed to ensure successful delivery. Hence, the identification of these risk factors is of utmost importance. Therefore, this study aimed at assessing contractors‘ perception of <b>critical</b> <b>risk</b> factors in construction projects in Gauteng (South Africa). Explorative and questionnaire survey methods were employed to obtain data from literature and construction professionals all practising in Gauteng. Results revealed that supply of faulty materials, poor communication between involved parties, financial failure of the contractor, working at dangerous areas and closure were the five <b>critical</b> <b>risk</b> factors in construction projects. It is obvious from the results that the knowledge of the identified <b>critical</b> <b>risk</b> factors furnishes invaluable information to the construction contractor concerning what risk variables to focus attention on in construction activities.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a framework for}} using probabilistic terrorism risk modeling in regulatory analysis. We demonstrate the framework with an example application involving a regulation under consideration, the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for the Land Environment, (WHTI-L). First, we estimate annualized loss from terrorist attacks with the Risk Management Solutions (RMS) Probabilistic Terrorism Model. We then estimate the <b>critical</b> <b>risk</b> reduction, which is the risk-reducing effectiveness of WHTI-L needed for its benefit, in terms of reduced terrorism loss in the United States, to exceed its cost. Our analysis indicates that the <b>critical</b> <b>risk</b> reduction depends strongly not only on uncertainties in the terrorism risk level, but also on uncertainty {{in the cost of}} regulation and how casualties are monetized. For a terrorism risk level based on the RMS standard risk estimate, the baseline regulatory cost estimate for WHTI-L, and a range of casualty cost estimates based on the willingness-to-pay approach, our estimate for the expected annualized loss from terrorism ranges from $ 2. 7 billion to $ 5. 2 billion.

40|$|AbstractCost overrun {{in power}} plant {{projects}} {{is a global}} problem. Assessing potential risks at preliminary stage of the project is important to control cost overrun. Existing models are discovered as ineffective for assessing cost overrun risks in power plant projects due to two basic limitations- i) incapable to handle subjective biases in riskassessment and ii) complex relationship among the risk factors. A novel method based on the combination of fuzzy logic and Bayesian belief network has been developed, which can solve both drawbacks of the existing models and provides the best result for finding inherent risks in power plant projects. This model assists the project managers providing early warning to manage the <b>critical</b> <b>risks.</b> It also helps to reach a realistic budget considering the costs of potential and <b>critical</b> <b>risks</b> in the estimation process, which consequently reduces the cost overrun of power plant projects...|$|R
