5|$|International {{emergency}} medicine is a subspecialty of {{emergency medicine}} that focuses {{not only on}} the global practice of emergency medicine but also on efforts to promote the growth of emergency <b>care</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> branch of medicine throughout the world. The term international emergency medicine generally refers to the transfer of skills and knowledgeincluding knowledge of ambulance operations and other aspects of prehospital carefrom developed emergency medical systems (EMSs) to those systems which are less developed. However, this definition has been criticized as oxymoronic, given the international nature of medicine and the number of physicians working internationally. From this point of view, international emergency medicine is better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{problem with the}} quality of American medicine is that we’ve failed to view delivery of health <b>care</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One is finding effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.|$|E

25|$|However, as of 2004, {{according}} to the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association (CHPCA), hospice palliative care was only available to 5-15% of Canadians, with available services having decreased with reduced government funding. At that time, Canadians were increasingly expressing a desire to die at home, but only two of Canada's ten provinces were provided medication cost coverage for care provided at home. Only four of the ten identified palliative <b>care</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> core health service. At that time, palliative care was not widely taught at nursing schools or universally certified at medical colleges; there were only 175 specialized palliative care physicians in all of Canada.|$|E

500|$|One {{focus of}} {{attachment}} {{research has been}} the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences.

Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to provide this, more infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than in the past.|$|E

[...] Despite a series of further raids the castle was strengthened, only to be largely abandoned by the middle of the 17th century.
