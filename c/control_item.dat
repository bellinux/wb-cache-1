The mutualism between the Indo-Pacific cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and its reef fish clients has been a model system to study conflicts of interest and their resolution. These cleaners prefer client mucus over ectoparasites – that is, they prefer to cheat – but punishment and partner switching by clients enforce cooperative behaviour by cleaners. By contrast, clients of Caribbean cleaning gobies (Elacatinus spp.) do not to use punishment or partner switching. Here, we test {{the hypothesis that the}} behavioural differences between these two cleaner fish systems are caused by differences in cleaner foraging preferences.

Furthermore, the disownership items clearly concern disownership, while only one of the <b>control</b> <b>items</b> clearly concerns the possibility of experiencing a supernumerary limb.

30|$|Unlike this {{previous}} research, {{the aim of}} {{the present}} study is to <b>control</b> <b>item</b> difficulty in the automatic question generation task. Automatic question generation has been proven to be able to generate questions with a quality that is comparable to those made by humans (Susanti et al. 2017). Moreover, they cannot be distinguished from human-made questions (Le and Pinkwart 2015; Susanti et al. 2017). Our long-term goal is to integrate automatic question generation into CATs, where the question items are created on the fly before they are presented to test takers. To our knowledge, studies on controlling item difficulty are scarce. Cheng (2010) mentioned that there are four elements of an item in which difficulty may reside: the content to be assessed, the stimulus (the accompanying things that come with the question, e.g. tables or diagrams), the task to be performed, and the expected response. Therefore, he suggested controlling the item difficulty by varying these four elements. Hohensinn and Kubinger (2009) investigated item difficulty control by changing the response format in math items and found that the different response formats measure the same ability but bias the item difficulty.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{knowledge}} {{is known to}} facilitate learning new information. Normally in studies confirming this outcome the relationship between prior knowledge and the topic to be learned is obvious: the information to be acquired {{is part of the}} domain or topic to which the prior knowledge belongs. This raises the question as to whether prior knowledge of various domains facilitates recalling information. In this study 79 eleventh-grade students completed a questionnaire on their prior knowledge of seven different domains related to the bioethical dilemma of prenatal diagnostics. The students read a text containing arguments for and arguments against prenatal diagnostics. After one week and again 12 weeks later they were asked to write down all the arguments they remembered. Prior knowledge helped them recall the arguments one week (r =. 350) and 12 weeks (r =. 316) later. Prior knowledge of three of the seven domains significantly helped them recall the arguments one week later (correlations between r =. 194 to r =. 394). Partial correlations with interest as a <b>control</b> <b>item</b> revealed that interest did not explain the relationship between prior knowledge and recall.

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{examined the}} relearning of words, simple line-drawing pictures, and complex photographic pictures after retention intervals of 1 tb 10 weeks. For those {{items that were}} neither recalled nor recognized, the identical item was relearned better than an unrelated <b>control</b> <b>item,</b> as measured by a recall test following relearning. This relearning advantage in recall held tbr all three classes of material and extended to the cross-modality case (i. e., picture-word and wordpicture) and the same-referent case (i. e., two pictures of the same object). However, recognition tests of relearning failed to detect this same relearning advantage for apparently forgotten items. Taken together, these findings conflict with the existing account of savings. Most fundamental, the classic argument that relearning serves a trace-strengthening function is undermined by the observed recall-recognition contrast. An alternative explanation of savings is suggested wherein relearning assists retrieval of information, thereby affecting recall in particular.
