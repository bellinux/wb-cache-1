500|$|Before a 1994 {{playoff game}} against the Steelers' long-time rival Cleveland Browns, Steelers {{defensive}} tackle Brentson Buckner accidentally dropped a Towel that he was waving during the player introductions. Browns running back Earnest Byner stepped on the Towel yelling, [...] "We don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> towel. We're going to beat you this time." [...] This act [...] "provok other Steelers and Browns to mingle. Not affectionately." [...] The Steelers won the game 299.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> crew, and you really {{feel like you have}} a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E
500|$|The {{canvassing}} {{is largely}} unsuccessful. [...] Most of {{the supporters of}} the park say {{they will not be}} able to attend the meeting. [...] Mark, April and Tom speak with one seemingly interested resident, who is implied to be a pedophile. [...] Leslie becomes frustrated with the lack of success and attempts to push poll the community residents. [...] She suggests phrasing the question, [...] "Wouldn't you rather have a park than a storage facility for nuclear waste?" [...] Tom leaves the canvassing group to call prospective contractors about the park project, hinting at accepting bribes and making corrupt deals. [...] Several residents express a lack of support for the park. [...] Resident Kate Speevak (Lennon Parham) vows to attend the public meeting and voice her disapproval after a frustrated Leslie says, [...] "You don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> kids if you don't support this park". [...] The canvassing ends with an angry Leslie finding Mark and April playing Rock Band with Ann's boyfriend, Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt) at Ann's house.|$|E

500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Force Awakenss first {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Michael Arndt. Early drafts had Luke appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that [...] "every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> main character anymore." [...] Luke became the film's MacGuffin and {{does not appear in}} person until the final scene. Several directors were considered, including David Fincher, Brad Bird, Ben Affleck and Guillermo del Toro; after a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy, J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013, with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.|$|E

Peter once again wrote to his son, who had not answered his parents' phone calls in weeks: [...] "I {{want you to know that}} if you abuse my credit again, I will be forced to file forgery affidavits in order to disclaim liability and that applies to the Citibank college loan if you attempt to reactivate it or use my credit to obtain any other loan." [...] The email concluded: [...] "We may be disappointed with you, but your mother and I still love you and <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Australian foreign {{minister}} Stephen Smith {{issued a statement}} condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated [...] "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against {{the interests of the}} people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [...] was bravely helping to provide." [...] United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the killings, calling them [...] "despicable acts of wanton violence." [...] (see above) Karl Eikenberry, the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan, speaking to Afghan people said, [...] "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [...] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} 1805 to 1806, Beethoven {{composed}} the three Op. 59 quartets on a commission from Count Razumovsky, who played second violin {{in their first}} performance. These quartets, from Beethoven's middle period, were pioneers in the romantic style. Besides introducing many structural and stylistic innovations, these quartets were much more difficult technically to perform – {{so much so that}} they were, and remain, beyond the reach of many amateur string players. When first violinist Ignaz Schuppanzigh complained of their difficulty, Beethoven retorted, [...] "Do you think I <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> wretched violin when the spirit moves me?" [...] Among the difficulties are complex syncopations and cross-rhythms; synchronized runs of sixteenth, thirty-second, and sixty-fourth notes; and sudden modulations requiring special attention to intonation. In addition to the Op. 59 quartets, Beethoven wrote two more quartets during his middle period – Op. 74, the [...] "Harp" [...] quartet, named for the unusual harp-like effect Beethoven creates with pizzicato passages in the first movement, and Op. 95, the [...] "Serioso".|$|E

Salman said, [...] "What are we saying to the young people? We're saying that New Mexico, this Legislature, <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> fellow citizens and (doesn't) want to see them suffer needlessly, subject to Draconian laws." [...] However, the bill did not legalize sale of marijuana. Patients could keep a three-month supply, but would have to grow their own or buy it illegally.|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Anderson {{participated in}} the SBS doco-reality show Go Back To Where You Came From, in which six Australians, each with differing {{opinions}} on Australia's asylum seeker debate, were taken on a journey to which refugees have taken to reach Australia. At {{the outset of the}} series Anderson says that [...] "boat people" [...] who arrive in Australia illegally should be sent back to their countries of origin: [...] "If you come here illegally, I don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> story, first thing you do is you turn around and go back." [...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be. But I don't want them to come to Australia in boats." ...|$|E

The result is that professors and their students adhere rigidly to a limited set of viewpoints, and have little interest in, or understanding of, opposing viewpoints. Once they obtain this intellectual self-satisfaction, persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation are common.|$|R

40|$|Can {{you imagine}} a city that feels, understands, and <b>cares</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> wellbeing? Future cities will reshape human {{behavior}} in countless ways. New strategies and models are required for future urban spaces to properly respond to human activity, environmental conditions, and market dynamics. Persuasive urban systems will {{play an important role}} in making cities more livable and resource-efficient by addressing current environmental challenges and enabling healthier routines. Persuasive cities research aims at improving wellbeing across societies through applications of socio-psychological theories and their integration with conceptually new urban designs. This research presents an ecosystem of future cities, describes three generic groups of people depending on their susceptibility to persuasive technology, explains the process of defining behavior change, and provides tools for social engineering of persuasive cities. Advancing this research is important as it scaffolds scientific knowledge on how to design persuasive cities and refines guidelines for practical applications in achieving their emergence...|$|R
