[...] About thirty four percent of the working population is dedicated to agriculture, livestock, forestry, fishing and hunting. 1,045 hectares of land are dedicated to irrigated farming, with 916 farmed only during the rainy season. The rest, about 70,000 is left wild due to its dryness. Irrigated land is limited to those closest to the Extoráz River and orchards that produce avocados, guavas, <b>cherimoya,</b> peaches, pomegranates, figs, limes, lemons, mangos, oranges, nuts, papayas and more. The most profitable crop is nuts, including pecans and pine nuts, although the amount produced each year can vary. However, there is a total of fifty three products grown with significant harvest. Pine nuts, avocado and Mexican plums are grown at the Maguey Verde, La Higuera, Camargo, Los Encinos, Río Blanco, Agua Fría and Molinitos ejidos.|$|E

50|$|In 1952, Brown {{published}} Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book, {{which has}} become a classic regional American cookbook for its well-written and researched choices, as well as her knowledge {{of a wide variety of}} cuisines and sense of taste. She transformed cookbook writing into a scholarly endeavor giving bibliographic references, historical context and social significance to her recipes. Brown's push for using local, fresh ingredients, regardless of whether they were available in the grocery store, was revolutionary. She recommended the use of items that grew in people's own back yards, like avocados, <b>cherimoyas,</b> figs, guavas, and loquats, as well as seasonings like cilantro and garlic, which until that time was rarely used, and teriyaki sauce. Brown advocated fusion of cultural dishes into American cuisine and the use of fish which was locally caught. Her vision, laid the foundation of what became known as California cuisine. The publication solidified Brown's reputation among her peers as the authority on the west coast food scene of the 1950s and 1960s and she counted among her many friends, Julia Child, Craig Claiborne, M. F. K. Fisher, Helen McCully and Albert Stockli.|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} how the length of {{exposure}} to chilling temperature and atmosphere storage conditions regulate the hydrolytic activity and expression of chitinase (PR-Q) and 1, 3 -β-glucanase (PR- 2) isoenzymes in <b>cherimoyas</b> (Annona cherimola Mill.). Storage at 6 °C modified the expression of constitutive isoenzymes and induced the appearance of novel acidic chitinases, AChi 26 and AChi 24, {{at the onset of}} the storage period, and of a basic chitinase, BChi 33, after prolonged storage. The induction of this basic isoenzyme was concomitant with the accumulation of basic constitutive 1, 3 -β-glucanases. These low-temperature-induced chitinases modified the growth inhibition in vitro of Botrytis cinerea. Short-term high CO 2 treatment activated a coordinated response of acidic chitinases and 1, 3 -β-glucanases after prolonged storage at chilling temperature. Moreover, the high in vitro cryoprotective activity of CO 2 -treated protein extracts was associated with the induction of two low molecular mass isoenzymes, AGlu 19 and BChi 14. Thus, exposure to high concentrations of CO 2 modified the response of fruit to low temperature, inducing the synthesis of cryoprotectant proteins such as specific pathogenesis-related isoenzymes that could be functionally associated with an increase in chilling tolerance in vivo. © 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

40|$|Two cold-induced chitinases were {{isolated}} and purified from the mesocarp <b>cherimoyas</b> (Annona cherimola Mill.) {{and they were}} characterised as acidic endochitinases with a Mr of 24. 79 and 47. 77 kDa (AChi 24 and AChi 48, respectively), both family 19 glycosyl hydrolases. These purified chitinases differed significantly in their biochemical and biophysical properties. While both enzymes had similar optimal acidic pH values, AChi 24 was enzymatically active and stable at alkaline pH values, as well as displaying an optimal temperature of 45 °C and moderate thermostability. Kinetic studies revealed a great catalytic efficiency of AChi 24 for oligomeric and polymeric substrates. Conversely, AChi 48 hydrolysis showed positive co-operativity that was associated to a mixture of different functional oligomeric states through weak transient protein interactions. The rise in the AChi 48 kcat at increasing enzyme concentrations provided evidence of its oligomerisation. AChi 48 chitinase was active and stable in a broad acidic pH range, and while it was relatively labile as temperatures increased, with an optimal temperature of 35 °C, it retained about 50 % of its maximal activity from 5 to 50 °C. Thermodynamic characterisation reflected the high kcat of AChi 48 and the remarkably lower δH‡, δS‡ and δG‡ values at 5 °C compared to AChi 24, indicating that the hydrolytic activity of AChi 48 was less thermodependent. In vitro functional studies revealed that AChi 24 had a strong antifungal defence potential against Botrytis cinerea, whereas they displayed no cryoprotective or antifreeze activity. Hence, based on biochemical, thermodynamic and functional data, this study demonstrates that two acidic endochitinases are induced at low temperatures in a subtropical fruit, {{and that one of}} them acts in an oligomeric cold-adapted manner. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
