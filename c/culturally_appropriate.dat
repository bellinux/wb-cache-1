25|$|West and Central African {{religious}} practices generally manifest themselves in communal ceremonies or divinatory rites in {{which members of}} the community, overcome by force (or ashe, nyama, etc.), are excited {{to the point of}} going into meditative trance in response to rhythmic or mantric drumming or singing. One religious ceremony practiced in Gabon and Cameroon is the Okuyi, practiced by several Bantu ethnic groups. In this state, depending upon the region, drumming or instrumental rhythms played by respected musicians (each of which is unique to a given deity or ancestor), participants embody a deity or ancestor, energy or state of mind by performing distinct ritual movements or dances which further enhance their elevated consciousness. When this trance-like state is witnessed and understood, practitioners are privy to a way of contemplating the pure or symbolic embodiment of a particular mindset or frame of reference. This builds skills at separating the feelings elicited by this mindset from their situational manifestations in daily life. Such separation and subsequent contemplation of the nature and sources of pure energy or feelings serves to help participants manage and accept them when they arise in mundane contexts. This facilitates better control and transformation of these energies into positive, <b>culturally</b> <b>appropriate</b> behavior, thought, and speech. Further, this practice can also give rise to those in these trances uttering words which, when interpreted by a culturally educated initiate or diviner, can provide insight into appropriate directions which the community (or individual) might take in accomplishing its goal.|$|E

500|$|To {{optimise}} women's {{control over}} pregnancy, {{it is essential}} that <b>culturally</b> <b>appropriate</b> contraceptive advice and means are widely, easily, and affordably available to anyone that is sexually active, including adolescents. In {{many parts of the world}} access to contraception and family planning services is very difficult or non existent and even in developed counties cultural and religious traditions can create barriers to access. Reported usage of adequate contraception by women has risen only slightly between 1990 and 2014, with considerable regional variability. Although global usage is around 55%, it may be as low as 25% in Africa. Worldwide 222 million women have no or limited access to contraception. Some caution is needed in interpreting available data, since contraceptive prevalence is often defined as [...] "the percentage of women currently using any method of contraception among all women of reproductive age (i.e., those aged 15 to 49 years, unless otherwise stated) who are married or in a union. The “in-union” group includes women living with their partner in the same household and who are not married according to the marriage laws or customs of a country." [...] This definition is more suited to the more restrictive concept of family planning, but omits the contraceptive needs of all other women and girls who are or are likely to be sexually active, are at risk of pregnancy and are not married or [...] "in-union".|$|E

Since the millennium, music festivals such as Coachella have experienced a resurgence in popularity, giving rise to the style of dress known commonly as ˜festival fashion 2 ̆ 2. Cultural appropriation began occurring at music festivals when attendees began wearing Native American headdresses and other ethnic items of dress as a fashion statement, which has created a tension between members of these ethnic groups and festival attendees.

The project’s objective was to construct an organizational self-assessment tool for Local Public Health Agencies (LPHAs) that offers sound measures of <b>culturally</b> and linguistically <b>appropriate</b> services (CLAS). In this project, the term LPHA is defined as a publicly funded entity (i. e., local health department, local board of health, and other local government organization) responsible for providing essential public health services within a specific jurisdiction. 1 In addition, CLAS are defined as health care services that are respectful of, and responsive to, the specific needs and preferences of racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse populations (OMH 2001). The self-assessment tool and corresponding data collection protocols generated by the project were developed around a conceptual framework of CLAS conceived in a recent OMH-sponsored study which produced a similar tool for collecting data from private-sector health care entities—the National Study of <b>Culturally</b> and Linguistically <b>Appropriate</b> Services in Managed Care Organizations (OMH 2003 b). ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} an Aboriginal caring centre called the Aboriginal Community Elders Services (ACES), and investigates local conceptualizations {{of the need}} for <b>culturally</b> <b>appropriated</b> health {{services}} in an urban setting. The ACES is situated in Melbourne, Australia. The fieldwork was carried out for six months in 2004. The main focus of this thesis is the particular philosophy and healing strategy of the ACES. It also explores Aboriginal health care choices, motivations and legitimation of the centre seen in light of relevant contexts of historical, cultural and political trajectories. During the fieldwork period, the Liberal Federal Government announced a new mainstreaming policy of Aboriginal services. Based on Aboriginal avoidance of mainstream services, this thesis looks at differences between the ACES as a health care system and the western biomedical health care system. In order to understand Aboriginal health care choices, Aboriginal conceptualizations of illness, body and pain are examined. By exploring local rights and needs to health care, this thesis looks at how Aboriginal health discourse concerning physical and emotional pain is articulated. It also looks at how the ACES had (re) constructed an Aboriginal identity which created a sense of unity and empowerment of local Aboriginal people as a group, in order to justify the organizations existence...|$|R
