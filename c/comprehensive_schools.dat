5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} Lord Rothschild's 1971 {{proposal for}} market forces to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should {{not interfere with}} funding. The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although Thatcher was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3,612proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending <b>comprehensive</b> <b>schools</b> consequently rose from 32percent to 62percent.|$|E

League tables published in March 2007 showed grammar schools throughout the country were outperforming comprehensive schools; data published ten years later in 2017 suggested a similar clear division between student attainment in grammar schools compared to <b>comprehensive</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>schools</b> favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15.

He stated: The findings indicate that the Gymnasium help students of all social classes reach their full mathematical potential. Others however, who have reanalized the data, claimed that those attending a Gymnasium were different ab initio and could not properly be compared to those attending a primary school. The data is of high political relevance as those who are in favour of the tripartite system and those who are in favour of <b>comprehensive</b> <b>schools</b> both use it to prove their point.
