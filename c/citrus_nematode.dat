50|$|Tylenchulus semipenetrans (<b>Citrus</b> <b>nematode,</b> Citrus root nematode) is a plant {{pathogenic}} nematode and {{the causal}} agent of slow decline of citrus. T. semipenetrans {{is found in}} most citrus production areas and diverse soil textures worldwide. Their feeding strategy is semi-endoparasitic and has a very narrow host range among commonly grown crops. These nematodes are considered as major plant-parasitic nematode because they can cause 10-30% losses reported on citrus trees. They also parasitize other hosts such as olive, grape, persimmon and lilac. The <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> was first discovered in California in 1913 by J.R. Hodges and was later described and named by Nathan Cobb that year.|$|E
50|$|T. semipenetrans is {{the only}} species of Tylenchulidae that are {{economically}} important to agriculture. <b>Citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> range from 0.25-0.35 mm long. They have an amalgamated procorpus and metacorpus, distinct isthmus, and a bulb-shaped postcorpus. They are distinct in juveniles. Both the juvenile stages and the adult male stage are vermiform in shape. The male has significantly reduced esophagus and stylet. The posterior end of the female <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> becomes swollen upon feeding. She contains a single ovary and the vulva is subterminal. The female will lay up to 100 eggs deposited in a gelatinous matrix secreted from the nearby excretory pore. The pore is surrounded by small, irregularly shaped lobes; and the excretory duct is directed forward. The rectum and anus are atrophied or absent; non-functional.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the female <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> is 6-8 weeks long, whereas the male <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> only lives for about 7-10 days. These {{nematodes}} reproduce by amphiximis and parthenogenesis. The first-stage juvenile (J1) undergo one molt while still in the egg. The J1 has no stylet. The second-stage juveniles (J2) hatch from the eggs and the sex can be distinguished at this stage. The J2 male is short and fat. Juveniles will undergo two more molts into the J3 and J4 before becoming young adults. The citrus male nematodes are required for reproduction with females when their posterior end is exposed on the root surface. The J2 male has a stylet while the J3 and J4 have a weaker stylet. The J2 female is longer and thinner than males {{and they do not}} molt until feeding site is established. The female juveniles begin feeding ectoparasitically on epidermal root cells. It is not until the female <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> becomes a young adult that she becomes the infective stage. The anterior end of the young female penetrates into the cortex of the root and begins feeding on 3-6 nurse cells. This intense feeding by the adult female will cause the posterior end to enlarge outside the root and start producing eggs. After fertilization, the female lays its eggs outside of the root in a gelatinous matrix extruded from excretory pore located near the vulva.|$|E

Results showed that root-knot nematodes, cereal cyst-nematodes and <b>citrus</b> <b>nematodes</b> were most prevalent and damaging nematodes to plants in the Kingdom. These nematodes cause a high loss and reduction in agricultural production. Therefore, the study suggests that integrated pest management (I. P.

5000|$|Management {{practices}} {{consist of}} exclusion, preventive measures, and post-planting nematicide applications. All growers should avoid contaminated nursery rootstocks and use certified nematode-free soil and nematode-free rootstock (it is obligatory in some areas). Nematodes {{can easily be}} removed from seedlings by dipping the roots in 45 C water for 25 min, this kills the nematodes but does not harm the plant. For cultural practices, the container-grown citrus can be treated with steam and soil solarization. Fumigation and nematicides are used to reduced initial population densities. Halogenated hydro-carbons ( [...] MBr,1-3-D and chloropicin) are the most effective. Resistant rootstocks are available and this management strategy is the most useful to suppress nematode population density. Recently, the hybrid rootstock called Swingle citrumelo (Citrus paradisi x P. trifoliata) is highly resistant to the <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode.</b>|$|E
40|$|Foliar {{sprays of}} 4 μg/ml oxamyl on sweet orange trees in a {{greenhouse}} slightly depressed {{the number of}} Tylenchulus semipenetrans larvae obtained from roots and soil, but similar treatments were not effective in two orchards. Soil drench treatments decreased the number of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> larvae obtained from roots or soil of citrus plants grown itt a greenhouse and in orchards. Exposure to 5 - 10 μg/ml of oxamyl in water was lethal to only a few second-stage larvae treated 10 days, and many second-stage larvae in 2. 0 μg/ml oxamyl recovered motility when transferred to fresh water. Aqueous solutions of 50 and 100 μg/ml of oxamyl were toxic to <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> larvae. Additional observations indicate that oxamyl interfered with hatch of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> larvae and was nematistatic and/or protected sweet orange roots from infection. Oxamyl degraded at different rates in two soils. The number of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> larvae that infected and developed on sweet orange roots was increased by an undetermined product of the degradation of oxamyl in soil, water, and possibly within plants. This product apparently was translocated in roots...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} greenhouse {{and laboratory}} studies, citrus seedlings infested with the <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> Tylenchulus semipenetrans and later inoculated with the fungus Phylophthora nicotianae grew larger and contained less fungal protein in root tissues than plants infected by only the fungus, demonstrating antagonism of the nematode to the fungus. In this study, we determined whether eggs of the <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> T. semipenetrans and root-knot nematode Meloidogyne arenaria affected mycelial growth of P. nicotianae and Fusarium solani in vitro. Approximately 35, 000 live or heat-killed (60 °C, 10 minutes) eggs of each nematode species were surface-sterilized with cupric sulfate, mercuric chloride, and streptomycin sulfate {{and placed in}} 5 -pl drops onto the center of nutrient agar plates. Nutrient agar plugs from actively growing colonies of P. nicotianae or F. solani were placed {{on top of the}} eggs for 48 hours after which fungal colony growth was determined. Live <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> eggs suppressed mycelial growth of P. nicotianae and F. solani (P ≤ 0. 05) compared to heat-killed eggs and water controls. Reaction of the fungi to heat-killed eggs was variable. Root-knot nematode eggs had no effect on either P. nicotianae or F. solani mycelial growth. The experiment demonstrated a species-specific, direct effect of the eggs of the <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> on P, nicotianae and F. solani...|$|E
40|$|In {{laboratory}} testing, egg hatch of Tylenchulus semipenetrans was stimulated at {{concentrations of}} 1 and 10 μg/ml aldicarb solution and inhibited at 50 and 100 μg/ml. Aldicarb was more inhibitory to egg hatch than the aldicarb sulfoxide and the aldicarb sulfone. Inhibition of hatch {{at the high}} concentration was associated with delays in the molting processes, lack of larval movement within the egg, and delays in embryonic development. Nematode motility was reduced at 10, 50, and 100 μg/ml of aldicarb and aldicarb sulfoxide solution, and at 50 and 100 μg/ml aldicarb sulfone. Male development was retarded at 10 μg/nrl and almost completely inhibited at 50 and 100 μg/ml of the three chemicals. In greenhouse tests, female development antl reproduction on roots of citrus seedlings were suppressed by aldicarb at rates of 2. 6 μg/ml and completely inhibited at 10. 6 μg/ml of soil solution during a 50 -day experimental period. Under field conditions, there was little systemic movement of aldicarb into roots located outside treated areas. Aldicarb reduced the nematode larvae and the female adult population {{in the second year}} after the second treatment. There were no differences in egg hatch and sex ratio of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematodes</b> between treated and nontreated roots...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} soil-chemical {{processes}} which affect the fate and transport of fumigants in agricultural soils. Generally, three factors must be controlled {{to reduce emissions}} while Maintaining adequate efficacy: containment, degradation and soil-gas distribution. Probably the most reliable method {{to reduce the amount}} of methyl bromide (MeBr) leaving the treated soil involves the use of virtually-impermeable plastic films. To demonstrate this, a recent field experiment was conducted using the traditional high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and a virtually-impermeable film (VIF), Hytibar (Klerks Plastic, Belgium), to cover triplicated field plots treated with MeBr at a rate of 280, 210 or 140 kg/ha. At the beginning of the experiment, 2 bags containing <b>citrus</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Tylenchulus semipenetrans), Yellow Nutsedge seeds (Cyperus esculentus) and fungi (Rhizoctonia solani) were placed 10 - 15 cm deep in each plot to determine the effectiveness of the fumigation. During the course of the experiment, the volatilization rate was continuously measured over 3 hour intervals using two or more flux chambers. After the experiment, soil bromide concentration was measured to provide information for a mass balance. It was found that MeBr emissions were reduced from approximately 60 % using current practices to less than 5 % when VIF together with an 210 kg/ha application rate and a 10 -day cover period were used. VIF offer several advantages f 6 known in advance and films are more uniform in space and time compared to soil-based methods...|$|R
40|$|Biology of Fictor composticola {{has been}} studied on Aphelenchus avenae in vitro. It reproduces by amphimixis, {{embryonic}} development is completed in 24 - 27 h and life cycle in 3 - 4 days. Fusion of sperm and egg pronuclei occurs in the uteri. Pulsation of median oesophageal bulb and pressing of lips against egg shell is seen just prior to hatching but teeth seem to play no role in this process. No moulting occurs inside the egg shell and the first stage juvenile hatches out. Female and male undergo mating upon addition {{of water in the}} culture plates and continue to swim in copula for a considerable time. A female lays 1. 6 - 4. 0 eggs in 24 h while feeding upon A. radicicolus. Predation and reproduction is affected by the temperature and 25 - 35 °C is the optimum range for these phenomena. Process of feeding as recorded with a CCTV attached to a compound microscope is described. F. composticola engulfs small preys; sucks the intestinal contents while holding them or cuts the body wall of large-sized preys and then feeds on prolapsed organs. Two sexes differ in their efficiencies of predation, a female on an average kills 53 A. avenae as compared to 11 by a male in 24 h. F. composticola feeds and reproduces on mycophagous nematodes and juveniles of root- knot, cyst and <b>citrus</b> <b>nematodes</b> but does not prey upon adult nematodes having coarsely annulated cuticle. Cannibalism in this species is also observed. F. composticola and Seinura paratenuicaudata prey upon each other.

Three field trials and a greenhouse study utilizing the nematodes at population ratés of one and two billion juveniles per acre were each unsuccessful in reducing the nematode or insect pest. Poor viability and survival were attributed to the negative results in each of the investigations. The microbial nematicide, DiTera, which was included in two limited trials, was found to be highly effective in suppression of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> populations infecting Yuma citrus.

40|$|The {{infectivity}} {{and development}} of two biotypes of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> (Tylenchulus semipenetrans) were compared on highly resistant Poncirus trifoliata selection 'Pomeroy,' moderately susceptible 'Troyer' citrange, and highly susceptible sweet orange selection 'Homosassa' small seedlings in a glasshouse. Biotype- 1 was more infective on the above hosts and developed faster on sweet orange and on 'Troyer' citrange than Biotype- 2. The differences in infectivity were interpreted to reflect differences {{in the ability of}} the nematodes to penetrate the epidermis and hypodermis and become established in host roots. Poncirus selections 'Pomeroy,' 'Webber-Fawcett,' and 'Rubidoux' seedlings were highly resistant to the <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> in California, but seedlings of 'Pomeroy' and 'Rubidoux' were only moderately resistant in Japan.

40|$|Burrowing {{nematodes}} from Central America, Dominican Republic, Florida, Guadeloupe, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico {{were characterized}} {{for their ability}} to parasitize citrus, but citrus parasites were found only in Florida. Sequence tag sites originally amplified from a citrus-parasitic burrowing nematode were polymorphic among 37 burrowing nematode isolates and were not correlated with <b>citrus</b> parasitism, <b>nematode</b> isolate collection site, or amplification of a 2. 4 -kb sequence tag site (DK# 1). Results of a RAPD analysis and characterization of the isozymes phosphoglucose isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase indicated that the burrowing nematode isolates were highly similar. Citrus parasitism in Florida appears to be associated with limited changes in the burrowing nematode genome. Findings did not substantiate a previous report that R. citrophilus was present in Hawaii.

40|$|In {{two studies}} to {{estimate}} sampling requirements for entomogenous nematodes in the field, highest persistence of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora after application occurred beneath the canopies of mature <b>citrus</b> trees. <b>Nematode</b> persistence declined with {{distance from the}} center-line of the tree row toward the row-middles. Immediately after nematode application to soil, 32 samples (15 cm deep, 2. 5 -cm diameter) beneath a single tree were required to derive 95 % confidence intervals that were within 40 % of mean nematode population density. The estimated probability of measuring the mean density within 40 %, using 32 samples, declined to 88 % at 2 days post-application and to 76 % at 7 days. The persistence in soil of Steinernema carpocapsae, S. riobravis, and two formulations containing H. bacteriophora and their efficacy against the larvae of Diaprepes abbreviatus were compared in a grove of 4 -year-old citrus trees.

Salinity treatments were initiated by watering daily with 25 mol/m³ NaCl + 3. 3 mol/m³ CaCl₂ for 3 days {{and every other}} day with 50 mol/m³ NaC 1 + 6. 6 mol/m³ CaC 1 ₂ for one week, with no salt (NS) treatments as controls. Salinity was discontinued in one treatment (DS) by leaching with tap water prior to inoculation with nematodes, whereas the continuous salinity (CS) treatment remained unchanged. Overall, in Rangpur lime organic soil supported the highest population densities of T. semipenetrans, followed by loamy sand and sand. The DS treatment resulted in the highest (P ≤ 0. 05) mean population densities of T. semipenetrans in the three soil types. Similarly, the DS treatment in Sweet lime resulted in the highest (P ≤ 0. 05) nematode populations. The DS treatment predisposed <b>citrus</b> to <b>nematode</b> infection through accumulated salt stress, whereas leaching soluble salt in soil solution offered nematodes a suitable nonosmotic habitat.

40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that Tylenchulus semipenetrans infection reduced concentrations of inorganic osmolytes, (Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺), in roots, along with leaf K⁺ in citrus. However, infection increased leaf Na⁺ and Cl⁻, along with carbohydrates in roots. Pruning of roots also increased carbohydrates in intact roots, whereas shoot pruning increased carbohydrates in shoots. Carbohydrates are translocated as reducing sugars, which collectively form organic osmolytes. Because changes in concentrations of osmolytes regulate osmotic potential in plant cells, we hypothesize that increasing concentrations of organic osmolytes in an organ displaces inorganic osmolytes. We measured the osmotic potentials of young <b>citrus</b> trees under <b>nematode</b> infection, stem girdling, and root pruning at two salinity levels. All treatments reduced leaf osmotic potentials at four sampling times. At harvest, 16 days after pruning and girdling treatments, organs with higher carbohydrates had lower inorganic osmolytes and vice versa, {{regardless of the}} treatment. Pruning simulated effects of nematode infection, whereas girdling reduced the effects of nematodes. Results suggested that high organic osmolytes in roots displace inorganic osmolytes, thereby avoiding very low osmotic potentials...|$|R

50|$|Control {{of plant}} {{diseases}} {{is crucial to}} the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs. Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts (see Irish potato famine, chestnut blight), as well as recurrent severe plant diseases (see rice blast, soybean cyst <b>nematode,</b> <b>citrus</b> canker). However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as crop rotation, use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and pesticide use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings. Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and spectroscopy and biophotonics that are able to diagnostic plant health and metabolism.|$|R

However, the first observations on plant parasitic nematodes were made from the second half of 1800 to early 1900. They refer to Anguina tritici in wheat kernels (1867), Meloidogyne spp. (1875 - 1904) on several host plants, Ditylenchus dipsaci (1897) in oats. The sugar beet cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, was reported in 1931 and the <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode,</b> Tylenchulus semipenetrans, in 1940. The turning point in Italian plant nematology occurred during 1950 - 1970, when investigations and control trials started on Xiphinema index, the natural vector of the Grape fan leaf virus. In the same period, the Phytosanitary Service of Pescara addressed much of his efforts on plant parasitic nematodes and the Section of Nematology i...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{aspects of}} the laelapid mite Cosmolaelaps simplex (Fox) was studied {{for the first time}} after feeding on one acarid mite species Caloglyphus rodriguezi Samsinak and egg masses of two plant {{parasitic}} nematodes Meloidogyne javanica Treub and Tylenchulus semipenetrans (Cobb) at 26 °C. Also, the effect of adding of mite individuals or aldicarb to citrus seedlings infected with citrus nematodes T. semipenetrans was investigated under greenhouse conditions. The laelapid mite successfully completed its life span feeding on the previous preys. The developmental time of C. simplex averaged 8. 4, 8. 8 and 10. 6 days for male immatures and averaged 10. 3, 12. 6 and 13. 9 days for females when they were fed on acarid mites and egg masses of both M. javanica and T. semipenetrans at 26 °C, respectively. Larvae didn’t feed and the mite passed through two nymphal stages before adulthood. Males had a shorter life span than females where they lasted for an average of 37. 6, 42. 0 and 44. 9 days for males and 45. 7, 45. 9 and 48. 6 days for females after feeding on the same previous food sources, respectively. Arrhenotoky parthenogenesis was observed where un-mated females put eggs that gave males. Egg production was higher when C. simplex fed on the acarid mites where the net reproductive rate (Ro) was 20. 46, while it decreased to 13. 62 and 13. 10 after feeding on egg masses of root-knot and citrus nematodes, respectively. The predatory mite had a mean generation time (T) of 22. 24, 21. 07 and 20. 22, while the net rate of natural increase (r m) was 0. 135, 0. 123 and 0. 127 after feeding on the aforementioned preys, respectively. Enhanced citrus seedlings growth were achieved when citrus seedlings were treated with the nematicide aldicarb and followed by those treated with mite individuals added at the same time of nematode inoculation. Compared to the nematode-alone control, all mite treatments and aldicarb significantly restricted reproduction of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode.</b> Nematode populations ranged from 1386 to 1665 J 2 / 100 cm 3 soil for the mite-treated plants compared to 4011 J 2 / 100 cm 3 soil for the nematode untreated control. Moreover, the predatory mite C. simplex showed a preferable response to the acarid mites but it also significantly reduced <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> T. semipenetrans populations under greenhouse conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{granular}} {{formulation of}} a chelate of metham-zinc (CMZ) which liberates the biocidal methyl isothiocyanate was tested for nematicidal activity on Tylenchulus semipenetrans {{in a jar}} soil screening and on Meloidogyne javanica (greenhouse test) and M. incognita (field test) infecting tomato. Comparisons were made with 1, 3 -D in the jar and pot experiments. The CMZ caused only 3. 9 % mortality of <b>citrus</b> <b>nematode</b> juveniles at 1. 0 μg a. i. /g soil, but 95. 4 % mortality at 10. 0 μg a. i. /g and 100. 0 % at 100. 0 μg a. i. /g. CMZ at 10. 0 and 100. 0 μg a. i. /g significantly reduced tomato root infections by M. javanica in the pot test relative to the untreated control. In the field test, CMZ (11. 5 g a. i. /m² calibration rate) reduced M. incognita populations in the zone of incorporation but not below it, thus failing to provide season-long control for tomato. This material has good nematicidal activity at 10 μg a. i. /g or more, but its effectiveness in the field may be limited by its lack of movement...|$|E
