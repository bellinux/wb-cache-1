2500|$|On December 19, 2006, GoDaddy {{received}} {{a third party}} complaint of invalid domain contact information in the WHOIS database for the domain FamilyAlbum.com. GoDaddy {{wrote a letter to}} the owner of FamilyAlbum.com saying, [...] "Whenever we receive a complaint, we are required by ICANN regulations to initiate an investigation as to whether the <b>contact</b> <b>data</b> displaying in the WHOIS database is valid data or not... On 12/19/2006 we sent a notice to you at the admin/tech contact email address and the account email address informing you of invalid data in breach of the domain registration agreement and advising you to update the information or risk cancellation of the domain. The contact information was not updated within the specified period of time and we canceled the domain." [...] The editor of [...] "Domain Name Wire" [...] said that since domain names are valuable it was reasonable to expect that the registrar would try to contact the domain owner by phone or postal mail. On February 28, 2007, GoDaddy offered to get the domain name back for the previous owner if he would indemnify GoDaddy from legal action by the new registrant. GoDaddy stated that the new owner paid $18.99 for the domain, the price of a backorder, not a regular registration. On November 2, 2007, Domain Name Wire reported that it appears that GoDaddy no longer cancels domains for invalid WHOIS. The editor on Domain Name Wire {{received a}} message from a reader who is trying to acquire a domain with obviously false WHOIS information. The message from GoDaddy said, [...] "The domain has been suspended due to invalid WHOIS. The domain will remain in suspension through expiration, including the registry's redemption period, unless the owner updates the contact information before that time." ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Contact</b> tracing <b>data</b> {{collected}} from disease outbreaks has received relatively little {{attention in the}} epidemic modelling literature because it {{is thought to be}} un-reliable: infection sources might be wrongly attributed, or data might be missing due to resource contraints in the questionnaire exercise. Nevertheless, these data might provide a rich source of information on disease transmission rate. This paper presents novel methodology for combining <b>contact</b> tracing <b>data</b> with rate-based con-tact network data to improve posterior precision, and therefore predictive accuracy. We present an advancement in Bayesian inference for epidemics that assimilates these data, and is robust to partial contact tracing.
