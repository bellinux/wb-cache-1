5000|$|The Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (<b>CIP)</b> {{sequence}} <b>rules,</b> {{named for}} organic chemists R.S. Cahn, C.K. Ingold, and V. Prelog—alternatively termed the <b>CIP</b> priority <b>rules,</b> system, or conventions—are a standard process used in organic chemistry to completely and unequivocally name a stereoisomer of a molecule. The {{purpose of the}} CIP system is to assign an R or S descriptor to each stereocenter and an E or Z descriptor to each double bond so that {{the configuration of the}} entire molecule can be specified uniquely by including the descriptors in its systematic name. A molecule may contain any number of stereocenters and any number of double bonds, and each usually gives rise to two possible isomers. A molecule with an integer [...] describing the number of its stereogenic centers will usually have [...] stereoisomers, [...] diastereomers each having an associated pair of enantiomers. The <b>CIP</b> sequence <b>rules</b> contribute to the precise naming of every stereoisomer of every organic and organometallic molecule with all atoms of ligancy of fewer than 4 (but including ligancy of 6 as well, this term referring to the [...] "number of neighboring atoms" [...] bonded to a center).|$|R

50|$|The R / S {{system is}} an {{important}} nomenclature system for denoting enantiomers.

If the center is oriented so that the lowest-priority of the four is pointed away from a viewer, the viewer will then see two possibilities: If the priority of the remaining three substituents decreases in clockwise direction, it is labeled R (for , Latin for right), if it decreases in counterclockwise direction, it is S (for , Latin for left).|$|R

An axiomatic characterization of F l in that general setting is provided and contrasted with previously known characterizations which only work in more specialized (e. g. distributive) lattices, {{and are therefore}} confined to collective identification problems with exoge-nously fixed labels.
