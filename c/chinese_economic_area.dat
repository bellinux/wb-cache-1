40|$|This study tests whether {{contagion}} efects exist, {{during the}} “Asian flu”, between the stock markets of Thailand and the <b>Chinese</b> <b>economic</b> <b>area</b> (CEA), including China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The time points of structural breaks in stock return volatility are detected first, {{based on the}} iterated cumulative sums of squares (ICSS) algorithm developed by Inclán and Tiao (1994), to identify the crisis period and to add dummies to avoid the overestimation of volatility. Then, time-varying correlation coefficients are estimated by the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) multivariate GARCH model of Engle (2002). In order to recognize the contagion effect, we test whether {{the mean of the}} DCC coefficients in post-crisis period differs from that in the pre-crisis stable period. Empirical findings show that the stock markets displayed {{a significant increase in the}} means of correlation coefficients across markets between the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods. This proves the existence of contagion between the studied markets...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} 2000 to 2003, global FDI {{declined}} by 60 percent. Investment in the ASEAN- 5 also fell while investment in China surged, {{causing it to}} become the world's biggest host country of foreign direct investment (FDI). These trends have significant implications for the countries concerned as FDI is understood {{to be a major}} force for growth and development, an agent for the spread of capital, technology and management skills and supports the upgrading of competitiveness of host countries. In addition to China's large market size and high growth rate, a range of environmental factors have been identified that will also assist in explaining these trends. These factors include China's entry into the World Trade Organisation, economic integration of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Area,</b> the Asian economic crisis and changing patterns of costs and government incentives across Asia. This study reports the influence of these environmental factors on the strategic decision-making process of multinational corporations (MNCs) that have restructured their subsidiaries in Malaysia as part of their production strategy in East Asia, which now includes significant operations in China. This paper will show that MNCs are not simply transferring production from Southeast Asia to China, but rather a more sophisticated segmentation of global production is taking place in East Asia...|$|E

Capital investment contributed significantly to the growth of the Chinese industrial sector, but not to the agricultural sector. The results also suggest that foreign trade has made a significant contribution to <b>Chinese</b> <b>economic</b> development.

40|$|The {{revival of}} {{regional}} {{integration in the}} European Community (EC) in the early 1980 s has brought about profound implications {{for the development of}} regional integration and its related theory. Firstly, European industry searching to promote its competitiveness highlighted the need for a "European-level" solution to European economic decline and contributions to the relaunching of European integration. Secondly, {{as a result of the}} renewed momentum for regional integration, external factors which were neglected by previous efforts in theory-exploration, have become more noticeable in the process of regional integration. The purpose of this thesis about external factors is to analyse to what extent the progress of regional integration is driven by the private sector. The relaunching of European integration which brought about the successful  passage of the Single European Act has demonstrated the crucial contribution of the business community to  accelerating  the progress of integration. This thesis further offers an analysis of the proposition that the impact of external factors on industrial development is the key to understanding the process of creating the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> (CEA). It explores the argument  that instead of being motivated by political factors, the process of regional integration is primarily stimulated by  industrial development in the private sector. It concludes by suggesting a new focus for the study of regional  integration - the "external incentives-industrial development" approach, and comparative insights into the EC and  the CEA...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of foreign subsidiaries and local companies, each playing {{a significant role}} in the local economy is a typical phenomenon in the business environment of emerging economies. The objective of this study is to extend the research concerning the relationship between environmental factors and error occurrence by examining the impact of organizational ownership (foreign subsidiaries in Hong Kong vs. local Chinese companies) on error characteristics. The second objective of this study is to examine the empirical characteristics of errors in an emerging economy, Hong Kong, with references to relevant U. S. studies. Hong Kong is part of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Area,</b> a Big Emerging Market identified by the U. S. Department of Commerce. In the past two decades, while there have been numerous empirical studies on error characteristics for U. S. audit data, there is a scarcity of such studies using non-U. S. data. Due to differences in organizational culture, nature of business transactions as well as accounting practices, the error characteristics detected in audit populations in emerging economies may be significantly different from those discovered in the U. S. Results of this study should facilitate audit efficiency and effectiveness through improved audit risk assessment for each ownership type company and should also alert management of multinational corporations to incorporate the potential differences in error patterns in designing and implementing effective accounting controls for companies outside the U. S...|$|E
40|$|The Europeans regard {{monetary}} arrangements as a {{key element}} of the overwhelming effort to never again allow hostilities to flare up on their continent. For Taiwan and China, a monetary coordination mechanism may also be appealing in order to eliminate hostilities caused by the Chinese civil war since 1949. Due to certain historical and geopolitical reasons, the impact of a China-Taiwan Economic Union on the world can not be measured by its economic scale only. On the basis of Robert Mundell's earlier proposal and the current development of the European Monetary Union, this paper provides a framework to analyze whether the establishment of a Chinese monetary union (CMU) could be sustained after suffering various economic shocks. We assume that a Chinese central bank coordinates the single monetary policy of the <b>Chinese</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Area</b> and that China and Taiwan maintain their fiscal independence. An international policy coordination approach is used to simulate possible outcomes if the CMU were to be implemented. The simulation indicates that the U. S. and Japan may suffer welfare losses if China and Taiwan insist on their monetary unification. However, if both the U. S. and Japan accept the CMU, further international policy coordination may help them decrease such kind of losses. The analysis is preliminary but may be helpful in considering the East Asian economic policies. ...|$|E

40|$|This work proposes and {{explains}} a political-economic concept, defined {{here as the}} neoliberal-dirigiste continuum, which offers {{an explanation of the}} manner in which Chinese capital and Chinese State Capitalism have been invested and received in different ways across the distinct geographies and countries in Latin America over the last three decades. While bilateral trade is one measure used to gauge the attractiveness of the Chinese state capitalist model in targeted Latin American economies, foreign direct investment (FDI) and <b>economic</b> aid/assistance by <b>Chinese</b> firms and Chinese government actors are other mechanisms through which <b>Chinese</b> <b>economic</b> engagement in the region can be assessed. This dissertation employs a mixed-methods approach to developing a <b>Chinese</b> <b>economic</b> engagement framework given particular and distinct Latin American foreign policies. The geographic variation of the success of recent <b>Chinese</b> <b>economic</b> activity (particularly foreign investment) in nine targeted Latin American economies (Colombia, Chile, Peru, México, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia and Venezuela) is examined in order to understand <b>Chinese</b> <b>economic</b> actors' engagement in the region compared with that of European and US economic actors...|$|R
