50|$|With later {{developments}} in psychometric theory, {{it has become}} possible to employ direct methods of scaling such as application of the Rasch model or unfolding models such as the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (HCM) (Andrich & Luo, 1993). The Rasch model has a close <b>conceptual</b> <b>relationship</b> to Thurstone's law of comparative judgment (Andrich, 1978), the principal difference being that it directly incorporates a person parameter.

[...] She had explained ethnocentricity {{as a form of}} sociocentricity, since, on her view, sociocentrism refers to all forms of group pathologies in thought, and therefore goes beyond those pathologies that arise out of ethnicity. Her work has been influenced by the writings of Peter Singer, Jane Goodall, and Roger Fouts.

5000|$|In a 1979 {{review of}} Gold's work, Donald Kuspit {{explains}} the <b>conceptual</b> <b>relationship</b> between {{painting and sculpture}} that comes out through Gold's work: [...] "Gold's differentiation of the phenomenal field of the paint by a cruciform--the form becomes {{a means by which}} the field decisively announces its power of individuation--introduces a profound relief into the paintings, and also heralds their critical relation to sculpture. Indeed, when I first saw them I thought of them as impacted reliefs, because they were sufficiently raised from the wall to function as reliefs yet not sufficiently removed from it to become theatrical, or even illustrative of the wall. The model of differentiated form emerging from undifferentiated flux--simply of a frame emerging from the unframed--which the relief offers, seems to me a more primordial image of sculpture than Pincus-Witten's vertical/horizontal, figure/earth crossing. The crossing can be displayed only after the primary relief has been established: it becomes the differentiation of the freshly undifferentiated surface the frame contains. In any case, this critical relation to sculpture--reinforced by the fact that Gold's canvas is backed by [...] "wall-like plywood panels" [...] (another touch of felt invisibility, of subliminally articulate negative presence)--adds a fresh element of conceptual tension to the perceptual tensions already noted. Both perceptual and conceptual tension are registered {{in the fact that the}} crossings of the cruciform—or rather, in some cases, the implied crossings—are handled in such a way that they become a kind of relief sculpture." ...|$|E

40|$|Universities {{have long}} been {{recognised}} as avenues for teaching and learning, research and discovery, as well as providers of services to the society {{through the application of}} knowledge. To strive for academic excellence, it is imperative for public universities to become a learning organization (LO). This can be done by integrating the <b>conceptual</b> <b>relationship</b> between learning organization and knowledge management process (KMP) to enhance the academic excellence of the public universities. Hence, this paper attempts to develop an empirical research model which examines the relationship between learning organisation and knowledge management process of tacit knowledge in a public university in Malaysia. The objective of this research project is to empirically investigate the <b>conceptual</b> <b>relationship</b> between the seven dimensions of the LO and the transfer process of tacit knowledge through knowledge management (KM) concept. A survey questionnaire was employed as the main instrument to collect data from the academicians in this university. The empirical findings of this study provide an initial step forward in identifying the significant <b>conceptual</b> <b>relationship</b> between the relevant dimensions of a learning organisation and the effective knowledge management process of tacit knowledge which can drive the future value for academic excellence of a public university...|$|E
