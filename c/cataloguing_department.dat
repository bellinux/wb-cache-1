50|$|Samuel Ayscough {{was born}} in 1745, and was educated at the free grammar school in Nottingham. The son {{assisted}} his father in the successive failures of business, speculations and farm. At last, when complete ruin confronted the family, Samuel hired himself {{to take care of}} a mill in the neighbourhood, and bravely laboured as a working miller to keep his father and sister. The new start in life proved unsuccessful, but an old schoolfellow and intimate friend of early life, Mr. Eamer (afterwards Sir John Eamer, lord mayor of London), hearing of his distress, about the year 1770 sent for him to come to town, clothed him, and procured for him a situation as overlooker of street-paviors. It was doubtless this employment which gave him the capacity for such rude labour as index-making. Soon afterwards he entered the shop of Mr. Rivington, bookseller, of St. Paul's Churchyard, and subsequently obtained an engagement at a very modest salary as assistant in the <b>cataloguing</b> <b>department</b> under the principal librarian of the British Museum. This was the turning-point of his laborious and useful career. His value was soon recognised by a small increase in his weekly stipend, and he was able to occupy some of his leisure in arranging private libraries. These additions to his income, added to some assistance from Mr. Eamer, enabled him to send for his father, whom he maintained in comfort till his death, in November 1783.|$|E

Generally characterizes the types of subject retrieval languages and traditional indexing languages with emphasis on those used in the National Library. The third section concerns principles of subject access at NL with emphasis on users' accessibility. It describes new projects, which should facilitate access to provided information. Primarily it mentions authority files, conspectus, UDC. This chapter is followed by specific examples of cataloging in MARC 21 and the importance of each step for final information retrieval.

A case study approach was adopted, {{with the aim of}} getting detailed information and insights into the experienced problem of inconsistencies and duplication of the data. Structured questionnaires and interview guides were used to collect data. The results show that there is little knowledge sharing and transfer amongst the cataloguers; use of existing rules or standards such as Anglo American Cataloguing Rules and Library of Congress Cataloguing Schedules with its Subject Headings is compromised by the poor grounding of Cataloguers. The study indicates that there is no system in place to manage tacit knowledge; lack of proper training and skills in cataloguing and; not being able to seek help from colleagues; lack the ability of verifying the existence of materials in the database before working on them and simply human error. There is little systematic knowledge sharing and transfer of knowledge among cataloguers. Although there is use of existing standards; this is compromised by lack of knowledge of cataloguing.

The so-called information explosion leads to certain manpower issues in the library and information profession. The question arises whether married women with family obligations {{can contribute to the}} alleviation of library and information workforce problems? Can other librarians, e. g. post graduate students or librarians reaching retirement age, contribute to the library and information profession on a basis other than that which is traditionally accepted (i. e. working approximately forty hours per week in a library?) To what extent does the university library use this potential workforce? What are the career opportunities for this latent workforce? The following non-traditional career patterns were included in this study: part-time work, flex(i) time, dual appointments, free-lance information brokers. job sharing, librarianship, staff rotation, consultants and Following a literature survey a questionnaire was sent to 22 South African University Librarians. Another questionnaire was sent to 122 non-traditional library and information professionals at nine university libraries. Although the study was limited to only a few university libraries, {{it was found that the}} current non-traditional university library workforce consists mainly of part-time employees. The majority are female, married, Afrikaans-speaking, have children at school and have stopped working full-time because of family obligations. The largest percentage (25 %) of the respondents are between the ages of 36 and 40 years.

40|$|Our library {{literature}} {{is replete with}} statements that indicate that the goals and functions of the public library are vitally concerned with the interests and needs of people in general. In fact our most recent statement, as found in Public Library Service says in part: the library's function "is to assemble, preserve, and make easily available to all people the printed and other materials that will assist them to: Educate themselves continuously Keep pace with progress in all fields of knowledge Become better members of home and community Discharge political and social obligations Be more capable in their daily occupations Develop their creative and spiritual capacities Appreciate and enjoy works of art and literature. " 1 Are classifiers and catalogers concerned with pronouncements such as these? Or has it been assumed that a shelf arrangement which stems from a classification which is a systematization of knowledge and originally was aimed at a service for scholars and specialists can logically be used by another service in libraries whose purpose is primarily planned to provide the popular education services for the general reader? The well-established classification and <b>catalogue</b> <b>departments</b> in large libraries make it seem efficient to class a book for a large main library collection or {{for a series of}} special departments, and then apply this same classification number for the book in branch libraries. This appears to be the quick and cheap way to do it. In the smaller independent libraries the suggestions for class numbers made by the H. W. Wilson Company, the A. L. A.

Whilst e. g. <b>catalogues</b> for <b>department</b> stores or phone books are typical representatives of CS covering a relatively clearly outlined information spectrum (address, phone number, article no., price etc.), other systems cover a quite larger spectrum. Examples for this are environmental MIS such as the UDK (German: Umweltdatenkatalog, engl. : environmental data catalogue, see Swoboda et al., 1999) on a national basis or GELOS (Global Environment Information Locator Service, see GELOS, 2000 and ETC/CDS, 1999) and EIONET (European Environment Information and Observation Network, see EIONET, 1999) on an European basis.
