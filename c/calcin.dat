40|$|The {{rural and}} remote primary medical {{workforce}} continues {{to struggle to}} meet community needs. This paper looks at {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the various datasets used to measure workforce. The analysis concludes that no current data set adequately describes workforce from a community need perspective. In particular, activity based data sets based on claims data do not capture issues such as service mix or the importance of issues outside activity collections, such as time on call. The paper calls for a new approach to workforce measurement based on a community needs model. Robert W. Pegram, John S. Humphreys and Gordon <b>Calcin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Scorpion venoms {{are rich}} in ion channel-modifying peptides, which {{have proven to be}} {{invaluable}} probes of ion channel structure-function relationship. We previously isolated imperatoxin A (IpTxa), a 3. 7 kDa peptide activator of Ca 2 +-release channels/ryanodine receptors (RyRs) [1, 2, 3] and founding member of the <b>calcin</b> family of scorpion peptides. IpTxa folds into a compact, mostly hydrophobic molecule with a cluster of positively-charged, basic residues polarized {{on one side of the}} molecule that possibly interacts with the phospholipids of cell membranes. To investigate whether IpTxa permeates external cellular membranes and targets RyRs in vivo, we perfused IpTxa on intact cardiomyocytes while recording field-stimulated intracellular Ca 2 + transients. To further investigate the cell-penetrating capabilities of the toxin, we prepared thiolated, fluorescent derivatives of IpTxa. Biological activity and spectroscopic properties indicate that these derivatives retain high affinity for RyRs and are only 5 - to 10 -fold less active than native IpTxa. Our results demonstrate that IpTxa is capable of crossing cell membranes to alter the release of Ca 2 + in vivo, and has the capacity to carry a large, membrane-impermeable cargo across the plasma membrane, a finding with exciting implications for novel drug delivery...|$|E

However, cardiopulmonary bypass {{in a patient}} with myasthenia gravis has not been reported previously. This paper describes the management of a patient with myasthenia gravis who required both coronary revascularization and mitral valve replacement. CASE REPORT The patient, a 53 -yr-old, 65 -kg woman, had suffered from myasthenia gravis for 19 yr and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for 26 yr. Ten years previously a thymectomy had been per-formed because of the progressive deterioration of her myasthenic symptoms—which included both bulbar and skeletal muscle weakness. This {{was followed by a}} difficult 3 -month period of intensive care which was complicated by poor diabetic control, respiratory failure and two episodes of asystolic cardiac arrest. A temporary tracheotomy was performed during this time to allow weaning from mechanical ventilation. Nine years later the patient had suffered a transient ischaemic attack, affecting her left arm, from which she had recovered fully. On the present admission the preoperative symptoms included grade 2 effort intolerance limited by dyspnoea and chest pain. There was also some weakness of the bulbar and extra-ocular muscles, mainly occurring in the early morning. Motor power in the limbs was unaffected.

40|$|Members of the <b>calcin</b> family, {{presently}} including imperatoxin A, maurocalcin, opicalcins and hemicalcin, are basic, 33 -mer peptide activators of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), {{the calcium}} channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) {{that provide the}} majority of calcium for muscle contraction. Here we describe hadrucalcin, a novel member of this family. Hadrucalcin was isolated from the venom of Hadrurus gertschi. Amino acid sequence and mass were determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry respectively. A cDNA library was constructed to generate clones for DNA sequence determination. Biological activity of native toxin was confirmed with [H- 3]ryanodine binding, by using SR vesicles from cardiac and skeletal muscle, and with single skeletal (RyR 1) and cardiac (RyR 2) channels reconstituted in lipid bilayers. Hadrucalcin was applied to intact ventricular myocytes to investigate effects on calcium transients. The secondary structure of hadrucalcin was computer-modelled by using atomic coordinates from maurocalcin, a structurally similar peptide. Hadrucalcin is distinguished from previously described congeners by two additional amino acids in its primary sequence {{and the lack of}} prominent amphipathicity. Hadrucalcin activated RyRs with high affinity (EC 50 = 37 nmol. L- 1), induced a long-lasting subconductance state on RyR 1 and RyR 2, and rapidly (lag time similar to 2 s) penetrated ventricular cardiomyocytes, eliciting discharge of internal calcium stores and spontaneous contractions. Hadrucalcin is a cell-permeant, powerful activator of RyRs, which has translational potential for targeted delivery of drugs to RyR as novel therapeutic intervention in arrhythmogenic disease...|$|E
40|$|Scorpions {{belonging}} to the Buthidae family have traditionally drawn much of the biochemist's attention due to the strong toxicity of their venoms. Scorpions not toxic to mammals, however, also have complex venoms. They {{have been shown to}} be an important source of bioactive peptides, some of them identified as potential drug candidates for the treatment of several emerging diseases and conditions. It is therefore important to characterize the large diversity of components found in the non-Buthidae venoms. As a contribution to this goal, this manuscript reports the construction and characterization of cDNA libraries from four scorpion species {{belonging to}} the Vaejovis genus of the Vaejovidae family: Vaejovis mexicanus, V. intrepidus, V. subcristatus and V. punctatus. Some sequences coding for channel-acting toxins were found, as expected, but the main transcribed genes in the glands actively producing venom were those coding for non disulfide-bridged peptides. The ESTs coding for putative channel-acting toxins, corresponded to sodium channel β toxins, to members of the potassium channel-acting α or κ families, and to calcium channel-acting toxins of the <b>calcin</b> family. Transcripts for scorpine-like peptides of two different lengths were found, with some of the species coding for the two kinds. One sequence coding for La 1 -like peptides, of yet unknown function, was found for each species. Finally, the most abundant transcripts corresponded to peptides {{belonging to the}} long chain multifunctional NDBP- 2 family and to the short antimicrobials of the NDBP- 4 family. This apparent venom composition is in correspondence with the data obtained to date for other non-Buthidae species.

Data concerning S-Hcy and bone health in children are scarce. ObjectiveOur {{aim was to}} evaluate S-Hcy {{in children and adolescents}} with impaired bone health and look for correlations with clinical and laboratory data. Patients and methodsWe assessed S-Hcy levels in 37 children and adolescents (22 boys and 15 girls; mean age 13. 9 ± 3. 5 years) with prevalent low-energy trauma fractures (mean 3. 3 ± 2. 3 per patient) and/or low spinal L 1 -L 4 BMD (below - 2 SD Z-score; DXA Lunar GE). We also evaluated S-ALP, serum CrossLaps, osteocalcin (S-OC), body height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and serum levels of folate and vitamin B 12. At the time of assessment, the chil- dren were not taking any drugs known to influence bone metabolism. The age-dependent parameters were expressed as Z-scores ± SD. ResultsS-Hcy Z-score was significantly higher (1. 3 ± 1. 5; P < 0. 0001) and L 1 -L 4 BMD Z-score was significantly lower (- 1. 7 ± 1. 3; P < 0. 0001), respectively, in comparison with reference values. S-ALP did not differ from reference values (P = 0. 88), while S-CrossLaps and S-osteo- <b>calcin</b> were higher (1. 2 ± 1. 8 and 0. 4 ± 0. 5; P = 0. 0001 and P = 0. 001, respectively). S-Hcy was inversely correlated to L 1 -L 4 BMD (r = - 0. 33; P = 0. 05) and S-ALP (r = - 0. 36; P = 0. 04) and not related to number of prevalent fractures (r = 0. 01), S-osteocalcin (r = - 0. 22) or S-CrossLaps (r = 0. 003).

40|$|Introduction: Bone tissue {{engineering}} demands hybrid 3 D structures {{able to provide}} both mechanical stability and an adequate nano and micro-environment. Herein, we investigated a methodology to perform the structuring of 3 D prototyped scaffolds, with nanocoatings and fibrillar structures where autologous growth factors (GFs) are stabilized and able to conduct and induce the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose derived stem cells (hASCs). Materials and methods: Poly(e-caprolactone) -PCL, ι-carrageenan and chitosan where obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Human platelet lysate was obtained as explained elsewhere 1 The assembling of the polyelec- trolytes (PEs) with PL was studied by QCM-D. PCL scaffolds were pre- pared by BioplotterTM and modified by dipping LbL similar to what we described before 2. hASCs were culture in osteogenic (+dexamethasone,+Dex) and osteoconductive media (-Dex). After 28 days in culture, samples were harvested and characterized by several techniques for calcium, osteocalcin (OC) and fat deposition; and for chondro-, adipo-, angio-, and osteogenic-specific gene expression. Results: PL was incorporated in the LbL assembled structures {{in the form of}} nanocoatings and fibrillar structures (Fig. 1). The new structures supported hASCs osteogenesis both in the pres- ence and absence of PL. These structures conduced the deposition of CaP not only onto the surfaces (as in the case of PCL) but also in the void spaces of the pores. In the absence of Dex, PL and the hierarchical structures both induced the deposition of mineralized matrix and osteo- <b>calcin</b> (Fig. 2). An inhibitory effect was observed when the number of bilayers was triplicated (results not shown). Discussion and conclusions: The structuring method has shown to be effective for the introduction and stabilization of osteo-inductive factors derived from PL. The GF’s showed its bioactivity by inducing the depo- sition of OC and CaP, by hASCs, in absence of Dex. Gene expression was influenced by both structuring and PL; which tended to increase angio- and osteogenic-related expression. With this method, 3 D scaf- folds can be structured with hybrid, multi-functional, inductive and hierarchical micro/nanostructures. By playing with the structuring parameters the density of the GFs which are presented to cells, the profile and even the spatial-temporal release can be controlled.

The hydrotalcite was <b>calcined</b> at 500 degrees C, with the dehydration from interlayer, the dehydroxilation from the brucite-like layer and the decomposition of carbonate successively, transformed into the mixed oxide type. The removal of thiocyanate from aqueous solution by using the original hydrotalcite and <b>calcined</b> hydrotalcite (HTC- 500) was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} thiocyanate adsorption capacity of <b>calcined</b> hydrotalcite was much higher than that of the original form. <b>Calcined</b> hydrotalcite was particularly effective at removing thiocyanate, and that the effective range of pH for the thiocyanate removal are between 5. 5 - 10. 0. The experimental data of thiocyanate removal fit nicely with Langmuir isotherm, and the saturated adsorption uptake was 96. 2 mg SCN-/g HTC- 500. The adsorption of thiocyanate by <b>calcined</b> hydrotalcite follows first-order kinetics. And the intercalation to the structure recovery for <b>calcined</b> hydrotalcite.

40|$|Effective {{adsorbents}} for {{sulphur dioxide}} (SO 2) removal were investigated in this work. The conventional adsorbent for gas purification is normally operated at low temperature (below 200 ºC), {{which is not}} suitable {{for the removal of}} SO 2 in hot flue gas. Pillared clays and <b>calcined</b> layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which have been widely studied for many catalytic applications at high temperature, are of a great potential for SO 2 removal from hot flue gas. In the current study, SO 2 adsorption performances of pillared clays and <b>calcined</b> LDHs were evaluated. Different metal species have been used to prepare pillared clays with bentonite as the supporting material. Ce and Zr pillared clays are found to have better SO 2 adsorption performance than other pillared clays. The SO 2 adsorption performance of pillared clay with different Ce and Zr content are also investigated. Several <b>calcined</b> LDHs with different Ce and Zr content are synthesized with Mg and Al as the major component. SO 2 adsorption performance of <b>calcined</b> LDHs with carbonate exchange and synthesized at higher pH are also investigated. It is found that Ce and Zr are active species for SO 2 adsorption, which have strong attractions to SO 2. Also <b>calcined</b> LDHs are found to have outstanding performance for SO 2 removal. The adsorption capacities of <b>calcined</b> LDHs are in average 100 % higher than pillared clays and 300 % higher than activated carbon and ZSM- 5 at 200 °C. The current results have demonstrated that <b>calcined</b> LDHs can achieve high SO 2 adsorption capacities at high temperature. As the synthesis procedure of <b>calcined</b> LDHs is not complicated, with further development, <b>calcined</b> LDHs can be developed into effective adsorbents for industrial SO 2 removal...|$|R
40|$|<b>Calcined</b> bone, highly burned bone, survives well in {{archaeological sites}} with acidic soils (pH 4. 5 to 5. 5). These acidic soils {{are present in}} archaeological sites along the Northwest coast due to the {{presence}} of coniferous forests. <b>Calcined</b> bone has shown to provide accurate radiocarbon ages, if intact apatite can be extracted, processed, and assayed. My CWU Science Honors Research project involves collaborations with DirectAMS Laboratory, creating a protocol for test comparison of <b>calcined</b> bone and radiocarbon dates from seven sites. Petrographic microscope analysis of <b>calcined</b> bone shows there is little to no calcite contamination (from humic acids). Analysis also reveals intact apatite structure, which contains the only obvious carbon in my samples of <b>calcined</b> bone. Accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) dating of <b>calcined</b> bone samples compare accurately with corresponding dates of charcoal and other bone from all seven sites in my sample. Dating <b>calcined</b> bone from large cooking features will be highly significant for researchers investigating resource intensification along the Northwest coast and within the Columbia Plateau. In these areas, mass food processing and storage were well established by 2500 RCYBP, especially where marine resources and/or tuberous plants were abundant. Radiocarbon dating of <b>calcined</b> bone from three of my sites with large cooking features demonstrates that improved accuracy and efficiency in radiocarbon dating will yield supporting evidence for resource intensification. This evidence will aid in improving our understanding of the ecological and economic factors that drive the development of the Pacific Northwest village pattern.
