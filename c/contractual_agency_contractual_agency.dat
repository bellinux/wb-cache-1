40|$|OBJECTIVE. We compare case mix of Medicare {{home health}} {{patients}} under HMO and FFS payment. STUDY DESIGN. A pseudo-experimental design {{was employed to}} study case mix using three types of Medicare-certified home health agencies (HHAs) : HMO-owned agencies, pure FFS agencies that admit few Medicare HMO patients (less than 5 percent of admissions are Medicare HMO patients), and mixed (or <b>contractual)</b> <b>agencies</b> that admit at least 15 Medicare FFS patients and 15 Medicare HMO patients per month. SAMPLES OF PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS. Random samples of Medicare-aged patients (> or = 65 years) were selected at admission between June 1989 and November 1991 from the 38 study HHAs. Sample sizes by agency type were: 308 patients from 9 HMO-owned agencies; 529 patients from 15 pure FFS agencies; and 381 HMO patients and 414 FFS patients from 14 <b>contractual</b> <b>agencies.</b> DATA. Primary longitudinal data were prospectively collected at admission for all patients on health status indicators, demographics, admission source, and home environment. MEASURES. The most important case-mix measures were functional and physiologic indicators of health status, including (instrumental) {{activities of daily living}} ([I]ADLs). Selected indicators of demographic variables, prior location, living situation, characteristics of informal caregivers, mental/behavioral factors, and resource needs were also used. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. (a) The case mix of Medicare FFS patients compared with Medicare HMO patients was more intense in terms of impairments in ADLs, IADLs, and various physiologic conditions. Pressure ulcers as well as neurological and orthopedic impairments requiring rehabilitation care were also more prevalent among FFS patients. (b) Relative to HMO patients admitted to <b>contractual</b> <b>agencies,</b> HMO patients admitted to HMO-owned agencies were moderately more dependent in ADLs and IADLs. However, only 62 percent of HMO patients admitted to HMO-owned agencies, in contrast to 77 percent of HMO patients admitted to <b>contractual</b> <b>agencies,</b> had been hospitalized during the 30 days prior to home health admission. (c) In all, the case mix of patients receiving care from HMO-owned agencies is more heterogeneous than the case mix of HMO patients receiving care from <b>contractual</b> <b>agencies.</b> CONCLUSIONS. The case-mix (and selected utilization) findings indicate that HMOs use home health care differently than does the FFS sector. The greater diversity of case mix for HMO-owned agencies and the narrower or less diverse case mix that characterizes HMO patients receiving home care on a contractual basis point to the likelihood of cost differences among the two types of HMO patients and FFS patients, and raise the question of possible outcome differences...|$|R
40|$|In this Article, the {{historical}} evolution of corporate governance is considered, highlighting the different eras of governance, the dominant {{theoretical and practical}} paradigms, and the reformulation of paradigms and counter paradigms. Two alternative and sharply contrasting theorizations, one collective and collaborative (the work of Berle and Means), the other individualistic and <b>contractual</b> (<b>agency</b> theory and shareholder value) are focused upon. The explanatory potential of Blair and Stout’s team production theory is elaborated, along with its conception {{of the complexity of}} business enterprise, with a mediating hierarch (the board of directors) securing a balance between the interests of different stakeholders. The potential for reform of corporate purpose, corporate governance, and directors’ duties is examined with reference to the U. K. Modern Company Law Review. The impact of the intensification of the financialization of corporations is analyzed, with the increased emphasis upon short-termism. The origins of the global financial crisis in shareholder value orientations are explored, as well as the continuing reverberations of the crisis. In light of the foregoing discussion, I argue it is imperative to advance sustainable enterprise, and elaborate on the critical changes this will necessitate in corporate purpose and directors’ duties...|$|R
30|$|The {{recognition}} {{that information is}} imperfect, costly, asymmetrically distributed and affected by the agents' strategic behaviours 'provided explanations {{of economic and social}} phenomena that otherwise would be hard to understand’ (Stiglitz 2000, p. 1441). In that view, economists discriminate between two types of information asymmetry: moral hazard and adverse selection. Guesnerie et al. (1989, p. 807) referred to the notions of 'hidden knowledge’ and 'hidden actions’ to identify these two sources of inefficiency in resource allocation. While moral hazard results from the inability of one individual (called the Principal in Standard Agency Theory, SAT) to monitor another individual's (called the Agent in SAT) actions, adverse selection corresponds to the inability of the principal to observe an agent's private information (Picard 1987, p. 305). Because the properties of incentive contracts 'are altered in the presence of such concerns about information management’ (Lewis and Sappington 1997, p. 797), research efforts focused on designing contractual arrangements that aim at reducing the negative impacts of information asymmetries. Two broad categories of <b>contractual</b> <b>agency</b> are likely to reduce information asymmetry: (1) self-selection, in particular through information disclosure and signalling, and screening, and (2) designing of incentive structures and monitoring (Stiglitz 2000). The first category provides rational responses to adverse selection problems; the second one is likely to reduce moral hazard situations.|$|R

40|$|The Austrian School's {{conventional}} {{theory of}} the firm {{is based on an}} attempt to synthesize Coase's concept of the firm as a centrally planned hierarchy with the Austrian theory of entrepreneurship and monetary calculation. This paper is a critique of that program as well as an attempt to outline the alternative {{theory of the}} firm, one based on the synthesis of the <b>contractual</b> <b>agency</b> theory of the firm (Alchian-Demsetz, Jensen-Meckling) with the same Austrian arguments about entrepreneurship and calculation. The firm in this paper is defined as a nexus of various markets for goods as well as for labor and managerial services rather than as a hierarchy or organization. Both the neoclassical and Austrian critiques of the latter concept are utilized to prove that a clear distinction between the market and the firm cannot be established. That distinction is based on the misunderstanding of the firm's dynamics as exclusively tied to the managing/transaction costs ratio {{as well as on the}} mischaracterization of inter-firm relations as commanding ones (Demsetz-Alchian, Jensen, Meckling, Fama, Cheung). On the other hand, the central planning view of the firm is equally at odds with the key Mises's argument that rational economic planning is impossible in the absence of market prices (Mises, 1990). If this is so, the firm, as understood in a Coasian paradigm, would not have any reason to exist, or any reason to contribute positively to economic efficiency, because it would simply represent a centrally planned island of incalculability in a wider market setting (Rothbard, 2004). Since the firm is a nexus of various markets, its operation is contrary to the Coaseian assumptions led by the price signals. Only insofar as the internal firm's operation is driven by the price signals can the firm be efficient. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on {{governance}} structures, which are analyzed in a two-fold theoretical perspective, that is both <b>contractual</b> (<b>agency</b> theory) and relational (social capital theory), and {{in the context of}} Italian family and non-family SMEs The paper intends to offer three types of contributions to governance literature. First, we focus on the whole set of bodies which can be involved in governance and not only on boards of directors. Family firms of small and medium size are generally supposed to feature quite simple governance structures. The paper shows that, on the contrary, they can be fairly elaborate and identifies basic archetypes. Second, we explore archetypes of governance structures. Literature on SMEs and family business governance generally assumes that bodies like the shareholders meeting and the board of directors are often paper ones. This study highlights - {{for the first time in}} Italy - to what extent governance structures simply exist and to what extent they are actually used. We posit that increasing ownership complexity and company size induce companies to set up more articulated governance structures in terms of both existence and functioning. Another hypothesis we make is that governance structures are utilized less in family firms than in non-family firms. Third, family business governance literature shows that governance structures may serve either the purpose of reducing agency threats (which is particularly true for “official” corporate bodies) or the purpose to create trust, unity and commitment in the firm (which is especially the case of “unofficial” ones like the family council). Our study shows how in family firms official and unofficial bodies can be both present; particularly, it tests the hypothesis that the former are less used than the latter. All the hypotheses have been tested on a statistically representative sample of 546 Italian small and medium-sized businesses, returned from an 15157 mailing sample to an initial population of 94, 504 SMEs.

40|$|The IFRS {{mandatory}} {{adoption in}} European countries {{is an excellent}} context from which to assess the validity of accounting choice theory, which postulates that information asymmetry, <b>contractual</b> efficiency (<b>agency</b> costs) and managerial opportunism reasons could drive the choice. With this aim, we test {{the impact of these}} factors to explain the adoption of fair value for investment properties (IAS 40) in the real estate industry, taking into account the ‘revaluation’ option offered by IFRS 1 and using historical cost without revaluations as a baseline category for comparison purposes. We select a sample of European real estate companies from Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain and Sweden, all first-time adopters of the IFRS. Using a multinomial logistic model, we show that information asymmetry, contractual efficiency and managerial opportunism could account for the fair value choice. Particularly, the most significant findings are that size as a proxy of political costs reduces the likelihood of using fair value while market-to-book ratio is negatively associated with the fair value choice. On the other hand, leverage, another typical proxy of contracting costs, seems not to influence the choice. This evidence confirms the current validity of traditional accounting choice theory even if it reveals, in such a context, the irrelevance of the usual relations between accounting choice and leverag...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} five decades, {{development}} assistance has evolved {{in response to a}} dramatically changing global political and economic landscape. In this paper, we examine this evolution and discuss how the effectiveness of aid has been and will be seen in the eyes of donors, intended beneficiaries, and outside observers. From an historical perspective, we note that the effectiveness debate has been confined by preoccupation with macro institutions and outcomes. We also discuss how the relative importance of aid has changed with rapid growth of trade and private capital markets. Looking ahead, we argue that care should be taken when applying macro performance evaluation to development assistance because this approach increases the risk that aid will be politicized and allocated inefficiently. Rationing credit and other assistance by macro-criteria inevitably screens out credit- or need-worthy recipients, while many beneficiaries in attractive macro settings may be less deserving. Simplistic macro rules-of-thumb not only compromise more rigorous credit and need standards; they reinforce the adversity of people living under substandard governance. In reality, aid and lending relationships involve complex <b>contractual</b> and <b>agency</b> relationships that are essentially microeconomic in nature. We discuss how conceptual innovations in modern microeconomic theory might be enlisted to improve aid effectiveness. In passing, we also review some implications for public donor institutions of another globalization phenomenon, rapidly emergent private policy agencies in the form of NGOs...|$|R

The debated question is the trade‐off between employment opportunities offered by the deregulation and the employment stability and quality after entry, in particular for the new entrants. Building on previous research, we address the question of whether temporary contractual arrangements are a dead‐end that traps workers indefinitely or just a stepping stone toward more stable and definitive forms of employments. Using micro data of more than 600. 000 workers entered the labour market in the years 2008 to 2015 and two different types of temporary <b>contractual</b> agreements (temporary <b>agency</b> and fixed‐term contracts) as treatment, we adopt propensity score techniques to assess which one is more likely to act as a stepping stone towards permanent jobs with respect to a control group.

Also, our model makes it possible to generalize the Mukerji (1998) approach to contractual incompleteness. In fact, it shows that incomplete contracts are costly and that, before reaching the conclusion that ambiguity leads to contractual incompleteness, their costs should be compared with those of complete contracts, other things being equal. ambiguity, <b>agency,</b> E-capacity, <b>contractual</b> incompleteness. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Temporary agency working {{continues}} {{to grow in the}} UK. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to look at a number of important developments in the agency industry, which generate implications for the performance of agencies, temps and the user firms in which temps work and to set out some of the key performance implications of these developments. These developments are: the increasingly complex set of <b>contractual</b> arrangements between <b>agencies</b> and user firms; the changing regulatory environment; and the changing role of agencies in pay setting. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the state of the art literature on agency working, and draws on 15 years of primary research and secondary analysis of the sector by the authors. Findings: The paper shows that there is a proliferation of models of temporary agency worker supply, some of which involves agencies playing a greater role within firms in the management of temps, with other involving a deliberate and strategic distancing of client firms and/or agency in the day-to-day management of temps. This creates significant challenges for the management of temps. The paper also finds that there are significant tensions and challenges arising from the implementation of the Agency Working Regulations, even though these regulations have the potential to raise motivation and performance of temps. Practical implications: The management of temps creates significant challenges for organisations and agencies. New models of supply of agency labour have the potential to make these challenges even more problematic, if not addressed effectively. The implications of the shifting regulatory and political environment also need closer scrutiny, particularly in the context of the recent EU referendum result in the UK. Originality/value: The paper sheds light on a number of new developments in the agency sector, and by demonstrating their effects on organisations, agencies and temps, draws out some of the performance implications of the continued and changing use of agency temps...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this Article is to bring {{empirical}} evidence {{to bear on the}} heretofore largely theoretical law and economics debate about insider trading. The Article first summarizes various <b>agency,</b> market, and <b>contractual</b> (or 2 ̆ 2 Coasian 2 ̆ 2) theories of insider trading propounded over the course of this longstanding debate. The Article then proposes three testable hypotheses regarding the relationship between insider trading laws and several measures of stock market performance. Exploiting the natural variation of international data, the Article finds that more stringent insider trading laws are generally associated with more dispersed equity ownership, greater stock price accuracy and greater stock market liquidity, controlling for various economic, legal and institutional factors. These results cast doubt on pure 2 ̆ 2 Coasian 2 ̆ 2 theories of insider trading and suggest the appropriate locus of academic and policy inquiries about the efficiency implications of insider trading and its regulation. Further empirical research is necessary, however, to conclusively resolve the perennial insider trading debate...|$|R
40|$|The {{carriage}} {{of goods}} by sea starts off with a contract of carriage, an essentially simple and straightforward contract between two parties, the shipper and the carrier. Very often, however, a bill of lading is issued and a third party appears on the scene: the holder {{of the bill of}} lading. The holder was not involved in the making of the contract of carriage, but does have rights, and possibly obligations, against the carrier at destination. The holder of the bill of lading is entitled to claim delivery and has title to sue the carrier for loss of or damage to the goods, but he can also be liable to pay freight or other costs. The question then is how the third party holder of the bill acquires those rights and obligations. The thesis analyzes the different theories that have been proposed to explain the position of the third party holder. In doing so, a distinction is made between contractual theories and non-contractual theories. The former try to explain the holder's position by building on the initial contract of carriage and applying contract law mechanisms. The latter, although obviously not denying the existence of the contract of carriage, construe the position of the third party holder independently. Within the group of contractual theories, there is a further distinction to be made between those theories that have the holder succeed to all of the shipper's rights and obligations and thus have the holder step into the shoes of the shipper, and the theories that see the holder's position as contractual but independent, and thus not necessarily identical to the position of the shipper. Within the first group (<b>contractual,</b> identical position) <b>agency,</b> assignment and novation are looked at. The second group (contractual, non-identical position) includes the third party beneficiary clause, multi-party contracts and accession, and direct contracts between the carrier and the holder. The third group (statutory) includes the bill of lading as a quasi-contract, statutes explicitly or implicitly dealing with the holder's position, the bill of lading as a negotiable instrument, the bill of lading as a voluntary engagement and the bill of lading as part of the Lex Maritima. Following the analysis and appraisal of the different theories, the case is made that the position of the third party holder of the bill of lading is not obvious or self-evident; the question what the holder's position is needs to be asked and answered. It is further argued that, al-though it is easy to understand why contractual approaches were initially chosen and are still preferred, they are nevertheless not the best possible solution. It is submitted that a statutory approach to the position of the holder of the bill of lading has advantages and would be preferable...|$|R

Far more consequential factors were rifts within the MID, caused in large part by the election of a board member adamantly opposed to the transfer, and the threat of legal action by the city of Modesto, already engaged in a contract with the MID. These spheres of conflict [...] within the negotiating <b>agency,</b> among <b>contractual</b> partners, and outside by third parties [...] combined to scuttle the deal. As a result of the failed transfer, the two agencies are taking two very different paths forward, with the SFPUC considering a similar water deal with a different irrigation district while the MID, after an overhaul of personnel, will tackle its challenges with a completely new management approach.

But, the existing literature addresses traditional agency costs with respect to the pursuit of a single monetary goal. Impact investment funds that balance monetary goals, short-term or long, with other goals may strike a different balance in negotiating with companies. We examine how the introduction of new motivations and interests into a precarious negotiation process shapes contracting outcomes. We address this question empirically by analyzing the role of employee stock ownership in impact investment fund contracts when investing in targeted portfolio companies. That a startup’s employees might receive shares and options is uncontroversial. Indeed, this appears in many ways to be fundamental to today’s startup culture. Might impact investors mandate that employees own shares as a means to balance dual goals? That is the key question for our analysis...|$|R
40|$|Credit ratings {{produced}} by the major credit rating agencies (CRAs) aim to measure the creditworthiness, or more specifically the relative creditworthiness of companies, i. e. their ability to meet their debt servicing obligations. In principle, the rating process focuses on the fundamental long-term credit strength of a company. It is typically based on {{both public and private}} information, except for unsolicited ratings, which focus only on public information. The basic rationale for using ratings is to achieve information economies of scale and solve principal-agent problems. Partly for the same reasons, the role of credit ratings has expanded significantly over time. Regulators, banks and bondholders, pension fund trustees and other fiduciary agents have increasingly used ratings-based criteria to constrain behaviour. As a result, the influence of the opinions of CRAs on markets appears to have grown considerably in recent years. One aspect of this development is its potential impact on market dynamics (i. e. the timing and path of asset price adjustments, credit spreads, etc.), either directly, {{as a consequence of the}} information content of ratings themselves, or indirectly, as a consequence of the “hardwiring” of ratings into regulatory rules, fund management mandates, bond covenants, etc. When considering the impact of ratings and rating changes, two conclusions are worth highlighting. – First, ratings correlate moderately well with observed credit spreads, and rating changes with changes in spreads. However, other factors, such as liquidity, taxation and historical volatility clearly also enter into the determination of spreads. Recent research suggests that reactions to rating changes may also extend beyond the immediately-affected company to its peers, and from bond to equity prices. Furthermore, this price reaction to rating changes seems to be asymmetrical, i. e. more pronounced for downgrades than for upgrades, and may be more significant for equity prices than for bond prices. – Second, the hardwiring of regulatory and market rules, bond covenants, investment guidelines, etc., to ratings may influence market dynamics, and potentially lead to or magnify threshold effects. The more that different market participants adopt identical ratings-linked rules, or are subject to similar ratings-linked regulations, the more “spiky” the reaction to a credit event is likely to be. This reaction may include, in some cases, the emergence of severe liquidity pressures. Efforts have recently been made, notably with support from the rating agencies themselves, to encourage a more systematic disclosure of rating triggers and to renegotiate and smooth the possibly more destabilising forms of rating triggers. However, the lack of a clear disclosure regime makes it difficult to assess how far this process has evolved. Questions also remain as to the extent to which ratings-based criteria introduce a fundamentally new element into market behaviour, or, conversely, the extent to which they are simply a va riant of more traditional <b>contractual</b> covenants. Rating <b>agencies</b> strive to provide credit assessments that remain broadly stable through the course of the business cycle (rating “through the cycle”). Agencies and other analysts frequently contrast the fundamental credit analysis on which ratings are based with market sentiment — measured for example by bond spreads — which is arguably subject to more short-term influences. Agencies are adamant that they do not directly incorporate market sentiment into ratings (although they may use market prices as a diagnostic tool). On the contrary, they make every effort to exclude transient market sentiment. However, as reliance on ratings grows, CRAs are being increasingly expected to satisfy a widening range of constituencies, with different, and even sometimes conflicting, interests: issuers and “traditional” asset managers will look for more than a simple statement of near-term probability of loss, and will stress the need for ratings to exhibit some degree of stability over time. On the other hand, mark-to-market traders, active investors and risk managers may seek more frequent indications of credit changes. Hence, in the wake of major bankruptcies with heightened credit stress, rating agencies have been under considerable pressure to provide higher-frequency readings of credit status, without loss of quality. So far, they have responded to this challenge largely by adding more products to their traditional range, but also through modifications in the rating process. The rating process and the range of products offered by rating agencies have thus evolved over time, with, for instance, an increasing emphasis on the analysis of liquidity risks, a new focus on the hidden liabilities of companies and an increased use of market-based tools. It is too early, however, to judge whether these changes should simply be regarded as a refinement of the agencies’ traditional methodology or whether they suggest a more fundamental shift in the approach to credit risk measurement. For the same reason, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusions about changes in the effects of credit ratings on market dynamics. ...|$|R
