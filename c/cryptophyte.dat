40|$|In the nearshore {{coastal waters}} along the Antarctic Peninsula, a {{recurrent}} shift in phytoplankton community structure, from diatoms to <b>cryptophytes,</b> has been documen ted. The shift {{was observed in}} consecutive years (1991 – 1996) during the austral summer and was correlated {{in time and space}} with glacial melt-water runoff and reduced surface water salinities. Elevated temperatures along the Peninsula will increase the extent of coastal melt-water zones and the seasonal prevalence of <b>cryptophytes.</b> This is significant because a change from diatoms to <b>cryptophytes</b> represents a marked shift in the size distribution of the phytoplankton community, which will, in turn, impact the zooplankton assemblage. <b>Cryptophytes,</b> because of their small size, are not grazed efficiently by Antarctic krill, a keystone species in the food web. An increase in the abundance and relative proportion of <b>cryptophytes</b> in coastal waters along the Peninsula will likely cause a shift in the spatial distribution of krill and may allow also for the rapid asexual proliferation of carbon poor gelatinous zooplankton, salps in particular.

40|$|Nucleomorphs are the relic nuclei of algal endosymbionts {{that became}} {{permanent}} fixtures inside nonphotosynthetic eukaryotic host cells. These unusual organelles exist in only 2 lineages, the <b>cryptophytes,</b> which possess nucleomorphs and plastids (chloroplasts) {{derived from the}} uptake of a red algal endosymbiont, and the chlorarachniophytes, which harbor green algal derived nucleomorphs and plastids. Despite having evolved independently of one another, the nucleomorph genomes of <b>cryptophytes</b> and chlorarachniophytes are strikingly similar in size and basic structure. Both are, 1 Mbp in size—the smallest nuclear genomes known—and are composed of only 3 chromosomes, {{each with its own}} subtelomeric rDNA repeats. Nucleomorph-containing algae thus represent an interesting system in which to study genome and chromosome evolution in eukaryotes. Here, we provide an overview of nucleomorph genome biology and focus on new information gleaned from comparisons of complete nucleomorph genome sequences, both within and between <b>cryptophytes</b> and chlorarachniophytes. Such comparisons provide fascinating insight into the evolution of these highly derived organelles and, more generally, the potential causes and consequences of genome reduction in eukaryotes.

40|$|Red {{algae and}} green plants {{are known to}} have {{obtained}} their photosynthetic organelles, or plastids, through the endosymbiotic adoption of cyanobacteria. It is still widely debated as to how other eukaryotic alga such as haptophytes, <b>cryptophytes,</b> and photosynthetic heterokonts obtained their plastids, although all are believed to be descended from a red alga. In this thesis, genome-level regressions, analyses of residuals, and Fisher's exact tests were used to determine how these three eukaryotic algal groups obtained their plastids. A phylogeny also was constructed using 11 plastid genes from various red algae, green plants, haptophytes, <b>cryptophytes,</b> and photosynthetic heterokonts. The results from these collective analyses indicate that multiple endosymbiosis events occurred. Furthermore, they show that a plastid was passed from a red alga, first to <b>cryptophytes,</b> then to photosynthetic heterokonts, and finally to haptophytes in a series of endosymbioses.   M.

40|$|Microalgae {{have the}} ability to synthetize many compounds, some of which have been {{recognized}} as a source of functional ingredients for nutraceuticals with positive health effects. One well-known example is the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are essential for human nutrition. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the two most important long-chain omega- 3 (ω- 3) PUFAs involved in human physiology, and both industries are almost exclusively based on microalgae. In addition, algae produce phytosterols that reduce serum cholesterol. Here we determined the growth rates, biomass yields, PUFA and sterol content, and daily gain of eight strains of marine <b>cryptophytes.</b> The maximal growth rates of the <b>cryptophytes</b> varied between 0. 34 – 0. 70 divisions day− 1, which is relatively good in relation to previously screened algal taxa. The studied <b>cryptophytes</b> were extremely rich in ω- 3 PUFAs, especially in EPA and DHA (range 5. 8 – 12. 5 and 0. 8 – 6. 1 µg mg dry weight− 1, respectively), but their sterol concentrations were low. Among the studied strains, Storeatula major was superior in PUFA production, and it also produces all PUFAs, i. e., α-linolenic acid (ALA), stearidonic acid (SDA), EPA, and DHA, which is rare in phytoplankton in general.

40|$|Changes in {{phytoplankton}} composition {{from large}} diatoms to small <b>cryptophytes</b> and their implications {{to the food}} web have been previously associated with rapid warming of surface waters in the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). However, ecological and physiological attributes that favor dominance of these flagellates {{in the region have}} not been fully explored. The overall aim of this work was to characterize the phytoplankton pigments and assemblages in relation to environmental conditions during three successive summer cruises (2013, 2014 and 2015) in the Gerlache Strait − a coastal area in the northern WAP. Data on phytoplankton (through HPLC/CHEMTAX pigment analysis) and associated physical (water column structure) and chemical (macronutrients) parameters were determined. <b>Cryptophytes</b> were conspicuously found in shallow mixed layers, under stratified conditions, as the main contributors to total phytoplankton biomass. Their greatest contributions were associated with warmer surface waters at the northwestern sector of the strait. Other phytoplankton groups (Phaeocystis antarctica in 2013 and small diatoms in both 2014 and 2015) were also important components. Photoprotective carotenoids (mainly alloxanthin), with an important role in preventing photodamage caused by excess light, were closely linked with the dominance of <b>cryptophytes</b> at surface layers. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the prevalence of <b>cryptophytes</b> in WAP coastal waters can be, to a great extent, due to a particular ability of those small flagellates to successfully grow in highly illuminated conditions in shallow upper mixed layers and strong water column stratification...|$|R

40|$|The {{plastids}} of <b>cryptophytes,</b> haptophytes, and heterokontophytes (stramenopiles) (together {{once known}} as chromists) are surrounded by four membranes, reflecting the origin of these plastids through secondary endosymbiosis. They share this trait with apicomplexans, which are alveolates, the plastids {{of which have been}} suggested to stem from the same secondary symbiotic event and therefore form a phylogenetic clade, the chromalveolates. The chromists are quantitatively the most important eukaryotic contributors to primary production in marine ecosystems. The mechanisms of protein import across their four plastid membranes are still poorly understood. Components of an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery in <b>cryptophytes,</b> partially encoded by the reduced genome of the secondary symbiont (the nucleomorph), are implicated in protein transport across the second outermost plastid membrane. Here, we show that the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi, like <b>cryptophytes,</b> stramenopiles, and apicomplexans, possesses a nuclear-encoded symbiont-specific ERAD machinery (SELMA, symbiont-specific ERAD-like machinery) in addition to the host ERAD system, with targeting signals that are able to direct green fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein to the predicted cellular localization in transformed cells of the stramenopile Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Phylogenies of the duplicated ERAD factors reveal that all SELMA components trace back to a red algal origin. In contrast, the host copies of <b>cryptophytes</b> and haptophytes associate with the green lineage to the exclusion of stramenopiles and alveolates. Although all chromalveolates with four membrane-bound plastids possess the SELMA system, this has apparently not arisen in a single endosymbiotic event. Thus, our data do not support the chromalveolate hypothesis.
