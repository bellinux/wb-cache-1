50|$|The {{importance}} of rainfed agriculture varies regionally but produces most food for poor communities in developing countries. In subSaharan Africa more than 95% of the farmed land is rainfed, while the corresponding ﬁgure for Latin America is almost 90%, for South Asia about 60%, for East Asia 65% {{and for the}} Near East and North Africa 75%. Most {{countries in the world}} depend primarily on rainfed agriculture for their grain food. Despite large strides made in improving productivity and environmental conditions in many developingcountries, a great number of poor families in Africa and Asia still face poverty, hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition where rainfed agriculture is the main agricultural activity. These problems are exacerbated by adverse biophysical growing conditions and the poor socioeconomic infrastructure in many areas in the semi-arid tropics (SAT). The SAT is the home to 38% of the developing countries’ poor, 75% of whom live in rural areas. Over 45% of the world’s hungry and more than 70% of its malnourished children live in the SAT There is a correlation between poverty, hunger and water stress. The UN Millennium Development Project has identiﬁed the ‘hot spot’ countries in the world suffering from the largest prevalence of malnourishment. These countries coincide closely with those located in the semi-arid and dry subhumid hydroclimates in the world (Fig. 1.1), i.e. savannahs and steppe ecosystems, where rainfed agriculture is the dominating source of food and where water constitutes a key limiting factor to crop growth. Of the 850 million undernourished people in the world, essentially all live in poor, developing countries, which predominantly are located in tropical regions. Since the late 1960s, agricultural land use has expanded by 20-25%, which has contributed to approximately 30% of the overall grain production growth during the period. The remaining yield outputs originated from intensiﬁcation through yield increases per unit land area. However, the regional variation is large, as is the difference between irrigated and rainfed agriculture. In developing countries rainfed grain yields are on average 1.5 t/ha, compared with 3.1 t/ha for irrigated yields (Rosegrant et al., 2002), and increase in production from rainfed agriculture has mainly originated from land expansion.Trends are clearly different for different regions. With 99% rainfed production of main cereals such as maize, millet and sorghum, the cultivated <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> in sub-Saharan Africa has doubled since 1960 while the yield per unit of land has been nearly stagnant for these staple crops (FAOSTAT, 2005). In South Asia, there has been a major shift away from more drought-tolerant, low-yielding crops such as sorghum and millet, while wheat and maize hasapproximately doubled in area since 1961 (FAOSTAT, 2005). During the same period, the yield per unit of land for maize and wheat has more than doubled (Fig. 1.2). For predominantly rainfed systems, maize crops per unit ofland have nearly tripled and wheat more than doubled during the same time period. Rainfed maize yield differs substantiallybetween regions (Fig. 1.2a). In Latin America (including the Caribbean) it exceeds 3 t/ha, while in South Asia it is around 2 t/ha and in subSaharan Africa it only just exceeds 1 t/ha. This can be compared with maize yields in the USA or southern Europe, which normally amount toapproximately 7-10 t/ha (most maize in these regions is irrigated). The average regional yield per unit of land for wheat in Latin America(including the Caribbean) and South Asia is similar to the average yield output of 2.5-2.7 t/ha in North America (Fig. 1.2b). In comparison, wheat yield in Western Europe is approximately twice as large (5 t/ha), while in sub-Saharan Africa it remains below 2 t/ha. In view of the historic regional difference in development of yields, there appears to exist a signiﬁcant potential for raised yields in rainfed agriculture, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Rural development through sustainable management of land and water resources gives a plausible solution for alleviating rural poverty and improving the livelihoods of the rural poor.In an effective convergence mode for improving the rural livelihoods in the target districts,with watersheds as the operational units, a holistic integrated systems approach by drawing attention to the past experiences, existingopportunities and skills, and supported partnerships can enable change and improve the livelihoods of the rural poor. The well-being of therural poor depends on fostering their fair and equitable access to productive resources. The rationale behind convergence through watersheds has been that these watersheds help in ‘cross-learning’ and drawing {{on a wide range of}} experiences from different sectors. A signiﬁcantconclusion is that there should be a balance between attending to needs and priorities of rural livelihoods and enhancing positive directions of change by building effective and sustainable partnerships. Based on the experience and performance of the existing integrated community watersheds in different socioeconomic environments, appropriate exit strategies, which include proper sequencing of interventions, building up of ﬁnancial, technical and organizational capacity of local communities to internalize and sustain interventions, and the requirement for any minimal external technical and organizational support needs to be identiﬁed.|$|E

This study consists in the setup of the fungal growth monitoring by novel analytical techniques during the Stagonospora nodorum pathogenic attack and blotch disease progression on durum wheat. Durum wheat plant, treated or untreated with Folicur, have been inoculated or not (control) both in greenhouse and in the field at different phenotypic stage. Leaf samples have been harvested at different time intervals and used for the subsequent analyses. These analyses consist in two different approach for monitoring and quantifying fungal growth: a spectral images-based analysis and a molecular quantitative (qPCR) method. The first is a no invasive analytical technique, which has recently been used for determining fungal contamination of plant tissues. The latter allow to specifically and quantitatively detect the amount of fungus inside its host. Fungal contamination can be determined by a classical approach (e. g. microscopy) within 120 hours post infection (hpi). The image spectroscopy combined with a robust statistical analysis (ANOVA+Principal Compenents Analysis) indicates 1510 nm as wavelength predictive for unraveling at 48 - 72 hpi the presence of S. nodorum.

According to recent estimates by the Food and Agriculture organization (FAO), one in nine {{people in the world}} and about a quarter of those in Sub-Saharan Africa are unable to meet their dietary energy requirements in 2014 – 2015 (FAO 2015). The focus of this study is not food insecurity and hunger per se. It instead addresses one major component of food security, that is, food production. Although a range of factors influence global food security (FAO 1996), food production plays a major role (Parry et al. 2009). In this paper, we seek to analyze the extent to which production of staple crops in major producer countries can respond to changes in output and input prices. Our focus is on production of the world’s principal staple crops, namely wheat, rice, maize, and corn. These crops are crucial for the fight against global food insecurity since they are major sources of food in several parts of the world, comprising three quarters of the food calories in global food production. Maize, wheat, and rice, respectively, are the three largest cereal crops cultivated around the world. According to data from FAO (2012), they make up more than 75 and 85  % of global <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> and production in 2010, respectively. Our analysis focuses on data from 11 major crop producer countries for the 1991 – 2013 period.

First, the paper uses adult mortality rates from available data on an HIV-negative sample from neighboring Tanzania {{to predict the}} number of deaths that might have been expected in the absence of HIV, and compares this to {{the number of deaths}} actually recorded over the survey interval in the Kenyan sample. Based on this procedure, only a quarter of the prime-age female deaths in the 25 - 34 age range and about half of the male deaths in the 35 - 44 year age range age range could have been predicted {{on the basis of the}} HIV-negative Tanzanian adult mortality rates. In the Nyanza area, the discrepancies were even larger over a broader number of age/sex ranges. This provides a strong indication that AIDS accounts for a large proportion of the recorded deaths for these age/sex categories, particularly in the Nyanza area. Next, using a household fixed-effects model that controls for time-varying effects, we measure changes in outcomes between households afflicted by adult mortality vs. those not afflicted over the three-year survey period. The effects of adult death are highly sensitive to the gender and position of the deceased family member in the household. Households suffering the death of the head -of-household or spouse incurred a greater-than-one person loss in household size. The death of a male household head between 16 and 59 years is associated with a 68 % reduction in the net value of the household's crop production. Female head-of-household or spouse mortality causes a greater decline in <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> cultivated, while cash crops such as coffee, tea, and sugar are most adversely affected in households incurring the death of a prime-age male head. Off-farm income is also significantly affected by the death of the male head of household, but not in the case of other adult members. The death of other prime-age family members is partially offset by an inflow of other individuals into the family. Other prime-age family members' mortality has less dramatic effects on the households' agricultural production, assets, and off-farm income. Lastly, there is little indication that households are able to recover quickly from the effects of prime-age head-of-household adult mortality; the effects on crop and non-farm incomes do not decay at least over the three-year survey interval. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for agricultural research and extension programs as well as for safety net programs designed to cushion the impacts of prime-age adult death.

40|$|Half of world’s food {{comes from}} {{irrigated}} area that uses about 72 % of available water resources. In Morocco, water availability {{is the main}} limiting factor for crop growth and final yield and it is becoming a national priority for the agricultural sector. This situation leads the stakeholders to define most favorable strategies in planning and management of available water resources, on one hand, and to assess accurately vegetation water content status, on the other hand, {{in order to improve}} irrigation scheduling and prevent water stress adversely affecting yield. Remotely sensed reflectance has been used to estimate vegetation water content for different crops and to monitor water irrigation per surface unit, considering its high temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, we used two spectral indices of vegetation water content indicator (the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Moisture Stress Index (MSI)) developed using Near Infrared (NIR) and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands. The study area is the irrigated perimeter of Tadla in Morocco (35 % dominated by irrigated wheat crop). In a first step, we compared observed vegetation water content of 16 studied plots of wheat and derived spectral indices NDII and MSI at the end of cropping season. The two images used at this step were acquired on March 26, 2013 and on April 11, 2013 when soil was fully covered by vegetation. Statistical analyses showed that the two spectral indices, NDII and MSI, simulated accurately vegetation water content. The statistical indicators, r, R², RMSE, nRMSE and MAE were - 0. 81, 0. 65, 3. 26 % of water content (≈ 0. 13 kg/m²), 4. 26 % and 2. 69 % for the NDII and 0. 81, 0. 65, 3. 27 % of water content (≈ 0. 14 kg/m²), 4. 27 % and 2. 72 % for the MSI, respectively. To validate these results, we compared observed vegetation water content values and those predicted using the k-fold CV method. The errors were minimal for NDII and MSI, and the indicators of model evaluation obtained for predicted vegetation water content from NDII were: RMSE = 3. 17 %, nRMSE = 4. 13 %, MAE = 2. 52 % and R²= 0. 64. For MSI, these indicator were RMSE = 3. 28 %, nRMSE = 4. 29 %, MAE = 2. 68 % and R²= 0. 61. In a second step, we delimited the <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> in the studied perimeter using a supervised classification method.

Based on the regression model resulting from the comparison between NDII and measured vegetation water content, we produced maps of vegetation water content of wheat over the whole Beni-Moussa East irrigated area (41, 000 hectares). The results of this work demonstrated the potential of spectral indices (NDII and MSI) derived from SPOT 5 satellite images data to quantify and map vegetation water content of wheat. It showed also the potential of the SWIR band to improve the monitoring of irrigation by mapping water stress of wheat at field and regional level. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Arable farming {{systems in}} the Netherlands are {{characterized}} by crop rotations in which potato, sugar beet, spring onion, winter wheat and spring barley {{are the most important}} crops. The objectives of this study were to decompose crop yield gaps within such rotations into efficiency, resource and technology yield gaps and to explain those yield gaps based on observed cropping frequencies and alternative farmers' objectives. Data from specialized Dutch arable farms between 2008 and 2012 were used. Production frontiers and efficiency yield gaps were estimated using the stochastic frontier framework. The resource yield gap was quantified through the estimation of highest farmers' yields (Y HF, average across farms with actual yields above the 90 th percentile). Crop model simulations and variety trials were compiled to assess climatic potential yields (Yp) and technology yield gaps. The contribution of crop area shares and farmers' objectives to actual yields were assessed using regression analysis and based on five different farm level indicators (N production, energy production, gross margin, nitrogen-use efficiency and labour use), respectively. The average yield gap per crop (as percentage of Yp which is given in parentheses) was: 29. 2 % (of 72. 6 t ha − 1) for ware potato, 39. 7 % (of 71. 6 t ha − 1) for starch potato, 26. 4 % (of 107. 1 t ha − 1) for sugar beet, 32. 3 % (of 88. 3 t ha − 1) for spring onion, 25. 2 % (of 12. 3 t ha − 1) for winter wheat and 37. 5 % (of 10. 4 t ha − 1) for spring barley. The efficiency yield gap ranged between 6. 6 % (starch potato) and 18. 1 % (spring onion) of Yp. The resource yield gap was lower than 10 % of Yp for all the crops and the technology yield gap ranged between 7. 1 % (ware potato) and 30. 7 % of Yp (starch potato). There were statistically significant effects of potato (positive quadratic) and onion (positive) area shares on ware potato, sugar beet and winter wheat yields, of sugar beet area share (positive quadratic) on winter wheat yield and of <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> share (negative) on sugar beet and winter wheat yields. Farmers' objectives explain part of the variability observed in crop yields which were 7 – 24 %, 13 – 24 % and 12 – 32 % lower than Y HF, respectively, for gross margin maximising, labour minimising and N use efficiency maximising farms. In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between gross margin and the yield of ware potato, sugar beet and winter wheat. By contrast, no significant relationships were found between crop yields and NUE or labour use. We conclude that most of the yield gap is explained by the efficiency yield gap for ware potato and spring onion and by both the efficiency and technology yield gaps for sugar beet and cereals. The resource yield gap explains most of the yield gap of seed potato, and the technology yield gap of starch potato. The results regarding the effects of cropping frequency and crop rotations to crop yields are not very conclusive which suggest that agronomic principles become less evident at 'systems level’ given the number of interacting factors at crop rotation level. Finally, although N and energy production are lower for gross margin maximising farms, most crop yields are not significantly different between farms with the highest N and energy production compared to farms performing best on economic (gross margin) objectives. </p...|$|E

Thus, temporal profiles of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from MODIS sensor, from April to December of the 2000 to 2008, were analyzed. Firstly, crop masks were elaborated by subtracting the minimum NDVI image (April to May) from the maximum NDVI image (June to October). Then, an unsupervised classification of NDVI images was carried out (Isodata), considering the crop mask areas. According to the results, crop masks allowed the identification of pixels with greatest green biomass variation. This variation might be associated or not with winter <b>cereals</b> <b>areas</b> established to grain production. The unsupervised classification generated classes in which NDVI temporal profiles were associated with water bodies, pastures, winter cereals for grain production and for soil cover. Temporal NDVI profiles of the class winter cereals for grain production were in agree with crop patterns in the region (developmental stage, management standard and sowing dates). Therefore, unsupervised classification based on crop masks allows distinguishing and monitoring winter cereal crops, which were similar in terms of morphology and phenology...|$|R

40|$|Nautakarjatiloilla rehuviljan tuotanto tapahtuu suhteellisen pienissä yksiköissä eikä se nykyisillä viljan hinnoilla ole kovin taloudellista. Lisäksi eräät viimeaikojen tukiratkaisut ovat hieman parantaneet nurmirehun asemaa viljaan verrattuna. Nautakarjatilojen puimuri-investoinneista päätellen omaa rehuviljaa tuotetaan jatkossa yhä harvemmalla tilalla. Aktiivitiloille tehdyn kyselyn perusteella vain yksi maitotila sadasta aikoo hankkia ajopuimurin lähivuosina. Myös yhä useampi viljelijä vähentää rehuviljan suhteellista alaa, luopuu rehuviljan viljelystä tai on epävarma koko tilan tulevaisuuden suhteen. Koska useilla nautakarjatiloilla tukiehtojen mukainen lannankäyttö koetaan ongelmaksi jo nyt, viljan jääminen pois viljelykierrosta vaikeuttaa tilannetta yhä enemmän. Nurmirehuntuotannossa keskeisimpiä ongelmia ovat nurmen uudistamisen, viljelykasvivalinnan ja lannankäytön yhteensovittaminen. Rehuviljaa korvaavaksi vaihtoehdoksi viljelykierrossa on esitetty kokoviljasäilörehua, jossa on mukana koko kasvusto eli jyvät, lehdet ja korsi. Tällä menetelmällä päästäisiin yhteen peltoviljelyn koneketjuun ja vältettäisiin rehuviljan puintiin ja kuivatukseen liittyvät työ- ja pääomakustannukset. Kokoviljasäilörehun viljelyä, tuotantotekniikkaa, ruokintavaikutuksia ja taloudellista kannattavuutta selvitetään usean tutkimuslaitoksen yhteistyönä. Selvitettävänä on, voidaanko nautakarjatiloilla perinteinen rehuviljanviljely korvata ja nurmet uudistaa viljakasvustolla, josta tietyssä kehitysvaiheessa tehdään säilörehua. Tyypillisillä maitotiloilla siirtyminen viherlinjaan muuttaa viljelykiertoa ja karjalannan käyttömahdollisuuksia. Kun rehuvilja ostetaan tilan ulkopuolelta, eläinmäärien ja nurmi- ja kokoviljarehun tuotannon sekä lannankäytön välille joudutaan hakemaan uusi ympäristönormit huomioon ottava tasapaino. This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the current state, problems and plans for the near future related to the cereal and grass production on cattle farms. Production has been examined {{on the basis of the}} proportional shares of cereal and grass fodder area as well as farmers intentions concerning changes in fodder production. The study also covers the current state and future prospects of farming, and it is based on mailed questionnaires directed at the farms participating in the profitability bookkeeping of the Agricultural Economics Research Institute in spring 1999 as well as DataLaari farm panel made by the Food Facts Ltd. in 1998. Both inquiries concern the situation after autumn 1998, i. e. following an exceptionally bad crop year. About half of the cattle farms plan to continue fodder production in the current extent and with the same proportional shares of grass and cereal fodder. The willingness to continue production is the highest on bookkeeping farms practising cattle husbandry, while farms that participated in the farm panel expressed more intentions related to changes in fodder production due to uncertainty or plans to quit production. In terms of the different parts of the country as well as active farms and the farm panel, the intentions to change fodder production deviate mainly for the part of Ostrobothnia, where uncertainty was more common and many farms refused to participate in the study. The planning of the fodder production is particularly difficult due to the uncertainty related to the EU membership as well as the Agenda 2000 process, which was underway when the inquiry was made. About half of the farms consider that Agenda 2000 will have no effect on their fodder production, but almost a fifth of all cattle farms were unable to estimate the future of their fodder production or did not answer the questions. About half of the bookkeeping farms practising cattle husbandry expects the efficiency of arable crop production to continue to decrease, and according to about a quarter the <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> is going to fall as a result of Agenda 2000. Whole cereal, i. e. cereals where part of the straw and the whole ear is used as fodder, was cultivated for either green fodder or silage on about a quarter of dairy farms participating in the bookkeeping in 1999. On other cattle farms whole cereal was not produced at all. On dairy farms producing whole cereal the average area under this was a little over four hectares. The farms expressed no intentions to increase the area of whole cereal, and the introduction of whole cereal fodder was considered on very few of the farms where cattle husbandry was based on grass fodder only. The use of whole cereal fodder is examined in a joint project, primarily between the Agricultural Research Centre and Agricultural Economics Research Institute. An economic study will be published in the beginning of 2000 concerning the comparison of the milk production cost at the farm level between whole cereal and grass feeding. vokMTT Taloustutkimus MTT...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the number}} of undernourished people in the {{developing}} world and the increasingly complex risks to food security, policymakers are faced with an enormous agenda. Freeing people from hunger will require more and better-targeted investments, innovations, and policy actions, driven by a keen understanding of the dynamic risks and forces that shape the factors affecting people’s access to food and the links with nutrition. The International Food Policy Research Institute’s (IFPRI’s) International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) provides insight into the management of these risks through appropriate policy actions. By projecting future global food scenarios to 2050, IMPACT explores the potential implications of policy action and inaction in several main risk areas as well as the effects on child malnutrition {{in the developing world}}, commodity prices, demand, cereal yields, production, and net trade. In the progressive policy actions scenario, which assumes increased investment in rural development, health, education, and agricultural research and development, developing country governments and the international community are able to dramatically reduce {{the number of}} food-insecure people, leading to a worldwide decline in hunger. Under these conditions, Latin America and China are able to virtually eliminate child malnutrition by 2050. Bolstered by the development and dissemination of improved technologies and better infrastructure, crop production and yields increase in developing countries. Notably, the bulk of the growth in production is driven by yield increases rather than by expanding land area. Spurred by growth in the agricultural sector, average incomes in developing countries increase. Rising incomes bolster demand for high-value agricultural products, such as meat, dairy, and fruits and vegetables; global livestock production more than doubles, for example. Average per capita calorie supplies for developing countries exceed 3, 400 per day, well in excess of minimum requirements. The policy failure scenario assumes greater political discord and more extensive agricultural protectionism, together with the failure of policies to deal with food emergencies related to conflict. Slow growth and trade restrictions lead to stagnation in average per capita calorie availability, which remains only slightly above minimum requirements until after 2030, when availability increases. In addition, crucial investments in agriculture, rural development, and poverty reduction are forgone or displaced. Because of limited investment in agricultural research and technology, this scenario has a high level of crop area expansion as a result of relatively rapid population growth and slim yield improvements in developing countries. This scenario also results in flat maize prices, declining per capita cereal demand, falling beef prices, and relatively flat meat demand. As a result of the policies in this scenario, the number of malnourished children in developing countries rises between 1997 and 2015, after which there are only modest declines. In the technology and natural resource management failure scenario, yield growth falls even more than under the preceding scenario, forcing farmers to move into marginal producing areas, which causes a more rapid expansion of <b>cereal</b> <b>area</b> into less productive land that does not compensate for the yield shortfalls (and causes environmental degradation). As a result, cereal prices rise substantially through 2030 and then fall off only gradually. Beef and other meat prices, which are affected by the price of feed, follow a similar pattern. Developing-country per capita calorie availability is essentially unchanged over 1997 – 2050 and remains at a barely adequate average level. Given unequal access to the food that is available, millions of people actually consume less than the minimum. The occurrence of child undernourishment is even higher than under the policy failure scenario in all developing-country regions. Overall, the technology and natural resource management failure scenario results in the worst impact on food security and child malnourishment in the developing world. The progressive policy scenario outlines several of the most crucial positive steps. National governments and the international community must assume a new focus on agricultural growth and rural development, along with increasing their investments in education, social services, and health. Policies to encourage synergistic growth in the nonfarm sectors are also needed to spur broad-based economic growth. Underpinning these strategies and research agendas must be a firm commitment to reducing hunger and improving the welfare of the world’s undernourished people.
