5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was backed up by a formidable logistical support base that <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there was}} talk of making a film about the Maharishi in {{co-operation}} with Apple Films, it was discovered that he was independently negotiating with ABC in the US to create a TV special featuring the band. Two visits by business manager Peter Brown to the Maharishi—who was lecturing in Malmö, Sweden—and one by Harrison and McCartney, failed to stop him proclaiming that he <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> the band for a TV show.|$|E

5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried in tanks so that they <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, and at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. They found that the Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> results in line with its capacity.|$|E
5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military and led them {{to find a new}} approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, it should not be attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E

5|$|As a {{follow-on}} to the Mach 1 capable North American F-100 Super Sabre, the F-105 {{was also}} armed with missiles and a cannon; however, its design was tailored to high-speed low-altitude penetration carrying a single nuclear weapon internally. First flown in 1955, the Thunderchief entered service in 1958. The single-engine F-105 <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> a greater bomb load than some American heavy bombers of World War II {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator. The F-105 {{was one of the}} primary attack aircraft of the Vietnam War; over 20,000 Thunderchief sorties were flown, with 382 aircraft lost including 62 operational (non-combat) losses (out of the 833 produced). Although less agile than smaller MiG fighters, USAF F-105s were credited with 27.5 kills.|$|E
5|$|Before {{implementing}} Steam, Valve Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base disconnecting for several days. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only grow with planned Internet expansion in the following years, and recognized that they <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> game content faster to players than through retail channels. Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plans}} for the British {{airborne}} operations were being discussed, Lieutenant-Colonel George Chatterton, the commander of No. 2 Wing, Glider Pilot Regiment, brought up a problem with the only glider then in theatre, the American Waco CG-4, known in British service as the Hadrian: its small size. The Waco's capacity was only two pilots and thirteen troops, and for cargo either a jeep or an artillery gun but not both together. The plan for Operation Ladbroke involved a coup de main assault on the Ponte Grande Bridge by the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. Using the Horsa glider, which could carry twenty-seven troops or a jeep and gun together, they <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> a larger force at the bridge during the initial assault. Chatterton decided he needed around forty Horsas, as well as the American Wacos, for the British missions.|$|E

5|$|William Russell, {{senior partner}} of 'Russell, Majors, and Waddell' {{and one of}} the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential {{election}} as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> the U.S. Mail. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an unrivaled feat at the time.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety margins and spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was {{populated}} with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the University of California at San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E
5000|$|Superimposed {{schedules}} {{of reinforcement}} are {{a type of}} compound schedule that evolved from the initial work on simple schedules of reinforcement by B.F. Skinner and his colleagues (Skinner and Ferster, 1957). They demonstrated that reinforcers <b>could</b> be <b>delivered</b> on schedules, and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules. Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time {{as a consequence of}} some behavior, a reinforcer <b>could</b> be <b>delivered</b> after more than one instance of the behavior. For example, a pigeon may be required to peck a button switch ten times before food appears. This is a [...] "ratio schedule". Also, a reinforcer <b>could</b> be <b>delivered</b> after an interval of time passed following a target behavior. An example is a rat that is given a food pellet immediately following the first response that occurs after two minutes has elapsed since the last lever press. This is called an [...] "interval schedule".|$|R

5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate decking armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, the Portland Water Committee, {{predecessor}} of the Portland Water Bureau, began {{a search}} for a superior drinking water source. The committee, led by Henry Failing, commissioned Isaac W. Smith, an engineer and surveyor, to inspect any viable water supply in the region. Smith chose the Bull Run River, and a five-month survey trip led him to conclude that a gravity-flow system <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> clean water from Bull Run to Portland. In 1892, U.S. President Benjamin Harrison signed a proclamation creating a protected area, the Bull Run Reserve, in the watershed. By 1895 Portland had built a diversion dam on the Bull Run River, and completed its first conduit (Conduit 1) to carry Bull Run water to the city. At {{about the same time as}} the Smith survey, a small farming community, at first named Unavilla but renamed Bull Run in 1895, grew up near the confluence of the Bull Run and Sandy rivers. Meanwhile, improvements to the Barlow Road encouraged population growth along the lower Sandy and the establishment of cities like Gresham and Sandy. Even so, by 1900 much of the upper Sandy basin was still remote, wild, and accessible mainly by trails.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Plateosaurus {{is small and}} narrow, {{rectangular}} in side view, and nearly three times {{as long as it}} is high. There is an almost rectangular lateral temporal foramen at the back. The large, round orbit (eye socket), the sub-triangular antorbital fenestra and the oval naris (nostril) are of almost equal size. The jaws carried many small, leaf-shaped, socketed teeth: 5 to 6 per premaxilla, 24 to 30 per maxilla, and 21 to 28 per dentary (lower jaw). The thick, leaf-shaped, bluntly serrated tooth crowns were suitable for crushing plant material. The low position of the jaw joint gave the chewing muscles great leverage, so that Plateosaurus <b>could</b> <b>deliver</b> a powerful bite. These features suggest that it fed primarily to exclusively on plants. Its eyes were directed to the sides, rather than the front, providing all-round vision to watch for predators. Some fossil skeletons have preserved sclerotic rings (rings of bone plates that protect the eye).|$|E
