5|$|On December 14, 2014 Naasón Joaquín García, {{the fifth}} {{born of the}} Joaquin family, became the spiritual leader and {{international}} director of La Luz del Mundo church. Naasón was born on May 7, 1969 and previously served as pastor in Santa Ana, California. After almost three years of arduous work Naasón continues to lead the church, with ambition to fulfill a promise he received from God in a vision, that La Luz del Mundo <b>Church</b> <b>will</b> grow to a number that he could never imagine or perceive. He also urges the youth {{and members of the}} church to join him in spreading their doctrine {{to the ends of the}} earth.|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, smaller <b>churches</b> <b>will</b> feature bright lighting, large windows, {{a simple}} {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger <b>churches</b> <b>will</b> have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many <b>churches</b> <b>will</b> include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|R

5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but do not try to persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the <b>church</b> <b>will</b> not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the <b>church</b> <b>will</b> protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
25|$|Historic, or Classic Premillennialism is distinctively non-dispensational. This {{means that}} it sees no radical {{theological}} distinction between Israel and the Church. It is often post-tribulational, meaning that the rapture of the <b>church</b> <b>will</b> occur {{after a period of}} tribulation. Historic premillennialism maintains chiliasm because of its view that the <b>church</b> <b>will</b> be caught up to meet Christ in the air and then escort him to the earth in order to share in his literal thousand year rule. Proponents of the view include Charles Spurgeon and George Eldon Ladd.|$|E

25|$|In the {{introductory}} paragraph, Colet concludes {{by stating that}} his presence {{is due to the}} need for the Council to consider a Church reformation. First, Colet criticises the living style of the priests. Colet explains that the priests should set an example for others as be a beacon of light, because if they are instead figures of darkness, the <b>Church</b> <b>will</b> be engulfed by darkness. Colet cites four evils, referencing the Apostle, that constitute the corrupt, priestly living: devilish pride, carnal concupiscence, worldly covetousness, and worldly occupations.|$|E

25|$|In 1817, {{under the}} auspices of King Frederick William III of Prussia, the Lutheran {{congregation}} of Kaulsdorf, like most Prussian Protestant congregations, joined the common umbrella organisation then called the Evangelical Church in Prussia (under this name since 1821), with each congregation maintaining its former denomination or adopting the new united denomination (Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church). The Kaulsdorf church still being subordinate to the ius patronatus of the Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, the king's court <b>church,</b> <b>will</b> most probably have promptly joined the Prussian Union.|$|E
25|$|Divine Liturgy of the Last Supper is held on {{the morning}} of Great and Holy Thursday, {{combining}} Vespers with the Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the Holy Table (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and monasteries it is customary for the bishop or hegumen (abbot) to celebrate the Washing of Feet.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the procession, the Epitaphios {{is brought}} back to the church. Sometimes, after the clergy carry the Epitaphios in, they will stop just inside the {{entrance}} to the church, and hold the Epitaphios above the door, so that all who enter the <b>church</b> <b>will</b> pass under it (symbolically entering into the grave with Christ) and then kiss the Gospel Book. In Greek churches, the Epitaphios is then brought directly to the sanctuary, where it remains on the Holy Table until Ascension Thursday. In Slavic churches, it is brought back to the catafalque {{in the middle of the}} church (and may be honoured further with more petals, rosewater and incense), where it remains until the Midnight Office at the Paschal Vigil on Great Saturday night. Where the Epitaphios remains in the centre of the church, the faithful will continue to venerate it throughout Great Saturday.|$|E

25|$|Thorstein Eriksson {{resolves}} {{to go to}} Vinland for {{the body}} of his brother. The same ship is prepared yet again and Thorstein sets sail with a crew of 25 and his wife Gudrid (ON: Guðríðr). The expedition never reaches Vinland and after sailing the whole summer, the ship ends up back at the coast of Greenland. During the winter, Thorstein falls ill and dies but speaks out of his dead body and tells the fortune of his wife Gudrid. He predicts that Gudrid will marry an Icelander and have {{a long line of}} “promising, bright and fine, sweet and well-scented” descendants. Thorstein also predicts that she will leave Greenland for Norway and from there she will set out for Iceland. She will, however, live so long that she outlives her husband. Once her husband passes, Thorstein foresaw, she would travel abroad once again, going south on a pilgrimage and then return to her farm in Iceland. When she returns, a <b>church</b> <b>will</b> be built. From the time it is built until she dies, she will remain there and take holy orders.|$|E

500|$|The Statement of Fundamental Truths {{articles}} 13 and 14 {{articulate the}} Assemblies of God's official teaching {{on the return}} of Christ to Earth.

The rapture of the <b>Church</b> <b>will</b> be followed by Christ's visible return to earth and his reign of 1,000 years. This millennial reign will usher in the salvation {{of the nation of}} Israel and universal peace. The Assemblies of God is specifically opposed to the theologies and practices of universal salvation, setting dates for Christ's return, post-Tribulation rapture, and amillennialism.|$|E
