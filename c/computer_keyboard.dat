Roland {{returns to the}} lab {{and is in the}} process of pushing the prototype engine to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard</b> and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|The PC port was {{outsourced}} by Eidos Montréal by Nixxes Software, {{who also}} worked with Eidos on multiple projects including the PC port of Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. The decision to outsource the PC port was made because the team {{wanted to make a}} quality port, but their team could not handle the three different versions. Nixxes were chosen as they had already been collaborating with the project, were a trusted port developer, and had a deep understanding of the game's engine. The two teams kept in constant contact, working from the same code base so the PC and console versions were as close as possible in terms of content and graphics. To create the port, Nixxes developed a DirectX 11 that the PC version would use, which enabled the inclusion of multiple graphical tweaks and extra touches such as adding tessellation and extra anti-aliasing options. The controls and HUD were customized to work with a <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The initial response to the announcement of the PC port's outsourcing was mixed, which made the teams more determined to deliver a high-quality port. Further technical assistance was provided by Advanced Micro Devices. The game was also ported to Apple Inc.'s OS X platform. First announced in September 2011 after the other versions were released, the porting was handled by Feral Interactive, who had made a name for themselves porting titles such as Bioshock and Max Payne to the platform.|$|E

25|$|Control-Alt-Delete, often {{abbreviated}} as Ctrl-Alt-Del, is a <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard</b> command on PC compatible {{systems that}} can be used to reboot a computer, and summon the task manager or operating system. It is invoked by pressing the Delete key while holding the Control and Alt keys: Ctrl+Alt+Delete.

25|$|Michael Bloomberg's 1997 {{autobiography}} {{contains a}} chapter entitled Computers for Virgins, which explains {{the differences in}} the design of the terminal and its keyboard from the standard IBM PC keyboard layout that was popular at that time. The terminal's keyboard layout was designed for traders and market makers who had no prior computer experience. While the look and feel of the Bloomberg keyboard is very similar to the standard <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard,</b> there are several enhancements that help users navigate through the system, from the idea for a user-friendly system when originally designed in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Turing test, {{developed}} by Alan Turing in 1950, {{is a test}} of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware {{that one of the}} two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard</b> and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. The test does not check the ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely answers resemble those a human would give.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard <b>computer</b> <b>keyboard,</b> although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E
500|$|Pathways into Darkness is a first-person shooter and {{adventure}} game. The game interface {{consists of four}} windows.

[...] or [...] "Hi!"), attack, and jump.
