5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

Spring precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> influenced mainly by PDO. Winter precipitation <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> influenced by more climate oscillations.

[...] Perhaps the best way to explain how the interpretation of the riot <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> by looking at the change in the public perceptions of its antagonist: [...] "It was necessary to overlook some of [...] character traits and to rewrite several episodes of his career" [...] in order to elevate him into a mythical figure.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the strike, Pittston was a strong coal company and the area was full of strikers protesting. [...] Since the strike, many of Pittston's coal plants have been sold to Alpha Natural Resources, which is now in the nation’s top three coal companies, in order to pay for the health care for the miners. After the strike ended, Moss 3 was {{demolished}} and a new plant was built and named after it, and the recreational park that became Camp Solidarity has been reclaimed by nature and is now an open field. Though the physical aspects of the area have changed since the strike has ended, what has not <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> the feeling that the miners of Pittston accomplished – a win for their own benefits as well as benefits for the UMWA. The union’s actions during the strike made it possible for thousands of miners to receive health care and retirement funds for years to come.|$|E
500|$|The {{first name}} of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion, since a real Mary Crane existed in Phoenix. Also <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> the novel's budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock {{preferred}} to focus the audience's attention on {{the solution to the}} mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam Loomis seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman's pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. (Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother at the time of writing the film.) The novel is more violent than the film; for instance, Crane is beheaded in the shower as opposed to being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion's telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect, since toilets were virtually never seen in American cinema in the 1960s. The location of Arbogast's death was moved from the foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about [...] "Mother" [...] without tipping that something was being hidden. As Janet Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.|$|E

500|$|Mileena is {{physically}} identical to Kitana, the most glaring exception being her half-Tarkata face with large and exposed fang-like teeth (which got noticeably downsized for Deception and Armageddon). Boon described Mileena as [...] "Anti-Kitana" [...] {{and said that}} her large [...] "sharp, nasty teeth" [...] have been not originally planned and were only drawn for her infamous Fatality [...] "Man-Eater" [...] (featured in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, too), in which she sucks up the entire body of her victims and then regurgitates their clean bones. After Mortal Kombat II, her teeth were almost never used again during gameplay until Mortal Kombat 2011 (in a leap attack to bite an opponent in the neck and in one Fatality to gnaw on the killed enemy's severed head), with a sole exception of one Fatality in Deception in which she uses them to tear off the opponent's head. Mileena's skin color appears to be at times mildly darker than Kitana's, but is always lighter than Jade's. After the two were given more varying appearances in Mortal Kombat Gold (hairstyle for Kitana-derived characters is loose in Mortal Kombat II and pinned back in Ultimate MK3), Mileena's hair is usually much shorter than Kitana's and is most often worn gathered in a ponytail. One element of Mileena's anatomy that has often <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> her eyes. As her supposed twin sister, Mileena shared Kitana's eyes in Mortal Kombat II; her eyes then became [...] "undead" [...] style all-white (similar to the eyes of Scorpion and Noob Saibot) in Ultimate MK3. In Deception, Armageddon and Shaolin Monks, Mileena's eyes return to normal, but with yellow pupils (Kitana's eyes are brown). In Mortal Kombat 2011, however, she has Baraka-like yellow eyes with slit pupils (her eyes are also sometimes seen as glowing whole), except of her alternate Ultimate MK3 style costume (available through pre-order bonuses and later in a DLC package) in which she has human eyes once again. In Mortal Kombat X, her facial appearance has undergone drastic changes on her facial appearance based on those from Mortal Kombat Legacy live-action series, such as having a human-like mouth, yet still retain most of her Tarkatan mouth, as seen on both of her cheeks.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have claimed}} that the Qur'an does not {{identify}} or allude to Jerusalem as being the first Qiblah and {{that the practice of}} facing Jerusalem is only mentioned in traditional biographies of Muhammad and hadith collections. There is also disagreement as to when the practice started and for how long it lasted. Some sources say the Jerusalem Qiblah was used for a period of between sixteen and eighteen months. The Jewish custom of facing Jerusalem for prayer may have influenced the Muslim Qiblah. Others surmise that the use of Jerusalem as the direction of prayer was to either induce the Jews of Medina to convert to Islam or to [...] "win over their hearts". When relations with the Jews soured, Muhammad changed the Qiblah towards Mecca. Another reason given why the Qiblah was <b>changed</b> <b>is</b> that Jews viewed the use of Jerusalem as signalling the Muslims' intention of joining their religion. It was changed to discredit this assumption. Others state that it was changed because Muhammad was angered by that city or its people, and not because of his conflict with the Jews.|$|E
