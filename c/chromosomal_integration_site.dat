40|$|Cells of the {{oligodendrocyte}} lineage {{go through}} a complex sequence of division, migration and differentiation. In transgenic mice in which the first exon of myelin basic protein (MBP) has been replaced with the Lac Z reporter gene, Lac Z expression emerges adjacent to the putative source of the oligodendrocyte lineage, after PDGFaR-expressing progenitors have left the ventricular zone. This suggests transcriptional activity at the MBP locus begins in oligodendrocytes at the premyelinating stage of development. Low-level Lac Z expression is also observed in the presumptive grey matter from embryonic day 12 (E 12). In contrast, transgenic mice bearing Lac Z fused to various lengths of the MBP promoter suggest that, while capable of driving expression in oligodendrocytes, the MBP promoter is unexpectedly sensitive to deregulation from elements adjacent to its <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site.</b> Expression of one construct may identify transcription factors involved in establishing the oligodendrocyte lineage as early as E 9...|$|E
40|$|Temperate bacteriophages play an {{important}} role in the pathogenicity of Staphylococcus aureus, for instance, by mediating the horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors. Here we established a classification scheme for staphylococcal prophages of the major Siphoviridae family based on integrase gene polymorphism. Seventy-one published genome sequences of staphylococcal phages were clustered into distinct integrase groups which were related to the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> and to the encoded virulence gene content. Analysis of three marker modules (lysogeny, tail, and lysis) for phage functional units revealed that these phages exhibit different degrees of genome mosaicism. The prevalence of prophages in a representative S. aureus strain collection consisting of 386 isolates of diverse origin was determined. By linking the phage content to dominant S. aureus clonal complexes we could show that the distribution of bacteriophages varied remarkably between lineages, indicating restriction-based barriers. A comparison of colonizing and invasive S. aureus strain populations revealed that hlb-converting phages were significantly more frequent in colonizing strains...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{recombinant}} monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) {{are commonly}} produced by high-expressing, clonal, mammalian cells. Creation of these clones for manufacturing remains heavily reliant on stringent selection and gene amplification, {{which in turn}} can lead to genetic instability, variable expression, product heterogeneity and prolonged development timelines. Inclusion of cis-acting ubiquitous chromatin opening elements (UCOE™) in mammalian expression vectors {{has been shown to}} improve productivity and facilitate high-level gene expression irrespective of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> without lengthy gene amplification protocols. In this study we have used high-throughput robotic clone selection in combination with UCOE™ containing expression vectors to develop a rapid, streamlined approach for early-stage cell line development and isolation of high-expressing clones for mAb production using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Our results demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} go from transfection to stable clones in only 4 weeks, while achieving specific productivities exceeding 20 pg/cell/day. Furthermore, we have used this approach to quickly screen several process-crucial parameters including IgG subtype, enhancer-promoter combination and UCOE™ length. The use of UCOE™-containing vectors in combination with automated robotic selection provides a rapid method for the selection of stable, high-expressing clones...|$|E

Five different <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> were found in nine individuals. Only one site was identified in each individual, each site was {{in the vicinity of}} the telomeric region and was on either the p or q arm of only one of the two chromosome homologues. The sites were 9 q 34. 3, 10 q 26. 3, 11 p 15. 5, 17 p 13. 3, and 19 q 13. 4, of which three have not been previously identified. For 9 q 34. 3 the <b>site</b> of <b>integration</b> was further mapped using a locus-specific probe for 9 q 34. 3 together with a pan-telomeric probe and both co-localized with the HHV- 6 signal. Similarly an arm-specific telomeric probe for 19 q co-localized with the HHV- 6 signal. It was therefore concluded that the <b>site</b> of <b>integration</b> is actually within the telomere. The number of viral DNA copies/cell was calculated in blood, LCL cells and hair follicles and was one or more in every case for each of the nine individuals. This result was confirmed by FISH where 100 % of cells gave an HHV- 6 signal. These findings add to previous reports suggesting that integrated HHV- 6 DNA is found in every cell in the body and transmitted vertically. Finally, including our data, worldwide seven different chromosomal sites of HHV- 6 integration have now been identified. Large epidemiological studies of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> are required to identify further telomeric sites, geographical or racial variation and possible clinical consequences...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method of specifically modifying the mammalian genome in vivo. This procedure comprises heritable tissue-specific and site-specific DNA recombination {{as a function of}} recombinase expression in transgenic mice. Transgenes encoding the bacteriophage P 1 Cre recombinase and the loxP-flanked beta-galactosidase gene were used to generate transgenic mice. Genomic DNA from doubly transgenic mice exhibited tissue-specific DNA recombination as a result of Cre expression. Further characterization revealed that this process was highly efficient at distinct <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> These studies also imply that Cre-mediated recombination provides a heritable marker for mitoses following the loss of Cre expression. This transgene-recombination system permits unique approaches to in vivo studies of gene function within experimentally defined spatial and temporal boundaries...|$|R
40|$|The β-lactam {{resistance}} gene mecA of Staphylococcus aureus {{is carried}} by a novel mobile genetic element, designated staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), {{identified in the}} chromosome of a Japanese methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain. We now report identification of two additional types of mecA-carrying genetic elements found in the MRSA strains isolated in other countries of the world. There were substantial differences in the size and nucleotide sequences between the elements and the SCCmec. However, new elements shared the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> with the SCCmec. Structural analysis of the new elements revealed that they possessed all of the salient features of the SCCmec: conserved terminal inverted repeats and direct repeats at the integration junction points, conserved genetic organization around the mecA gene, {{and the presence of}} cassette chromosome recombinase (ccr) genes responsible for the movements of SCCmec. The elements, therefore, were considered to comprise the SCCmec family of staphylococcal mobile genetic elements together with the previously identified SCCmec. Among 38 epidemic MRSA strains isolated in 20 countries, 34 were shown to possess one of the three typical SCCmec elements on the chromosome. Our findings indicated that {{there are at least three}} distinct MRSA clones in the world with different types of SCCmec in their chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Using a Moloney leukemia {{virus vector}} {{containing}} the bacterial neo gene, we demonstrate that retrovirus vectors {{can be used}} to introduce genes into the mouse germ line. Infection of preimplantation embryos with the vector MLV-NEO. 1 resulted in integration of neo sequences in approximately equal to 10 % of the progeny mice. One of these animals, mouse F. 2, contained approximately six MLV-NEO. 1 proviruses at independent integration sites, each present at less than a single copy per cell. This mosaic mouse transmitted one of these proviruses to her offspring, producing a line of transgenic mice carrying a full-length, unrearranged MLV. NEO. 1 provirus at a single <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site.</b> Mice homozygous at this MLV-NEO. 1 locus have also been produced. No expression of the neo gene has been detected in the transgenic mice, either by screening of primary bone marrow or lung cells for resistance to G 418 or by RNA transfer blot analysis of RNA from several tissues. In addition, the neo gene was found to be extensively methylated in the transgenic mice; however, treatment of primary cells with 5 -azacytidine did not induce G 418 resistance. The inactivity of the MLV-NEO. 1 provirus in transgenic mice and potential means of eliciting neo expression under these conditions are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> of the {{structural}} gene of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) in the genome of BALB/Mo mice was mapped genetically. These mice transmit the exogenous M-MuLV as an endogenous virus at a single Mendelian locus. Two independent experimental approaches were used: (i) Non-virus-producing fibroblasts prepared from homozygous BALB/Mo embryos were fused to Chinese hamster Wg 3 -h-o cells. In an analysis of 30 independent mouse-Chinese hamster cell hybrid clones, the segregation of the viral genome measured by molecular hybridization and enzymes assigned to 16 different mouse chromosomes were compared. We found a highly concordant segregation of M-MuLV sequences and the mouse enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI, EC 5. 3. 1. 1), whose gene has been assigned to chromosome 6. A further karyotype analysis of 9 clones, in which the chromosomes were identified cytochemically, supported this result. (ii) The segregation of the viral genome was studied in backcrosses of BALB/Mo with ABP/J mice. In the backcross ABP/J×(ABP/J×BALB/Mo) a linkage of the M-MuLV genome to the morphological marker wa- 1 on mouse chromosome 6 was found. This confirmed {{the conclusion that the}} M-MuLV genome is integrated in mouse chromosome 6. These experiments define the genetic locus Mov- 1, denoting the genetically transmitted structural gene of M-MuLV in BALB/Mo mice...|$|E

Neither a casual relationship between XMRV infection and prostate cancer nor a mechanism of tumori-genesis has been established. To determine the <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> preferences of XMRV and the potential risk of proviral insertional mutagenesis, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of viral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in the prostate cell line DU 145 after an acute XMRV infection and compared the <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> pattern of XMRV with those found for murine leukemia virus and two human retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Among all retroviruses analyzed, XMRV has the strongest preference for transcription start sites, CpG islands, DNase-hypersensitive sites, and gene-dense regions; all are features frequently associated with structurally open transcription regulatory regions of a chromosome. Analyses of XMRV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in tissues from prostate cancer patients found a similar preference for the aforementioned chromosomal features. Additionally, XMRV <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in cancer tissues were associated with cancer breakpoints, common fragile sites, microRNA, and cancer-related genes, suggesting a selection process that favors certain <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> In both acutely infected cells and cancer tissues, n...|$|R

However, the dearth of genetic tools available to control and monitor protein production precludes rapid and predictable metabolic engineering that is possible in hosts such as Escherichia coli or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In an effort to improve genetic tools for Streptomyces venezuelae, we developed a suite of standardized, orthogonal integration vectors and an improved method to monitor protein production in this host. These tools were applied to characterize heterologous promoters and various attB <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> A final study leveraged the characterized toolset to demonstrate its use in producing the biofuel precursor bisabolene using a chromosomally integrated expression system.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of multidrug-resistant (MDR) typhoid {{is a major}} global health threat affecting many countries where the disease is endemic. Here whole-genome sequence analysis of 1, 832 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) identifies a single dominant MDR lineage, H 58, that has emerged and spread throughout Asia and Africa over the last 30 years. Our analysis identifies numerous transmissions of H 58, including multiple transfers from Asia to Africa and an ongoing, unrecognized MDR epidemic within Africa itself. Notably, our analysis indicates that H 58 lineages are displacing antibiotic-sensitive isolates, transforming the global population structure of this pathogen. H 58 isolates can harbor a complex MDR element residing either on transmissible IncHI 1 plasmids or within multiple <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> We also identify new mutations that define the H 58 lineage. This phylogeographical analysis provides a framework to facilitate global management of MDR typhoid and is applicable to similar MDR lineages emerging in other bacterial species...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of transgene loci in mammals often {{occurs in a}} heterocellular fashion resulting in variegated patterns of expression. We have examined the effect of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site,</b> copy number, and transcriptionally activating sequences on the variegation of a keratin 5 -lacZ (K 5 Z) construct in the stratified epithelia of transgenic mice. lacZ expression in these mice is always mosaic, and the beta-gal activity per cell is usually higher in the lines with {{a higher proportion of}} expressing cells. Similar constructs, in which cDNAs were exchanged by lacZ sequences, showed no variegation. Also, when a strongly active, nonvariegating construct was coinjected with K 5 Z, most transgenic lines showed an almost homogeneous lacZ expression. The comparison of transgene arrays of different copies inserted at the same locus (obtained by using a lox/Cre system) showed that the reduction of copy number does not lead to an increase in the proportion of cells that express the transgene. Finally, in most of the variegating or nonexpressing lines the transgenes were located both at intermediate positions and at peritelomeric regions in the long chromosome arms. These findings suggest that the probability and efficiency of {{expression of}} K 5 Z genes depend on both long range chromosomal influences and on sequences in the transgene array...|$|E
40|$|Human {{fibroblasts}} transformed with an adenovirus- 5 /simian virus 40 recombinant construct (Ad 5 /SV 40) {{were analyzed}} {{to determine the}} chromosomal site(s) of virus integration. This was firstly done by in situ hybridization using metaphase and prometaphase chromosomes and 125 I-labeled Ad 5 DNA. Out of seven transformed cell lines (six of clonal origin and one uncloned), six were proven to have integrated the viral genome at the short- or the long-subtelomeric regions of autosome 1, two regions known to include chromosomal modification sites induced by acute infection with Ad 12. Characterization of the integration sites {{was carried out by}} restriction analysis. Transformed cell lines with the same major <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> were found to have the viral genome inserted in restriction fragments of different size, indicating that viral integration has occurred at different sites within a relatively small chromosomal region. Molecular studies carried out on one of the transformed cell lines (H 13. 1) gave an independent confirmation of the viral integration at the subterminal region of autosome 1 short arm. Nucleotide sequencing at this cellular-viral junction has shown that the virus has integrated within tandemly repeated Alu-like elements and that the cellular flanking sequences have several homologies with variable number of tandem repeats core sequences. Many possible open reading frames were identified in the DNA segment adjacent to the Alu-like elements...|$|E

In the studies {{described}} here, we used these hybrids to produce 18 transgenic mouse lines, each carrying a single newly acquired Srev locus (SWR/J-RF/J ecotropic proviral locus). All {{of the newly}} acquired proviruses identified in mosaic founder SWR/J-RF/J mice that could be transmitted through the germ line were also present in somatic tissues, demonstrating that viral integration occurred before the germ line was set aside from the somatic lineages. Quantitative analysis of proviral DNA copy numbers in somatic and germinal tissues of mosaic founder parents combined with structural analysis of Srev loci indicated that these proviruses are acquired after multiple rounds of somatic viral reinfection and {{that most of these}} viral integration events occurred after DNA replication in the zygote and before DNA replication in the four-cell embryo. The frequency of provirus acquisition in Srev lines that expressed the infectious ecotropic virus was similar to that in SWR. RF mice carrying Emv- 16 and Emv- 17, suggesting that the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> of the parental locus is not an important determinant for high-frequency provirus acquisition. The frequency of recessive lethal mutations induced by spontaneous viral integration was 5 %, which was similar to that induced by preimplantation embryo infection.

40|$|Three {{lines of}} {{transgenic}} mice carrying the {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) long terminal repeat fused to the simian virus 40 early region (HIV- 1 Tag) were constructed. Expression of the transgenes was reproducibly observed in the lymphoid tissue and skin of all three transgenic lines studied. Interestingly, cell types other than T cells, i. e., B cells and thymic stromal cells, contributed most of the expression detectable in the lymphoid organs. Each transgenic line also displayed a different but consistent pattern of transgene expression in nonlymphoid organs. These individual patterns probably reflect the effects of particular <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> on transcriptional activity of the HIV- 1 promoter. The disease spectrum displayed by viral pathogens is restricted. Tropism of viral infection and specificity of viral transcriptional control elements contribute to this restric-tion. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is tropic for CD 4 surface antigen-expressing cells.

40|$|Silencing and position-effect (PE) {{variegation}} (PEV), {{which is}} due to integration of viral vectors in heterochromatin regions, are considered significant obstacles to obtaining a consistent level of transgene expression in gene therapy. The inclusion of chromatin insulators into vectors has been proposed to counteract this position-dependent variegation of transgene expression. Here, we show that the sea urchin chromatin insulator, sns 5, protects a recombinant gamma-retroviral vector from the negative influence of chromatin in erythroid milieu. This element increases the probability of vector expression at different <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites,</b> which reduces both silencing and PEV. By chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we demonstrated the specific binding of GATA 1 and OCT 1 transcription factors and the enrichment of hyperacetylated nucleosomes to sns 5 sequences. The results suggest that this new insulator is able to maintain a euchromatin state inside the provirus locus with mechanisms that are common to other characterized insulators. On the basis of its ability to function as barrier element in erythroid milieu and to bind the erythroid specific factor GATA 1, the inclusion of sns 5 insulator in viral vectors may be of practical benefit in gene transfer applications and, in particular, for gene therapy of erythroid disorders...|$|R
40|$|Over the {{previous}} years, comprehensive studies on antiretroviral drugs {{resulted in the}} successful introduction of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) into clinical practice for treatment of HIV/AIDS. However, there is still need for new therapeutic approaches, since HAART cannot eradicate HIV- 1 from the infected organism and, unfortunately, can be associated with long-term toxicity and the development of drug resistance. In contrast, novel gene therapy strategies may have the potential to reverse the infection by eradicating HIV- 1. For example, expression of long terminal repeat (LTR) specific recombinase (Tre-recombinase) has been shown to result in chromosomal excision of proviral DNA and, in consequence, in the eradication of HIV- 1 from infected cell cultures. However, the delivery of Tre-recombinase currently depends on the genetic manipulation of target cells, a process that is complicating such therapeutic approaches and, thus, might be undesirable in a clinical setting. In this report we demonstrate that E. coli expressed Tre-recombinases, tagged either with the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV- 1 Tat trans-activator or the translocation motif (TLM) of the Hepatitis B virus PreS 2 protein, were able to translocate efficiently into cells and showed significant recombination activity on HIV- 1 LTR sequences. Tre activity was observed using episomal and stable integrated reporter constructs in transfected HeLa cells. Furthermore, the TLM-tagged enzyme was able to excise the full-length proviral DNA from <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> of HIV- 1 -infected HeLa and CEM-SS cells.

40|$|A great {{majority}} of G protein-coupled receptors are modified by N-glycosylation, but the functional significance of this modification for receptor folding and intracellular transport has remained elusive. Here we studied these phenomena by mutating the two N-terminal N-glycosylation sites (Asn 18 and Asn 33) of the human δ-opioid receptor, and expressing the mutants from the same <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> in stably transfected inducible HEK 293 cells. Both N-glycosylation sites were used, and their abolishment decreased the steady-state level of receptors at the cell surface. However, pulse-chase labeling, cell surface biotinylation, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed {{that this was not}} because of intracellular accumulation. Instead, the non-N-glycosylated receptors were exported from the endoplasmic reticulum with enhanced kinetics. The results also revealed differences in the significance of the individual N-glycans, as the one attached to Asn 33 was found to be more important for endoplasmic reticulum retention of the receptor. The non-N-glycosylated receptors did not show gross functional impairment, but flow cytometry revealed that a fraction of them was incapable of ligand binding at the cell surface. In addition, the receptors that were devoid of N-glycans showed accelerated turnover and internalization and were targeted for lysosomal degradation. The results accentuate the importance of protein conformation-based screening before export from the endoplasmic reticulum, and demonstrate how the system is compromised when N-glycosylation is disrupted. We conclude that N-glycosylation of the δ-opioid receptor is needed to maintain the expression of fully functional and stable receptor molecules at the cell surface...|$|E

The anthracycline antibiotic-producing strains Streptomyces peucetius and Streptomyces sp. strain C 5 were transformed using E. coli ET 12567 (pUZ 8002) as a conjugal donor. When this donor species, carrying pSET 152, was mated with Streptomyces strains, the resident plasmid was mobilized to the recipient and the transferred DNA was also integrated into the recipient chromosome. Analysis of the exconjugants showed stable integration of the plasmid at a single chromosomal site (attB) of the Streptomyces genome. The DNA sequence of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> was determined and shown to be conserved. However, the core sequence, where the crossover presumably occurred in C 5 and S. peucetius, is TTC. These results also showed that the φC 31 integrative recombination is active and the phage attP site is functional in S. peucetius {{as well as in}} C 5. The efficiency and specificity of φC 31 -mediated site-specific integration of the plasmid {{in the presence of a}} 3. 7 -kb homologous DNA sequence indicates that integrative recombination is preferred under these conditions. The integration of plasmid DNA did not affect antibiotic biosynthesis or biosynthesis of essential amino acids.

40|$|The {{imprinted}} {{expression of}} the mouse Igf 2 /H 19 locus is governed by the differential methylation of the imprinting control region (ICR), which is established initially in germ cells and subsequently maintained in somatic cells, depending on its parental origin. By grafting a 2. 9 -kbp H 19 ICR fragment into a human β-globin yeast artificial chromosome in transgenic mice, we previously showed that the ICR could recapitulate imprinted methylation and expression at a heterologous locus, suggesting that the H 19 ICR in the β-globin locus contained sufficient information to maintain the methylation mark (K. Tanimoto, M. Shimotsuma, H. Matsuzaki, A. Omori, J. Bungert, J. D. Engel, and A. Fukamizu, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 : 10250 - 10255, 2005). Curiously, however, the transgenic H 19 ICR was not methylated in sperm, which was distinct from that seen in the endogenous locus. Here, we reevaluated {{the ability of the}} H 19 ICR to mark the parental origin using more rigid criteria. In the testis, the methylation levels of the solitary 2. 9 -kbp transgenic ICR fragment varied significantly between six transgenic mouse lines. However, in somatic cells, the paternally inherited ICR fragment exhibited consistently higher methylation levels at five out of six randomly integrated sites in the mouse genome. These results clearly demonstrated that the H 19 ICR could acquire parent-of-origin-dependent methylation after fertilization independently of the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> or the prerequisite methylation acquisition in male germ cells...|$|E

40|$|Integrative and conjugative {{elements}} (ICEs) are widespread chromosomal mobile genetic elements {{which can}} transfer autonomously by conjugation in bacteria. Thirteen ICEs with a conjugation module {{closely related to}} that of ICESt 3 of Streptococcus thermophilus were characterized in Streptococcus salivarius by wholegenomesequencing. Sequence comparison highlighted ICE evolution by shuffling of 3 different integration/excision modules (for integration in the 3 = end of the fda, rpsI, or rpmG gene) with the conjugation module of the ICESt 3 subfamily. Sequence analyses also pointed out a recombination occurring at oriT (likely mediated by the relaxase) as a mechanism of ICE evolution. Despite a similar organization in two operons including three conserved genes, the regulation modules show a high diversity (about 50 % amino acid sequence divergence for the encoded regulators and presence of unrelated additional genes) with a probable impact on the regulation of ICE activity. Concerning the accessory genes, ICEs of the ICESt 3 subfamily appearparticularly rich in restriction-modification systems and orphan methyltransferase genes. Other cargo genes that could confer a selective advantage to the cell hosting the ICE were identified, in particular, genes for bacteriocin synthesis and cadmium resistance. The functionality of 2 ICEs of S. salivarius was investigated. Autonomous conjugative transfer to other S. salivarius strains, to S. thermophilus, and to Enterococcusfaecalis was observed. The analysis of the ICE-fda border sequence in these transconjugants allowed the localization of the DNA cutting site of the ICE integrase. IMPORTANCE The ICESt 3 subfamily of ICEs appears to be widespread in streptococci and targets diverse <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> These ICEs carry diverse cargo genes that can confer a selective advantage to the host strain. The maintenance of these mobile genetic elements likely relies in part on self-encoded restrictionmodification systems. In this study, intra- and interspecies transfer was demonstrated for 2 ICEs of S. salivarius. Closely related ICEs were also detected in silico in other Streptococcus species (S. pneumoniae and S. parasanguinis), thus indicating thatdiffusion of ICESt 3 -related elements probably {{plays a significant role}} in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurring in the oral cavity but also in the digestive tract, where S. salivarius is present...|$|R

Methods We corroborate {{the potential of}} genomic sequence correction by ssODN using chromosomally integrated mutated enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) reporter genes in CHO cell lines. The role of integration site was studied in a panel of cell clones with randomly integrated reporters and in cell lines with site-specific single copy integration of the mEGFP reporter in opposite orientations. Involvement of end modification was examined on ssODN with unprotected or phosphorothioate (PS) protected ends. Also ssODN containing octyl or hexaethylene glycol (HEG) end blocking groups were tested. The significance of DNA synthesis was investigated by cell cycle analysis and by the DNA polymerases alpha, delta and epsilon inhibitor aphidicolin. Results Correction rates of up to 5 % were observed upon a single transfection of ssODN. Independent of the mEGFP <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> and of its orientation towards the replication fork, antisense ssODN were more effective than sense ssODN. When ssODN ends were blocked by either octyl or HEG groups, correction rates were reduced. Finally, we demonstrate a dependence of the process on DNA synthesis. Conclusions We show that, on a chromosomal level, {{the orientation of the}} replication fork towards the targeted locus is not central in the strand bias of ssODN-based targeted sequence correction. We demonstrate the importance of accessible ssODN ends for sequence alteration. Finally, we provide evidence for the involvement of DNA synthesis in the process...|$|E

Glucocorticoids activate the promoter elements of various human papillomaviruses in transient-expression assays. We have analyzed {{the effect of}} dexamethasone on the transcription rate of human papillomavirus 18 E 6 and E 7 genes integrated at different chromosomal sites in four cervical cancer cell lines. Dexamethasone led {{to an increase in}} the transcription rate of the integrated E 6 -E 7 sequences in C 4 - 1 and C 4 - 2 cells but led to a decrease in SW 756 cells and did not affect the transcription rate in HeLa cells. However, when the viral promoter elements derived from HeLa or SW 756 cells, in which dexamethasone does not activate transcription of the integrated E 6 -E 7 sequences, were tested in transient-expression assays within the same cell lines, dexamethasone consistently activated the viral promoter. It thus appears that dominant regulatory mechanisms presumably depending on the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> are able to override the response of the viral promoter to steroid hormones. The growth rate of all dexamethasone-treated cell lines correlated consistently with the expression of the papillomavirus E 6 and E 7 genes, supporting their role in the maintenance of the proliferative phenotype of cervical carcinoma cells. Since human papillomaviruses are integrated into the host cell genome at variable, presumably randomly selected chromosomal loci, regulatory mechanisms that influence viral gene expression, and hence cell growth, may differ among cancers of independent clonal origin...|$|E

MRSA clinical isolates were screened for known SCCmec types by multiplex and conventional PCR methods. Three phenotypically and genotypically identical MRSA clinical isolates with a pulsotype identical to CMRSA 9 were identified locally and found to be nontypeable by available SCCmec typing schemes. Complete sequencing of the SCCmec element revealed a nucleotide fragment of 32, 168 bp integrated at an identical <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> (attBscc) at the 3 ′ end of the orfX gene. The nucleotide sequences at the chromosome-SCCmec junction regions were typical of other SCCmec types, but the element harbored a unique combination of class A mec and type 4 ccr gene complexes. Sequence recombination analysis suggested that this unique SCCmec type may be derived from homologous recombination between the previously described SCCRP 62 A of S. epidermidis strain RP 62 A and SCC composite island of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, respectively, or via recombination of other staphylococcal strains that carry the same or similar mobile cassettes. We identified a previously undescribed type of SCCmec from isolate C 10682, tentatively designated type VIII, and we provide compelling evidence supporting the ability of SCC elements to transfer horizontally or undergo recombination to generate new SCCmec types...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Genetic {{transformation}} systems based onMos 1 and piggyBac transposable {{elements are}} used to achieve stable <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration.</b> However, in-tegration <b>sites</b> are randomly distributed in the genome and transgene expression can be influenced by position effects. We developed a novel technology that utilizes chimeric transposases to direct <b>integration</b> into specific <b>sites</b> on a target DNA molecule. The Gal 4 DNA binding domain was fused to the NH 2 terminus of theMos 1 and piggyBac transposases and a target plasmid was created that contained upstream activating sequences (UAS), to which the Gal 4 DBD binds with high affinity. The transpositional activity of the Gal 4 -Mos 1 transposase was 12. 7 -fold higher compared to controls where the Gal 4 -UAS interaction was absent and 96 % of the recov-ered transposition products were identical, with inte-gration occurring at the same TA site. In a parallel experiment, a Gal 4 -piggyBac transposase resulted in an 11. 6 -fold increase in transpositional activity compared to controls, with 67 % of the integrations occurring at a single TTAA site. This technology {{has the potential to}} minimize nonspecific integration events that may result in insertional mutagenesis and reduced fitness. Site-directed integration will be advantageous to the manip-ulation of genomes, study of gene function, and for the development of gene therapy techniques. —Maragath...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} that hepatitis B virus (HBV) integrates into host chromosomes {{raises the question}} of whether such viral DNA integration correlates directly with the activation of specific oncogenes or the inactivation of anti-oncogenes. To obtain insight into this problem, we randomly collected HBV integrant samples from different human hepatocellular carcinomas and identified the <b>site</b> of <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> by using in situ hybridization and/or linkage analysis with the flanking cellular DNAs as probes. Our findings did not specifically identify particular HBV DNA <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> in chromosomes, although chromosomes 11 and 17 seemed to have more than the average number of integrants...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of mitotically stable yeast strains for heterologous gene or pathway expression often requires <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration.</b> However, transcription levels vary between different chromosome regions. We therefore characterized 20 different <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> of the Sacchromyces cerevisiae genome by inserting lacZ {{as a reporter}} gene {{under the control of}} two different promoters and determining expression levels through enzyme activity measurement. An up to 8. 7 -fold difference was detected between the sites conferring lowest and highest expression, respectively. This opens the opportunity for modulating gene expression levels while retaining promoter and culture conditions. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcal {{cassette}} chromosome mec (SCCmec) is {{a mobile}} genetic element {{composed of the}} mec gene complex, which encodes methicillin resistance, and the ccr gene complex, which encodes the recombinases responsible for its mobility. The mec gene complex has been classified into four classes, and the ccr gene complex has been classified into three allotypes. Different combinations of mec gene complex classes and ccr gene complex types have so far defined four types of SCCmec elements. Now we introduce the fifth allotype of SCCmec, which {{was found on the}} chromosome of a community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (strain WIS [WBG 8318]) isolated in Australia. The element shared the same <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> with the four extant types of SCCmec and the characteristic nucleotide sequences at the chromosome-SCCmec junction regions. The novel SCCmec carried mecA bracketed by IS 431 (IS 431 -mecA-ΔmecR 1 -IS 431), which is designated the class C 2 mec gene complex; and instead of ccrA and ccrB genes, it carried a single copy of a gene homologue that encoded cassette chromosome recombinase. Since the open reading frame (ORF) was found to encode an enzyme which catalyzes the precise excision as well as site- and orientation-specific integration of the element, we designated the ORF cassette chromosome recombinase C (ccrC), and we designated the element type V SCCmec. Type V SCCmec is a small SCCmec element (28 kb) and does not carry any antibiotic resistance genes besides mecA. Unlike the extant SCCmec types, it carries a set of foreign genes encoding a restriction-modification system that might {{play a role in the}} stabilization of the element on the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} amount of data has been accumulated supporting {{the important role of}} genomic islands (GEIs) - including pathogenicity islands (PAIs) - in bacterial genome plasticity and the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Their instability and the high level sequence similarity of different (partial) islands suggest an exchange of PAIs between strains of the same or even different bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Transfer events of archetypal large genomic islands of enterobacteria which often lack genes required for mobilisation or transfer have been rarely investigated so far. Results: To study mobilisation of such large genomic regions in prototypic uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) strain 536, PAI II 536 was supplemented with the mobRP 4 region, an origin of replication (oriVR 6 K), an origin of transfer (oriTRP 4) and a chloramphenicol resistance selection marker. In the presence of helper plasmid RP 4, conjugative transfer of the 107 -kb PAI II 536 construct occured from strain 536 into an E. coli K- 12 recipient. In transconjugants, PAI II 536 existed either as a cytoplasmic circular intermediate (CI) or integrated site-specifically into the recipient’s chromosome at the leuX tRNA gene. This locus is the <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> of PAI II 536 in UPEC strain 536. From the E. coli K- 12 recipient, the chromosomal PAI II 536 construct as well as the CIs could be successfully remobilised and inserted into leuX in a PAI II 536 deletion mutant of E. coli 536. Conclusions: Our results corroborate that mobilisation and conjugal transfer may contribute to evolution of bacterial pathogens through horizontal transfer of large chromosomal regions such as PAIs. Stabilisation of these mobile genetic elements in the bacterial chromosome result from selective loss of mobilisation and transfer functions of genomic islands...|$|E

40|$|Cholera {{outbreaks}} in subSaharan African {{countries are}} caused by strains of the El Tor biotype of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae O 1. The El Tor biotype is the causative agent of the current seventh cholera pandemic, whereas the classical biotype, which {{was associated with the}} sixth pandemic, is now extinct. Besides other genetic differences the CTX prophages encoding cholera toxin in the two biotypes of V. cholerae O 1 have distinct repressor (rstR) genes. However, recent incidences of cholera in Mozambique were caused by an El Tor biotype V. cholerae O 1 strain that, unusually, carries a classical type (CTXclass) prophage. We conducted genomic analysis of the Mozambique strain and its CTX prophage together with <b>chromosomal</b> phage <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> to understand the origin of this atypical strain and its evolutionary relationship with the true seventh pandemic strain. These analyses showed that the Mozambique strain carries two copies of CTXclass prophage located on the small chromosome in a tandem array that allows excision of the prophage, but the excised phage genome was deficient in replication and did not produce CTXclass virion. Comparative genomic microarray analysis revealed that the strain shares most of its genes with the typical El Tor strain N 16961 but did not carry the TLC gene cluster, and RS 1 sequence, adjacent to the CTX prophage. Our data are consistent with the Mozambique strain's having evolved from a progenitor similar to the seventh pandemic strain, involving multiple recombination events and suggest a model for origination of El Tor strains carrying the classical CTX prophage...|$|R

In order {{to streamline the}} integration of genes into the Synechococcus chromosome, validation of neutral <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> with optimization of the DNA transformation protocol parameters is necessary. Availability of BioBrickcompatible integration modules is desirable to further simplifying <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integrations.</b> Results: We designed three BioBrick-compatible genetic modules, each targeting a separate neutral <b>integration</b> <b>site,</b> A 2842, A 0935, and A 0159, with varying length of homologous region, spanning from 100 to 800 nt. The performance of the different modules for achieving DNA integration were tested. Our results demonstrate that 100 nt homologous regions are sufficient for inserting a 1 kb DNA fragment into the Synechococcus chromosome. By adapting a transformation protocol from a related cyanobacterium, we shortened the transformation procedure for Synechococcus significantly. Conclusions: The optimized transformation protocol reported in this study provides {{an efficient way to}} perform genetic engineering in Synechococcus. We demonstrated that homologous regions of 100 nt are sufficient for inserting a 1 kb DNA fragment into the three tested neutral <b>integration</b> <b>sites.</b> <b>Integration</b> at A 2842, A 0935 and A 0159 results in only a minimal fitness cost for the chassis.

40|$|Data are {{presented}} on {{the identification and}} characterisation of 17 <b>chromosomal</b> <b>integration</b> loci of the insertion element IS 901 in the Mycobacterium avium (cervine strain JD 88 / 118) genome. Thirteen of these integration loci have been mapped to their corresponding positions on the M. avium strain 104 (an IS 9013 strain) genome (The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR) unfinished genome-sequencing project). Sequence data for both upstream and downstream sequence flanking regions were obtained for 12 insertion loci, while upstream sequence was obtained for five others. A consensus IS 901 insertion target sequence compiled from all 17 <b>integration</b> <b>sites</b> was in broad agreement with earlier reports that were based on only two such loci. Analysis of IS 901 <b>integration</b> <b>site</b> flanking sequences revealed that, like IS 900 in M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis, IS 901 inserts preferentially between a putative ribosome-binding sequence (RBS) and the translational start codon of an open reading frame (ORF).
