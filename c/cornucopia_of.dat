Categorical assignments were problematic. For example, {{the decision to}} append cognitive to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the computational and constructivist approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of simulated v. embodied cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.|$|E
25|$|Monterey is {{well known}} for the {{abundance}} and diversity of its marine life, which includes sea lions, sea otters, harbor seals, bat rays, kelp forests, pelicans and dolphins and several species of whales. Only a few miles offshore is the Monterey Canyon, the largest and deepest (3.2km) underwater canyon off the Pacific coast of North America, which grants scientists access to the deep sea within hours. The <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> marine life makes Monterey a popular destination for scuba divers of all abilities ranging from novice to expert. Scuba classes are held at San Carlos State Beach, which has been a favorite with divers since the 1960s. Monterey is home to one of the largest aquariums in North America, namely the Monterey Bay Aquarium, as well as several marine science laboratories, including Hopkins Marine Station.|$|E
25|$|Some {{versions}} of the flag also feature the coat of arms on the left hand side, over {{the intersection of the}} three stripes. The coat of arms was approved in the 1970s by the Municipal Assembly. It features a red band crossing the shield diagonally, from left to right. Over the red band lies a golden citrus, which is believed {{to be one of the}} reasons for the town's name, and a <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> fruits, which alludes to Cidra's role as one of the major producers of fruits of the island. The upper field is either white or silver, and features two symbols: a black scapular representing the Virgin, and a black bishop hat referencing San Juan Nepomuceno, bishop and martyr. The lower field is mostly blue and features a brown pigeon flying over a mountain range, representing the location of the town in the Central Mountain Range, and a set of silver water waves. The whole seal is capped by a three-tower crown, which is usually seen in municipal seals in the island.|$|E

500|$|Michigan Avenue {{is named}} after Lake Michigan, which it once ran {{alongside}} at 100 east in the city's street numbering system until land reclamation for Grant Park (then Lake Park) pushed the shoreline east. [...] The one-sided street feature is {{due in large part}} to the legal battles of Aaron Montgomery Ward with the city over cleaning up the park and removing most of the structures in it. [...] Ward opposed the development of Grant Park with public buildings along the lakefront except for the Art Institute of Chicago Building. [...] Eventually, Ward's ideas were adopted by Daniel Burnham in his Plan of Chicago, which called for [...] "insured light, air, and an agreeable outlook" [...] along the Grant Park street frontage.

2500|$|Michael Fitzgerald, a {{professor}} of child and adolescent psychiatry, published a <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> pathographies of outstanding historical personalities, mostly disclosing that they had Asperger syndrome, {{which is on the}} autism spectrum. In his 2004 published anthology Autism and creativity, he classified Hitler as an [...] "autistic psychopath". Autistic psychopathy is a term that the Austrian physician Hans Asperger had coined in 1944 in order to label the clinical picture that was later named after him: Asperger syndrome, which {{has nothing to do with}} psychopathy in the sense of an antisocial personality disorder. Fitzgerald appraised many of Hitler’s publicly known traits as autistic, particularly his various obsessions, his lifeless gaze, his social awkwardness, his lack of personal friendships, and his tendency toward monologue-like speeches, which, according to Fitzgerald, resulted from an inability to have real conversations.|$|E
2500|$|One {{good example}} of {{his work as a}} flower painter is his Offering to Flora, a visual poem that {{parallels}} the lyric verse of his time, in which he united his skills as portraitist and flower painter to produce {{one of the most beautiful}} paintings of the allegory of spring. The large canvas, painted in 1627, shows the goddess of the flowers seated besides a <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> spring flowers. The painting adopts a Flemish compositional; type and reveals an interest in the play of light on iridescent fabrics that probably derived in the style of [...] Juan Bautista Maino. The offering to Flora and the pair of paintings: the still life with Flowers and a Dog, and Still-Life with a Puppy, formed part of the interior decoration of Jean de Croy's palace in Madrid.

2500|$|During the war years, Miranda {{starred in}} eight of her {{fourteen}} films; although the studios called her the Brazilian Bombshell, the films blurred her Brazilian identity {{in favor of}} a Latin American image. According to a Variety review of director Irving Cummings' That Night in Rio (1941, Miranda’s second Hollywood film), her character upstaged the leads: [...] " [...] Ameche is very capable in a dual role, and Miss [...] Faye is eye-appealing but it’s the tempestuous Miranda who really gets away to a flying start from the first sequence". A New York Times article said, [...] "Whenever one or the other Ameche character gets {{out of the way and}} lets her [...] have the screen, the film sizzles and wickedly scorchers." [...] Years later, Clive Hirschhorn wrote: [...] "'That Night in Rio' was the quintessential Fox war-time musical – an over-blown, over-dressed, over-produced and thoroughly irresistible <b>cornucopia</b> <b>of</b> escapist ingredients."

Marvel Comics' editor-in-chief Joe Quesada said that unlike the fictionalized version of Hell's Kitchen depicted in Daredevil and Jessica Jones, which was more inline with how {{it was when the}} comics were first written, the Harlem of Luke Cage represents the Harlem of [...] "today", and is truer to the real-life modern New York. However, Colter admitted that [...] "Harlem, the character that we’re trying to create, does resemble Harlem of maybe ten years ago." [...] Coker said that Harlem was a world for the series, but also [...] "all about legacy too. Harlem is filled with moments of history." [...] He wanted to replicate the experience of walking through Harlem and hearing different music coming from every car driving past, and every open window, which he felt was unique to the neighborhood.

Steve Malins of Vox {{also liked the}} album. He said, [...] "The title-track is a sublime melodrama recalling the experimentation of Peepshow and 1982's Kiss in the Dreamhouse", [...] before concluding with this sentence, [...] "The Rapture represents an intelligent twist on familiar Banshees obsessions". Liz Buckley of Sun Zoom Spark also praised it, writing, [...] "How is a band that first formed almost two decades ago able to remain both vital and celebrated? Answer: Metamorphosis". Buckley also declared that [...] "the album is able to excite the hairs {{on the back of}} your neck". Select gave it a 4-star rating, hailing the band as [...] "purveyors of scary pop par excellence". Matt Hall noted the ability of the group for [...] "trotting out jolly tunes about mental breakdown, love bordering on obsession and severely dislocated relationships." [...] The reviewer characterized The Rapture as a [...] "fine little Russian doll of a record", and said, [...] "Under the keyboard lines, swelling strings and OTT percussion, at the centre of every song is a nugget of disquiet that keeps you listening again and again".|$|E
