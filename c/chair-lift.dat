The slope and surrounding area have become more increasingly dilapidated.

50|$|The two {{mountain}} ranges {{that surround the}} valley are dominated by the peaks of Skrzyczne at 1,257 m and Klimczok 1,117 m, both of significant interest to tourists. There are commanding views from either peak. Moreover, either peak is accessible to most people, in one day's hike, via the tourist routes marked on any tourist map available in most kiosks or mountain shelters. The routes are mostly accessible for the able-bodied, Skrzyczne being accessible via <b>chair-lift.</b>|$|E
50|$|Daily {{passenger}} electric trains run by SJ AB connect Stockholm {{with the}} Norwegian city of Narvik, stopping {{at both the}} Abisko village (the name of that railway station is Abisko Östra east) and the Abisko Turiststation.

5000|$|Social {{exclusion}} has eased due to {{the development}} of a transport infrastructure; the Metro, a new system of public buses, is being planned with the so-called [...] "Metroplus", already inaugurated, and a network of <b>chair-lifts</b> in the poorest barrio communities called the [...] "MetroCable". Additionally, an electric escalator 1,260 feet long was inaugurated in Comuna 13, one of Medellín's poorest neighborhoods, on December 26, 2011, making it the first and only one of its kind in the world. Today's Medellín includes spaces for art, poetry, drama, the construction of public libraries, the foundation of new ecological parks, and the inclusion of people of the city in its development.|$|R
50|$|Mount Tom Ski Area was a {{ski resort}} in Holyoke, Massachusetts, in the Mount Tom Range {{in the western}} part of Massachusetts about 10 miles north of Springfield. It opened in 1962 and closed in 1998. Since its closing, all <b>chair-lifts</b> and snow making {{equipment}} had been either sold off or scrapped. Mt Tom was located off Rt. 5 on the North side of Holyoke Massachusetts and was just up the road from Mountain Park, a local amusement park. Both Mountain Park and Mt. Tom were owned by the O'Connell Construction Company. It was rumored that Mt. Tom was created so that the Construction company could keep seasonal workers working during the winter and keep them available for the summer construction season. Currently, the lodge/surrounding buildings of the ski area have been heavily vandalized are not structuarly sound for future use unless extensive renovation was to be done. A recent forest fire in late April 2014 burned roughly 27 acres of the ski area. None of the ski areas buildings caught fire. The fire mostly burned trees and loose brush that had grown in on the slopes. In late 2016, vandals and arsonists set fire to one of the smaller, old ski shacks, burning it to the ground.|$|R

5000|$|In 1962, Page Newman {{built the}} Nobby Beach {{chairlift}} that later formed {{part of the}} Magic Mountain entertainment park. A cafeteria was built {{on top of the}} outcrop. It was a gamble that paid off, in its first year of operation the <b>chair-lift</b> carried 40,000 people. A Magic Castle was built, giving the park the [...] "magic" [...] theme. Page Newman sold the park in 1976 to George Carrett. Carrett owned the park until 1982 when it was sold again. In 1983, the new owner commenced intensive development with A$13.6 million spent to extend the Magic Mountain theme park.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to expressing his genuine interest (he also wrote a learned {{paper on the}} remains of a Norse mill at Buttermere), the books were a means to promote the business; as a local resident later recalled [...] "He'd do anything to make money." [...] Nicholas had problems with some of the local landowners and farmers, who festooned their boundaries with No Trespassing signs, even on wild sheep-pasture. In {{addition to}} arguing with such people (earning for himself the name Old Nick), in the 1930s he bought two pieces of land himself, the first being in the relatively flat area leading down to Crummock Water, which he developed as a 9-hole golf course. This facility was available free to guests at the hotel, which was subsequently promoted as the Victoria Golf Hotel. For the less sports-minded, about 1937 he acquired the pretty piece of woodland along the stream opposite the hotel, and opened it to the public under the title of The Fairy Glen. Local opposition and the Second World War prevented him from bringing his grandest ideas to fruition: a Bavarian-style beer garden at the hotel, complete with brass band; a fully equipped service station for the growing number of cars visiting the valley; and even a <b>chair-lift</b> to the summit of High Crag, {{at the south end of}} the lake. Plagued with illness in his last years, he was cared for by his wife at the Buttermere Hotel, which the couple had acquired some years after the Victoria.|$|E
