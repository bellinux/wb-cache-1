40|$|Perceived color at a {{point in}} space is not {{determined}} simply by the color directly stimulating the corresponding retinal position. Surface color is informed by flanking edge signals, which also serve to inhibit the intrusion of signals from neighboring surfaces. Spatially continuous local interactions among color and luminance signals have been implicated in a propagation process often referred to as filling-in. Here, we report a phenomenon of discrete <b>color</b> <b>filling</b> whereby <b>color</b> jumps over luminance gaps filling into disconnected regions of the stimulus. This <b>color</b> <b>filling</b> is found to be blocked at boundaries defined by texture. The <b>color</b> <b>filling</b> is also highly specific to the elements belonging to a common perceptual surface, even when multiple surfaces are transparently overlaid. Our results indicate that <b>color</b> <b>filling</b> can be governed by a host of visual cues outside the realm of first-order color and brightness, via their impact on perceptual surface segmentation and segregation...|$|R

Activities in time-distance diagrams are displayed both along a time axis and along a distance axis according to their relative linear position. This allows showing not only the location of the activity but also the direction of progress and the progress rate. Activities can be presented as geometrical shapes showing the occupation of the work site over time such that conflicting access can be detected visually. Different types of activities are differentiated by <b>color,</b> <b>fill</b> pattern, line type, or special symbols. A symbolic drawing along the distance axis is often used to improve the understanding of the time-distance diagram.|$|E

40|$|The Visual Data Analysis Package is a {{collection}} of programs and scripts that facilitate visual analysis of data available from NASA and NOAA satellites, as well as dropsonde, buoy, and conventional in-situ observations. The package features utilities for data extraction, data quality control, statistical analysis, and data visualization. The Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) satellite data extraction routines from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory were customized for specific spatial coverage and file input/output. Statistical analysis includes the calculation of the relative error, the absolute error, and the root mean square error. Other capabilities include curve fitting through the data points to fill in missing data points between satellite passes or where clouds obscure satellite data. For data visualization, the software provides customizable Generic Mapping Tool (GMT) scripts to generate difference maps, scatter plots, line plots, vector plots, histograms, timeseries, and <b>color</b> <b>fill</b> images...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{power of}} human vision to {{synthesize}} information and recognize pattern {{is fundamental to}} the success of visualization as a scientific method. This same power can mislead investigators who use visualization to explore georeferenced data-if data reliability is not addressed directly in the visualization process. Here, we apply an integrated cognitive-semiotic approach to devise and test three methods for depicting reliability of georeferenced health data. The first method makes use of adjacent maps, one for data and one for reliability. This form of paired representation is compared to two methods in which data and reliability are spatially coincident (on a single map). A novel method for coincident visually separable depiction of data and data reliability on mortality maps (using a <b>color</b> <b>fill</b> to represent data and a texture overlay to represent reliability) is found to be effective in allowing map users to recognize unreliable data without interfering with their ability to notice clusters and characterize patterns in mortality rates. A coincident visually integral depiction (using color characteristics to represent both data and reliability) is found to inhibit perception of clusters that contain some enumeration units with unreliable data, and to make it difficult for users to consider data and reliability independently...|$|E

Features evident in this image include both low relief structures and ones of higher relief, thought to be cored with evaporities of the Carboniferous Otto Fiord Fm. Some of these salt structures pierce the entire Sverdrup stratigraphy to surface or sea floor.

The map illustrates the general structural context of the 17 hydrocarbon discoveries between Sabine Peninsula and Ellef Ringnes Island.

The resulting data integration image shows the spatial coincidence of magnetic anomalies with present subsurface structure. Some of the larger magnetic features may be a indication of considerable intrusive emplacement at depth, which may have influenced local thermal maturity of sediments, such as the large magnetic anomaly east of the Cisco field. Other NE trending linear magnetic features are observed to trend coincident with extensional faults (grabens). These magnetic anomalies are thought to be dykes at depth, which created by volume accommodation, the graben formation of overlying section. (Balkwill an...|$|E
