5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron <b>capture</b> <b>cross-section</b> of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E

40|$|An {{integral}} {{model is}} proposed for recombination at the silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO 2) interface of thermally oxidized p-type silicon via Pb amphoteric centers associated with surface dangling bonds. The proposed {{model is a}} surface adaptation of a model developed for bulk recombination in amorphous silicon based on Sah-Shockley statistics which is more appropriate for amphoteric center recombination than classical Shockley-Read-Hall statistics. It is found that the surface recombination via amphoteric centers having <b>capture</b> <b>cross-sections</b> larger for charged centers than for neutral centers is distinguished from Shockley-Read-Hall recombination by exhibiting two peaks rather than one peak when plotted versus surface potential. Expressions are derived for the surface potentials at which the peaks occur. Such a finding provides a firm and plausible interpretation for the double peak surface recombination current measured in gated diodes or gated transistors. Successful fitting is possible between {{the results of the}} model and reported experimental curves showing two peaks for surface recombination velocity versus surface potential. On the other hand, if charged and neutral center <b>capture</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are equal or close to equal, surface recombination via amphoteric centers follows the same trend as Shockley-Read-Hall recombination and both models lead to comparable surface recombination velocities...|$|R

The detailed analysis is based on determination of the recently introduced defect parameter solution surface (DPSS) in order to extract the underlying defect parameters. Modeling these lifetime curves {{on the basis of}} the Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics required two defect energy levels. A unique solution has been found for a deep defect level located in the upper band gap half with an energy depth of E(ind c) -E(ind t) = 0. 38 ± 0. 01 eV and a ratio of <b>capture</b> <b>cross-sections</b> k=sigma(ind n) /sigma(ind p) = 0. 16 within the interval of uncertainty of 0. 06 - 0. 69.

50|$|Free final state {{neutrons}} {{are captured}} in the gadolinium-doped water of the detector. Even neutrons with energies ranging {{in the hundreds of}} MeV will quickly lose energy through collisions in water. Once these neutrons have been thermalized, they undergo radiative capture wherein they are incorporated into a nucleus to produce a more tightly bound state. The excess energy is given off as a gamma cascade. In pure water, neutron capture produces about 2.2 MeV in gamma radiation. In order to enhance visibility of neutron capture events, Gadolinium salts are dissolved into ANNIE’s aqueous media. Gadolinium has a larger <b>capture</b> <b>cross-section,</b> around 49,000 barns, and this occurs on the orders of microseconds after the free neutron is emitted.
