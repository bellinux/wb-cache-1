5|$|In {{all species}} {{copulation}} {{takes place at}} the nest site; it begins shortly after pairing and continues for 3–10days before egg-laying. The male brings the nesting material, in ground-nesting species (which may not build a nest) sometimes in the pouch, and in tree-nesting species <b>crosswise</b> in the bill. The female then heaps the material up to form a simple structure.|$|E
5|$|Another large {{building}} lies <b>crosswise</b> at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other diurnal primates, {{which usually}} carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing {{them in the}} canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and {{performs}} other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them {{one at a time}} by grasping the infant's belly <b>crosswise.</b> This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too heavy to carry.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the dynasty (c. 965) the two Zhe provinces (now Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) presented (to the throne) two dragon ships each more than (60.00m/200ft) in length. The upper works included several decks with palatial cabins and saloons, containing thrones and couches all ready for imperial tours of inspection. After many years, their hulls decayed and needed repairs, but the work was impossible {{as long as they were}} afloat. So in the Xi-Ning reign period (1068 to 1077) a palace official Huang Huaixin suggested a plan. A large basin was excavated at the north end of the Jinming Lake capable of containing the dragon ships, and in it heavy <b>crosswise</b> beams were laid down upon a foundation of pillars. Then (a breach was made) so that the basin quickly filled with water, after which the ships were towed in above the beams. The (breach now being closed) the water was pumped out by wheels so that the ships rested quite in the air. When the repairs were complete, the water was let in again, so that the ships were afloat once more (and could leave the dock). Finally the beams and pillars were taken away, and the whole basin covered over with a great roof so as to form a hangar in which the ships could be protected from the elements and avoid the damage caused by undue exposure.|$|E

The Amt Himmelpforten, however, used an altered variant of that coat of arms showing in the arch instead of the nun the ducal Bremian Saint Peter's <b>crosswise</b> keys.|$|E
25|$|Anping {{residents}} use {{a special}} symbol called Sword Lion to keep bad spirits away. During Zheng’s regime, Anping {{was one of}} Koxinga's main naval stations. When returning home from military drills, soldiers would put lion-face shields on the main gates of their houses and insert their swords <b>crosswise</b> in the lion’s mouth. Locals incorporate this symbol into the design of their houses {{as a symbol of}} security.|$|E
25|$|Dot pitch {{defines the}} maximum {{resolution}} of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, moiré appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render. Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moiré; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two <b>crosswise</b> (horizontal) support strips.|$|E
25|$|In Russia {{the first}} planned city was St. Petersburg founded in 1703 by Peter I. Being {{aware of the}} modern European {{construction}} experience which he examined in the years of his Grand Embassy to Europe, czar ordered Domenico Trezzini to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for Vasilyevsky Island was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in Amsterdam), with three lengthwise thoroughfares , rectangularly crossed with about 30 <b>crosswise</b> streets.|$|E
25|$|The sinus (literally, a bay or inlet) {{appears in}} the Imperial era as a loose over-fold, slung from beneath the left arm, {{downwards}} across the chest, then upwards to the right shoulder. It functioned as a pouch or pocket. Early examples are slender, rather like the slim, tighter <b>crosswise</b> fold known as the balneus (sword belt) from which the sinus probably derives. Later form of sinus are much fuller; the loop hangs at knee-length, suspended there by draping over the crook of the right arm.|$|E
25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, <b>crosswise</b> in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they can come back with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E
25|$|Most snakes move using lateral {{undulation}} where {{a lateral}} wave travels down the snake's {{body in the}} opposite direction to the snake's motion and pushes the snake off irregularities in the ground. This mode of locomotion requires these irregularities to function. Another form of locomotion, rectilinear locomotion, is used at times by some snakes, especially large ones such as pythons and boa. Here large scales {{on the underside of the}} body, known as scutes are used to push backwards and downwards. This is effective on a flat surface and is used for slow, silent movement, such as when stalking prey. Snakes use concertina locomotion for moving slowly in tunnels, here the snake alternates in bracing parts of its body on it surrounds. Finally the caenophidian snakes use the fast and unusual method of movement known as sidewinding on sand or loose soil. The snake cycles through throwing the front part of its body in the direction of motion and bringing the back part of its body into line <b>crosswise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Regeneration {{research}} using Planarians {{began in the}} late 1800s and was popularized by T.H. Morgan {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. Alejandro Sanchez-Alvarado and Philip Newmark transformed planarians into a model genetic organism in the beginning of the 20th century to study the molecular mechanisms underlying regeneration in these animals. Planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to regenerate lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or <b>crosswise</b> will regenerate into two separate individuals. In one experiment, T.H. Morgan found that a piece corresponding to 1/279th of a planarian or a fragment with as few as 10,000 cells can successfully regenerate into a new worm within one to two weeks. After amputation, stump cells form a blastema formed from neoblasts, pluripotent cells found throughout the planarian body. New tissue grows from neoblasts with neoblasts comprising between 20 and 30% of all planarian cells. Recent work has confirmed that neoblasts are totipotent since one single neoblast can regenerate an entire irradiated animal that has been rendered incapable of regeneration. In order to prevent starvation a planarian will use their own cells for energy, this phenomenon is known as de-growth.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or <b>crosswise</b> (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E
500|$|In {{building}} the walls, the sod blocks were laid one course at a time; each course was completed {{before the next}} was begun. [...] Walls were generally two or three wythes thick; the vertical joints were staggered to avoid creating a direct path through the wall for wind and vermin. [...] To bind the wythes and increase {{the stability of the}} wall, every second, third, or fourth course was laid <b>crosswise.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Nyiszli, [...] "Eight {{hundred to}} a {{thousand}} people were crammed into the superimposed compartments of each barracks. Unable to stretch out completely, they slept there both lengthwise and <b>crosswise,</b> with one man's feet on another's head, neck, or chest. Stripped of all human dignity, they pushed and shoved and bit and kicked each other {{in an effort to}} get a few more inches' space on which to sleep a little more comfortably. For they did not have long to sleep".|$|E
500|$|The pale, flask-shaped egg {{capsules}} measure [...] {{long and}} [...] across, and bear 1927 <b>crosswise</b> ridges. There are long, curling tendrils {{at the four}} corners, which allow the female to attach the capsule to seaweed or other bottom structures. In captivity, the embryo develops external gills at two months old, which are retained until it is five months old, at which time the internal gills take over and the first pigmentation appears. At six months, embryonic growth accelerates and the yolk sac begins to shrink, disappearing by nine to ten months of age. Hatching usually occurs at eleven to twelve months; the newly emerged young are miniature versions of the adults measuring [...] long. Males mature sexually at a length of , and females at [...]|$|E
500|$|Passengers were {{conveyed}} on trucks up {{the incline}} free {{and without the}} company assuming any responsibility for their safety. When doing so passengers climbed on and off wagons using a ladder and sat on planks laid <b>crosswise.</b> Trains conveying passengers on the upper level ran with the locomotive pushing the wagon. Mitchell and Smith {{point out that the}} Ordnance Survey map shows [...] "Station" [...] at : the Company's building there evidently seemed to be a station to the surveyors. The line also had stopping places at [...] and [...] where passengers could be picked up or set down on request. The line was used on occasions for special passenger trains, the commonest being organised by religious and temperance groups. Conventional cardboard tickets were issued, colour coded by class, for journeys below the incline.|$|E
500|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} M.rufobrunnea can reach [...] tall, {{although}} most are typically {{found in a}} narrower range, [...] The conical to roughly cylindrical hymenophore (cap) is typically [...] high by [...] wide. Its surface is covered with longitudinal anastomosed ridges and <b>crosswise</b> veins that form broad, angular, elongated pits. Young fruit bodies are typically dark grey with sharply contrasting beige or buff ridges, while mature specimens fade to ochraceous-buff. The cylindrical stipe is often strongly wrinkled, enlarged at the base and measures [...] by [...] thick. It is typically covered with a dark brown to greyish pruinescence, often fading at maturity, a useful character to discriminate it from similar species, such as M. tridentina or M. sceptriformis. The stipe and hymenophore often exhibit ochraceous, orange or reddish stains, although this feature is neither constant nor exclusive to M. rufobrunnea and {{can be seen in}} a number of Morchella species, such as Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata), [...] M. esculenta, M. guatemalensis, the recently described M. fluvialis (Clowez et al. 2014), and most likely M. anatolica.|$|E
500|$|The {{eggs are}} laid in late May or June. A clutch {{of one or}} two olive-brown oval eggs with dark brown spots is laid which take 24 to 25 days to hatch, with both parents taking turns to incubate. [...] The nest is usually placed along steep lake shorelines where the adults can quickly dive {{underwater}} when approached by predators. The eggs are about [...] long and [...] wide and the two eggs are laid with an interval of one to three days between them, and hatch [...] The newly hatched chicks are sooty black and have a white belly. Within hours of hatching, the young begin to leave the nest with the parents, swimming close by and sometimes riding on one parent’s back. The parents and chicks initially stay in shallow and isolated bays where the parents are able to defend the chicks better. The chicks are capable of making shallow dives from their first day but make deeper dives as they grow. Fledging takes 70 to 77 days. Usually, only one brood is raised. [...] Both parents feed the chicks live prey from hatching to fledging and as they grow, they become able to feed and fend for themselves after about two months. The parent birds capture small fish and hold them <b>crosswise</b> in their bill, call and approach the chicks with their head lowered so that the chicks can grasp them. If food is scarce, the young may fight intensely, and often only one young survives. The chicks leave the breeding ground before ice formation in the fall. A pair of loons raising two chicks have been estimated to feed on 423kg of fish during the five and a half months that they spend in their breeding territory. Some common loons live to 20 years or more, the maximum recorded age being 29 years 10 months.|$|E

2500|$|The hull's {{bottom is}} {{transversely}} flat and usually bowed fore-and-aft. (This curvature {{is known as}} [...] "rocker".) The stern is frequently a raked narrow transom that tapers sharply toward the bottom forming a nearly double-ended boat. The traditional bottom is made from planks laid fore and aft and not transverse, although some hulls have {{a second set of}} planks laid over the first in a pattern that is <b>crosswise</b> to the main hull for additional wear and strength.|$|E
2500|$|Cordwood {{construction}} {{is a term}} used for a natural building method in which [...] "cordwood" [...] or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up <b>crosswise</b> with masonry or cob mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a timber frame structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods [...] (e.g., rammed earth, cob or light clay) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high thermal mass, which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.|$|E

2500|$|The {{centre line}} divides {{the ice in}} half <b>crosswise.</b> It is used to judge icing, meaning that if a team sends the puck across the centre line (red line), blue line and then across the goal line (that is to say, shoots or dumps the puck past the goal line from behind their own side of the centre line) {{it is said to}} be icing. It is a thick line, and in the NHL must [...] "contain regular {{interval}} markings of a uniform distinctive design, which will readily distinguish it from the two blue lines." [...] When discussing differences in the rules of the game, it is often said that a game is played with no red line. This simply means that there is no [...] two-line pass violation. The centre line is still used to judge icing violations.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{symbolism}} of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (tennure) represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (hırka), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms <b>crosswise,</b> the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, [...] "All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!" ...|$|E

In ordinary circumstances these would have seemed indecorous to the world; {{but in the case}} of Ruth, it was a method, doubtless conformable to prevailing usage, of reminding Boaz of the duty which devolved on him as the kinsman of her deceased husband. Boaz probably slept upon a mat or skin; Ruth lay <b>crosswise</b> at his feet—a position in which Eastern servants frequently sleep in the same chamber or tent with their master; and if they want a covering, custom allows them that benefit from part of the covering on their master's bed. Resting, as the Orientals do at night, in the same clothes they wear during the day, there was no indelicacy in a stranger, or even a woman, putting the extremity of this cover over her.|$|E
2500|$|Cornwall was {{an attempt}} to avoid the {{damaging}} long wheelbase of the Cramptons, whilst still permitting large driving wheels. By moving the driving axle ahead of the firebox, one of the carrying axles could be moved backwards, giving a shorter overall wheelbase. The difficulty of how to fit the axles past the boiler recurred, to which Trevithick provided an [...] "extremely complicated" [...] solution. The boiler was placed entirely underneath the driving axle. Even then, it was necessary to recess a transverse channel {{across the top of the}} boiler, so as to provide clearance for the driving axle. The trailing carrying axle passed through a <b>crosswise</b> tube through the middle of the firebox. This made assembly difficult, but as it was only a straight carrying axle rather than a cranked driving axle, the tube diameter required was manageable. This use of a cross-firebox axle tube was part of Crampton's patent of 1842. As completed in 1847, and first numbered 173, Cornwall was a 4-2-2 with 8'6" [...] drivers, paired leading wheels of 3'6", single trailing wheels of 4' and an overall wheelbase of 16'6".

2500|$|In 1907, Captain Johnson {{was still}} in charge of Mount Royal. On the {{afternoon}} of July 6, [...] he was returning from Hazelton and was steaming through the Kitselas Canyon, when disaster struck. A strong wind pushed her into a large rock formation named Ringbolt Island, wedging her <b>crosswise</b> against the current. Luckily, she held while the passengers and crew scrambled to safety on the shore. Johnson assessed the situation and decided that Mount Royal could be saved and with ten crewmen, he returned aboard. He had decided {{that the best way}} to deal with this problem was to use the capstan to winch the sternwheeler back over Ringboat Island. This proved to be a disastrous decision. The king post broke and rammed through the bottom of Mount Royal and she buckled as the current washed over her, then she rolled upside down and broke into pieces. Although Johnson survived, six of the crewmen drowned, including the first officer. One of the four survivors was rescued by George Little, who would later become the founder of the town of Terrace. George and a companion spotted the wrecked hull as the wreckage floated past the community of Kitselas. Curious, they paddled out to it and saw a hand waving at them from a hole in hull. The survivor was Mount Royals chief engineer, Ben Maddigan, who was trapped in the bilge and filthy, but unhurt.
