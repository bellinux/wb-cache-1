5|$|In August, Clinton {{signed the}} Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It <b>cut</b> <b>taxes</b> for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts {{available}} to 90percent of small businesses, and raised {{taxes on the}} wealthiest 1.2percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced {{over a number of}} years through the implementation of spending restraints.|$|E
5|$|In a 2008 {{evaluation}} of state Governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking {{him in a}} tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to <b>cut</b> <b>taxes,</b> where he received {{the highest score on}} tax policy of all 50 governors. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code.|$|E
5|$|Instead of re-applying the {{unspent balance}} {{from the general}} fund to the same programs, the city council may choose {{to spend the money}} on other programs. Alternatively, they may use the balance to <b>cut</b> <b>taxes</b> or pay off a {{long-term}} debt. With a large surplus, reducing the tax burden will normally be the preferred choice.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{important}} reason for the recent expansion of the AMT {{is the effect of}} the 2001-2006 Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> The <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> decreased marginal <b>tax</b> rates for all income tax brackets without making corresponding changes to AMT rates. The lower tax liabilities triggered AMT eligibility for many households. Economists often refer to this as the [...] "take-back effect" [...] of the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{part of his}} {{campaign}} platform, Walker said he would create 250,000 jobs {{in his first term}} through a program that would include <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for small businesses, capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> and income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> He proposed cutting state employee wages and benefits to help pay for these <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> Critics argued that his proposals would help only the wealthy and that cutting the salaries of public employees would adversely affect state services, while supporters argued that <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> for businesses would spur the economy and create jobs.|$|R
5|$|During the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Rice sponsored 16 {{pieces of}} legislation, including 11 {{as the primary}} sponsor in the House of Representatives. Among {{the most prominent of}} his bills was a measure to set up a cold case unit within the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate Colorado's 1200 unsolved homicides. After passage, Gov. Ritter signed the bill into law. Rice also pursued legislation to <b>cut</b> <b>taxes</b> for businesses by raising the personal property tax exemption. After having passed the state house unanimously, the measure died in a Senate committee.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{continued}} his independence from his party throughout his term, vocally opposing Republican plans to <b>cut</b> <b>taxes</b> despite record national budget deficits and resisting the party's {{efforts to reduce}} funding for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe {{in the aftermath of}} the war. He worked with fellow Kentuckian Alben Barkley and Oregon Senator Wayne Morse to undermine Jim Crow laws enacted by the states and remove obstacles to suffrage for minorities. He also co-sponsored a bill to create the Medicare system, although it was defeated at the time. Although he had voted with the Republicans just 51% of the time during his partial term– the lowest average of any member of the party– Cooper headed the Kentucky delegation to the 1948 Republican National Convention. He supported Arthur Vandenberg for president, but Thomas E. Dewey ultimately received the party's nomination. Cooper himself was mentioned as a possible candidate for vice-president, but ultimately did not receive the nomination and sought re-election to his Senate seat instead. Also in 1948, Centre College awarded Cooper an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.|$|E
5|$|With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, {{government}} deficits ceased: {{the budget}} showed a surplus in {{every year from}} 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was {{on the cusp of}} a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new income tax. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to deficit spending. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any Keynesian desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to <b>cut</b> <b>taxes</b> as a stimulus measure.|$|E
30|$|Never were <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> an easy task. Empirical {{evidence}} from tax reforms {{around the world}} demonstrates that ample tax revenues should be ensured before cuts can be made. <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should be made in consideration of our nation’s economic structure, i.e., income from other sources {{could be used to}} offset deficiencies of disposable income brought about by <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should be linked to the government’s budget reforms and used to elevate the efficiency of government expenditures by increasing the transparency of public budgets. <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should also be linked into the structure of national public expenditures, thus opening up more room for <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> by shutting down any projects which have already been out of date.|$|R
25|$|While McCain has {{historically}} opposed <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> {{in favor of}} deficit reduction, he now favors <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> He says that he would reduce government spending {{to make up for}} the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} Mankiw and Weinzierl (2006) model and {{examines}} the revenue effects {{of capital and}} labor income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> under alternative financing regimes. Our analysis suggests that the revenue losses from capital and labor income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> are the highest when the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> are productive spending-financed and the lowest when transfer payments are used to finance the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> For plausible parameter values consistent with the US economy, we find that about 47 percent of a transfer-financed capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is self-financing. The corresponding result for a productive spending-financed capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> is only 6 percent. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{test whether}} {{dividend}} taxes affect corporate investments. We exploit Sweden's 2006 dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> of 10 percentage points for closely held corporations and five percentage points for widely held corporations. Using rich administrative panel data and triple-difference estimators, {{we find that}} this dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> affects allocation of corporate investment. Cashconstrained firms increase investment after the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> relative to cash-rich firms. Reallocation is stronger among closely held firms that experience a larger <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> This result is explained by higher nominal equity in cash-constrained firms and by higher dividends in cash-rich firms after the <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> The heterogeneous investment responses imply that the dividend <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> raises efficiency by improving allocation of investment...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} effects of the 1995 and 1996 <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> in Japan. Both <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> were {{introduced}} to compensate consumers for an impending consumption tax rate increase from 3 % to 5 % in 1997. We use micro-level data of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey to evaluate effects of these <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> on household consumption, focusing on {{the differences between the two}} episodes. Our estimates indicate that the Ricardian equivalence largely holds. Only the 1995 <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> distinctly stimulated consumption on its impact, while the 1996 <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> had almost no effect on the consumption, presumably because it was implemented much closer to the coming <b>tax</b> increase. <b>Tax</b> <b>cuts,</b> Ricardian equivalence, excess sensitivity...|$|R
