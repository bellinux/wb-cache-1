40|$|International audienceThe open-burning of organo-arsenical {{compounds}} {{present in}} <b>chemical</b> <b>ammunitions</b> from the First World War {{was responsible for}} locally high concentrations of arsenic in top-soil of a highly polluted site from the region of Verdun (France). In {{order to understand the}} biogeochemistry of arsenic in this type of environment, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of microbial communities were determined in soil samples with differing As pollution levels. The total concentration of micro-organisms was negatively affected by the pollution level. However the proportion of heterotrophic As(III) -oxidizing organisms and the As(III) -oxidizing rate were higher in the most contaminated than in the less contaminated samples. These results suggest that pollutants, including arsenic, exerted a selective pressure on composition and/or activity of microbial communities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAt {{the end of}} the Great War, a {{large amount}} of unfired <b>chemical</b> <b>ammunitions</b> were burned near the former westernfrontline. This {{destruction}} resulted in locally intense soil contamination by arsenic and heavy metals. This soil was affected for 80 years by water saturation episodes and input of forest litter. To study the As behavior in this specific polluted material submitted to environmental changes, an 8 -months experiment was conducted with an 1 m 3 instrumented mesocosm including unsaturated, alternatively saturated and saturated levels. Arsenic speciation in water and solid compartiment was analyzed all along the experiment. Microbial characterization including bacterial identification and the determination of As(III) -oxidizing and As(V) reducing activities was performed. Figure 1 : Microbial As(III) -oxidizing activity for four sample levels at the beginning and {{the end of the}} experiment. Arsenic concentration reached 132. 44 ± 3. 66 g. kg- 1 in soil and 20 - 110 µM in soil solution. As(V) was the major species of soluble arsenic. Immobilization of As was observed in the saturated soil caused by As(V) adsorption onto iron oxide-hydroxides and by the precipitation of secondary arsenates. As(III) -oxidizing activity (Fig. 1) and bacterial communauty structure were strongly impacted by soil saturation and the addition of organic litter.

Most loci exhibited no loss of heterozygosity but the low effective population size may indicate vulnerability to future declines. No population substructure or sex-biased dispersal was detected. Possible explanations for the reduction in genetic diversity at four loci include a past anthropogenic decline, natural population cycles, and impending effects of a decline. Close monitoring of the population is necessary because genetic diversity may decline in the future due to current anthropogenic disturbances...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the period}} from 1920 to 1928, 200, 000 unfired German <b>chemical</b> <b>ammunitions</b> from World War I were broken down and open-burned near the former western Frontline. This {{destruction}} resulted in locally severe top-soil contamination by arsenic, heavy metals and dioxins and furans. The main type of shell, called “blue cross shell” were loaded high explosives coating a glass bottle containing solid diphenylchloroarsine (CLARK 1) and diphenylcyanoarsine (CLARK 2) which have released considerable amounts of arsenic oxides during their combustion. The biogeochemical behavior of arsenic is poorly documented {{in this type of}} environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the arsenic speciation in relation to mineral and microbial compartments in this particular context [...] Four soils were sampled presenting different levels of contamination. The concentrations of major and trace elements were analyzed by ICP-MS. In the samples, the concentration range of arsenic was 1937 - 72, 820 mg/kg. Zinc, copper and lead reached concentrations up to 90, 190 mg/kg, 9113 mg/kg and 5777 mg/kg, respectively. SEM observations and EDS analyses were performed on different grains. Results showed that the polluted material was composed of inherited minerals (silicates), charcoal and secondary phases, carrier of metals. In metal rich grains, two phases were identified : a crystalline phase, where arsenic was associated with copper and zinc, and an amorphous phase rich in iron, zinc, copper, and arsenic. Four secondary arsenate minerals were identified by X-ray diffraction: adamite and olivenite (zinc and copper arsenates, respectively) and two pharmacosiderites. Arsenic speciation displayed by SEM-EDS and XRD was proven to be directly linked to the thermal treatments of shells. Indeed, the two main As-carriers were identified as vitreous phases, composed of a blend of metals, and secondary arsenates minerals, which were formed in the material’s porosity during its cooling. AsIII and AsV concentrations were 1577 mg/kg and 70, 178 mg/kg, respectively : whereas AsV was the major species, AsIII concentration was high. Microbial activities may influence the speciation and mobility of the bioavailable fraction of As, in relation with redox conditions and organic matter. Microbial characterization included total cell counts, respiration, and determination of AsIII-oxidizing and AsV reducing activities. Results showed the presence of microorganisms actively contributing to carbon and arsenic metabolims, even in the most polluted soil, thus potentially driving cycle of biovailable As on the site...|$|R
50|$|This {{military}} organisation {{was originally}} formed {{as part of}} the Royal Australian Engineers in mid-1942, under the leadership of infantry Captain Jim McAllester. Known initially as the 2/1st Australian Mobile Anti-gas Laboratory, it was located in Broadmeadows Camp in Victoria. Following a name change to 2/1st Australian Chemical Warfare Laboratory in February 1943 it was moved to Brisbane to be closer to field operations. Approval was given to re-establish the laboratory at the St Johns Wood hall in Royal Parade in August 1943, and it was in operation at that site by October. The mobile chemical warfare laboratory operated by the unit had been constructed in recognition of its need to be mobile in Australia in event of enemy chemical attack, and potentially {{to be used in the}} Pacific area of operations. The tasks and processes adopted by the unit were similar to those of British units, and were well established by the time they settled in at St Johns Wood.

At various times the St Johns Wood Laboratory also stored larger quantities of chemicals. In February 1944 for example, 75 boxes of 25-pounder shells containing bromobenzyl cyanide (known as BBC) were delivered for training purposes. The site is believed to have been cleared when abandoned by the Army.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{assessments}} of reliability and condition based maintenance {{can only be}} implemented where {{a good understanding of}} ammunition stockpile condition exists. Use of miniaturized intelligent sensors provides an inexpensive means of nondestructively gaining insight into stockpile condition while keeping costs low. In the past, evaluation of ammunition lifetimes has utilized humidity, temperature, pressure, shock, and corrosion. New technologies provide the possibility of obtaining these environmental parameters, {{as well as a number}} of other indicators of propellant degradation, including NOx by utilizing a microsensor with capability for remote wireless monitoring. Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) like microcantilevers promise to revolutionize the field of sensor design. In the automobile industry, micromachined acceleration sensors are now used for triggering airbags and pressure sensors adjust the air-fuel intake ratio in the engine. By applying coatings to the sensor`s surface the behavior of the microdevice can be measurably altered to respond to chemical species as demonstrated by ORNL using microcantilevers to detect mercury vapor and humidity. Ultimately, single-chip detectors with electronics and telemetry could be developed with conceivably hundreds of individual microsensors on each chip to simultaneously monitor identify, and quantify many important <b>chemical</b> species for <b>ammunition</b> as well as measure environmental parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract � Among the <b>chemicals</b> {{used for}} <b>ammunition</b> production, TNT (Trinitrotoluene) play a {{significant}} role since World War I and II. Various types of military weapon utilize TNT in casting process. However, the TNT casting process for warhead is difficult to control the cooling rate of the liquid TNT. This problem occurs because the casting process lacks the equipment to detect the temperature during the casting procedure This study presents the temperature detected by infrared camera to illustrate the cooling rate and cooling zone of curing, and demonstrates the optimization of TNT condition {{to reduce the risk of}} air gap occurred in the warhead which can result in the destruction afterward. Premature initiation of explosive-filled projectiles in response to set-back forces during gunfiring cause by casting defects. Finally the study can help improving the process of the TNT casting. The operators can control the curing of TNT inside the case by rising up the heating rod at the proper time. Consequently this can reduce tremendous time of rework if the air gaps occur and increase strength to lower elastic modulus. Therefore, it can be clearly concluded that the use of Infrared Cameras in this process is another method to improve the casting procedure...|$|R
