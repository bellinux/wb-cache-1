5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> {{evidence}} of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds}} that the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the fairness of the scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> standard, but California has since abandoned the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E
5|$|A {{state may}} place {{the burden on}} the {{defendant}} has to prove incompetence by the preponderance of the evidence, but the state cannot require the defendant to prove incompetence by a higher standard, such as <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence. The right to competence cannot be waived because waivers of constitutional rights are required to be knowing and voluntary. The state may involuntarily medicate the defendant in order to make her competent for trial, but only after factual showings that there is a state interest in punishment (as opposed to civil confinement), that the medication is likely to result in competence, and that the medication is necessary to restore competence.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{then turned}} {{its attention to}} the question of a standard of proof in loss-of-citizenship cases. Terrazas had argued and the 7th Circuit had agreed that the 14th Amendment, as interpreted in Afroyim, had left Congress without any constitutional authority to set the standard of proof for intent to relinquish citizenship at a level any lower than one of <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence. The Supreme Court majority rejected this claim and held that Congress was within its rights to specify a standard of preponderance of evidence (more likely than not) when cases alleging loss of US citizenship were involved.|$|E

Further, the report emphasized that several prospective clinical trials of prolonged antibiotic therapy for persistently symptomatic patients uniformly showed evidence of harm without convincing evidence of benefit.

In its opinion, the special Alabama Supreme Court ruled {{that all of}} the Judicial Inquiry Commission charges against Moore were {{supported}} by <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence. Moore had argued that it required unanimous agreement of {{all the members of the}} JIC to remove a judge from the bench, but the special Alabama Supreme Court ruled that it did not have authority to rescind the sanctions imposed on Moore because the charges were amply supported by <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence, and that the JIC was unanimous in their decision to suspend Moore for the remainder of his term.|$|E
25|$|Cooper v.

The court said the defendant's Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process were violated.|$|E

Oklahoma did not {{specifically}} overturn Buck v. Bell, it created enough of a legal quandary to discourage many sterilizations. By 1963, sterilization laws were almost wholly out of use, though some remained officially on the books for many years. Language referring to eugenics was removed from Virginia's sterilization law, and the current law, passed in 1988 and amended in 2013, only authorizes the sterilization of incompetent patients if a Virginia court finds with <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence the sterilization procedure is medically necessary for the patient.|$|E
25|$|U.S. District Court Judge James R. Miller, Jr. {{ruled in}} favor of Beck and the 19 other co-plaintiffs in March 1983. Beck et al. claimed that CWA had not only {{breached}} its duty of fair representation but had also violated the agency fee payers' First Amendment rights as enunciated by the Supreme Court in Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson. Applying the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence standard, the district court found that CWA could not show that 21 percent of the agency fee was spent on collective bargaining purposes alone, ordered an immediate refund of all dues collected since January 1976, and directed CWA to establish a record-keeping system which segregated collective bargaining and non-collective bargaining accounts. The refund was about $5,000 for all 20 workers.|$|E

In a series of 4 panel votes, Commissioners affirmed that Turkish American funds are a primary source of support for Rep. Schmidt’s political campaign, but chided Krikorian for statements related to Turkish Government funding of his opponent, because such a funding would be illegal. The votes were taken after a panel decision to disregard testimony provided regarding the Armenian Genocide and its denial, which was criticized by David Krikorian's party and supporters. Schmidt also attempted, to no avail, to press criminal charges against Krikorian for his statements. Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator, testified on behalf of Krikorian during the Ohio Elections Commission hearing and spoke about Turkey's connections to Jean Schmidt.|$|E

50|$|A {{notarial}} instrument’s “valid” portions {{are open}} to direct rebuttal, but the “conclusive” portions can, in some jurisdictions, only be rebutted by an action of improbation (Fr inscription de faux, It querela di falso, Germ Fälschungsklage) in which a challenger must bring a collateral attack against the instrument, proving a willful material error by strong, <b>clear,</b> <b>and</b> positively <b>convincing</b> proof, rather than the ordinary preponderance of evidence standard in civil actions. Legally, a successful challenge must overcome the praesumptio iustae causa which attaches to a notarial instrument, the result {{of which is that}} said instrument is presumed to have been made or formed with a iusta causa, that is, sufficient legal consideration (causa). This presumption {{stems from the fact that}} a notary is expected to verify the facts, assertions, or events mentioned in his act, thereby assuming liability for and giving warrant to its contents.

40|$|Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are {{implementing}} Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems {{because they}} promise significant benefits. However, {{the majority of}} ERP deployments rarely meet user expectations and often do not yield expected benefits. As a result, the failure rate of ERP implementations at SMEs {{is estimated to be}} between 40 and 60 percent. This high rate of failure, together with the resultant impact on SMEs and the consequences for national development is a cause for concern. In order to address this concern, this study aims to explore how SMEs develop their business cases, as well as how the benefits, risks and costs of ERP systems are realised in SMEs. Companies need a <b>clear</b> vision <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> reasons when they adopt ERP systems. The study used the qualitative research method. Cases from South Africa and Zimbabwe were investigated in a cross-sectional study.

[...] The Secretary of State appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court, [...] questioning not only the appellate court's finding on the required standard of proof, but also challenging the finding that a separate intent to give up citizenship was required (as opposed merely {{to the performance of}} a designated expatriating act).|$|R
40|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{significance}} of cultural values are complex and many advocacy groups have not successfully provided <b>clear</b> explanations for <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> {{arguments in favor of}} prioritizing cultural values in the development processes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the roles played by culture in relation to livelihood resilience, posing the question of how cultural traditions might potentially offer alternatives/adaptive strategies, not only to strength livelihood assets of rural communities, but also in generating new opportunities during vulnerabilities caused by economic, social and political changes. Rural Kandyan communities afford us a good example of “cultural resilience”, relying on longstanding cultural traditions for their survival. This paper shows how culture and traditional values strengthen livelihood resilience and argues that while the impulse for change may come from external influences, adaptation comes from within, through dynamics, which are specific to values of the people. culture; resilience; rural communities; livelihoods; Kandy; Sri Lanka...|$|R
500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens {{also argued}} that [...] "a person's {{interest}} in retaining his American citizenship is surely an aspect of 'liberty' of which he cannot be deprived without due process of law" [...] and that [...] "due process requires that a <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> standard of proof be met" [...] in Terrazas's case or others like it. [...] Additionally, Stevens felt that Congress had not adequately addressed the question of specific intent to relinquish citizenship. [...] "Since we accept dual citizenship," [...] he wrote, [...] "taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign government is not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to remain an American citizen. [...] Moreover, as now written, the statute cannot fairly be read to require a finding of specific intent to relinquish citizenship." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, all states {{previously}} using the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] standard had adapted {{to using the}} [...] "clear and convincing" [...] standard in termination proceedings. New York, among other states, did not apply the elevated burden of proof to the fact-finding phase of the proceedings, but rather only to the termination proceedings. The Colorado Supreme Court, conducting its own Mathews test, found that such a burden need not {{be applied to the}} fact-finding portion of the case. In the 1990s, California, a state that had previously used the <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> standard, lowered its burden in termination proceedings. The constitutionality of this scheme was challenged and brought before the California Supreme Court in 1993. The court specifically rejected Santosky, citing substantial differences between California's procedures and New York's in Santosky, and upheld the constitutionality of the statute.|$|E
500|$|Toal {{then turned}} to the last issue, the trial court's refusal to {{terminate}} Brown's parental rights. The Capobiancos could not show that Brown had agreed to consent to the adoption. The court noted that the ICWA set out clear procedural guidelines and the Capobiancos did not comply with those requirements. [...] The Capobiancos also failed to show by <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence that Brown's parental rights should be terminated. Under the ICWA, prior to terminating an Indian parent's rights to the Indian child, the party seeking to terminate parental rights [...] "shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful." [...] The court noted that the Capobiancos made no efforts to comply with this requirement of federal law, but had actively sought to prevent the father from obtaining custody since the child was four months old.|$|E
500|$|Vance v. Terrazas, [...] was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that established that a United States citizen cannot have {{his or her}} citizenship taken away unless {{he or she has}} acted with an intent to give up that citizenship. [...] The Supreme Court overturned portions of an act of Congress which had listed various actions and had said that the performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive, irrebuttable proof of intent to give up U.S. citizenship. [...] However, the Court ruled that a person's intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of preponderance of evidence (i.e., more likely than not) — rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on the basis of <b>clear,</b> <b>convincing</b> <b>and</b> unequivocal evidence.|$|R
50|$|In {{the area}} of implied terms, the case is an oft-cited {{authority}} on trade usage. To put the position at its lowest, the evidence required to establish a trade usage must be <b>clear,</b> <b>convincing</b> <b>and</b> consistent. It must, moreover, amount to something more than mere opinion. Instances of the usage's having been acted upon should be provided {{in order to establish}} the fact of its existence. No rule can be laid down as to the number of witnesses required. This depends very much upon the nature of the usage in question, the character and quality of the witnesses {{and the extent to which}} their evidence is placed in issue by other evidence. In the nature of things, the court would not readily act upon the evidence of a single witness, even if uncontradicted: a fortiori if there is a conflict in the evidence.|$|R
5000|$|The court {{followed}} {{the decision of}} Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U.S. 133 in which it had held that [...] "it is settled that no conduct results in expatriation unless the conduct is engaged in voluntarily," [...] a position not challenged by the State Department in argument. The court also followed Gonzales v. Landon, 350 U.S. 920, where the court had held that {{the burden of proof}} in cases of denaturalization under section 401(j) was on the Government [...] "by <b>clear,</b> <b>convincing</b> <b>and</b> unequivocal evidence." [...] The court extended this rule to cases under all subsections of section 401. In Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118, the court had held that in a case concerning [...] "the precious right of citizenship... we believe the facts and the law should be construed as far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen." ...|$|R
500|$|The Mathews test {{employed}} {{consists of}} three considerations: the private interests affected, the risk posed by erroneous judgement, and the government interest affected. The Court found that private interests were substantially affected by the law noting that [...] "hen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it" [...] and that such a termination was irreversible. In analyzing the second factor, the Court stated that {{the interests of the}} parents and the child in their natural relationship are not distinct and thus the balancing factors are between the parents and the State. The Court then found that the [...] "fair preponderance" [...] burden did not fairly allocate risk and that a higher burden would be practically and symbolically important. The Court found that while the State had an interest, a higher burden would have little impact on the ability for the State to achieve its goal. Following from this review, the Court held that [...] "the State [...] support its allegations by at least <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence." ...|$|E

The court found in Rowling's favour, granting summary judgment and holding that [...] "no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties' works". During the course of the trial, it was held that Rowling proved [...] "by <b>clear</b> <b>and</b> <b>convincing</b> evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony", including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word [...] "muggle". Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her [...] "pattern of intentional bad faith conduct" [...] in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees. Stouffer appealed the decision in 2004, but in 2005 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling.

A modern airplane consists in fact of various types of elements of different technologies (structures, mechanics, electric, electronics, fluids, etc.). Each element has specific tasks to perform and all elements are harmonically integrated to constitute the whole system. Moreover the airplane is a particularly critical system because of quite obvious safety reasons, because of the relevance of its mission, because of high costs and eventually because of its long Life Cycle. Figure 1 shows {{an example of a}} modern transport aircraft. Let us consider the case of such an airplane, whose mission statement sounds like: "To transport in flight a certain payload from point A to point B". At a first glance the airplane {{can be seen as a}} single entity able to perform a well defined function but, getting more into the details, the airplane appears as consisting of various parts, all harmonically integrated and concurrently working to accomplish the same mission. For instance, taking into account Figure 1, different items, like the wing, the fuselage, the horizontal and vertical tails, the engine nacelles with propellers and the wheels of the landing gear (when the aircraft is on ground), can be easily individuated. By looking at the whole aircraft more into the details, other items can be identified or at least imagined, like the structural elements, the engines and many mechanical, electronic and fluidic installations, referable to the numerous and various technologies present onboard the aircraf...|$|R
