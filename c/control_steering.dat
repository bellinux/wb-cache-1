StabiliTrak was made standard equipment on all GM SUVs and vans sold in the U.S. and Canada by 2007 except for certain commercial and fleet vehicles.

40|$|Abstract—An Ackerman {{steering}} linkage for short wheelbase, four-wheel vehicles has been developed. The linkage coordinates the steering angle of each wheel through {{a range of}} 180 ° with minimal misalignment between wheels. <b>Control</b> of <b>steering</b> angles is accomplished using a single linear actuator. Control complexity is lower compared to four-wheel systems using individually <b>controlled</b> <b>steering</b> actuators for each wheel. A prototype linkage that provides a minimum turning radius while maintaining maximum stability has been developed and evaluated for a power wheelchair base. The single-actuator linkage is well suited for this application, due to the cost-sensitive nature of wheelchair products. Key words: spinal cord injury, {{steering linkage}}, wheelchair...|$|R

50|$|Reaching {{that working}} point from an initial {{configuration}} {{in which the}} various mirrors are moving freely is a control system challenge. In a first step, each mirror is controlled locally to damp its residual motion; then, an automated sequence of steps, usually long and complex, allows one {{to make the transition}} between a series of independent local controls to a unique global <b>control</b> <b>steering</b> the interferometer as a whole. Once this working point is reached, it is simpler to keep it as error signals read in real time provide a measurement of the deviation between the actual state of the interferometer and its optimal condition. From the measured differences, mechanical corrections are applied on the various mirrors to bring the system closer to its best working point.|$|E

50|$|One-arm {{or single}} arm drive enables a user to self-propel a manual {{wheelchair}} using {{only a single}} arm. The large wheel {{on the same side}} as the arm to be used is fitted with two concentric handrims, one of smaller diameter than the other. On most models the outer, smaller rim, is connected to the wheel on the opposite side by an inner concentric axle. When both handrims are grasped together, the chair may be propelled forward or backward in a straight line. When either handrim is moved independently, only a single wheel is used and the chair will turn left or right in response to the handrim used. Some wheelchairs, designed for use by hemiplegics, provide a similar function by linking both wheels rigidly together and using one of the footplates to <b>control</b> <b>steering</b> via a linkage to the front caster.|$|E

5000|$|Three days later, the Sterett {{suffered}} the same fate. While at picket station No. 4 northeast of Okinawa, five enemy planes swooped on her, and the LCS-36 and LCS-24.

40|$|Externally {{controlled}} {{motion of}} micro and nanomotors in a fluid environment constitutes a promising tool in biosensing, targeted delivery and environmental remediation. In particular, recent experiments {{have demonstrated that}} fuel-free propulsion can be achieved {{through the application of}} external magnetic fields on magnetic helically shaped structures. The magnetic interaction between helices and the rotating field induces a torque that rotates and propels them via the coupled rotational-translational motion. Recent works have shown that there exist certain optimal geometries of helical shapes for propulsion. However, experiments show that controlled motion remains a challenge at the nanoscale due to Brownian motion that interferes with the deterministic motion and makes it difficult to achieve <b>controlled</b> <b>steering.</b> In the present work we employ quantitatively accurate simulation methodology to design a setup for which magnetic nanohelices of 30 nm in radius, with and without cargo, can be accurately propelled and steered in the presence of thermal fluctuations. In particular, we demonstrate fast transport of such nanomotors and devise protocols in manipulating external fields to achieve directionally <b>controlled</b> <b>steering</b> at biologically relevant temperatures...|$|R
