5|$|The {{adult cattle}} egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks {{may be lost}} to starvation, <b>calcium</b> <b>deficiency</b> or {{disturbance}} from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming {{is believed to be}} a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{factor in}} nesting mortality is starvation. Sibling rivalry can be intense, and in South Africa {{third and fourth}} chicks inevitably starve. In the dryer habitats with fewer amphibians the diet may lack sufficient vertebrate content and may cause bone abnormalities in growing chicks due to <b>calcium</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In Barbados, nests were sometimes raided by vervet monkeys, and a study in Florida reported the fish crow and black rat as other possible nest raiders. The same study attributed some nestling mortality to brown pelicans nesting in the vicinity, which accidentally, but frequently, dislodged nests or caused nestlings to fall. In Australia, Torresian crows, wedge-tailed eagles and white-bellied sea eagles take eggs or young, and tick infestation and viral infections may also be causes of mortality.|$|E

50|$|<b>Calcium</b> (Ca) <b>deficiency</b> is a plant {{disorder}} {{that can be}} caused by insufficient level of available calcium in the growing medium, but is more frequently a product of low transpiration of the whole plant or more commonly the affected tissue. Plants are susceptible to such localized <b>calcium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in low or non-transpiring tissues because calcium is not transported in the phloem. This may be due to water shortages, which slow the transportation of calcium to the plant, poor uptake of calcium through the stem, or too much nitrogen in the soil.|$|R

50|$|Because coir pith {{is high in}} {{sodium and}} potassium, it is treated before use as a growth medium for plants or fungi by soaking in a calcium {{buffering}} solution; most coir sold for growing purposes {{is said to be}} pre-treated.

Coir is naturally rich in potassium, which can lead to magnesium and <b>calcium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> in soilless horticultural media. Coir fiber is rarely used as a potting material, except for orchids, and does not need buffering, as it has a very low cation-exchange capacity (CEC) capacity, hence not retaining salts.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Vitamin D and <b>calcium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> {{are common}} worldwide, causing {{nutritional}} rickets and osteomalacia, {{which have a}} major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children, and adolescents; the consequences can be lethal or can last into adulthood. The goals of this evidence-based consensus document are to provide health care professionals with guidance for prevention, diagnosis, and management of nutritional rickets and to provide policy makers with a framework to work toward its eradication. EVIDENCE: A systematic literature search examining the definition, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nutritional rickets in children was conducted. Evidence-based recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system that describe the strength of the recommendation and the quality of supporting evidence. PROCESS: Thirty-three nominated experts in pediatric endocrinology, pediatrics, nutrition, epidemiology, public health, and health economics evaluated the evidence on specific questions within five working groups. The consensus group, representing 11 international scientific organizations, participated in a multiday conference in May 2014 to reach a global evidence-based consensus. RESULTS: This consensus document defines nutritional rickets and its diagnostic criteria and describes the clinical management of rickets and osteomalacia. Risk factors, particularly in mothers and infants, are ranked, and specific prevention recommendations including food fortification and supplementation are offered for both the clinical and public health contexts. CONCLUSION: Rickets, osteomalacia, and vitamin D and <b>calcium</b> <b>deficiencies</b> are preventable global public health problems in infants, children, and adolescents. Implementation of international rickets prevention programs, including supplementation and food fortification, is urgently required...|$|R

Potato peel, grass clippings and rice husks were the starting organic materials considered. The incorporation of 30 % (w/w) ES in a composting mixture did not affect mixture biodegradability, nor its capacity to reach sanitizing temperatures. After 25 days of composting, ES addition caused a nitrogen loss of about 10 g N kg− 1 of initial volatile solids, thus reducing nitrogen nutritional potential of the finished compost.
