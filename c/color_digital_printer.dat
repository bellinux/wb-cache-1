40|$|RIP), ink jet printer In commercial, {{product or}} {{packaging}} printing, specific color inks {{are often used}} to meet specific requirements of customers. Recent developments in digital printing made this technique attractive for possible implementation in commercial, product or packaging printing. While digital printing {{is not expected to}} completely replace the conventional printing techniques, digital printing can be used for product proofing, replacing conventional procedures for product verification. To use digital printing for proofing and short run production, proper reproduction of spot <b>colors</b> with <b>digital</b> <b>printers</b> is essential. <b>Digital</b> <b>color</b> reproduction is closely related to color management, since a properly managed digital workflow is essential for accurate <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> reproduction. The overall objective of this investigation is to establish a digital proofing system for spot color printing. Color management with ICC profiles is used to investigate the reproduction of specific spot <b>colors.</b> Selected <b>digital</b> <b>printers</b> combined with its print driver and a commercially available RIP are tested and characterized by generating ICC profiles. These profiles are used to compare the device gamut and to investigate reproduction of specific spot colors. The reproduction of the spot colors on optimal (manufacture recommended Epson Premium Semimatte Photo Paper) and actual production substrates are compared. The quality of reproduction is evaluated in terms of the usual ΔE in L*a*b * color space...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to understand the investment requirements that <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> prospects will face in order to build a <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> business. <b>Printers</b> and prepress firms have been hearing that the cost of ownership is declining, but they need to understand that the business model reaches far beyond cost per page. Not only do <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> <b>printers</b> need to purchase equipment, maintenance support, and consumables, but they need to build the right infrastructure to deliver value-added <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> services to their customers. This research report will examine the various equipment, RIP, and software options print service providers have for migrating into the world of <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> and the associated costs. More importantly, this document will describe what is required to transform <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> equipment into value-added services.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{colorimetric}} characterization of a printer is proposed. It {{can also be}} applied to {{any other type of}} digital image reproduction device. The method is based on a computational geometry approach. It uses a 3 D triangulation technique to build a tetrahedral partition of the printer color gamut volume and it generates a surrounding structure enclosing the definition domain. The characterization provides the inverse transformation from the device-independent color space CIELAB to the device-dependent color spaceCMY, taking into account both colorimetric properties of the printer, and color gamut mapping.

Ask them to {{describe}} the color and they might resort to analogies such as mahogany, chestnut or chocolate. Ask how to produce the color with pigments and they could probably break it down in great detail, though their opinions might differ. But ask them to describe the same color using the numerical values required in the digital domain and things become problematic. Systems such as red-green-blue (RGB) coordinates; hue, saturation and value (HSV); or L*a*b*(CIELAB) values are terra incognita for most artists, {{but they are the}} roadmap of image software, color profiles and “lookup tables,” that drive <b>digital</b> <b>color</b> <b>printers,</b> a core component of today’s digital atelier. The gap between how artists approach color and how it is approached by commercially available digital printing systems creates numerous problems: it makes it difficult to predict the look of a printed color, which compromises reproduction and interferes with artistic creativity.
