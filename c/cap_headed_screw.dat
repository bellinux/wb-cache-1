5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to {{many different types of}} sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R
40|$|Torque tension {{testing of}} a newly {{designed}} Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle bolted assembly was successfully completed. Test {{results showed that the}} 3 -sigma preload variation was as expected at the required input torque level and the preload relaxation were within the engineering limits. A shim installation technique was demonstrated as a simple process to fill a shear lip gap between nozzle housings in the joint region. A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The bolted assembly performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw,</b> allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the <b>head</b> of the <b>screw.</b> The shape of the die in the machine dictates what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b> This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{are limited}} {{information}} and inconclusive results for dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nails for trochanteric fractures. Therefore, {{we performed a}} prospective study to evaluate the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients operated with this implant. 				 					Methods: We prospectively studied 79 patients (61 women and 18 men; mean age: 84. 7 ¬†years; range: 65 ‚Äì 96 ¬†years) with a low-energy trochanteric fracture, treated with a dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail from 2013 to 2016. The mean follow-up was 2. 1 ¬†years (range: 1 ‚Äì 3 ¬†years); seven patients were lost to follow up. This left 72 patients for further analysis. We evaluated the healing of fractures, and survival, function, and complications of patients. 				 					Results: Fracture healing was evident in 70 patients (97. 2 %) at 2 ‚Äì 3 months postoperatively. One patient experienced cut-out and z-effect phenomenon of the <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Another patient experienced a periprosthetic femoral diaphysis fracture at the distal tip of the nail. A third patient experienced an acute postoperative superficial skin infection that was treated successfully with wound dressing changes and a course of antibiotics. Sixteen patients (22. 2 %) deceased within 12 ¬†months postoperatively. In the remaining patients, the Harris Hip Score (HHS) at 12 ¬†months postoperatively was excellent in 16 (28. 6 %), good in 23 (41. 1 %), fair in 10 (17. 8 %), and poor in 7 patients (12. 5 %). The function declined after the patients‚Äô fracture. Fair and poor results were related to age >¬† 85 ¬†years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types. 				 					Conclusion: The dual <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> intramedullary hip nail is associated with high healing and low complication rates for intertrochanteric fractures. The function of the patients is good or excellent in most cases; however, it declines, especially for those patients with age >¬† 85 ¬†years, poor pre-fracture level of function, and AO/OTA- 31 -A 3 fracture types...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Z-effect {{and reverse}} Z-effect are {{complications}} {{that arise from}} the surgical treatment of pertrochanteric fractures of the femur with proximal femoral nails (PFN) comprising two interlocking <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> Such complications are induced by the migration of screws in opposite directions, which may lead to failure of the osteosynthesis. Findings The paper describes three cases of pertrochanteric fractures that were treated with PFN with two interlocking screws that evolved to either Z-effect or reverse Z-effect. Literature-based explanations for this phenomenon are provided together with recommendations of how to avoid such complications. Conclusions Although intramedullary fixation is an established method of treatment of femoral intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures, {{the evolution of the}} procedure may include complications associated with the migration of the interlocking <b>head</b> <b>screws.</b> The occurrence of Z-effect and reverse Z-effect has not been completely elucidated, but the main causes of such complications are probably fracture fixation in varus position, severe medial comminution, inappropriate entry point of the nail and poor bone quality. </p...|$|R

Aim {{of the study was to}} find the single best and combination of radiographic projections to reliably detect screw cut outs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The locking plate was fixed to six cadaveric proximal humeri. Six different radiographs were performed: anteriorposterior in internal (apIR), in neutral (ap 0) and in 30 ¬∞ external rotation (apER); axial in 30 ¬∞ (ax 30) and 60 ¬∞ (ax 60) abduction and an outlet view. Each <b>head</b> <b>screw</b> (n= 9) was sequentially exchanged to perforate the humeral head with the tip and all radiographs were repeated for each cut out.

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square socket <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot <b>head</b> <b>screws</b> and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
