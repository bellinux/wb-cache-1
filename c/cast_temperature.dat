The study investigates the DC processes in which liquid aluminum is cooling continuously in mold and then with water spray at the exit of mold. An inverse method is applied to measure heat transfer coefficient on water cooling surface experimentally. A correlation of heat transfer coefficient with surface temperature is used in numerical simulation. It has been approved that the defected curl and tears are caused by the higher rates of initial cooling and solidifying in mold and the sweat and liquation are caused by the isolation of heat transfer by air gap formed between cast solid surface and the mold wall by volume shrinkage with solidification. The present research analyzes the variations of temperature profiles in the cast ingot by the changes of cast speed and <b>cast</b> <b>temperature</b> and assesses the improvements of mold and cast process for the better cast quality...|$|E
40|$|Wire is a {{versatile}} product that offer the highest strength in any material and has therefore been a product form {{that is highly}} valued in engineering alloys. The idea of direct casting wire directly from metallic alloy melt {{has been around for}} long but for many reasons has not progressed to large scale commercialization. The main problem had been the difficulty of maintaining a stable melt stream while melt jet can be quenched and continuously solidified into unbroken wire product. Here, we consider the factors responsible for stabilizing a liquid metallic melt jet and the optimization of these. Experimentation with Fe-Si-B-Cr melts for single and multi-strand is reported. It is demonstrated that high strength metallic glass wires were castable using up to five strands. The role of oxide forming elements in stabilizing and widening the range of process parameters is emphasized. X-ray photon electron spectroscopy (XPS) of direct cast wires showed that stable Cr/Si oxide were formed and the evaluation of experimental cast data suggest that a minimum concentration of oxide former is required to maintain continuity in wire products. Other significant process parameters to be optimized for continuous wire formation in multi-streaming wire casting were, nozzle spacing, nozzle-water clearance, and the <b>cast</b> <b>temperature.</b> The multi-streaming of the wire casting process was achieved using laser drilled nozzles and thus provided a credible path for increasing the throughput in a wire casting process...|$|E

40|$|Solution-cast films made in {{different}} temperatures of shape memory polyurethane have been investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry, tensile test, {{water vapor permeability}} with different temperature and humidity and the shape memory effect were carried out to characterize these polyurethanes. We can get some results as follow: 1. SMPU films cast at higher temperatures have higher crystalinity of soft segments and hard segments than the sample cast at low temperature. The difference of mechanical properties and shape memory effects due to the difference in casting temperatures {{is related to the}} increase of the overall and the segment crystallinity. It seems that moderate crystalinity offers better shape memory effect and tensile properties. 2. The films obtained are non-porous and the water vapor permeability of SMPU films depends on the solubility and diffuse transmission of water vapor in these non-porous films. The changes in the water vapor permeability of SMPU films with respect to the temperature follow an S-Shaped curve, and increases abruptly at Tm of the soft segment due primarily to the changes of the morphology of soft segments on increased temperature. Moderate crystalinity is more suitable for better water vapor permeability than very low and very high crystalinity. 3. The water vapor permeability dependency of the temperature and humidity contribute {{is the result of the}} change of diffusion and solubility with the surrounding air condition. The diffusion coefficient (D) are the function of temperature and show good fit the Arrhenius form but show different parameter values when above and below Tg or Tm. 4.

40|$|A 2200 cc engine {{head for}} marine {{applications}} has been analysed and optimized {{by means of}} decoupled CFD and FEM simulations {{in order to assess}} the fatigue strength of the component. The fluid distribution within the cooling jacket was extensively analysed and improved in previous works, in order to enhance the performance of the coolant galleries. As a consequence of the many complex phenomena involved, an improved approach is presented in this paper, capable of a better characterization of the fatigue strength of the engine head under both high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue loadings. The improved methodology is once again based on a decoupled CFD and FEM analysis, with relevant improvements added to both simulation realms. From the CFD side, a new generation polyhedral grid is employed to combine high resolution surface spacing, computational demand, and numerical stability of the CFD simulations, with particular emphasis on the boundary layer representation. The local heat flux distribution is calculated by means of CFD analyses of the coolant galleries, now including the engine block portion, plus the engine head metal cast. In order to tune and improve the accuracy of the numerical forecasts, comparisons are carried out with experiments in terms of local metal <b>cast</b> <b>temperature</b> distribution for steady operation of the cooling circuit. Once again, particular care is devoted to the CFD representation of the boundary layer, both fluid and thermal. At the same time, great attention is paid to the thermal boundary conditions, i. e. the distribution of the heat fluxes among the many components facing the combustion process. In order to improve the accuracy of the CFD forecasts, effects of coolant boiling on the heat transfer forecast are investigated and included in the procedure. As a result, a pointwise heat transfer distribution on the fluid/solid interface is transferred as a boundary condition to a thermo-structural analysis for the evaluation of the fatigue strength of the component. An ad-hoc routine is used to map the CFD computed pointwise distribution of the heat flux on a FEM-optimized grid. From the FEM side, an energy based fatigue strength criterion is now implemented {{in order to create a}} design tool capable of predicting the fatigue strength of automotive parts subjected to different thermo-mechanical loadings.

30|$|As the {{intrinsic}} heterogeneity of BMGS {{can affect the}} rejuvenation behavior of BMGs upon following thermal treatment, the reason why different <b>casting</b> <b>temperatures</b> can tailor the microstructures should be clarified. Zhu et al. have {{also found that the}} <b>casting</b> <b>temperature</b> can tailor the structure from fully amorphous state (at high <b>casting</b> <b>temperature)</b> to composite structure (at low <b>casting</b> <b>temperature)</b> [30]. When the metallic liquid is quenched from high temperature, the element in the liquid can be fully mixed and makes the liquid more homogenous. Thus, fully amorphous phase can be obtained. However, if the <b>casting</b> <b>temperature</b> is low, the element segregation can occur in very local area among the liquid, which are retained during the solidification. This segregation is considered to be the nuclei for the nano-clusters in LT samples. Furthermore, if the <b>casting</b> <b>temperature</b> is very low, we cannot produce amorphous samples even with high cooling rate. Therefore, varying the <b>casting</b> <b>temperature</b> can induce nano-sized heterogeneity in the amorphous matrix, which generates internal stress and rejuvenation during DCT.|$|R

40|$|The work is {{particularly}} aimed at metallurgical problems connected with manufacture of castings of weight about 1 up to 40 tons from high-alloy austenitic nickel cast irons also known under the trade name Ni-resist. The main {{aim is to}} check and complement the knowledge about manufacture of heavy castings from austenitic nickel cast irons {{in a field of}} control of tapping and <b>casting</b> <b>temperature,</b> carbon content control with regard to the prediction of eutectic composition and in a field of setting a suitable chemical composition of cast iron with regard to the formation of chunky graphite and stability of the austenitic matrix and further on also possibilities of cast iron filtration during pouring the castings. Based on done experiments the formulae were determined that enable to calculate eutectic and liquidus temperatures on the basis of chemical composition of the cast iron. The use of several formulae given in the literature for calculating the carbon equivalent of austenitic nickel cast irons was compared and evaluated. For utilization of determined results in practice a calculating programme has been compiled making possible to be used in operational practice. This programme is named Calculation of <b>casting</b> <b>temperature</b> of Ni-resist <b>cast</b> irons. After the entry of the melt chemical composition the programme calculates the all important parameters necessary to know and to be controlled for manufacture of high quality castings from austenitic nickel <b>cast</b> irons. Eutectic <b>temperature,</b> liquidus temperature and then based on it the tapping and <b>casting</b> <b>temperatures</b> are included among those parameters. Further on there are eutectic concentration of carbon, carbon equivalent, nickel equivalent, and a criterion evaluating a danger of chunky graphite formation...|$|R

The interrelation between spatial configuration of chill mold and frequency curved lines for gradients of the chill mold and <b>casting</b> <b>temperatures</b> is analyzed. The possibilities of using of the temperatures gradients for analysis of thermostressed state of foundry units are shown. </p...|$|R
40|$|In this study, it {{was shown}} that {{improvements}} {{in the quality of}} continuously cast steel billets, similar to those which can be achieved by electromagnetic stirring (EMS) of the liquid pool during solidification, can be obtained if casting superheats can be consistently controlled at low levels. A lack of <b>casting</b> <b>temperature</b> control is not only detrimental {{to the quality of the}} cast product, but also to a shop's overall productivity. The important variables for temperature control in the ladle, tundish and mould were quantified and possible methods of controlling these variables were proposed. The thermal state of the ladle lining is one of the major contributors to the variability in <b>casting</b> <b>temperature.</b> It was shown that by reducing energy losses from the refractory ladle lining, by way of incorporating an insulating refractory tile between the ladle shell and the safety lining and by using a ladle lid throughout the cycle of the ladle, temperature losses from the liquid steel can be substantially decreased.
