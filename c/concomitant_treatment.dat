40|$|International audienceBackground Open-label, {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) {{are subject to}} observer bias. If patient management is conducted without blinding, a difference between groups {{may be explained by}} other factors than study treatment. One factor may come from taking <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> with an efficacy on the studied outcomes. In type 2 diabetes, some antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs are effective against diabetic complications. We wanted to determine if these <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> were correctly reported in articles of RCTs on type 2 diabetes and if they might have influenced the outcome. Methods We performed a systematic review using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (from January 1950 to July 2010). Open-label RCTs assessing the effectiveness of intensive blood-glucose control in type 2 diabetes were included. We chose five therapeutic classes with proven efficacy against diabetes complications: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs), fibrates, statins, and aspirin. Differences between <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> were considered statistically significant when p Results A total of eight open-label RCTs were included, but only three (37. 5 %) of them published <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments.</b> In two studies (ACCORD and ADVANCE), a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups for aspirin (p = 0. 02) and ACEIs (p = 0. 02). Conclusions Few <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> were published in this sample of open-label RCTs. We cannot completely eliminate an observer bias for these studies. This bias probably influenced the results to an extent {{that has yet to be}} determined...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent studies {{indicate}} increased risks of malignant lymphomas among individuals treated with corticosteroids, {{but have not}} taken into account the underlying reasons for steroid use, so the increased risks might be attributable to the underlying disease or <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> other than steroids.

40|$|Oral {{anticoagulants}} {{are frequently}} used in clinical practice. The most important complication of oral anticoagulation is major bleeding. The incidence of major bleeding is about 2 - 3 %/year in randomized controlled trials {{but may be}} considerably higher under real life conditions. Major bleeding risk in patients receiving oral anticoagulants depends on factors related to anticoagulation itself (intensity and quality), patient-related factors (demographic characteristics and comorbid diseases), and <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> with antiplatelet or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

2500|$|There are no {{expected}} pharmacokinetic {{interactions between}} thalidomide and other medicines {{due to its}} neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes. [...] It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatment</b> with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy. The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception {{to ensure that no}} child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.|$|E
40|$|Background The most {{important}} symptom {{as well as}} one of the major diagnostic criteria for eczema is itch. Although oral antihistamines continue to be prescribed for people with eczema, it is unclear if they are effective and safe in relieving itch and skin lesions. We sought to evaluate the available evidence on effectiveness of oral antihistamines (H 1 antagonists) as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema. Methods Searches included 10 databases and trial registers as well as conference proceedings (January 2014). Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of oral H 1 antihistamines as monotherapy in children and adults with eczema were included. Results Our searches retrieved 757 references, but no randomised controlled trial met our inclusion criteria. Most studies allowed <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments,</b> making the assessment of the individual effects of oral H 1 antihistamines impossible. Conclusions There is currently no high-level evidence to support or refute the efficacy or safety of oral H 1 antihistamines used as monotherapy for eczema. A further review of studies that assesses the effects of oral H 1 antihistamines as ‘add-on’ therapy together with <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> is warranted to determine the beneficial effects of this group of medications in the treatment of eczema...|$|R

40|$|Hyponatremia is {{a common}} {{electrolyte}} disorder in cancer patients. It {{may be related to}} cancer, to anti-cancer therapy or to other <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments.</b> In this setting hyponatremia is often caused by the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion, which is due to the ectopic production of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), to extracellular fluid depletion, to renal toxicity caused by chemotherapy or to other underlying conditions. Recent studies suggested that hyponatremia might be considered a negative prognostic factor for cancer patients therefore its early detection, monitoring and management might improve the patient's outcome. Treatment of hyponatremia depends on patient's symptoms severity, onset timing and extracellular volume status. In this review we summarize the main causes of hyponatremia in cancer patients and its management, including the available treatment options...|$|R

40|$|The {{interspecific}} {{interactions of}} Meloidogyne javanica with races 1, 2, 3, and 4 of M. incognita on tomato were determined. Impacts {{of the interactions}} on fecundity and morphometrics of females were also examined. Mutually inhibitory interactions occurred between M. javanica and the races of M. incognita, but the negative interactions did not reflect in plant growth. Numbers of root galls, egg masses, mature females, total population, fecundity, and reproduction factor declined in <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments,</b> but the morphometrics of the females remained unaltered. In general, mutual suppressive effects in all parameters were smaller for M. javanica than M. incognita, but some variations occurred among the races of M. incognita.

30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first study about calf morphometrics in CP after a {{non-invasive}} orthotic treatment. Prior to bracing, the children with CP had shorter and thinner MG muscle bellies, and shorter fascicles but longer distal tendons than controls. Positional ankle–foot braces significantly improved passive dorsiflexion with the knees flexed and improved the gait pattern of the children, but failed to improve MG morphometrics. Further shortened fascicles and thinner muscle bellies are likely {{due to the fact that}} bracing potentially decreased the MG excursion or kept the bi-articular muscle off-tension. Theoretically, braces may need to extend the knee if MG morphometric pathology is to be targeted. Promoting dorsiflexion and normalizing muscle morphometrics seems difficult to be accomplished in concert using traditional orthopaedic means such as surgery, botulinum toxin injections or brace wear in isolation. Consequently, there is a need for <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments</b> that promote muscle growth.|$|R

40|$|Background: Seven genes {{involved}} in folate metabolism {{are located on}} chromosome 21. Previous {{studies have shown that}} folate deficiency may contribute to mental retardation in Down’s syndrome (DS). Methodology: We investigated the effect of oral folate supplementation (daily dose of 1. 060. 3 mg/kg) on cognitive functions in DS children, aged from 3 to 30 months. They received 1 mg/kg leucovorin or placebo daily, for 12 months, in a single-centre, randomised, double-blind study. Folinic acid (leucovorin, LV) was preferred to folic acid as its bioavailability is higher. The developmental age (DA) of the patients was assessed on the Brunet-Lezine scale, from baseline to the end of treatment. Results: The intent-to-treat analysis (113 patients) did not show a positive effect of leucovorin treatment. However, it identified important factors influencing treatment effect, such as age, sex, and <b>concomitant</b> <b>treatments,</b> including thyroid treatment in particular. A per protocol analysis was carried out on patients evaluated by the same examiner {{at the beginning and end}} of the treatment period. This analysis of 87 patients (43 LV-treated vs. 44 patients on placebo) revealed a positive effect of leucovorin on developmental age (DA). DA was 53. 1 % the normal value with leucovorin and only 44. 1 % with placebo (p, 0. 05).
