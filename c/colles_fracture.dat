40|$|Abstract- BACKGROUND: <b>Colle’s</b> <b>{{fracture}}</b> is a {{very common}} extra-articular fracture that occurs {{as the result of}} a fall on out stretched hand (FOOSH). Although <b>Colle’s</b> <b>fractures</b> are commonly seen in all age groups and demographics, they are particularly common in osteoporotic individuals and as such are more frequently seen in elderly women. Some complications are associated with injury itself. The complications such as persistent neuropathy of median nerve, ulnar nerve or radial nerve, malunited fracture and post traumatic stiffness have been reported in 1 out of 3 patients. Rehabilitation of fractures {{is a very}} important thing because of the limitations produced by improper management can lead to stiffness, deformity and limitation of functions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to find out the effects of Maitland’s mobilization with Neuro-Muscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) on pain and hand grip strength in patients with post <b>Colle’s</b> <b>fracture</b> stiffness. DESIGN: Pre- test and Post- test experimental study desig...|$|R
50|$|Fragility {{fracture}} {{is a type}} of pathologic fracture {{that occurs}} as result of normal activities, such as a fall from standing height or less. There are three fracture sites said to be typical of fragility fractures: vertebral fractures, fractures of the neck of the femur, and <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> of the wrist. This definition arises because a normal human being {{ought to be able to}} fall from standing height without breaking any bones, and a fracture therefore suggests weakness of the skeleton.|$|E
50|$|The term of <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> is classically used to {{describe}} a fracture at the distal end of the radius, at its cortico-cancellous junction. However, now the term tends to be used loosely {{to describe}} any fracture of the distal radius, with or without involvement of the ulna, that has dorsal displacement of the fracture fragments. Colles himself {{described it as a}} fracture that “takes place at about {{an inch and a half}} (38mm) above the carpal extremity of the radius” and “the carpus and the base of metacarpus appears to be thrown backward”.|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of fractures (i. e., hip, Colles, humeral and vertebral fractures), compared with that of other common diseases requiring hospitalization, on health care in the main hospital in Rome (Italy). Methods: Hospital discharge forms, filled in according to the 9 (th) International Classification of Diseases, were examined from 1996 to 1999. Data on fractures were compared with those related to other diseases which occupy a considerable proportion of hospital operating time in Italy: coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disorders (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breast cancer (BC). Results: In all groups of patients, the mean age of females was significantly higher (p< 0. 0001) than that of males. Male patients with hip fractures had hospital stays significantly longer than females (p< 0. 0001), whereas women with <b>Colles</b> <b>fractures</b> had significantly (p< 0. 02) longer stays. When patients were divided according to age (i. e., over or under 60 years), mean hospital stays did not differ between younger and older patients in all groups except <b>Colles</b> <b>fractures</b> (p< 0. 001). Hip fractures in older patients showed striking in-hospital mortality. Throughout the study period, hip fractures accounted for the highest overall and per-patient costs. The number of female patients with fractures (and, obviously, breast cancer) was higher, while the opposite applied to the other disorders. Male patients with fractures, CHD and CVD were significantly younger than females (p< 0. 0001). When the percentage of deaths was added to that of patients discharged to other institutions, fractures showed the poorest outcome of any hospitalization event. Per-patient costs were remarkably high-er for CHD, followed by fractures. Conclusions: Fractures represent a growing but often underestimated burden for hospital care in Italy; further studies are needed on this issue. (C) 2003, Editrice Kurtis...|$|R

40|$|Background Musculoskeletal (MSK) {{conditions}} of the wrist and hand encompass {{a broad spectrum of}} disorders from acute traumas to chronic pathologies. Extensive lists of potential treatments are presented in the literature; however the evidence supporting the use of each modality is limited, with no systematic review conducted which has examined the effectiveness of resting splints on a range of MSK {{conditions of}} the wrist and hand. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of resting wrist and hand splints in reducing pain and increasing hand function in individuals with MSK {{conditions of the}} wrist and hand. Search Strategy To locate studies, the databases MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, CINAHL, PEDro and SportDiscus were searched using defined keywords. The search took place in February 2013. Selection Criteria Included within the review were all randomised controlled trials (RCT’s), controlled clinical trials (CCT’s), cohort studies, quasi experimental trials and crossover trials which evaluated the effectiveness of resting splints in individuals diagnosed with MSK conditions of the wrist and hand, excluding rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. Papers written only in English, involving participants 18 years and older were analyzed. Data Collection and Analysis The methodological quality of the included articles was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) research appraisal tool. Main Results In total seven studies were selected for inclusion in this review. MSK conditions examined included first carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (three papers), extensor tendon repairs in zones V to VII of the hand (two papers), proximal interphalangeal joint hyperextension injuries (one paper) and displaced <b>Colles</b> <b>fractures</b> (one paper). Results suggest that resting splints can reduce pain and improve function in first carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, with no statistically significant improvements found amongst the other conditions examined. Conclusion This systematic review revealed that resting splints have positive effects on reducing pain and improving hand function in individuals with first carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis, but that {{due to a lack of}} research, conclusions cannot be drawn on their effectiveness across a range of MSK conditions of the wrist and hand...|$|R
40|$|It has now became {{possible}} {{to measure the}} bone mineral content in the axial {{as well as the}} peripheral skeleton. Moreover, with the use of computed tomography a selective assessment can be made of cancellous (trabecular) versus cortical bone mineral density. These technical achievements have led {{to a better understanding of}} the pathophysiology of osteoporosis and provided information on the effects of therapeutic interventions. Despite these sophisticated methods for bone mineral assessment the diagnosis of osteoporosis remains based on the occurrence of non-traumatic fractures and for that purpose an ordinary X-ray will be sufficient. For investigational use several non-invasive methods for measuring bone mineral mass have been developed, although only photonabsorptiometry (Single and Dual energy: SPA and DPA. respectively) and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) are operational in large scale clinical practice. The advantages of photonabsorptiometry and the more recently developed Dual Energy Xray Absorptiometry (DEXA) over QCT are the lower radiation exposure, lower costs, better accuracy and precision and easier operation. The great advantage of QCT is the unique possibility to measure cancellous and cortical bone separately. With these non-invasive methods of bone mineral assessment is has been shown that women will lose during their lifes about 35 percent of their cortical and about 50 percent of their cancellous bone. We studied this pattern of age-related bone loss cross-sectionally in 171 healthy Dutch women and observed an accelerated bone loss around the menopause at all measurement sites (see Chapter 5). Further analyses showed that the onset of cortical bone loss as measured by SPA occurs on the average at least a decade later than the onset of cancellous bone loss which already manifests itself before the menopause. This pattern of cancellous and cortical bone loss during aging shows a parrallelism with the observed patterns of incidence of age-related fractures. The incidence of <b>Colles</b> <b>fractures</b> in women rises soon after the menopause and a plateau is reached around the age of 65. This type of fracture (distal forearm) occurs at a site containing a relatively high proportion of cancellous bone. On the other hand, the incidence of hip fractures increases slowly with age, which rise accelerates late in life in both men and women. This type of fracture characteristically is one of cortical bone. Somewhere between these two types of fractures the vertebral compression fractures take position. They occur soon after the menopause and the incidence apppears to rise over the two decades after menopause. The vertebral body contains about equal amounts of cancellous and cortical bone...|$|R
40|$|Die winkelstabile T-Radiusplattenosteosynthese im Vergleich mit anderen Osteosynthesverfahren In dieser Untersuchung sollte die Therapieform Osteosynthese mittels palmarer winkelstabiler T-Radiusplatte mit den herkömmlichen Osteosyntheseverfahren (Kirschnerdrahtosteosynthese, Plattenosteosynthese, Schraubenosteosynthese, Fixateur externe und kombinierte Operationsverfahren) in Bezug auf das radiologische und funktionelle Ergebnis verglichen werden. Im unserem Krankengut wurden 146 Patienten mit distaler Radiusfraktur mit einer winkelstabilen Plattenosteosynthese (Gruppe 1) operativ behandelt und nachuntersucht. Außer in 8 Fällen lagen Extensionsfrakturen vor. Alle wurden unabhängig vom Frakturtyp mit dem T-Radiusplattensystem (2, 4 / 2, 7 mm) ohne zusätzliche Spongiosaplastik operiert. Dieser Gruppe wurden 119 Patienten gegenübergestellt, die mit den bislang üblichen Operationsverfahren osteosynthetisch versorgt wurden (Gruppe 2). Darunter befanden sich 65 Patienten mit ausschließlicher Kirschnerdrahtosteosynthese (Gruppe 2 a) und 16 Patienten mit nicht winkelstabiler Plattenosteosynthese (Gruppe 2 b). Die Gruppen 2 a und 2 b wurden gesondert betrachtet und mit der Gruppe 1 verglichen. In allen Fällen der Gruppe 1 konnte im Gegensatz zu den anderen Operationsverfahren (Gruppe 2 a und 2 b) ein anatomisches Ausheilungsergebnis ohne relevanten sekundären Korrekturverlust erreicht werden. Ein ulnarer Vorschub konnte in der Gruppe 1 mit der winkelstabilen Plattenosteosynthese vermieden werden (durchschnittlich 0, 8 mm Verkürzung), dagegen zeigte sich in der Gruppe 2 eine durchschnittliche radiale Verkürzung von 2, 6 mm. Eine verbleibende Gelenkstufe von 2 mm erhöht das Risiko der Entstehung einer posttraumatischen Arthrose im Langzeitverlauf auf 91 %. Eine solche Gelenkflächenstufung wurde bei allen Patienten aufgehoben. Im Durchschnitt konnte in allen Gruppen ein Wert von maximal 1 mm erreicht werden. Die Beurteilung im radiologischen Bewertungsschema nach Naumann [47] ergab bei den Patienten der Gruppe 1 ein sehr gutes bis gutes Ergebnis (durchschnittlich 2, 8 Punkte), in der Gruppe 2 ein gutes Ergebnis mit 4, 9 Punkten. Die Rate postoperativer Komplikationen war bei der winkelstabilen Osteosyntheseform deutlich geringer (4, 11 %) als bei den anderen Osteosyntheseformen (Kirschnerdrahtosteosynthese 12, 31 %, konventionelle Plattenosteosynthese 6, 25 %). Die klinische Untersuchung der Patienten erbrachte eine verbesserte Beweglichkeit und Gebrauchsfähigkeit bei den Patienten, deren Frakturen mit der winkelstabilen T-Radiusplatte versorgt worden waren; ermöglicht durch eine frühzeitige funktionelle Nachbehandlung. Auch die subjektiven Scores dieser Patienten zeigten im Vergleich mit den übrigen Osteosyntheseverfahren einen besseren Wert; der durchschnittliche DASH - Wert der Gruppe 1 lag bei 13, 95 Punkten, der Solgaard - Score bei 1, 5 Punkten. Der DASH - Score der Patienten in Gruppe 2 war mit 23, 13 Punkten deutlich schlechter, der Solgaard - Score der Gruppe 2 lag um 3, 5 Punkte höher bei durchschnittlich 5, 9 Punkten. Die Behandlung der Frakturen am distalen Radius erfordert aufgrund ihrer hohen Inzidenz und sozioökonomischen Relevanz eine stabile osteosynthetische Versorgung mit anatomischer Reposition und der Möglichkeit zur frühfunktionellen Nachbehandlung Mit winkelstabilen Implantaten können, wie in der vorliegenden Arbeit gezeigt, die Vorteile des palmaren Zugangs (schonenderer Weichteilzugang, gute Exploration der Fraktur, exakte Reposition der Fraktur, bessere Weichteildeckung und weniger Komplikationen) auch im Falle von Extensionsfrakturen und intraartikulären Frakturen genutzt werden. Durch die subchondrale Abstützung (Platzierung der winkelstabilen Stifte unmittelbar an der Gelenkflächenkortikalis, ohne sie zu perforieren) ist eine dauerhafte Retention nach dem Fixateur-interne-Prinzip gewährleistet mit der Möglichkeit der Frühmobilisation. Die palmare winkelstabile Plattenosteosynthese kann somit heute als Standardverfahren zur adäquaten Therapie der nach AO definierten A 3 -, sowie B 2 - B 3 - und C 1 -C 3 -Frakturen, gerade auch beim älteren Menschen mit osteoporotischem Knochen, gelten. The palmar fixed angel radius-T-plate-osteosynthesis in {{comparision}} {{to other}} traditional osteosynthetic methods This study compares the surgical method osteosynthesis with fixed angle palmar T-radius-plate {{with the traditional}} osteosyntheses (K-wire-fixation, plate-osteosynthesis, screw-osteosynthesis, unilateral external fixation-system and combinated forms), focusing on the radiological and functional result of the compared methods. In total we included 265 patients into the study. Out of these 146 were surgically treated {{by means of a}} fixed angle plate-osteosynthesis and subsequently reviewed (Group 1). All cases but 8 were <b>Colles</b> <b>fractures,</b> and in all cases surgery was performed {{with the help of a}} fixed angle T-radius-plate-system (2, 4 / 2, 7 mm) without additional autogene bone grafting, regardless of the type of fracture. We compared this group to 119 patients which have all been treated with the traditional osteosynthetic methods (Group 2). Out of those 65 were treated exclusively with K-wire-osteosynthesis (Group 2 a), while 16 were treated with plate-osteosynthesis (Group 2 b). Groups 2 a and 2 b were initially analysed on their own, and subsequently compared to Group 1, which yielded the following key findings: After complete anatomic fracture healing none of the patients in Group 1 suffered from any relevant secondary loss of correction, as opposed to patients treated with the other two methods (Groups 2 a and 2 b). No radial shortening was found in Group 1 with the fixed angle T-radius-plate-osteosynthesis (average shortening of 0. 8 mm). In Group 2 the average radial shortening was 2. 6 mm. An articular step-off of more than 2 mm increases the risk of posttraumatical arthrosis to 91 % in the long run. Neither Group 1 nor Group 2 displayed any articular step-off. In all cases the value was less than 1 mm. An evaluation of the two methods according to the radiological results in accordance with Naumann [47] yielded a result between very good and good for the patients of Group 1 (&# 61638; 2, 8 points), while the result for Group 2 was good (&# 61638; 4, 9 points). Postoperative the frequency of complications was significantly lower in Group 1 with the fixed angle plate-osteosynthesis (4. 11 %) than in either Group 2 a (K-wire-fixation, 12. 31 %) or Group 2 b (traditional plate-osteosynthesis, 6. 25 %). The clinical examination showed improved flexibility and overall usability for Group 1 patients, as the treatment with fixed angle T-radius-plate permits to start post surgical physiotherapy early. Applying subjective scores the patients in Group 1 also showed better results. The average DASH-Value was 13. 95 points and the average Solgaard-Score was 1. 5 points. In comparison the DASH-Value of Group 2 patients was significantly worse. It was 23. 13 points. The Solgaard-Score of Group 2 was 5. 9 points. Due to its high incidence und socio-economic relevance fractures of the distal radius require a treatment that combines a stable osteosynthesis with anatomic reduction and the opportunity to start postsurgical therapy early. As shown in this study even in case of <b>Colles</b> <b>fractures</b> and intraarticular fractures the advantages of palmar approach with fixed-angled implants can be used, as there are a more gentle approach, better soft tissue cover and less complications. Because of the subchondral bracing a stable fixation is warranted according to the principle of internal fixation, with the possibility of early functional treatment. Consequently the palmar fixed angle radius-T-plate-osteosynthesis can apply as standard treatment for A 3, B 2  B 3 and C 1  C 2 fractures according to the AO even in elderly patients with osteoporotic bones...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effect of the Jintiange capsule-assisted {{internal}} fixation on fracture healing and bone metabolism activity of patients with <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture.</b> Methods: A total of 120 patients with <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> who received internal fixation in the hospital between July 2014 and May 2016 were collected and divided into control group and observation group according to the random number table method, 60 cases in each group. The control group received regular open reduction and internal fixation, and the observation group received Jintiange capsule-assisted internal fixation. The fracture healing quality as well as calcium phosphorus metabolism index and bone metabolism index levels were compared between the two groups before and after the operation. Results: Before operation, the differences in fracture end parameter levels, peripheral blood calcium and phosphorus metabolism index contents and serum bone metabolism index contents were not statistically significant between the two groups of patients; differences in fracture end radial incline, ulnar inclination and processus styloideus radii height were not statistically significant between the two groups of patients 6 weeks after surgery; peripheral blood Ca, P and ALP contents of observation group 6 weeks after surgery were significantly higher than those of control group, and serum bone formation indexes BGP and OPG contents were higher than those of control group while bone resorption indexes TRACP and CTX contents were significantly lower than those of control group.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether patients with <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> from minimal trauma were subsequently identified, assessed and treated for their elevated risk of fracture. Medical records at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth, Western Australia, from August 1999 to July 2000 were audited and 111 patients who had sustained a <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> from minimal trauma were identified. Questionnaires were subsequently posted to participants to determine whether any assessment or treatment was undertaken outside the hospital system. According to documentation in the medical records, 9 % (10 / 111) had their bone mineral density assessed, 15 % (17 / 111) were receiving medical therapy for osteoporosis, 7 % (8 / 111) had their falls risk assessed and 51 % (58 / 111) were seen by a physiotherapist. Of the 58 who received physiotherapy, 76 % (44 / 58) received upper limb exercises and 19 % (11 / 58) received lower limb or balance exercises. Follow-up questionnaires one to two years after the fracture were returned by 43 % (48 / 111) of the sample. By this time, 37 % (18 / 48) had BMD assessed and 27 % (13 / 48) were receiving medical therapy for osteoporosis.

Classically these fractures occurred after the fall resting on hands teregang. Garis fractures usually are 2. 5 cm proximal side of the wrist and distal fragments migrate to the posterior (deformity resembling a fork when viewed from the side) and to the radial often accompanied by some degree of shortening bone due to impaction some component parts. Physiotherapy in cases of <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> role in reducing motion pain, tenderness, painful silence, and increase muscle strength and joint range of motion (ROM).

Most distal radial fractures are uncomplicated and effectively treated with closed reduction and immobilization in a cast. The goal of treatment is to restore the functional anatomy by a method that does not compromise hand function. The important factors to consider are fracture pattern, displacement, stability of fracture, age and physical demands of the patient [1].|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{postmenopausal}} women, {{a history}} of any fracture is an important risk factor for a future hip fracture. Whether similar findings apply to aging men remains to be established. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to compare {{men and women with}} respect to the relative risk of hip fracture after a wrist or spine fracture. METHODS: Studies published in full from January 1982 through September 2002 in English, French, or German were identified from the PubMed database and from reference lists of retrieved articles. We included cohort studies that reported fractures associated with minimal trauma of the wrist or spine as a risk factor for a subsequent hip fracture among (white) women and men who were fifty years old or older. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and were checked for accuracy in a second review. Differences in assessments were resolved by consensus of the two reviewers. RESULTS: Nine cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis: five studies were conducted in the United States and four, in Europe. After homogeneity of association was demonstrated across all studies, a fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled relative risks with 95 % confidence intervals. Among postmenopausal women, the relative risks for a future fracture of the hip after a fracture of the wrist or spine were 1. 53 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 to 1. 74; p < 0. 001) and 2. 20 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 92 to 2. 51; p < 0. 001), respectively. In older men, these relative risks were 3. 26 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 08 to 5. 11; p < 0. 001) and 3. 54 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 01 to 6. 23; p < 0. 001), respectively. Fractures of the distal part of the radius increased the relative risk of hip fracture significantly more in men than in women (p = 0. 002). The impact of a spine fracture, conversely, did not differ between genders (p = 0. 11). Sensitivity analyses with use of random-effects methodology confirmed these findings to be robust. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that a previous spine fracture has an equally important impact on the risk of a subsequent hip fracture in both genders. The prospective association between a <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> and a subsequent hip fracture, however, is significantly stronger among men than among postmenopausal women. Men with a <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> are at high risk for a future hip fracture and should be evaluated as candidates for preventive measures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Malunions of {{the distal}} radius often induce carpal malalignment. Two {{different}} types can be distinguished: an adaptive midcarpal malalignment (so-called CIA wrist: carpal instability, adaptive) and a radiocarpal malalignment (dorsal {{translation of the}} whole carpus). The effect of distal radial osteotomy on the carpal alignment has hardly been studied. Material and Methods  31 wrists in 31 patients (mean age 44 years) with malunion of the distal radius after a <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> were treated with a corrective osteotomy. The patients were divided on basis of effective radio-lunate flexion (ERLF) in the two patterns of carpal malalignment. The radiographic changes were evaluated. Results There were 20 patients with midcarpal malalignment (ERLF[*]≤[*] 25 °) and 11 with radiocarpal malalignment (ERLF[*]>[*] 25 °). There was a correction of radial tilt and ulnar variance in both groups. There was a significant improvement of the carpal alignment in the midcarpal malalignment group, up to normal parameters. Neither age nor delay between fracture and osteotomy correlated. In the radiocarpal malalignment group {{a significant effect on}} the ERLF was observed. In the patients with dorsal plating 70 % of the hardware had to be removed. Conclusion Distal radial osteotomy is a reliable technique for correction of the deformity at the distal end of the radius and carpal malalignment. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: An optimal {{outcome of}} closed {{treatment}} of a <b>Colles</b> <b>fracture</b> may depend on accurate reduction and adequate immobilization. It {{has been suggested that}} the use of finger-trap traction results in a better re-duction and a lower rate of redisplacement than manual manipulation does, but to our knowledge these con-cepts have never been evaluated scientifically. We compared these two methods in a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-three patients with 225 displaced Colles-type fractures were randomized to treatment with closed reduction with either finger-trap traction (112 patients) or manual manipulation (111 pa-tients). The fractures were assessed radiographically by measurement of the radial angle, dorsal tilt, and radial shortening before reduction, immediately after reduction, and at one and five weeks after reduction. Results: The groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, side of injury, fracture grade, and amount of dis-placement at presentation. No {{significant differences were found between}} the alignment of the fractures in the two treatment groups at any time. With dorsal tilt of < 10 ° and radial shortening of < 5 mm considered accept-able, the two techniques both produced an 87 % rate of satisfactory reductions. However, the percentages of fractures in an acceptable alignment were only 57 % and 50 % at one week after finger-trap traction and manual manipulation, respectively, and only 27 % and 32 % at five weeks. The failure rates did not differ significantly be...|$|E
