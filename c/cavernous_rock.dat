25|$|Sinkholes are a {{consistent}} issue along highways in East Tennessee. One particularly problematic stretch is {{a section of}} I-40 between miles 365 and 367 in Loudon County, which is underlain by <b>cavernous</b> <b>rock</b> strata. In the 1970s and 1980s, TDOT employed numerous stabilization measures in this area, including backfilling existing sinkholes with limestone, collapsing potential sinkholes, and paving roadside ditches to prevent surface water from seeping into the volatile soil.|$|E
60|$|There was a <b>cavernous</b> <b>rock</b> by the seashore, that jutted {{into the}} water like a small craggy promontory. Captain Cadurcis climbed to its top, and then descending, {{reclined}} himself upon an inferior portion of it, which formed a natural couch with the wave on each side. There, lying at his length, he gazed upon the moon and stars whose brightness he thought would never dim. The Mediterranean is a tideless sea, but the swell of the waves, which still set in to the shore, bore occasionally masses of sea-weed and other marine formations, and deposited them around him, plashing, as it broke against the shore, with a melancholy and monotonous sound. The abstraction of the scene, the hour, and the surrounding circumstances brought, however, no refreshment to the exhausted spirit of George Cadurcis. He could not think, indeed he did not dare to think; but the villa of the Apennines and the open boat in the squall flitted continually before him. His mind was feeble though excited, and he fell into a restless and yet unmeaning reverie. As long {{as he had been}} in action, as long as he had been hurrying along the coast, the excitement of motion, the constant exercise of his senses, had relieved or distracted the intolerable suspense. But this pause, this inevitable pause, overwhelmed him. It oppressed his spirit like eternity. And yet what might the morning bring? He almost wished that he might remain for ever on this rock watching the moon and stars, and that the life of the world might never recommence.|$|E
50|$|It is {{normally}} associated with arid climates where strong heating causes strong evaporation and therefore salt crystallization. It is also common along coasts. An example of salt weathering {{can be seen}} in the honeycombed stones in sea wall. Honeycomb is a type of tafoni, a class of <b>cavernous</b> <b>rock</b> weathering structures, which likely develop in large part by chemical and physical salt weathering processes.|$|E
50|$|The soil of {{the nature}} reserve is {{basically}} limestone which was precipitated about 400 million years ago by an ancient ocean. In the following million years geological movements carried it to the surface where erosion removed large amounts. About 200 million years ago aqueous metal solutions filled the <b>cavernous</b> <b>rocks.</b> Primary ores were created mostly consisting of Sphalerite, Marcasite and Galena. The process continued and the ore {{close to the surface}} decomposed due to the influence of carbon dioxide and water. In this process as a secondary ore calamine ZnCO3 which is known as calamine developed.|$|R
60|$|A strange plunge it {{was into}} the utter darkness, {{crawling}} {{on hands and}} knees, with the chill <b>cavernous</b> gloom and <b>rock</b> seeming to press in upon those who slowly crept along, {{the dim light of}} Sigbert's lamp barely showing as he slowly moved on before. One of the two in the rear was dropped and extinguished in the dismal passage, a loss proclaimed by a suppressed groan passing along the line, and a louder exclamation from Walter, causing Sigbert to utter a sharp 'Hush!' enforced by a thud and tramp above, as if the rock were coming down on them, but which probably was the trampling of horses in the camp above.|$|R

30|$|As the {{feasibility}} was still uncertain at the beginning, a test injection was discussed with the Indonesian side {{and carried out}} in 2009. In the leak zone between access shaft and barrage consisting of different materials from compact limestone to breccia, two injection boreholes were drilled and filled with cement grout using a single packer. A control borehole in between showed that the grout has a flow reach of 1 – 1.5  m under applied pressures of 10  bar, i.e. the <b>cavernous</b> <b>rock</b> mass was groutable with the standard equipment available from local contractors. More sophisticated suggestions as the hydraulic prospection of clay fillings using water jets, the metre-wise determination of local permeabilities using double packers or the subsequent application of grouts with different viscosities were discussed but not yet carried out.|$|E
40|$|<b>Cavernous</b> <b>rock</b> decay {{processes}} {{represent a}} global phenomenon, ubiquitous to all environments, with the viewable-in-landscape form usually being the final descriptor (e. g. “alveoli”), sometimes {{alluding to the}} specific decay process (e. g. “pitting”), other times not (e. g. “honeycombing”). Yet, definitive terminology remains inconsistent, usually owing to variability in dimension, morphometry, distribution, and/or academic lineage. This lack of an established lexicon limits scientific collaboration and can generate scientific bias. With no official consensus on appropriate distinctions, researchers and scientists must either be familiar with all the possible terminology, or know the apparent distinction between “forms”—which can seem arbitrary and, even more frustrating, often differs from researcher to researcher, scientist to scientist. This article reviews the historical and contemporary progression of scientific inquiry into this decay—and, arguably, erosional—feature to identify lexical inconsistencies and promote a singular unifying term for future scholars. Ultimately, the authors support using “tafoni” (singular: “tafone”) as the non-scalar universal term—the form created by numerous processes involved in cavernous decay features—and strongly suggest researchers adopt the same vernacular {{in order to promote}} collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{combination}} of field, laboratory and micromorphological evidence, this study examines tafoni (singular, tafone) in the El Chorro area of Andalucia, southern Spain, and makes inferences concerning the processes responsible for their formation. Twenty-five tafoni were randomly selected for field examination. The morphology of these <b>cavernous</b> <b>rock</b> domes {{is characterized by a}} helmet-shaped outer roof and an arched-shaped cavern, often with a partially overhanging visor; measurements of height, width and depth of the caverns revealed marked variations in size. The presence or absence of lichen cover, surface varnish, overhanging visor, cavern backwall stripes, rock flaking, weathering pits and cavern floor sediments was also noted. Surface hardness values, obtained using a Schmidt hammer, are relatively low but significantly higher on the outer roof of the tafoni than on the inner cavern walls. Analysis of sediment samples collected from the cavern backwalls and floors indicates predominantly sandy textures, alkaline pH values and some base cation enrichment. Micromorphological analysis of thin sections, prepared from undisturbed blocks, reveals large quantities of pore-filling cement, consisting mainly of calcite, mineral grains affected by weathering and pseudomorphic replacement, and dark, rounded nodules with a metallic appearance. In terms of their formation, different processes appear to act on different parts of the landform. On the outer roof surfaces, case hardening, resulting from near-surface cementation and surface varnish development, is dominant. On the inner cavern surfaces, however, core softening, resulting from granular disintegration and flaking, dominates. Exfoliation weathering, running water and wind deflation also appear {{to play an important role}} in tafone formation. A phased model of tafone evolution is proposed whereby the features pass through four phases of development–initiation, enlargement, amalgamation and degradation; in the study area there are examples of tafoni in each of these phases. Much of the evidence suggests that the tafoni are actively developing under current environmental conditions...|$|E
