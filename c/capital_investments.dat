40|$|Various {{authors have}} scrutinised the sole {{utilisation}} of quantifiable (financial) appraisal criteria in <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> appraisal. They {{argue that the}} appraisal of <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> proposals must concentrate on the <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> process {{as a whole and}} not only on the selection phase. These authors suggest that <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities and proposals must be sought within the parameters set by strategy. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to explore and to describe how decision-makers in the platinum industry experience the influence of competitive strategy on the <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> process. Semi-structured interviews were held with strategic <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> decision-makers within a major role player in the platinum industry. Respondents were selected according to the snowball sampling method. An analysis of the results indicates that competitive strategy does influence the <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> process. This influence is particularly observable with regard to the initiation of <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> ideas, the <b>capital</b> budget allocation and the strategic appraisal criteria utilised by decision-makers to screen <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> proposals. The strategic <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> process constitutes much more than just the selection of <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> proposals.

Boston remained one of the nation's largest manufacturing centers until the early 20th century, and was notable for its garment production and leather-goods industries. A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories. Later, a dense network of railroads furthered the region's industry and commerce.|$|E

British <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual {{rate of growth of}} exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity diversification.|$|E

In 2015, Silicon Alley generated over US$7.3 billion in venture capital investment, most based in Manhattan, as well as in Brooklyn, Queens, and elsewhere in the region. High technology startup companies and employment are growing in Manhattan and across New York City, bolstered by the city's emergence as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship, social tolerance, and environmental sustainability, as well as New York's position as the leading Internet hub and telecommunications center in North America, including its vicinity to several transatlantic fiber optic trunk lines, the city's intellectual capital, and its extensive outdoor wireless connectivity. Verizon Communications, headquartered at 140 West Street in Lower Manhattan, was at the final stages in 2014 of completing a US$3 billion fiberoptic telecommunications upgrade throughout New York City.

5|$|The Abir Company entered {{liquidation}} in 1898 as a {{means of}} tax avoidance and to escape Belgian business regulations. It was immediately refounded in the Congo Free State as the Abir Congo Company. The name was no longer an acronym of Anglo-Belgian India Rubber and was instead a name in its own right. This change was because the company was no longer supported by British investment, partly because Colonel North had died and his heirs had sold their shares. The new company had a simpler shares system with just 2,000 shares (of 14,300 fr value each) divided between investors. The Free State held 1,000 of these shares. As Abir was now tax resident in the Congo the Free State received 2% of their profits through corporation tax, in addition to the 0.5 fr per kilogram export tax. All initial <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> had been amortised by 1899 along with material expenses in Africa and property and equipment expenses in Antwerp. In 1900 Abir reached the boundaries of its concession which covered eight million hectares. The next three years were spent filling gaps between existing posts and by 1903 Abir controlled 49 posts, managed by 58 agents. 1900 was Abir's most profitable year and the Congo Free State's shares and taxes provided 2,567,880.50 fr of revenue for the state, 10% of that year's total. The share dividend in 1900 was 2,100 fr, in the early 1890s it had been around 2 fr per share.|$|E

In addition, the financial analysts tend to revise upward their announcement-period earnings forecasts for those <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> announcers, suggesting that announcements of <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> convey positive information about the earnings prospects of the announcing firms. Furthermore, analysts' revisions of earnings forecasts subsequent to such announcements are more favorable for leading-announcer firms than the followers.

Rio de Janeiro also approved funding of US$240 billion from the Program for Growth Acceleration (PAC) of the federal government.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown inconsistent results pertaining {{to the relationship between}} <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> in property, plant and equity and research and development spending (R&D). This study re-examines that relationship between <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> and R&D in a panel of 36 pharmaceutical firms.

The short-run causality evidence confirms the research by Mairesse and Siu (1984) documenting that <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> does not Granger-cause R&D and vice versa. On the other hand, the long-run causality test suggest that R&D and <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> are cointegrated and the causality runs in both directions. These results imply that <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> depends on the success of the R&D effort over time. The implementation of breakthroughs created by R&D may require additional <b>capital</b> <b>investment,</b> e. g. facilities and equipment.
