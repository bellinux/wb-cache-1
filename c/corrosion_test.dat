50|$|The {{salt spray}} (or salt fog) test is a {{standardized}} and popular <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> method, used to check corrosion resistance {{of materials and}} surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt spray testing is an accelerated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating {{for use as a}} protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products (rust or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust.The salt spray test {{is one of the most}} widespread and long established corrosion tests. ASTM B117 was the first internationally recognized salt spray standard, originally published in 1939. Other important relevant standards are ISO9227, JIS Z 2371 and ASTM G85.|$|E
50|$|ASTM G85 is {{the most}} popular global test {{standard}} covering modified salt spray tests. There are five such tests altogether, referred to in ASTM G85 as annexes A1 through to A5. Many of these modified tests originally arose within particular industry sector, in order to address the need for a <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> capable of replicating the effects of naturally occurring corrosion and accelerate these effects.This acceleration arises through the use of chemically altered salt spray solutions, often combined with other test climates and in most cases, the relatively rapid cycling of these test climates over time. Although popular in certain industries, modified salt spray testing has in many cases been superseded by Cyclic corrosion testing (CCT) The type of environmental test chambers used for modified salt spray testing to ASTM G85 are generally similar to the chambers used for testing to ASTM B117, but will often have some additional features, such as an automatic climate cycling control system.|$|E

40|$|Various vacuum {{jacketed}} cryogenic {{supply lines}} at the Shuttle launch site use convoluted flexible expansion joints. The atmosphere at the launch site has a very high salt content, and during a launch fuel combustion products include hydrochloric acid. This extremely corrosive environment has caused pitting corrosion failure in the flex hoses, which were made out of 304 L stainless steel. A search was done to find a more corrosion resistant replacement material. Nineteen metal alloys were tested.

50|$|Salt spray {{testing is}} popular {{because it is}} {{relatively}} inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although {{there may be a}} weak correlation between the duration in salt spray test and the expected life of a coating in certain coatings such as hot dip galvanized steel, this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately, so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the accelerated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test,</b> the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches.The principle application of the salt spray test is therefore enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected corrosion resistance. Most commonly, the time taken for oxides to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason the salt spray test is most often deployed in a quality audit role, where, for example, {{it can be used to}} check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part.The salt spray test has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist corrosion in the real-world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions. Cyclic corrosion testing is better suited to this.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{brief review of}} major techniques applied in carbon dioxide <b>corrosion</b> <b>testing</b> and monitoring. The focus is on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} variously designed testing apparatus and monitoring devices for localized corrosion detection and assessment. Critical factors affecting the reliability and accuracy of major <b>corrosion</b> <b>testing</b> techniques are briefly discussed.

40|$|An {{accelerated}} <b>corrosion</b> <b>test,</b> {{known as}} proving ground accelerated test, is commonly performed by automotive manufacturers {{to evaluate the}} corrosion performance of a vehicle. The test combines corrosion and durability inputs to detect potential failures that may occur during in-service conditions. Currently, the test is conducted at an external test center overseas. Such test is aimed to simulate the effects of one year accelerated corrosion in severe corrosive environment of the north-east and south east of America. However, the test results obtained do not correlate with the actual corrosion conditions observed in the Malaysian market, which is likely attributed to the different test environment of the tropical climate of vehicles in service. Therefore, a vehicle accelerated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> procedure that suits the Malaysian market is proposed and benchmarked with other global car manufacturers that have their own dedicated <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> procedure.

In addition, an attempt was made to develop an empirical relationship to predict the corrosion rate of FSW welds in salt spray <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> and galvanic <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> using design of experiments.

The results show the usage of the magnesium alloy for best environments and suitable applications from the aforementioned conditions.

A Computation Fluid Dynamics simulation using STAR-CCM+ was conducted with the objectives of showing sufficient flow through the test cap section for a <b>corrosion</b> <b>test,</b> verifying the fluid experiment 2 ̆ 7 s validity, and explaining the abnormal pressure drop. The simulation used a polyhedral volume mesh and the k-e turbulent model with segregated equations. Convergence depended on a low continuity residual and an unchanging pressure drop result. The simulation showed the same pattern as the fluid experiment. The simulation provided evidence of flow through the test cap section needed for a <b>corrosion</b> <b>test.</b> The specimen holding assembly {{was found to be}} a small contributor to the pressure drop. The counterintuitive pressure drop was found to be the sum of many factors produced from the geometry of the test cap section. The inlet of the test cap section behaved as a diverging nozzle before a sudden expansion into the test cap section chamber with both creating a pressure drop. The chaotic flow inside the chamber gave rise to pressure loss from mixing. The fluid exited the chamber through a sudden contraction to a converging nozzle behaving exit, again, producing a pressure drop. By varying the flow rate in the simulation, a disturbance in the flow where the gap fluid separated into the parallel channels was found at high flow rates. At low flow rates the pressure drop anomaly was not found. The <b>corrosion</b> <b>test</b> cap section could be used in the ATR but with a higher pressure drop than desirable.
