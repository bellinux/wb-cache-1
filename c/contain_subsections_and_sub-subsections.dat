Text is often contained inside some structure (e.g., a title, sections, sub-sections, etc.) and queries can be tuned to return specific {{parts of a}} document instead of a full one. As an example, if the searched keyword is <b>contained</b> inside <b>Subsections</b> 3.1 <b>and</b> 3.3 of a document, a query may return either the two subsections, or the whole Section 3, depending on the method.|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 112 - 114. In the {{following}} dissertation, I have undertaken {{to explore the}} very wide-ranging yet largely unexplored territory of Irish cinema. I have confined my study to the 1990 s (other than {{a brief overview of}} the Irish film industry in my Introduction) in an attempt to express the revolutionary global success that all aspects of Irish culture have experienced in this decade. The central point, which I reiterate throughout the dissertation, is that, while Irish filmmakers are increasingly concerned with defining "Irishness" for themselves and the world, they inevitably encounter much confusion and ambivalence, and are often criticised for it. For this reason, I have uncovered many ambiguities in the films I have watched, which defy strict categorisation, other than in terms of their settings, which I describe in terms of "war-torn Belfast", modern Dublin and "the rural idyll". Nonetheless, I have divided the essay into three main sections, other than the Introduction and Conclusion, which themselves <b>contain</b> <b>subsections,</b> <b>and</b> which encompass the major themes which recur in Irish films. Section Two is a broad study of those films which deal with the political violence, known as the Troubles, that defines Northern Ireland. This includes a stereotyped American portrayals as well as a more recent IRA bias, beginning with Neil Jordan's attempt to put a new version of history on film in Michael Collins. The conclusion I come to is that filmmakers are ultimately trying to provide a balanced view of the situation and one that condemns violence. Section Three deals with the intertwined themes of women, family, sexuality and the Catholic Church. The traditional conservatism in Ireland is outlined before I show how recent films reflect the changes in moral attitudes and the new freedoms of sexuality that the younger generation is experiencing. Lastly I look at the special situation of women in the North, where they and their families are the long-suffering victims of the violence. Section Four continues the theme of the changes which are sweeping over "Modern Ireland", largely due to its opening-up to outside influences, particularly those of America. The dichotomies of this newly-modernised society are still evident, as I discuss in the section on the historical importance of land, which is expressed not only in the "rural idyll" films, but in those which deal with the move to the urban lure and squalor of Dublin. Finally I look at how the traditional and mythical still exist in modern Ireland, and how the combination of these aspects of the past and present is shown to suggest a positive way into the future...|$|R
25|$|In the {{proposed}} scheme of Weng et al. {{there would be}} two subgenera, based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (<1.5 μ, 1.5-3.0μ), but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being {{by far the largest}} clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (Myrrhidium, Chorisma, Reniformia, Pelargonium, Ligularia and Hoarea) but paraphyly in others (Jenkinsonia, Ciconium, Peristera). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic Polyactium, designated section Magnistipulacea. As a result, Polyactium has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself <b>contains</b> two <b>subsections,</b> Magnistipulacea <b>and</b> Schizopetala, following Knuth's original treatment of Polyactium as having four subsections.|$|R

40|$|The {{remainder}} of this document is concerned with showing, {{in the context of}} an “actual ” document, the L ATEX commands specifically available for denoting the structure of a proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions or explanations of such commands. 2. THE BODY OF THE PAPER Typically, the body of a paper is organized into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered headings for sections, <b>subsections,</b> <b>sub-subsections,</b> <b>and</b> even smaller sections. The command \section that precedes this paragraph is part of such a hierarchy. 2 LATEX handles the numbering and placement of these headings for you, when you use the appropriate heading commands around the titles of the headings. If you want a sub-subsection or smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an asterisk to the command name. Examples of both numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the balance of this sample document. Because the entire article is contained in the document environment, you can indicate the start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph. 2. 1 Type Changes and Special Characters We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample. You can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with the command \textit; emboldening with the command \textbf and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with \texttt. But remember, you do not have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are part of the structural elements of your article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will be in a sans serif 3 typeface, but that is handled by the document class file. Take care with the use of 4 the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark the beginning and end of the text that is to be in the different typeface. You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or non-English characters you need anywhere in your document; you can find a complete list of what is available in th...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is to {{synthesize}} and develop in-situ cross-linkable hydrophilic copolymers using multi-vinyl monomers via Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerisation (RAFT) for hydrogel applications. This thesis comprises six chapters described briefly below: Chapter 1 provides {{an introduction to the}} topics covered in the thesis. General fundamentals of main polymerisation techniques, basic concepts of the polymer chemistry, hyperbranched polymers, hydrogels and their applications are included. Chapter 2 describes the general experimental procedures and methodology used in this thesis, including the synthesis and characterisation of the precursors of the RAFT agents, final RAFT agents, disulphide diacrylate and the preparation of hydrophilic polymers by conventional and living/controlled radical polymerisation methods. Moreover, methods and analytical techniques used for the characterisation of compounds and polymers are described. The scientific background for interpretation and understanding of the results are also included in this chapter. Chapter 3 <b>contains</b> two <b>subsections</b> <b>and</b> focuses on the results and discussion on in-situ RAFT approach and its applicability in copolymerisation of vinyl monomers. In section 3. 1, an in-situ technique of Reversible-Addition Fragment Chain Transfer (in-situ RAFT) polymerisation is developed. The kinetic studies on the in-situ RAFT polymerisations of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St) through a facile one-pot and two-step approach are presented. Where, bis(thiobenzoyl) disulfide and 2, 2 '-azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) were used to generate RAFT agent 2 -cyanoprop- 2 -yl dithiobenzoate in-situ at 80 oC, followed by further RAFT polymerisations of MMA or St at 65 oC. The kinetics of these in-situ RAFT polymerisations were studied using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) under different reaction conditions in order to investigate the effects of solvent, temperature, and molar ratio of reactants. The experimental results demonstrated that this in-situ approach showed the similar controllability as conventional RAFT polymerisation in terms of the molecular weights and polydispersity of polymers obtained. The resultant polymers were characterized by proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (1 H NMR analysis) and GPC, and were successfully used as macro RAFT agents for the preparation of PMMA-b-PSt block copolymers. In section 3. 2, the in-situ approach developed in section 3. 1 was successfully adopted to copolymerise poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA), poly(propylene glycol) methacrylate (PPGMA) and up to 30...|$|R
