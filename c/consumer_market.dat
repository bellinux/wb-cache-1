40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{viewpoint}} about the role of cost transparency in <b>consumer</b> <b>markets</b> and whether or not consumers should request cost transparency from sellers, in light of the article by Antonis et al. (2015). Design/methodology/approach – Research in the area of cost transparency, pricing and related theoretical domains is analysed to understand the potential role for buyers and sellers in <b>consumer</b> <b>markets.</b> Findings – Although there are an increasing number of examples of greater operational transparency in supply chains, cost transparency in <b>consumer</b> <b>markets</b> is not widespread. Increased cost transparency represents an important product attribute for consumers, enhancing fairness perceptions and affective evaluations. For sellers, it is a potentially powerful complement to price moves and, through enhancing trust among consumers, can positively influence brand value(s). Research limitations/implications – Operational and cost transparency holds much promise as an emerging area in marketing but research into cost transparency in <b>consumer</b> <b>markets</b> is in its early stages and the limited number of field examples reduces the scope for empirical work. However, using carefully controlled lab experiments, much can be done to understand the generalisability and boundary conditions to its effect. Originality/value – This paper takes a balanced view about value to consumers and the implementation of cost transparency in <b>consumer</b> <b>markets,</b> highlighting key mechanisms through which greater transparency may i...|$|R

25|$|In the 19th {{century and}} early 20th century, sweet passito style dessert wines {{made from the}} Malvasia grape were held in high esteem and {{considered}} among Italy's finest wines. Following World War II, {{lack of interest in}} the <b>consumer</b> <b>market</b> lead to a sharp decline in plantings with many varieties on the verge of extinction.

25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, the South African wine {{industry}} received minimal international attention. Its isolation was exacerbated by the boycotts of South African products in protest against the country's system of Apartheid. It {{was not until the}} late 1980s and 1990s when Apartheid was ended, and the world's export market opened up, that South African wines began to experience a renaissance. Many producers in South Africa quickly adopted new viticultural and winemaking technologies. The presence of flying winemakers from abroad brought international influences and focus on well-known varieties such as Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay. The reorganisation of the powerful KWV co-operative into a private business sparked further innovation and improvement in quality. Vineyard owners and wineries who had previously relied on the price-fixing structure that bought their excess grapes for distillation were forced to become more competitive by shifting their focus to the production of quality wine. In 1990, less than 30% of all the grapes harvested were used for wine production meant for the <b>consumer</b> <b>market</b> with the remaining 70% being discarded, distilled into brandy, or sold as table grapes and juice. By 2003, the numbers had been reversed with more than 70% of the grapes harvested that year reaching the <b>consumer</b> <b>market</b> as wine.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{marketing}} {{can cross}} the border into <b>consumer</b> <b>marketing.</b> For example, an electronic component seller may distribute its products through industrial marketing channels (see Channel (marketing)), but also support consumer sales.
