50|$|Small seeds, such as oat {{fragments}} or <b>canary</b> <b>seeds,</b> are favored for triggering {{the onset}} of recruitment and mobilization of harvesting in Messor barbarus populations. This is because they allow for a faster rate of return between the initial discovery of the food source and the subsequent return of scouts to the nest to relay information to the greater population. The trail is adjusted by a fleet of initial scouts which enhance the harvesting patterns to select for the preferred seed size. Worker ants are divided into three distinct size classes which in turn correspond {{to the size of}} the seeds harvested. All of the ants participate in the process of trail-laying, but within the size classes there are distinct roles. The majority of ants in the harvesting arena are Media ants, which are responsible primarily for trail-laying. Minor ants are most efficient in carrying smaller seeds such as oat fragments. Major ants are primarily involved in the harvesting of larger or more preferred seed species. The collective action of M. barbarus favors the minimization of foraging time rather than maximized efficiency of the energetic gain per item harvested. On the whole, group cooperation allows for a successful balance to be struck between the benefits of maximized food exploitation and colony-wide energy gain and the costs associated with increased predation risk.|$|R

Recently, <b>canary</b> <b>seed</b> was approved as food for human consumption and identification of pathogenic fungal species on <b>canary</b> <b>seed</b> panicles is necessary to monitor seed quality. The objectives of this project were: 1) to evaluate variation for virulence among 27 isolates of S. triseti on Phalaris spp., 2) to identify the fungal species present on <b>canary</b> <b>seed,</b> and 3) to evaluate the effect of fungicides, application timings and <b>canary</b> <b>seed</b> genotypes on leaf mottle and fusarium seed infection of <b>canary</b> <b>seed.</b> Under controlled conditions, 24 Phalaris genotypes were evaluated for leaf mottle severity after inoculation with 27 isolates of S. triseti collected during 2005, 2013 or 2014.

During the nestling and early fledgling stages, juvenile finches raised by adults that avoided oats received 30 – 40 times less exposure to hulled oats than did juveniles raised by adults that ate oats.

Birds raised by adults that avoided oats during the late nestling and fledgling stages, however, displayed lower oat preference scores than did birds raised by adults that ate oats.
