50|$|The stamps {{offer an}} {{intriguing}} aspect of relating the David Plates to Heraclius’ rule. It is often {{thought that the}} set could have been commissioned to celebrate {{the defeat of the}} Sasanian Empire (628-629) by Heraclius. He managed to end a long war with Persia and retook control over Egypt, Syria, and other Byzantine regions. Specifically, Heraclius regained the Byzantine territories that included Jerusalem (founded by King David) and the Sasanian city of Ctesiphon. The Sasanian War echoed David’s victory over Goliath as he also beheaded his enemy, giving him the acclaim of being the new David. The emperor’s image as the new David par excellence might have been praised to celebrate past achievement as well as promote confidence in the present and future. The last years on the <b>control</b> <b>stamps,</b> therefore, are seen as the most likely for the development of David Plates. It is thought that Heraclius ordered the commission of the David Plates for their intrinsic value. More aspects are still being studied to point out their true reality in Byzantine art history.|$|R

The large octagonal plate has decoration around its rim, and in the center a medallion shows a series of scenes of Achilles’ life before the Trojan War.

The David Plates and Achilles Plate are very decorative, and would have been used as show pieces.|$|R

40|$|Process <b>Control</b> for Sheet-Metal <b>Stamping</b> {{presents}} a comprehensive and structured {{approach to the}} design and implementation of controllers for the sheet metal stamping process. The use of process <b>control</b> for sheet-metal <b>stamping</b> greatly reduces defects in deep-drawn parts and can also yield large material savings from reduced scrap. Sheet-metal forming is a complex process and most often characterized by partial differential equations that are numerically solved using finite-element techniques. In this book, twenty years of academic research are reviewed and the resulting technology transitioned to the industrial environment. The sheet-metal stamping process is modeled in a manner suitable for multiple-input multiple-output control system design, with commercially available sensors and actuators. These models are then used to design adaptive controllers and real-time controller implementation is discussed. Finally, experimental results from actual shopfloor deployment are presented along with ideas for further improvement of the technology. Process <b>Control</b> for Sheet-Metal <b>Stamping</b> allows the reader to design and implement process controllers in a typical manufacturing environment by retrofitting standard hydraulic or mechanical stamping presses and as such will {{be of interest to}} practising engineers working in metal-working, automotive and aeronautical industries. Academic researchers studying improvements in process control and how these affect the industries in which they are applied will also find the text of value. Advances in Industrial Control aims to report and encourage the transfer of technology in control engineering. The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of new work in all aspects of industrial control. ...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the basic}} design {{decisions}} affecting safety {{are made in the}} concept development stage of system development.
