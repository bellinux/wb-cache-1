It was invented by Horáček and Sasakawa in 1983. The goal of the method is to solve the integral equationiteratively and to construct convergent continued fraction for the T-matrixThe method has two variants. In the first one (denoted as MCFV) we construct approximations of the potential energy operator [...] {{in the form of}} separable function of rank 1, 2, 3 ... The second variant (MCFG method) constructs the finite rank approximations to Green's operator. The approximations are constructed within Krylov subspace constructed from vector [...] with action of the operator [...] The method can thus be understood as resummation of (in general divergent) Born series by Padé approximants. It is also closely related to Schwinger variational principle.In general the method requires similar amount of numerical work as <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> of Born series, but it provides much faster convergence of the results.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{piecewise}} variational {{iteration method}} (VIM) for solving Riccati differential equations (RDEs) provides a solution as a sequence of iterates. Therefore, its application to RDEs leads to the <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> that are not needed and more time is consumed in repeated calculations for series solutions. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose an easy-to-use piecewise-truncated VIM algorithm for solving the RDEs. Some examples are given to demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of the proposed method. Comparisons with the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK 4) verify that the new method is very effective and convenient for solving Riccati differential equations...|$|E

Circuits in our terminology (see [19]) are treated as locally-finite many sorted algebras over special signatures. Such approach enables to formalize every real circuit. The goal of this investigation is to specify circuits by terms and, enentualy, to have methods of formal verification of real circuits. The following notation is introduced in this paper: • structural equivalence of circuits, i. e. equivalence of many sorted signatures, • embedding of a circuit into another one, • similarity of circuits (a concept narrower than isomorphism of many sorted algebras over equivalent signatures), • <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> by a circuit according to an algebra, • specification of circuits by terms and an algebra...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} Web Services (WS) has ex-emplified {{the need for}} scalable and robust discovery mecha-nisms. Although decentralized solutions for discovering WS promise to fulfill these needs, most make limiting assump-tions concerning the number of nodes and the topology of the network and rely on having information on the data a-priori (e. g. categorizations or popularity distributions). In addition, most systems are tested via simulations using ar-tificial datasets. In this paper we introduce a lightweight, scalable and robust WSDL discovery mechanism based on real-time <b>calculation</b> <b>of</b> <b>term</b> popularity. In order to eval-uate this mechanism, we have collected and analyzed real data from deployed WS and performed a large-scale emula-tion on the DAS- 3 distributed supercomputer.
