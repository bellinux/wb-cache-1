The widely used present industry standard, the AGA 8 -DC 92 EOS, was developed against a database of reference quality natural gas mixtures with compositions containing less than 0. 2 mole percent of the heavier C 6 + fraction. With the advances in technology in the late nineties, it is possible to produce gas from deep and ultra-deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico where the pressures and temperatures encountered are much higher. Produced gas mixtures have compositions containing higher percentages of the C 6 + fraction. As AGA 8 -DC 92 is a statistical fit equation developed for one set of conditions, time has come to evaluate its performance to assess whether it is still viable for gas custody transfer with a new set of conditions encountered. A highly accurate, high pressure and temperature, compact single sinker magnetic suspension densimeter has been used first to determine densities of pure component??????s densities for which very reliable data are available. After validating its performance, the densities of four light natural gas mixtures, containing no C 6 + fraction and two heavy gas mixtures containing more than 0. 2 mole percent of the heavier C 6 + fraction, were measured. The light mixtures were measured in the temperature range of 250 to 450 K and in the pressure range of 10 to 150 Mpa (1450 to 21, 750 psi); the heavy mixtures were measured in the range of 270 to 340 K and in the pressure range of 3. 45 to 34. 45 MPa (500 to 5, 000 psi). Out of those, the data of only two light natural gas mixtures have been presented in the dissertation. Data on two heavy mixtures have not been published due to reasons of <b>confidentiality.</b> <b>Measured</b> densities of light mixtures, not containing the C 6 + fraction show less than expected relative deviations from the AGA 8 -DC 92 EOS predictions except at low temperature. The deviation with the recently developed GERG 02 EOS was more pronounced. A force transmission error analysis and uncertainty analysis was carried out. The total uncertainty was calculated to be 0. 105 %. The data measured as a part of this research should be used as reference quality data either to modify the parameters of AGA 8 -DC 92 EOS or develop a more reliable equation of state with wider ranges of pressure and temperature...|$|R

Wyner [1] introduced this model named the wiretap channel to model the degraded broadcast channel where the eavesdropper observes a degraded version of the receiver's signal. In this model, the <b>confidentiality</b> is <b>measured</b> by the equivocation rate, that is, the mutual information between the confidential message and the eavesdropper's observation. For the discrete memoryless degraded wiretap channel, Wyner characterized the capacity-equivocation region and showed that a nonzero secrecy rate can be achieved [1]. The most important operating point on the capacity-equivocation region is the secrecy capacity, that is, the largest reliable communication rate such that the eavesdropper obtains no information about the confidential message (the equivocation rate is {{as large as the}} message rate). The secrecy capacity of the Gaussian wiretap channel was given in [2]. Csiszár and Körner considered a more general wiretap channel in which a common message for both receivers is sent in addition to the confidential message [3]. For this model known as the broadcast channel with confidential (BCC) messages, the rate-tuple of the common and confidential messages was characterized.|$|R

Due to resource constraint nature of WSN, applicability of traditional security solutions is debatable. Although cryptography, authentication and <b>confidentiality</b> <b>measures</b> help in preventing specific types of attacks but they cannot safeguard against node misbehavior attacks and come at significant cost. To address this problem, we propose a Trust Based Secure Routing Protocol (TBSRP) which relies on distributed trust model for the detection and isolation of misbehaving nodes. The TBSRP aims to establish shortest path that contain all trusted nodes, identify packet forwarding misbehavior caused by malicious and faulty nodes and reroute the traffic to other reliable paths. The performance of TBSRP is evaluated in terms of packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and normalized routing load. Simulations results show that TBSRP can achieve both high delivery ratio and throughput in presence of various numbers of misbehaving and faulty nodes...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the quantitative assessment of security in software. More specifically, it tackles the problem of efficient computation of channel capacity, the maximum amount of confidential information leaked by software, measured in Shannon entropy or Rényi's min-entropy. Most approaches to computing channel capacity are either efficient and return only (possibly very loose) upper bounds, or alternatively are inefficient but precise; few target realistic programs. In this thesis, we present a novel approach to the problem by reducing it to a model counting problem on first-order logic, which we name Model Counting Modulo Theories or #SMT for brevity. For quantitative security, our contribution is twofold. First, on the theoretical side we establish the connections between <b>measuring</b> <b>confidentiality</b> leaks and fundamental verification algorithms like Symbolic Execution, SMT solvers and DPLL. Second, exploiting these connections, we develop novel #SMT-based techniques to compute channel capacity, which achieve both accuracy and efficiency. These techniques are scalable to real-world programs, and illustrative case studies include C programs from Linux kernel, a Java program from a European project and anonymity protocols. For formal verification, our contribution is also twofold. First, we introduce and study a new research problem, namely #SMT, which has other potential applications beyond computing channel capacity, such as returning multiple-counterexamples for Bounded Model Checking or automated test generation. Second, we propose an alternative approach for Bounded Model Checking using classical Symbolic Execution, which can be parallelised to leverage modern multi-core and distributed architecture.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the degrees}} of freedom (DOF) of {{wireless}} networks are studied with imperfect channel state information at transmitters (CSIT) and/or secrecy constraints. Different interference alignment schemes are proposed to establish the DOF lower bound {{for a variety of}} wireless networks. For the imperfections of CSIT, we mainly have two practical concerns. The first concern is the long delay of the high-resolution feedback from receivers to transmitters such that the obtained CSIT is totally outdated. The second concern is the inaccurate estimation on the instantaneous CSIT. Specifically, the first scenario is solely investigated in a delayed CSIT model, and a combination of these two types of imperfections is studied in a mixed CSIT model. The DOF of wireless networks are studied based on these two CSIT models. Regarding secrecy constraints, we also consider two scenarios, to be specific, the weak secrecy where the <b>confidentiality</b> is <b>measured</b> by the normalized information leakage with respect to the codeword length, and the strong secrecy where the total information leakage of the whole codeword is used as the secrecy measure. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the impact of imperfect CSIT is investigated for the multi-hop broadcast networks. The Maddah-Ali & Tse (MAT) alignment is extended to the considered multi-hop network to make use of the delayed CSIT, and it is also shown that the MAT scheme can be integrated with linear beamforming to achieve the optimal sum DOF of a two-user multi-hop broadcast network with mixed CSIT. In the second part of the thesis, the secrecy constraints are subjected to the studied networks. With weak secrecy constraints, we propose artificial noise alignment approaches for seeking the optimal secure {{degrees of freedom}} (SDOF) of wireless X networks, the multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel and the two-hop interference channel. It is worth noting that the proposed alignment schemes are also based on divergent CSIT conditions, i. e., delayed, mixed or even no CSIT. With strong secrecy constraints, the secure coding based on channel resolvability and the signaling method by interference alignment are combined to provide the optimal SDOF of the K-user interference channel with confidential messages. It is worth noting that a general framework of the secure interference alignment encoder is provided in the thesis, which consists of two functional sections: the stochastic encoding section to provide secure codes and the alignment section to provide signaling solutions. This framework can be applied to all the network models studied in the latter part of the thesis.    QC 20150507 </p...|$|R

40|$|Preserving {{privacy and}} {{confidentiality}} of medical data {{has always been}} a fundamental question in medicine and healthcare. Information technologies state even greater requirements to medical data security, especially when, as expected, medical data should be transferred between the different healthcare providers using specialized or public computer networks. The presented paper outlines some basic requirements to healthcare networks security, with which the future medical specialists should be well acquainted having in mind the ever growing implementation of information technologies including electronic medical records in daily medical practice. A model of the requirements to the security of electronic medical data is presented. It covers the two main trends in preserving the security of medical data when used via computer networks: (1) confidentiality and privacy of personal medical data, formalized in different political and legal issues and (2) security measures that should actually be performed. <b>Confidentiality</b> <b>measures</b> are discussed on the basis of preserving the initial right for the individuals privacy.

40|$|While {{violence}} against women has gained prominence in India, {{there is still a}} dearth of literature addressing these issues in the society. Amongst available research, the focus has primarily been on victims; judiciary and policing systems while, there are minimum efforts in understanding the alleged offenders. Masculinity originally emerged as concept opposite to femininity (Constantinople, 1973), was later developed into an independent personality characteristic (Bem, 1974) and is now being widely used by social psychologists to study various gender related phenomena (Pleck, Sonenstein and Ku, 1993). According to the trait conceptualization, a man can prove his masculinity only if he meets the expectations and ideals unique to his culture (Bem, 1974; Helgeson, 1994). In other words, possessing characteristics that conform to culturally acceptable behaviours for men (Levant et al., 1992; Thompson, Pleck, & Ferrera, 1992). The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze masculinity ideology in convicted rapists and to understand how these men view their roles in the society. Furthermore, the study also compares masculinity ideology of convicted rapists with convicted murders to establish similarities and differences between these two groups of offenders. The present study employed a sample of 60 convicted rapists (convicted under Indian Penal Code 375) and 60 convicted murders (convicted under Indian Penal Code 302) from Tihar Central Jail, New Delhi; which is the largest prison complex in South Asia. Participation in the study was voluntary. Information sheets were sent out to brief the participants about the procedure and <b>confidentiality</b> <b>measures</b> and only those inmates who gave their consent to the Superintendent of the Jail were included. The sample was not random and thus may not be representative of all rapists and murders. Each participant was given a demographic questionnaire to get an insight into their background as well as the Multicultural Masculinity Ideology Questionnaire (MMIS) by Doss and Hopkins (1998). The MMIS has 35 -items and is written and published in English. However majority of the participants did not know how to read English and for that reason the official translator of the Delhi Prisons Department translated the questionnaire into Hindi. The MMIS “measures an individual’s adaptation and internalization of a culture’s norms about how men should act”. Doss and Hopkins (1998) conducted a principal-components analysis and were able to identify five major components- Toughness, Pose, Responsibility, Sensitivity and Sexual Responsibility. For this study quantitative methodology will be adopted to analyze the questionnaires to determine the relationships between these components/factors when understood from an Indian context. A possible analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be run using SPSS to find differences among the group means of these two samples (convicted rapists versus convicted murders) as well as to identify any variation in-between groups. According to Stearns (1990) masculinity tends to emphasize on physical toughness, emotional stoicism, projected self-sufficiency, and heterosexual dominance over women. The expected results will most likely show a relationship between these core components of MMIS- Toughness, Pose, Responsibility, Sensitivity and Sexual Responsibility for both groups of convicted offenders. It can be hypothesized that convicted rapists will show less Sexual Responsibility as opposed to convicted murders due to the nature of their crime. Similarly it would be interesting to see which of the group scores reflect higher Sensitivity. Kindlon and Thompson (1999) highlighted emotional stoicism as an important feature of masculinity according to which most men are “emotionally illiterate” due to gender socialization. Toughness is another feature of masculinity that is learned early in life and pushes sensitivity further away (Pollack, 1995). India continues to be a patriarchal society. Culture specific gender-roles and expectations can be important factors when trying to understand crimes against women as rape is often seen as a gender-based crime (Brownmiller, 1975). It is also important to understand the attitudes and beliefs these men have (particularly the rapists) about gender roles and relationships in our society as well as their attitudes towards women. Researchers in the west have been studying the rapists and other offenders since early 1960 s (Scully and Marolla, 1984; Langevin, 1988; Segal & Stermac, 1990; Wilson and Shine, 1990) and have made noteworthy progress in highlighting factors that are responsible for their behaviours. The present research will be able to bring forward a new perspective of this unique sample and will contribute to the literature trying to identify factors responsible for crimes against women in India...|$|E
