40|$|We are {{developing}} a new method {{for the growth of}} small diamond crystals at very high temperatures and pressures directly from a carbon melt. A prototype "Supercell" has been developed for this purpose. This system is capable of high rate crystal growth in relatively large working volumes. The resulting high quality diamond crystals will be incorporated into a triphasic diamond/titanium carbide/titanium <b>composite</b> <b>tool,</b> with an oriented diamond crystal at its tip. High pressure is needed to prevent degradation of diamond at high temperature, and to ensure the formation of a crack & composite structure. After grinding and polishing, the composite material will be joined to a steel holder, thus forming a diamond-tipped tool for turning and smoothing of a mirror surface. A properly oriented single-crystal diamond cuts and smoothes much better than a conventional polycrystalline diamond crystal. This is because the hardness depends on crystallographic orientation-the difference corresponds to 60 - 100 GPa on the Knoop scale. Our goal is to achieve surface roughness of about 1 nm, which will be accomplished by precision cutting and smoothing. The hardness of the functionally-graded diamond/titanium carbide/titanium <b>composite</b> <b>tool</b> varies from 100 GPa at its tip to 15 GPa at its base.

40|$|In {{the wood}} cutting process, it is {{important}} to obtain the actual stress distributions over the tool rake face during cutting and to investigate the changes of the stress behavior depending on the workpiece conditions, but few studies have dealt with the exact measurements of the stress distributions, and so, the main objective {{of this paper is to}} obtain quantitative information on them. The method of the measurement was based on the use of the <b>composite</b> <b>tool</b> which was divided into two parts parallel to a cutting edge in order to measure separately the force on one section of the tool (Figs. 1, 3 and 4). Using this tool, the stress distributions over the tool rake face were measured directly in the wood cutting. The frictional coefficients on the interface between the tool and the chip during cutting were made clear based on the results of the stress distributions. The main results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) The distributions of the normal stress (σ) and the frictional stress (τ) over the rake face can be expressed by Eq. (16), and the variations of the values of the exponents and the coefficients used in this equation with grain angle (φ 1) are illustrated in Figs. 19 and 20. (2) On the basis of the experimental results (Figs. 13 ～ 16) obtained in the wood cutting tests with the conventional tool and the <b>composite</b> <b>tool,</b> the ratios of the cutting force acting on the rake face length (lc) of the edge part T 2 of the <b>composite</b> <b>tool</b> to the total cutting force acting on the conventional tool can be calculated from Eq. 17, and these ratios are illustrated in Fig. 23.

On the rake face, μ can be considered to be constant, and the variations of μ with φ 1 are illustrated in Fig. 24...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Carbon foam {{is a low}} cost, durable, {{light-weight}} {{material with}} a low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) and it has cure process compatibility with aerospace composites. Therefore, carbon foam is being investigated as an alternative to traditional <b>composite</b> <b>tooling</b> material for aerospace applications. However, the dramatic differences in properties between traditional tooling materials and carbon foam makes it difficult to fully predict the performance of this novel material as a tooling alternative. This article is a comparative analytical study of the effects of processing of composite geometries on a carbon foam tooling vs. conventional tool-ing materials. Simulation is carried out on graphiteepoxy composite system using a carbon foam tooling and the stresses and the resulting deformations are predicted for three different geometric features of composites. The results show that both the lower CTE and modulus of the carbon foam tooling can contribute to a reduction of residual stresses in the part and the tooling; however, the mechanical strength of the foam needs to be considered in the tooling design.
