5|$|Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon black truffle, {{is roughly}} similar in appearance, habitat, and growing season, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its darker (<b>charcoal</b> <b>black)</b> peridium. Microscopically, the spores of Leucangium are larger (60–90μm) and have a single large oil droplet. L.carthusianum is also edible and prized for its taste and aroma.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{artisans}} used {{stone to}} carve statues and fine reliefs, but used wood as a cheap and easily carved substitute. Paints {{were obtained from}} minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or <b>charcoal</b> (<b>black),</b> and limestone (white). Paints could be mixed with gum arabic as a binder and pressed into cakes, which could be moistened with water when needed.|$|E
5|$|The panel {{comprises}} four individual {{pieces of}} oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated {{date for the}} Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are lead white (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), <b>charcoal</b> <b>black,</b> ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, verdigris and red lake. There has been some discolouration– some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.|$|E

25|$|The open coke beds used in {{the early}} to mid 20th century and logging for fuel {{resulted}} in a near-total loss of native vegetation in the area. Consequently, the terrain was made up of exposed rocky outcrops permanently stained <b>charcoal</b> <b>black,</b> first by the air pollution from the roasting yards. Acid rain added more staining, in a layer that penetrates up to three inches into the once pink-grey granite.|$|E
500|$|The plains on Pluto's surface are {{composed}} of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti-Charon face of Pluto (around 180° longitude, where Tombaugh Regio's western lobe, Sputnik Planitia, is located), whereas methane is most abundant near 300° east. The mountains are made of water ice. Pluto's surface is quite varied, with large differences in both brightness and color. Pluto {{is one of the}} most contrastive bodies in the Solar System, with as much contrast as Saturn's moon Iapetus. The color varies from <b>charcoal</b> <b>black,</b> to dark orange and white. Pluto's color is more similar to that of Io with slightly more orange and significantly less red than Mars. Notable geographical features include Tombaugh Regio, or the [...] "Heart" [...] (a large bright area on the side opposite Charon), Cthulhu Regio, or the [...] "Whale" [...] (a large dark area on the trailing hemisphere), and the [...] "Brass Knuckles" [...] (a series of equatorial dark areas on the leading hemisphere).

2500|$|A black jaguar named [...] "Diablo" [...] was {{inadvertently}} crossed with a lioness named [...] "Lola" [...] at the Bear Creek Wildlife Sanctuary in Barrie, Ontario, Canada. The offspring were a <b>charcoal</b> <b>black</b> jaglion {{female and}} a tan-coloured, spotted jaglion male. It therefore {{appears that the}} jaguar melanism gene is also dominant over normal lion colouration (the black jaguar sire was presumably carrying the black on only one allele). In preserved, stuffed specimens, black leopards often fade to a rusty colour but black jaguars fade to a chocolate brown colour.|$|E

50|$|Carbon in {{the form}} of <b>charcoal,</b> carbon <b>black,</b> graphite, etc., can be and {{sometimes}} is used as a fuel in sugar formulations. Most often, however, a small amount of carbon is used as an opacifier, making a visible smoke trail. The carbon acts as a heat sink, keeping a portion of the heat of combustion located in the propellant rather than having it transferred quickly to the motor casing.|$|R
50|$|The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist, {{sometimes}} called The Burlington House Cartoon, is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci.

5000|$|The Halmahera python changes color over a {{short period}} of time; however, {{scientists}} are unable to determine what circumstances cause the color change. At the darker end of the color spectrum, morelia tracyae could be medium brown, orangish-brown, or russet. These colors could change to be a greenish-straw, grey-tan, yellowish-tan, or tan on the lighter end of the spectrum. Though the base color of the snake changes, the pattern of thick dorsal stripes remains the same. The stripes could be dark brown, charcoal-brown, brownish <b>black,</b> <b>charcoal,</b> or <b>black</b> at the dark end of the color continuum and become a medium greenish brown or medium reddish brown as the python shifts to the lighter end of the continuum. However, if a stripe is pure black it will remain black despite any other color changes. Though no newly hatched Halmahera pythons have been observed, Barker and Harvey of the 2000 python study “would predict that hatchlings are very dark reddish-brown in color.” ...|$|R

50|$|Bronze insect {{screening}} is {{much more}} expensive, but gives much longer service than either aluminum or fiberglass. When first installed, it has a bright gold color; this weathers to an unobtrusive dark charcoal {{within a year or}} less. Weathered bronze darkens the external appearance of windows to approximately the same degree as <b>charcoal</b> or <b>black</b> aluminum. Bronze is somewhat more resistant to denting than aluminum. Less common screen fabrics include copper, brass, stainless steel, and galvanized steel. For coastal locations, corrosion resistance usually requires the use of bronze or synthetic screening fabric.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} known pigments were natural minerals. Natural {{iron oxides}} give {{a range of}} colors and are found in many Paleolithic and Neolithic cave paintings. Two examples include Red Ochre, anhydrous Fe2O3, and the hydrated Yellow Ochre (Fe2O3.H2O). <b>Charcoal,</b> or carbon <b>black,</b> has also been used as a black pigment since prehistoric times.|$|R
