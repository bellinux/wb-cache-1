5000|$|Chain stitch and its {{variations}} {{are fundamental}} to embroidery traditions of many cultures, including Kashmiri numdahs, Iranian Resht work, Central Asian suzani, Hungarian Kalotaszeg [...] "written embroidery", Jacobean embroidery, and <b>crewelwork.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Crewel {{embroidery}}, or <b>crewelwork,</b> {{is a type}} {{of surface}} embroidery using wool. A wide variety of different embroidery stitches are used to follow a design outline applied to the fabric. The technique is at least a thousand years old.|$|E

50|$|Mary had a {{great love}} of music; she played the piano at concerts such as a Wakanui {{fundraising}} concert in 1893 and also sang in the church choir at the Ashburton Wesleyan Church. She and her sisters were also accomplished seamstresses, winning prizes at school competitions for their lacework, embroidery and <b>crewelwork.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike canvas work, crewel {{embroidery}} {{requires the}} use of an embroidery hoop or frame on which the material is stretched taut and secured prior to stitching. This ensures an even amount of tension in the stitches, so that designs do not become distorted. Depending {{on the size of the}} finished piece, <b>crewelwork</b> is generally executed with a small portable hoop up to large free standing frames (also known as slates).|$|E
50|$|The growing {{power of}} English East India Company {{resulted}} in increased imports of exotic commodities from China and Japan, including tea, porcelain and lacquer, and chintzes from India. This {{led to a}} craze for chinoiserie, reflected {{on the development of}} imitation lacquer (Japanning), blue and white decoration on ceramics, flat-chased scenes of Chinese-style figures and landscapes on silver and new forms of silver as teapots, as well as colourful Indian-style <b>crewelwork</b> bed-hangings and curtains.|$|E

50|$|The crewel {{technique}} {{is not a}} counted-thread embroidery (like canvas work), but a style of free embroidery. <b>Crewelwork</b> had its heyday in Britain in the 17th century, but has come {{in and out of}} fashion several times since then. Traditionally, crewel embroidery is done on tightly woven linen twill, though more recently, other fabrics like Matka silk, cotton velvet, rayon velvet, silk organza, net fabric and also jute have been used. A firm fabric is required to support the weight of the stitching. It is best to use a crewel needle to execute the stitches as a needle with a wide body, large eye and a sharp point is required.|$|E
