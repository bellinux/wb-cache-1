50|$|The {{technical}} {{complexity of}} this project was extreme. CONFIRM runs on two IBM 3090 mainframes. One houses the central reservations system, which runs under Transaction Processing Facility. The other mainframe houses a DB2 relational database in an MVS(an IBM mainframe operating system) environment. The database contains decision-support information such as customer histories and pricing data. The system required application-to-application bridging between the two mainframes (CPUs/IBM 3090) for some 60 applications. The main problem was to tie CONFIRM's transaction-processing facility-based <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> with its decision support system. Hilton users found that the system's user interface, mainframe transaction processing and mainframe database did not adequately communicate with one another. Other problems included different programming languages and difficulties with recovering databases in event of crashes. These problems were not insurmountable, but they would delay the project for about two extra years.|$|E

In the early years of mass global tourism (from the 1950 s to the 1970 s), computer systems were used to support the internal functions of large operators in the transportation, hotel, and food service sectors. Also, <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>systems</b> (CRSs) and global distribution systems (GDSs) —Sabre, Amadeus, Galileo, and Worldspan—were developed first by airlines and then by hotel companies to enable travel agencies (and other similar businesses) to access schedule and pricing information and to request reservations for clients (Sheldon, 1997). These businesses became the primary users of travel information systems, thus providing important links between travelers and industry players (World Tourism Organization Business Council [WTOBC], 1999) ...|$|R

Thus, a descriptive statistical analysis and a study of statistical associations through Cramer’s V have been carried out using data from 106 Valencian Community hotel establishments.

30|$|Social {{media have}} not only been playing an {{increasingly}} important role in airlines’ communication strategies, they have also {{found their way into}} airline distribution channels. Originally, flight tickets used to be sold either directly by airlines or by designated travel agents in brick-and-mortar sales points situated in big cities. Each carrier had its own <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>system,</b> first in form of books, later as a computer database. In the late 1980 s, airlines formed consortia and launched global distribution systems (GDS). GDSs have access to a complete inventory of seats of numerous airlines, which has led to standardization and simplification of sales and ticketing process [10]. At the turn of the centuries, some carriers started to express their dissatisfaction with fees attached to the use of GDSs and they launched their own online reservation platforms. Cheap Internet, expensive oil and severe competition from low cost carriers have intensified airlines’ effort to reduce costs. The equation is simple: fewer intermediaries mean lower distribution costs, which in turn leads to higher profits and possibly also lower tariffs.|$|E

40|$|Fierce {{competition}} abounds, extreme {{market segmentation}} is prevalent, and occupancy levels and profits are down throughout the hotel industry. As a partial {{response to these}} problems, the hotel industry has made significant changes in methods used to quote room prices and {{in the sale of}} its rooms through <b>central</b> or local <b>reservation</b> <b>systems.</b> To maximize revenue, many hotels have implemented yield management systems that adjust "room rates in response to the level of rooms booked for future arrival dates " (Relihan, 1989). Computer systems, sales incentive programs, and the retraining of reservation personnel and others are necessary in order to produce "the best possible return, or yield, from the space available " (Relihan, 1989). While the hotel management is attempting to boost revenues, they may be simultaneously and actively promoting discount programs to attract weekend guests, seniorcitizens, corporate accounts, government contracts, and families.

40|$|An online {{reservation}} system or <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> (CRS) is a computerized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to air travel, hotels, bus travel, rail travel, {{or any other}} activity. In general, reservation means an act of reserving or arranging to have something for use in advance. Originally designed and operated by airlines, CRSes were later extended {{for the use of}} travel agencies. Major CRS operations that book and sell tickets for multiple airlines are known as Global Distribution System (GDS). Airlines have divested most of their direct holdings to dedicated GDS companies who make their systems accessible to consumers through internet gateways. Modern GDSes typically allow users to book hotel rooms, rental cars, airline tickets as well as activities and tours. They also provide access to railway reservations and bus reservations in some markets, although these are not always integrated with the main system. There are a lot of booking sites using this option now. Nowadays, the internet is available to almost to everyone. So the online e-booking system has become a new trend. Many companies have its own e-booking facility. An individual with a positive attitude towards a product and service offering is more likely to make a purchase. This makes the study of consumer attitudes highly important for a marketer. An attitude may be defined as a feeling of favourableness or unfavourableness that an individual has towards an object (be it a person, thing or situation). It is a learned predisposition to exhibit and act based on evaluation, resulting in a feeling of like or dislike towards an object. In terms of consumer behaviour, consumer attitudes may be defined as "an inner feeling of favourableness or unfavourableness towards a product or service offering".

40|$|M. Comm. South Africa {{has become}} an {{accepted}} tourist destination since the 1994 general elections and the successful presentation of the 1995 Rugby World Cup event. The {{increase in the number}} of overseas visitors is reflected in higher arrival figures at our airports. Overseas tourists initially booked into the higher star rated hotels, but this trend quickly changed when they indicated a preference for the smaller hotels and the more personalised guesthouses. The recent establishment of hotels of well known world brands such as Hilton, Hyatt and others saw an increase in supply. These hotels were established with their links to the global reservation networks through which their reservations are accepted. The South African lodging industry now has to cope with management of the changes in demand in the face of world-wide computerised distribution. The guesthouses, smaller hotels and resorts tend to still utilise the printed media, mail or telephone bookings to communicate with prospective tourists. Although information technology is improving and becoming more accessible, only a few of the bigger South African hotel groups have utilised it to improve productivity and efficiency and to manage demand. A number of central reservation systems are in operation elsewhere in the world which allow the participants to present their establishments through the global travel agent networks such as Galileo and Worldspan. Trends in distribution of the lodging industry make it imperative to participate in such a system or face isolation from the world of tourism. The aim of this study is to establish the need for an integrated computer-based <b>central</b> <b>reservation</b> <b>system</b> for the smaller lodging establishments in South Africa. Depth interviews were conducted with a selected number of experts in the industry and the most important results of this empirical research were: The South African government has effectively withdrawn from the development of the tourism industry. The South African banks should be approached to establish such a system since they have proven expertise and knowledge of the operations of similar systems and would be in a position to make adequate funds available to allow the system to succeed. The system should be established with the capacity to link into world-wide distribution systems such as Galileo. The travel agents should be the first group to have access to this system since they are accepted as the driving force when implementing new solutions in the industry. Access through the Internet could follow. The cost of making a reservation at a lodging establishment is for the account of the hotel or guesthouse. The cost of accepting reservations from overseas tourists must be negotiated to be within the affordable range of the smaller lodging establishments. The establishmen...|$|E
