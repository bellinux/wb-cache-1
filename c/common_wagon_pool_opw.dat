Similar orders were conveyed to Cologne, Wesel, and Münster: and, by way of precaution, an express was sent to Liege for the removal of the battering train to Maastricht; as also for the destruction, in case of danger, of the iron foundry in the arsenal of the former place.|$|R
40|$|Wagon fleet is an {{essential}} component of the railways business. Motivated by the recent concern on freight wagon management in Europe and based on the experience from the deployment and pilot demonstrations of an advanced wagon management system in Europe, the current work presents main technological and organizational issues associated with a <b>wagon</b> <b>pool,</b> created and used by a railway operator partnership. The results include the identification of the essential hardware and software requirements for the implementation of such a system (user/wagon reservation, track-and-trace and energy-saver equipment, loading/unloading sensors, wagon dispatching and delay management functionalities) as well as the outcome of the investigation of significant organizational aspects of the system (imbalance between wagon offer and wagon demand, fair allocation of benefits among the users of the system, savings that can be achieved thanks to estimated time of arrival information, consideration of reliability metrics into the optimal empty wagons allocation problem).

30|$|In {{longitudinal}} train dynamics, {{draft gear}} {{is the most}} important component of the autocoupler. The autocoupler with friction type draft gear is the most <b>common</b> <b>wagon</b> connection in the Australian and North American freight system [1]. Similar autocouplers with draft gear are also used in the Indian freight system and their adoption in the freight system can be traced back in the early 1960 s. Mark- 50 was adopted in 1963, RF- 361 was adopted in 1965 and SL- 76 was adopted in 1977. Being {{an important part of the}} autocoupler system, the draft gear serves to absorb energy generated during the normal starting and braking of the freight railway wagon system and also during different train handling conditions, thus avoiding damage and failure of the coupling system. It thus functions as a passive vibration isolator to control and absorb high amplitude forces thereby avoiding damage to laden goods. The frequency of this longitudinal force depends on the train running condition and varies continuously.|$|R

First railway budget was presented. East Indian Railway Company {{taken over by the}} state on 1 January; Great Indian Peninsular Railway taken over on 30 June. <b>Wagon</b> <b>pooling</b> was made a practice for all railways. In 1926, Kurla-Kalyan section is electrified 1500 V DC. Electrification to Poona and Igatpuri (both 100V DC) over the Bhore and Thal Ghats was also completed in the same year. Charbagh railway station is built. On Jan 1928 Bandra-Virar section was electrified with 1500V DC. The Frontier Mail made its inaugural run between Bombay VT and Peshawar. First automatic colour-light signals became operational in India, on GIPR's lines between Bombay VT and Byculla. Kanpur Central and Lucknow stations were inaugurated. The Grand Trunk Express begins running between Peshawar and Mangalore. Punjab Limited Express begins to run between Mumbai and Lahore. Automatic colour-light signalling was extended to the Byculla-Kurla section. On 1 June 1930, the Deccan Queen begins running, hauled by a WCP-1 (No. 20024, old number EA/1 4006) and with 7 coaches, on the GIPR's electrified route from Bombay VT to Poona (Pune). Hyderabad Godavary Valley Rly. was merged into Nizam's State Rly. In the same year, the route of the Grand Trunk Exp. is changed to Delhi - Madras.|$|R

The incline itself was of three rails; the inner or centre rail being <b>common</b> to <b>wagons</b> both ascending and descending the incline. There was no engine working the incline which worked on the balance principle; horsepower was used for shunting until introduction of a Simplex shunter in the 1920s.

Throughout this research, not only structural information like wagon types, structure of their bodies, floor types, special equipment presence and suitable cargo types but also a contemporary comparison, {{in the light of the}} data provided by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Turkish State Statistics (TUIK), of Turkish transportation capabilities with its past and other countries are told...|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} most other British railways, goods trains were coupled {{together}} by a large three-link chain between sprung hooks on each wagon. Some vacuum-braked wagons were fitted with screw couplings which could be tightened so that wagons did not bounce back and forwards on their buffers, in which the middle link of the coupling was a threaded bar with a handle to rotate it. More <b>common</b> on GWR <b>wagons</b> was an instanter coupling, in which the middle link was specially shaped {{so that they could}} be shortened when in vacuum-fitted trains.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the door}} is hinged at the bottom it is termed a tailgate, {{particularly}} in the United States. A bottom opening door is common on a station wagon, pickup truck, or sport utility vehicle (SUV). Traditional U.S. station wagons included a roll down window. Because {{of the potential for}} carbon-monoxide fumes, the tailgate window on station wagons should be closed whenever the engine is running. Tailgates may contain accessories like a [...] "pocket" [...] for storage purposes. Traditional station wagon and pickup tailgates can also serve as a mount for a workbench. A 3-way tailgate is hinged at the side and bottom so it can be opened sideways like a car door, or downwards like a truck tailgate. The window can be opened to load small items. The door and hinge mechanisms of the 3-way tailgate are designed with special handle(s) for opening in the selected direction. In the late 1970s, it was the most <b>common</b> station <b>wagon</b> tailgate arrangement.|$|R
50|$|As with {{previous}} B series Sunny generations, the chassis was <b>common</b> with the <b>wagon</b> and sedan, with specific appearance to the RZ-1, {{while maintaining the}} traditional fastback associated with the Sunny Coupé. The Sunny hatchback and sedan were introduced with a square appearance, while the RZ-1 was more angular, with a more sharp appearance. The interior could only accommodate four people, with a black mask between the front headlights, retaining the strong slant angle, adding blistered front and rear over the wheels, and a wrapped around window treatment for the rear hatch, that had hit a different personality hatchback and sedan. The angular approach was also used on the Nissan EXA, which appeared internationally at the same time, and earlier on the Nissan Leopard.|$|R
5000|$|Loading the colliers {{was carried}} out by hand at first, {{especially}} where coal was transferred from keels which had brought it downstream from parts of the river that the colliers were unable to navigate, but as the quantities handled increased, specialised jetties known as [...] "staithes" [...] began to be built. These were of numerous designs. Some had spouts used for unscreened or small coal, others known as [...] "drops" [...] had steep inclines at the end, down which a wagon would be lowered directly into the hold, minimising the breakage of coal. Some had both drops and spouts. The drops and spouts could be raised and lowered with the tide. Later, elevators began to be introduced, such as those at Bates Staithes in Blyth, Northumberland and Harton Low Staithes in South Shields. These staithes used spouts. The largely intact Dunston Staithes on the Tyne are a good example of this type. In Scotland, a system was <b>common</b> where <b>wagons</b> would be placed on a cradle and lifted into the hold of the ship, but this system was rarely used elsewhere. Two large steam cranes were built for this purpose at the Harton Low Staithes, but it was found that despite their size and power they were too slow to handle the amount of coal that was arriving at the staithes, and were replaced by elevators.|$|R
50|$|The {{attendant}} {{and horse}} paths are four feet in width, and are raised or {{made up to}} a level with {{the top of the}} flange. From this mode of construction, the flat part of the rail is frequently filled with dirt and gravel; so much so, as to be little better than a common hard road. Horses only are used as the propelling power, and they convey thirteen wagons in convoy, each containing about one ton, at the rate of two and a half miles per hour. This reduced speed is occasioned principally by the great friction caused by the broad construction of the rails, and the wheels of the wagons come in contact, which is constantly thrown off from the horse path. Besides the rail <b>wagons,</b> <b>common</b> carts are introduced upon the rails; which has a very injurious effect, arising from the roughness of the tire of their wheels, and from the soil which adheres to them being deposited on the flat part of the rails.|$|R
5000|$|In Germany today, taxicabs {{are mostly}} a light, pale yellow/beige (ivory-coloured, RAL number 1015) (since November 2005 in some jurisdictions the colour {{has not been}} {{compulsory}} anymore; before 1971 they were black), with a small illuminated cylinder-like [...] "TAXI" [...] sign {{on the roof of}} the car (on when available, off otherwise). Typically the taxicabs are Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class along with other, mainly German, brands. Taxicabs are either sedans, station <b>wagons,</b> or MPVs. <b>Common</b> station <b>wagon</b> taxicabs include Mercedes-Benz C-Class. Among the MPVs, Mercedes-Benz B-Class, and Mercedes-Benz Vianos are common. Most taxicabs are automatic transmission, and some have navigation systems on board. Rates are usually near to other western European countries however, in Berlin taxis have a special low fare (€4) called [...] "Kurzstrecke" [...] for distances less than 2 km very useful for old people, except in Portugal in other western European capitals usually the minimum fare to take a taxi costs double; Netherless, the convenience and high quality of public transportation in most German cities eliminates the necessity for German citizens to use taxicabs. Although allowed, [...] "Street Hail" [...] is a relatively uncommon practice in Germany because cabs rarely circle the cities when vacant. Because there are relatively few customers, most cabs return to assigned waiting stations and are called on demand. Although this has proven to be more economic for cab drivers, it is considered very inconvenient for commuters because taxis include the ride from the waiting station to the pickup point in the fare.|$|R
60|$|The {{very day}} {{succeeding}} {{the arrival of}} the Sea Lion of the Vineyard, even while his mate was clearing the vessel, Daggett had a gang on the north shore, killing and skinning. As Roswell's rules were rigidly observed, no other change was produced by this accession to the force of the sealers, than additional slaughter. Many more seals were killed, certainly, but all was done so quietly that no great alarm was awakened among the doomed animals themselves. One great advantage was obtained by {{the arrival of the}} new party that occasioned a good deal of mirth at first, but which, in the end, was found to be of great importance to the progress of the work. Daggett had taken to pieces and brought with him the running part of a <b>common</b> country <b>wagon,</b> which was soon found of vast service in transporting the skins and blubber across the rocks. The wheels were separated, leaving them in pairs, and each axle was loaded with a freight that a dozen men would hardly have carried, when two or three hands would drag in the load, with an occasional lift from other gangs, to get them up a height, or over a cleft. This portion of the operation was found to work admirably, owing, in a great measure, to the smooth surfaces of the rocks; and unquestionably these wheels advanced the business of the season at least a fortnight;--Gardiner thought a month. It rendered the crews better natured, too, much diminishing their toil, and sending them to their bunks at night in a far better condition for rest than they otherwise could have been.|$|R
6000|$|As to the inns or hotels at Hamburg, I should {{recommend}} you to some German inn. Wordsworth and I {{were at the}} [...] "Der Wilde Man," [...] and dirty as it was, I could not find any inn in Germany very much cleaner, except at Lubec. But {{if you go to}} an English inn, for heaven's sake, avoid the [...] "Shakspeare," [...] at Altona, and the [...] "King of England," [...] at Hamburg. They are houses of plunder rather than entertainment. [...] "The Duke of York" [...] hotel, kept by Seaman, has a better reputation, and thither I would advise you to repair; and I advise you to pay your bill every morning at breakfast time: {{it is the only way}} to escape imposition. What the Hamburg merchants may be I know not, but the tradesmen are knaves. Scoundrels, with yellow-white phizzes, that bring disgrace on the complexion of a bad tallow candle. Now as to carriage, I know scarcely what to advise; only make up your mind to the very worst vehicles, with the very worst horses, drawn by the very worst postillions, over the very worst roads, and halting two hours at each time they change horses, at the very worst inns; and you have a fair, unexaggerated picture of travelling in North Germany. The cheapest way is the best; go by the <b>common</b> post <b>wagons,</b> or stage coaches. What are called extraordinaries, or post-chaises, are little wicker carts, uncovered, with moveable benches or forms in them, execrable in every respect. And if you buy a vehicle at Hamburg, you can get none decent under thirty or forty guineas, and very probably it will break to pieces on the infernal roads. The canal boats are delightful, but the porters everywhere in the United Provinces, are an impudent, abominable, and dishonest race. You must carry as little luggage as you well can with you, in the canal boats, and when you land, get recommended to an inn beforehand, and bargain with the porters first of all, and never lose sight of them, or you may never see your portmanteau or baggage again.|$|R
60|$|Covered with dust, gasping {{with the}} fatigue of a three hours' run beside the procession, but fresh at heart {{as in the}} beginning, they arrived with it on the Commons, where the tent-wagons were already drawn up, and the ring was made, and mighty men were driving the iron-headed tent-stakes, and {{stretching}} the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they {{were just going to}} clothe with canvas. The boys were not allowed to come anywhere near, except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well, and thought themselves richly paid with half-price tickets. The other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets; fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circus men. They stood about in twos and threes, and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tan-bark ring was better than a saw-dust ring; there were different opinions.

5000|$|After {{his long}} career in Fiat, Robinson was called upon by Lilli Bertone {{to become the}} new Brand and Design Director at Bertone in 2009. His first concept car in Bertone was the 2010 Alfa Romeo Pandion which was {{designed}} to celebrate Alfas 100 year anniversary at the Geneva Auto Show. The Pandion (which is the scientific name for Osprey) is a radical 2+2 sports car with reverse-opening scissors doors which are 3.4 meters tall when fully opened. The car utilizes a novel “Skin and Frame” concept stemming from the two-part Alfa Romeo logo, which underlines the new, dynamic mix between the robust organic frame and the sensuous skin that covers it. Many of the components in the car were realized using Algorithm Design technology, a random form generator which allows forms to become much more complex compared to those designed by humans.The second concept car from Robinson and Bertone was called the 2011 Jaguar B99 (Bertone turned 99 years old on this year) and demonstrated the exact opposite in design directions compared to the flamboyant Pandion. The B99 was a highly sophisticated yet compact luxury sedan that lead Jaguar into the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class market with a new proportions called: “dynamic imbalance” which offer a perfect mix, lost some time ago by Jaguar designers, between [...] "modernity" [...] and the [...] "brand DNA [...] ".In 2012, Bertone presented their centennial concept car appropriately called the Bertone Nuccio, to honor the man who has rewritten car design history several times. The Nuccio is again a supercar like the Pandion, this time a classic two seater, mid-engine sports car with a 500 hp 8-cylinder Ferrari engine. The aggressive lines are a mix between the icons of the past such as the Stratos Zero and a decidedly futuristic look. The roof without a rear window denotes the arrival of the digital era, replacing the backlight with external cameras and internal screens. The orange color on the roof is Nuccio Bertone’s favorite color, widely used throughout the Bertone Design Center. Another concept car developed simultaneously that year was the Chinese concept SUV called the BAIC C51X, the sister of the BAIC Senova D50 sedan designed by Bertone and launched into production at the 2014 Beijing Auto Show. The C51X is compact, dynamic, and extremely modern, and the success it had at the 2012 Beijing Auto Show convinced BAIC top management to put it into production [...]In 2013 Robinson designed the Aston Martin Jet 2+2, a [...] "one-off" [...] prototype, ordered directly by private British client. The car was born as an Aston Martin Rapide, then transformed into a Shooting brake, preserving the original beauty of the spectacular Rapide. The Shooting brake formula must never be confused with the <b>common</b> Station <b>Wagon,</b> since the former is a station wagon [...] "coupe" [...] while the latter is a [...] "cargo" [...] station wagon, with very different proportions [...] The interior was highly refined, according to the requests of the private client, adding an innovative mobile platform to make better use of the rear compartment.|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not really}} know how boys live through the wonder and the glory of such a sight. Once there were two chariots--one held the band in red-and-blue uniforms, and was drawn by {{eighteen}} piebald horses; {{and the other was}} drawn by a troop of Shetland ponies, and carried in a vast mythical sea-shell little boys in spangled tights and little girls in the gauze skirts and wings of fairies. There was not a flaw in this splendor to the young eyes that gloated on it, and that followed it in rapture through every turn and winding of its course in the Boy's Town; nor in the magnificence of the actors and actresses, who came riding two by two in their circus-dresses after the chariots, and looking some haughty and contemptuous, and others quiet and even bored, as if it were nothing to be part of such a procession. The boys tried to make them out by the pictures and names on the bills: which was Rivers, the bare-back rider, and which was O'Dale, the champion tumbler; which was the India-rubber man, which the ring-master, which the clown. Covered with dust, gasping with the fatigue of a three hours' run beside the procession, but fresh at heart as in the beginning, they arrived with it on the Commons, where the tent-wagons were already drawn up, and the ring was made, and mighty men were driving the iron-headed tent-stakes, and stretching the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they were just going to clothe with canvas. The boys were not allowed to come anywhere near, except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well, and thought themselves richly paid with half-price tickets. The other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets; fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circus-men. They stood about in twos and threes, and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tan-bark ring was better than a sawdust ring; there were different opinions.

All round, before the circus doors were open, the doorkeepers of the side-shows were inviting people to come in and see the giants and fat woman and boa-constrictors, and there were stands for peanuts and candy and lemonade; the vendors cried, [...] "Ice-cold lemonade, from fifteen hundred miles under ground! Walk up, roll up, tumble up, any way to get up!" [...] The boys thought this brilliant drolling, but they had no time to listen after the doors were open, and they had no money to spend on side-shows or dainties, anyway. Inside the tent, they found it dark and cool, and their hearts thumped in their throats with the wild joy of being there; they recognized one another with amaze, as if they had not met for years, and the excitement kept growing, as other fellows came in. It was lots of fun, too, watching the country-jakes, as the boys called the farmer-folk, and seeing how green they looked, and how some of them tried to act smart with the circus-men that came round with oranges to sell. But the great thing was to see whether fellows that {{said they were going to}} hook in really got in. The boys held it to be a high and creditable thing to hook into a show of any kind, but hooking into a circus was something that a fellow ought to be held in special honor for doing. He ran great risks, and if he escaped the vigilance of the massive circus-man who patrolled the outside of the tent with a cowhide and a bulldog, perhaps he merited the fame he was sure to win.|$|R
