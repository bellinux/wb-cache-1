40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{cultural}} underpinnings of accounting practices through a comparative analysis of India and New Zealand, using the chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report,</b> which is increasingly becoming one of the most important segments of the corporate annual report. Design/methodology/approach – The annual reports of Indian and New Zealand companies from 2001 to 2005 were selected to investigate the extent and nature of information disclosure in their chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report.</b> “Content analysis” is the main methodological orientation of the paper. Findings – The paper argues that, contrary to propositions based on Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s cultural framework, Indian companies provide more disclosure in their chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report</b> than their New Zealand counterparts. This leads to the conclusion that voluntary disclosure, more generally, is a complex phenomenon and cultural variables alone may not be sufficient predictors of the voluntary disclosure practices of a country. Originality/value – Using India and New Zealand, two countries with significant cultural differences, according to Hofstede 2 ̆ 7 s typology, the paper extends the literature by focusing on the chairperson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>report,</b> a more recent accounting phenomenon which is gaining popularity across the globe...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master s thesis was to investigate and evaluate HSE management practices implemented by Statkraft in a construction project in a developing country where the frame conditions {{are different from the}} Western countries where they have been developed. To evaluate the HSE methods, a case study approach was utilized by using one of Statkraft s construction projects, the Moglice Hydropower Project, in Albania as a case. The HSE methods assessed were 1) management of safety in work with severe accident potential, 2) management of HSE compliance by the Client s site team through inspections of <b>Contractor</b> <b>s</b> work and 3) initiatives to ensure employee HSE engagement. For the management of safety in hazardous work, road transportation, tunnelling and lifting operations were selected as hazardous work cases. Of the initiatives to ensure employee HSE engagement, JSAs, RUOs and toolbox talks were addressed. The HSE methods have been evaluated by following the principles of evaluation research. In the evaluation, the level of implementation, immediate effect, intermediate effect and long-term effect was assessed whenever possible. To evaluate the level of implementation, the Client s requirements in the contractual documents and in the Contractor' and the Project s own procedures served as evaluation criteria. The mini- audit carried out of <b>Contractor</b> <b>s</b> management of safety in hazardous work showed that some of the requirements have not been implemented in the project. From behavioural sampling performed on the hazardous work cases, it was discovered that safety rules were not always complied with and that the supervision and enforcement schemes were considered insufficient. The evaluation of the Client s site team s approach for carrying out safety inspections showed that the Client s site team has failed in terms of implementing the Client s requirements in their written safety management system and in the project. Due to a low level of implementation of medial actions, it is concluded that the immediate effect of the safety inspections is low. From the evaluation of <b>Contractor</b> <b>s</b> initiatives to ensure employee HSE engagement, it became apparent that there is a solely top- down communication between managers and workers and that engagement of workers in HSE issues in the project is almost non- existing. The gaps identified in the evaluation were discussed in light of external and internal factors influencing the implementation of the safety management system. It became apparent that internal factors had a larger influence on the gaps identified than external factors and that the level of implementation {{and the quality of the}} execution to a large extent were depending on individuals. Of the internal influencing factors, management support, personal motivation, appropriate supervision, enforcement scheme, personal competence and program evaluation stood out. Of the external factors, national culture seemed to have an influence on the workers participation in HSE matters. Albania s economic situation also seemed to influence the quality of both the Client <b>s</b> and <b>Contractor</b> <b>s</b> safety inspections, as there is a lack of experienced and qualified HSE personnel in the country. A further analysis of how external and internal factors influenced the HSE methods showed that external factors in developing countries such as national regulations and authority handling, national culture and national economic wealth, often seem to make the internal factors such as management commitment and safety prevention and control systems more prominent. When implementing safety management practices at construction sites in developing countries, the establishment of training programs and strict supervision is even more important as the workforce often consists of unskilled workers. As developing countries are often characterized by high power distance and masculinity, lifesaving safe rules and incentives for RUOs and safe behaviour should be established...|$|R

40|$|Despite growing {{evidence}} suggesting that women engage in verbal and physical dating aggression, there is a dearth of research examining the predictors of women 2 ̆ 7 s engagement in these behaviors. Utilizing a college sample, {{the purpose of the}} current study was to explore women 2 ̆ 7 s perpetration of dating aggression within the context of victimization experiences. Women (N = 374) completed surveys {{at the beginning and end}} of a 10 -week academic quarter for course credit. Results from two retrospective regression analyses (all Time 1 variables) suggested that (1) paternal physical abuse and adolescent/adulthood verbal victimization predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of verbal perpetration and (2) childhood sexual abuse, adolescent/adulthood verbal victimization, adolescent/adulthood physical victimization, and adolescent/adulthood verbal perpetration predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of physical perpetration. Results from the two prospective, longitudinal regression analyses suggested that (1) verbal perpetration (as measured at Time 1) and verbal victimization over the interim predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of verbal perpetration over the interim and (2) physical perpetration (as measured at Time 1), verbal perpetration over the interim, and physical victimization over the interim predicted women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>reports</b> of physical perpetration over the interim.
