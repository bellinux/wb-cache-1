5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule <b>cyclic</b> <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|The NO {{produced}} by {{this process is}} a potent activator of guanylyl cyclase (GC) by heme-dependent mechanisms; this activation results in formation of <b>cyclic</b> <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Among other roles, cGMP serves as a substrate for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that activates myosin light chain phosphatase. Thus, production of NO from exogenous sources such as GTN increases the level of cGMP within the cell, and stimultates dephosphorylation of myosin.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil protects <b>cyclic</b> <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (cGMP) from {{degradation}} by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in {{the corpus}} cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to guanylate cyclase receptors, {{which results in}} increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.|$|E

25|$|The binding of {{melatonin}} to melatonin receptors activates a few signaling pathways. MT1 receptor activation inhibits the adenylyl cyclase and its inhibition {{causes a}} rippling effect of non activation; starting with decreasing formation of {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (cAMP), and then progressing to less protein kinase A (PKA) activity, which in turn hinders the phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB binding protein) into P-CREB. MT1 receptors also activate phospholipase C (PLC), affect ion channels and regulate ion flux inside the cell. The binding of melatonin to MT2 receptors inhibits adenylyl cyclase which decreases the formation of cAMP. As well it hinders guanylyl cyclase and therefore the forming of <b>cyclic</b> <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (cGMP). Binding to MT2 receptors probably affects PLC which increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Activation of the receptor can lead to ion flux inside the cell.|$|E
25|$|While some {{mutations}} in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, {{at least one}} mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for <b>Cyclic</b> <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate.</b> Others include {{the introduction of a}} sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.|$|E
25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is often}} seen through two routes of administration, either through consumption or through endogenous ailments such as liver failure. One notable case in which ammonia toxicity is common {{is in response to}} cirrhosis of the liver which results in hepatic encephalopathy, and can result in cerebral edema (Haussinger 2006). This cerebral edema can be the result of nervous cell remodeling. As a consequence of increased concentrations, ammonia activity in-vivo has been shown to induce swelling of astrocytes in the brain through increased production of cGMP (<b>Cyclic</b> <b>Guanosine</b> <b>Monophosphate)</b> within the cells which leads to Protein Kinase G-mediated(PKG) cytoskeletal modifications. The resultant effect of this toxicity can be reduced brain energy metabolism and function. Importantly, the toxic effects of ammonia on astrocyte remodling can be reduced through administration of L-carnitine. This astrocyte remodeling appears to be mediated through ammonia-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. This mitochondrial transition {{is a direct result of}} glutamine activity a compound which forms from ammonia in-vivo. Administration of antioxidants or glutaminase inhibitor can reduce this mitochondrial transition, and potentially also astrocyte remodeling.|$|E

Regulation of the vascular tone {{is one of the}} best known roles of NO in the cardiovascular system. Once produced in endothelial cells, NO diffuses across the vascular smooth muscle cell membranes and activates the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into <b>cyclic</b> <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (cGMP). cGMP, in turn, activates protein kinase G (PKG), which promotes multiple phosphorylation of cellular targets lowering cellular Ca2+ concentrations and promoting vascular relaxation.|$|E

Prototypes of twice-as-smart ligands were recently developed to track and label G-quadruplexes: these higher-order nucleic acid structures originate in the assembly of four guanine(G) -rich DNA or RNA strands, whose stability is imparted by the formation and the self-assembly of G-quartets. The first prototypes of twice-as-smart quadruplex ligands were designed to exploit the self-association of quartets, being themselves synthetic G-quartets. While their quadruplex recognition capability has been thoroughly documented, some doubts remain about the precise photophysical mechanism that underlies their peculiar spectroscopic properties. Here, we uncovered this mechanism via complete theoretical calculations.

Our study aimed to compare the effect of red ginseng (RG) (warm property) and ginseng leaves (GL; cold property) on the substance and energy metabolism of rats with hypothyroidism. Materials and methods: Rats were administered propylthiouracil intraperitoneally for 20 d to cause hypothyroidism. The reference group was orally administered Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparaia [FZ (Fuzi in Chinese) ], while both the RG and GL groups were orally administrated crude drugs. The rectal, tail, toe, and axilla temperature of the rats were assayed every 3 d. Oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, heat production, and energy expenditure were measured via TSE phenoMaster/LabMaster animal monitoring system. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, Na+-K+-ATPase, fumarase, pyruvic acid and <b>cyclic</b> adenosine monophosphate/cyclic <b>guanosine</b> <b>monophosphate</b> were determined. Results: The lower levels of triiodothyronine, tetraiodothyronine, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone and the higher level of thyroid stimulating hormone revealed the successful establishment of a hypothyroidism model.
