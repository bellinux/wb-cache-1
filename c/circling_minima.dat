40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of airport congestion at New Zealand's major airports {{is the subject}} of this research thesis. A growing problem in New Zealand, the importance of understanding this problem and identifying options for solution is high. The intention of this research was to identify the extent of congestion at New Zealand airports; to estimate the industry cost of congestion; to identify the causes of congestion; to estimate future levels of congestion; and to offer suggestions for solution of this problem. Actual levels of airborne delay for flights arriving at these airports have been measured, and the industry cost of this delay in terms of time and fuel burn is estimated. Airport capacity for Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch airports is established and compared with the levels of demand for service. The level of delay attributable to excess demand is thus established. Comparison of differing airports' capacity levels indicates some level of delay attributable to air traffic control procedures. The majority of current delay is directly attributable to demand schedules which are characterised by grouping of demand - i. e. the scheduling of several aircraft at the same time, followed by periods of little or no demand. At Auckland and Christchurch airports, the current levels of airborne delay is due exclusively to scheduling patterns. Demand exceeds available capacity for many short periods throughout the course of the day, but is interspersed by a greater number of periods where capacity exceeds current demand. The delays experienced at these airports is also low – averaging approximately three minutes per aircraft. Similar levels of delay are experienced at Wellington airport during weather conditions which meet visual or instrument above <b>circling</b> <b>minima</b> criteria, but delays rise markedly when weather conditions fall below this criteria. This is due to the differing air traffic control procedures which must (for safety reasons) be invoked during these conditions, and result in a decrease in airport capacity. Instrument conditions below <b>circling</b> <b>minima</b> occur approximately 11 % of the time at Wellington, compared with approximately 3 % for Auckland and Christchurch. Moreover, weather conditions below <b>circling</b> <b>minima</b> do not necessarily reduce the capacity of Auckland or Christchurch airports. Forecast increases in demand over the next twelve years, when compared with available airport capacity indicate future levels of delay at extremely high rates for Auckland and Wellington airports which are currently operating at levels close to capacity. At Auckland, management of aircraft schedules is sufficient to provide a solution until 2005. Forecast levels of demand beyond this indicate that a greater level of solution will be required. These issues are likely to be addressed by the addition of a second runway. At Wellington airport the problem of congestion is more severe. Capacity is well exceeded by present levels of demand during weather conditions below <b>circling</b> <b>minima,</b> and is reached during instrument conditions for significant periods. There is little available capacity for future growth. Terrain and cost issues make additional runways for Wellington airport unfeasible options. It is essential then, that the available capacity of Wellington airport be managed with regard to available capacity. This must take the form of schedule management, and restrictions on aircraft types during busy periods. The primary cause of capacity degradation during weather conditions below <b>circling</b> <b>minima</b> is increased separation provided by air traffic control to keep aircraft safely separated in the event of a missed approach. Where the performance characteristics of the aircraft using an airport are similar, and minimal wake turbulence separation applies, then it is not necessary to increase separation between aircraft to provide this protection. In other words, if all aircraft using Wellington airport are restricted to a similar size and have similar speed and climb performance, then capacity will not be degraded during weather conditions below <b>circling</b> <b>minima.</b> As well as providing a constant capacity, standardisation of aircraft types will provide a small increase in that capacity. This is the only feasible solution to a growing problem at Wellington airport. It should be implemented immediately to both relieve current congestion and to prevent future levels of delay which are forecast to reach 1 hour duration by 2000 and exceed 6 hours by 2005...|$|E

The spherical and flick standards are respectively used to calibrate the spindle motion error and the probe which equips commercial conventional cylindricity measuring machines. The primary pressure standards are obtained using pressure balances equipped with rotary pistons with an uncertainty of 5 nm for a piston diameter of 10 mm. Conventional machines {{are not able to}} reach such an uncertainty level. That is why {{the development of a new}} machine is necessary. To ensure such a level of uncertainty, both stability and performance of the machine are not sufficient and the data processing should also be done with an accuracy less than the nanometre. In this paper, the new method based on the Small Displacement Screw (SDS) model is proposed. A first validation of this method is proposed on a theoretical dataset published by the European Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) in report n° 3327. Then, an experiment is prepared in order to validate the new method on real datasets. Specific environment conditions are taken into account and many precautions are considered. The new method is applied to analyze the least squares <b>circle,</b> <b>minimum</b> zone <b>circle,</b> maximum inscribed <b>circle</b> and <b>minimum</b> circumscribed <b>circle.</b> The results are compared to those done by the reference Chebyshev best-fit method and reveal a perfect agreement.

Desmoplasia and stromal invasion are diagnostic for EC {{but they are}} not always demonstrated in endometrial biopsies. In this study, we investigated the contribution of nuclear morphometry to distinction of ACEH and low grade EC. Methods: Ten low grade EC and eight ACEH cases retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology. For each case at least 100 nuclei (totally 1000 for both groups) were selected using hematoxylen-eosine stained sections and evaluated by a computer assisted system. Measured nuclear morphometric features were nuclear area, nuclear perimeter, circular form factor, diameter equivalent <b>circle,</b> <b>minimum</b> feret, maximum feret, area convex hull, perimeter convex hull. Results: There was no significant differences between these two groups for circular form factor (P= 0. 871). But all other morphometric features were statistically significant (P< 0. 05).

Then a critical plane criterion was invoked to estimate the fatigue endurance based on such values.
