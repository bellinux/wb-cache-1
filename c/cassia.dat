Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and was for a long time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from the bark of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in the bark of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia).

Individual inoculation of M. incognita, A. rabiei and X. campestris pv. <b>cassiae</b> caused {{significant reduction in}} plant growth while inoculation of Rhizobium sp. resulted in {{a significant increase in}} plant growth over control. Inoculation of pathogens in combination caused a greater reduction in plant growth than the damage caused by each of them singly.

This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus.

5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative <b>cassia),</b> cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and cubeb. Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp is an {{indigenous}} food legume in Africa, which has great production potential, especially {{in areas with}} low agricultural resources. During surveys of cowpea fields in southern Africa, a new foliar disease was recorded. Alternaria <b>cassiae</b> Juriar&Khan was consistently isolated from diseased plant material. Pathogenicity was confirmed using Koch's Postulates. The effect of different culture media, temperature, light and wounding on the growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. A. <b>cassiae</b> grew well and produced conidia abundantly when maintained on V 8 -agar at 25 °C in a 12 h UV-light/ 12 h dark cycle. Sporulation was further enhanced by wounding the cultures. The pre-penetration and infection process of A. <b>cassiae</b> on cowpea leaves was studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. Conidia germinated within 2 - 3 h post inoculation (hpi), forming multiple germ-tubes randomly that grew in any direction across the leaf surface. By 8 hpi terminal or intercalary appressoria were formed above epidermal cells or over stomata. Occasionally germ-tubes entered stomata, without the formation of appressoria. Penetration of the plant surface, whether directly through the epidermis or indirectly through stomata was observed 72 hpi. Following penetration bulbous primary hyphae were observed within the sub-stomatal cavities, secondary hyphae developed from the primary hyphae and grew within the intercellular spaces penetrating epidermis and mesophyll cells. A. <b>cassiae</b> is a necrotrophic fungus as the infection process is characterised by a destructive necrotrophic phase where plant cells became necrotic even prior to fungal penetration. Conidial morphology, types {{and development of the}} fungus were studied in vitro on different culture media and in vivo on cowpea leaves. A. <b>cassiae</b> produced a mixed population of three conidial types. Conidia were formed singly or in chains of 2 - 4 conidia. Conidia with long, filiform beaks and conidia with shorter beaks, converted into secondary conidiophores were more frequently produced than mature, beakless conidia on all the media, except on potato dextrose agar. Conidial body and beak sizes were variable when measured in culture and on cowpea leaves. Conidia produced in culture were larger, than those produced in vivo. Conidiophores emerged directly through the epidermis or stomata or were formed when hyphae growing on the leaf surface differentiated into conidiophores. Smooth, bud-like conidial initials were produced at the apex of conidiophores. Conidia matured and became elliptical to obvate and densely verrucose. Once a mature conidium had detached, a small pore was visible at the apex of the conidiophore. A. <b>cassiae</b> was shown to be seed-borne in cowpea. Six fungicides i. e. Benomyl, bitertanol, captab, mancozeb, propiconazole and triforine were evaluated for their efficacy in reducing mycelial growth of A. <b>cassiae</b> in vitro. All fungicides except benomyl proved to be effective. Cowpea seeds were artificially inoculated with A. <b>cassiae</b> and treated with all the fungicides except benomyl. Percentage germination and infection was determined in vitro. Percentage emergence, disease incidence, root and shoot lengths and abnormalities were determined in greenhouse trials. Only bitertanol at l. 5 x the recommended dosage significantly reduced percentage germination. All treatments except triforine l. 0 x and l. 5 x significantly decreased the percentage infection of artificially inoculated seeds. None of the treatments except bitertanol l. 5 x showed a difference in shoot and root length when compared to the control. Captab l. 5 x the recommended rate proved to be the best treatment over all.
