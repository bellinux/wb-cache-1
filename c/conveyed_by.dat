5|$|In early 1345, Apokaukos and Kalekas {{rejected}} {{offers of}} reconciliation <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> two Franciscan monks. Trying {{to bolster his}} waning power, Apokaukos {{began a series of}} proscriptions in the capital, and even ordered a new prison constructed for political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, Apokaukos suddenly decided to inspect the new prison, without being escorted by his bodyguard. The prisoners immediately rose up and lynched him, and his head was severed and stuck on a pole.|$|E
5|$|According to Martin Špegelj, the Defence Minister of Croatia between August 1990 and July 1991, the Croatian Army was {{informed}} by a Yugoslav Air Force Željava Air Base-based source about a top secret mission {{prepared for the}} next day, but Špegelj claims that the information was not taken seriously {{due to lack of}} details. Other sources assert that a warning was <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> Croatian security and intelligence system services, indicating the Soviet Union and its then-president Mikhail Gorbachev as the source of the information. At midnight during the night of the 67 October, the Soviet ambassador to Belgrade was reported to have received government instructions to warn the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb.|$|E

5|$|After the war ended, the OSS {{conducted}} {{an investigation into}} Cicero, interviewing key German players including Moyzisch. It was postulated that of the intelligence <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> Cicero to the Germans, the most notable information came from Knatchbull-Hugessen's notes, particularly regarding diplomatic efforts with the Turkish government. Many of the other documents were considered by Ostuf Schuddekoft, head of the British section of Amt VI , to be {{too old to be}} of much value to the Germans. Moyzisch was aggressively interviewed by the Allies and was a witness at the Nuremberg trials, after which he wrote a book to address rumors and explain his role during the war. He was never charged with a war crime.|$|E
5|$|For the {{two centuries}} prior to 1854, Japan had {{severely}} limited exchange with foreign nations, with the notable exceptions of Korea via Tsushima, Qing China via the Ryūkyūs, and the Dutch through the trading post of Dejima. In 1854, Commodore Perry opened Japan to global commerce with the implied threat of force, thus initiating {{a period of}} rapid development in foreign trade and Westernization. In large {{part due to the}} humiliating terms of the Unequal Treaties, as agreements like those <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> Perry are called, the Shogunate soon faced internal hostility, which materialized into a radical movement, the sonnō jōi ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians").|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her passengers and cargo, De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States. Most of the news <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> De Soto was of a mundane characterfor example, reports of activity on the Havana sugar marketbut sometimes it was of more interest. In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{the towers}} were {{redesigned}} in the Dutch Renaissance style {{but after the}} serious fire of 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops. At the same time, the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> pictures of the period. Only in 1740 were copper-faced spires installed, designed by Carl Hårleman. At the same time, Hårleman carried out significant work on the west façade. Today's towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s, substantially increasing their height. After the serious fire of 1702, the original flying buttresses were removed and a higher roof was built.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> the acoustic properties of the call.|$|E

As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional castle-guard rent to Dover Castle and retained a court baron; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle.|$|E

5|$|The {{memorial}} is {{not without}} its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|Elaine's role is {{significantly}} reduced for the sequel , though {{the majority of}} the story is <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> Guybrush to Elaine {{in the form of a}} flashback. Between the games, the two have broken off their relationship and Elaine has moved to her governor's mansion on Booty Island. When Guybrush appears at the mansion, she presumes he has come to apologize; instead he is looking for a map that belonged to Elaine's grandfather, which leads to fabled treasure Big Whoop. After discovering Guybrush's intentions, Elaine is infuriated and refuses to speak to him. Guybrush eventually becomes trapped at the site of Big Whoop, with Elaine arriving to rescue him. Guybrush falls into a chasm, where he is confronted by LeChuck, recently resurrected as a zombie. As the game ends with Guybrush thinking he is a child in a theme park, Elaine is seen worrying that LeChuck has placed a curse on Guybrush.|$|E
5|$|In 550, a pro-Persian revolt {{broke out}} among the Abasgians, a people that neighboured Lazica to the north. This {{provided}} {{an opportunity for a}} high-ranking Lazic noble, called Terdetes, who had quarrelled with Gubazes, to betray to the Persians Tzibile, an important fort {{in the land of the}} Apsili, a tribe under Lazic suzerainty. The Apsili retook the fort, but refused to accept Lazic rule until persuaded to do so by the Byzantine general John Guzes. In 551, the Byzantines finally took and razed Petra, but a new army under Mihr-Mihroe was able to establish Persian control over the eastern part of Lazica. The Byzantine forces in Lazica withdrew west to the mouth of the Phasis, while the Lazi, including Gubazes and his family, sought refuge in the mountains. Despite enduring harsh conditions in the winter of 551/552, Gubazes rejected the peace offers <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> envoys from Mihr-Mihroe. In 552, the Persians received substantial reinforcements, but their attacks on the fortresses held by the Byzantines and the Lazi were repulsed.|$|E

5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> the pipeline would melt the underlying permafrost, causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. What {{a pleasure to see}} these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E
5|$|The {{first stop}} for the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it was greeted by a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. The truck was loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E

5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a hand-drawn 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E
5|$|His {{most notorious}} exploit {{took place during}} the Crimean War on 25 October 1854 when, in command of the Light Cavalry Brigade at the battle of Balaclava, he led the Charge of the Light Brigade {{reaching}} the Russian guns before returning, personally unscathed, in a manoeuvre that cost the lives of about 107 out of the 674 men under his command {{who took part in the}} charge (although others may have died of wounds later on). The extent to which Lord Cardigan was to blame is unproven, since he attacked only after expressing his doubts and receiving a direct order in front of the troops from his immediate superior Lord Lucan, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The two men were barely on speaking terms as Lucan was married to one of Cardigan's sisters and, as Cardigan believed, did not treat her well. The order had been <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> Captain Louis Nolan, who died in the charge, and both Lucan and Cardigan blamed him for passing on the order incorrectly. Cardigan's first action on his return from the charge was to report the undisciplined behaviour of Captain Nolan (whom he did not know to be dead) in riding ahead of him at the start of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Refusing to {{surrender}} until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius, asking Pym if {{he believed it}} would be practical to send boats to tow Nereide out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow Sirius and Magicienne off the reef {{it was not possible}} to deploy them under fire to tow Nereide. Pym also suggested that Willoughby disembark his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to disembark the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius. At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. However, Willoughby's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead <b>conveyed</b> <b>by</b> French prisoners from Nereide who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender.|$|E
