Each time the weaver moved the sley to beat-up the weft, a rachet and pawl mechanism advanced the <b>cloth</b> <b>roller.</b> In 1802 William Ratcliffe of Stockport patented a Dandy loom with a cast-iron frame. It was {{this type of}} Dandy loom {{that was used in}} the small dandy loom shops.|$|E

5000|$|Decatising or decatizing, {{also known}} as crabbing, blowing, and decating, {{is the process of}} making {{permanent}} a textile finish on a cloth, so that it does not shrink during garment making. The word comes from the French , which means to remove the [...] or finish of the wool. Though used mainly for wool, the term is also applied to processes performed on fabrics of other fibers, such as cotton, linen or polyester. Crabbing and blowing are minor variations on the general process for wool, which is to roll the <b>cloth</b> onto a <b>roller</b> and blow steam through it.|$|R
5000|$|Four {{months after}} Coonen Cross Oath, on 22 May 1653, twelve kathanars (priests) ordained Thoma Kathanar {{as the first}} Bishop of Malankara See by the act of laying hands on him together. The Catholic faction argued that his consecration by 12 priests was irregular, {{from the fact that}} his consecration as a Bishop {{is said to have been}} regularized by Gregorios Abdal Jaleel ( [...] a {{delegate}} of the Patriarch of Antioch), in the year AD 1665, but the place and date yet anonymous. They chose the name Mar Thoma as they considered him the successor of St.Thomas the disciple of Jesus Christ. This action was not accepted by two Southist churches-one at Kaduthuruthy and another at Udayamperoor. Later on Bishop Sebastiani (He was ordained as a Bishop on 15 Dec. 1659) could convince many of the Kathanars, including three trustworthy and responsible priests, Kaduthuruthy Kadavil Chandy Kathanar, Angamaly Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar and Kuravilangad Palliveettil Mar Chandy Kathanar and also many other churches and important laymen that the consecration was irregular. Realizing this and also due to the political and monetary pressure exerted by the Carmelite fathers through the Portuguese and the native kings, many of the churches, Kathanars and laymen now withdrew their allegiance to Mar Thoma. They asked him to give up his dignity of Bishop, which was irregular, but he continued to wear the habit of Bishop and even started giving minor orders and blessing of Holy Oil etc., which acts, only a Bishop is entitled to do. Thus two parties are formed in the Malankara Church-one party under the Bishop Mar Thoma I and the other party under Bishop Palliveettil Mar Chandy called by the Europeans as Alexander de Campo (Chandy Parambil). Both of them claimed to have Apostolic briefs of appointment as Bishop. To resolve the issue and as suggested by the Archdeacons party, the case was referred to the King of Cochin. On 20 September 1661, the King of Cochin asked both parties, to present the Apostolic Briefs in his court. The Apostolic Commissary could produce Apostolic briefs from the Pope of Rome, while the Archdeacon's party failed to produce any briefs. On 9 October 1661, Bishop Sebastiani, tried to capture the Bishop Mar Thoma, with the help of the Portuguese General Captain Ignatius Sarmento, one Kurupp of Purakkad and the Cochin prince Godavarma II, from Mulunthuruthy Church, but he and his party escaped, during the previous night, wearing munds (loin <b>cloths),</b> swords, <b>rollers</b> in hands and special hats on their heads, just like gentile soldiers, so that they could not be recognized by the Nair soldiers.|$|R
