40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} a severe accident analysis computer program to the uncertainty analysis of molten <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interaction</b> (MCCI) phenomena in cases of severe accidents in CANDU 6 type plant. The potential hazard of MCCI is a failure of the reactor building owing to the possibility of a calandria vault floor melt-through even though the containment filtered vent system is operated. Meanwhile, the MCCI still has large uncertainties in several phenomena such as a melt spreading area and the extent of water ingression into a continuous debris layer. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the MCCI in the calandria vault floor via an uncertainty analysis using the ISAAC program for the CANDU 6...|$|E
40|$|Modelling of corium {{behaviour}} {{during a}} severe accident requires {{knowledge of the}} phases present at equilibrium for a given corium composition, temperature and pressure. The thermodynamic database NUCLEA in combination with a Gibbs Energy minimizer is the European reference tool to achieve this goal. This database has been improved thanks {{to the analysis of}} bibliographical data and to EU-funded experiments performed within the SARNET network, PLINIUS as well as the ISTC CORPHAD and EVAN projects. To assess the uncertainty range associated with Energy Dispersive X-ray analyses, a round-robin exercise has been launched in which a UO 2 -containing <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interaction</b> sample from VULCANO has been analyzed by three European laboratories with satisfactorily small differences.

40|$|International audienceTo {{increase}} the basic knowledge of key phenomena which occur during the molten <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interaction</b> (MCCI) {{resulting from the}} event of a severe accident in a nuclear power plant, we are developing a thermodynamic database for the corium (TDBCR) including the main materials involved. The first step of the accident is the core degradation, resulting from the interaction of the fuel (UO 2) with the zircaloy (98 wt% Zr). That is why the thermodynamic modelling of the fundamental O-U-Zr system is performed from a critical assessment of all the available experimental information. Optimized Gibbs energy parameters are given, and comparison between calculated and experimental equilibrium phase diagrams or thermodynamic properties is presented both for binary sub-systems and the ternary one, by means of isothermal (up to 3300 K) and isopleth sections of particular interest. The extent of the O-U liquid miscibility gap into the ternary system is especially discussed...|$|E

5000|$|The thermal {{hydraulics}} of <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interactions</b> (CCI, or also MCCI, [...] "molten core-concrete interactions") {{is sufficiently}} understood. However {{the dynamics of}} the movement of corium in and outside the reactor vessel is highly complex, and the number of possible scenarios is wide; slow drip of melt into an underlying water pool can result in complete quenching, while the fast contact of a large mass of corium with water may result in a destructive steam explosion. Corium may be completely retained by the reactor vessel, or the reactor floor or some of the instrument penetration holes can be melted through.|$|R
40|$|In case of {{a nuclear}} reactor severe accident, the core could melt, forming a high {{temperature}} mixture called corium. A uranium oxide-containing sample from a <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interaction</b> test has been analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-Ray Energy Dispersion Spectrometry (EDS) at three different laboratories. In all the measured windows, the composition lay on or close to the line connecting the initial corium melt composition to the concrete average composition. The round robin exercise confirmed that SEM and EDS analysis can be used confidently to perform fast and good quality local corium analyses and provide local quantitative compositions in the metallic elements of corium with an uncertainty of 10 % of the measured value. Differences up to 25 % of the measured value were found for the oxygen content, although two of the laboratories provided very close results. JRC. E. 2 -Hot cell...|$|E
40|$|Within SARNET, the CORIUM topic {{covers all}} the {{behaviour}} of corium from early phase of core degradation to in or ex-vessel corium recovery {{with the exception}} of corium interaction with water, direct containment heating and fission product release. The CORIUM topic regroups in three work packages the critical mass of competence to improve significantly the corium behaviour knowledge. The spirit of the SARNET networking is to share the knowledge, the facilities and the simulation tools for severe accidents, so to reach a better efficiency and to rationalise the R&D effort at European level. Extensive benchmarking has been launched in most of the areas of research. These benchmarks were mainly dedicated to the recalculation of experiments, while, in the next periods, a larger focus will be given to integral experiments or reactor applications. Eventually, all the knowledge will be accumulated in the ASTEC severe accident simulation code through physical model improvements and extension of validation database. This paper summarizes the progress that has been achieved in the frame of the networking activities and underlines also the orientation of the CORIUM work packages for the next period. A special focus is placed on the melt pool and debris coolability and <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interaction,</b> in which, the effects due to multidimensional geometries and heterogeneities has been shown, during SARNET, to play a crucial role and further research is still needed. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{thermodynamic}} modelling of the carbon-uranium (C-U) and boron-uranium (B-U) binary {{systems is}} being {{performed in the}} framework of the development of a thermodynamic database for nuclear materials, for increasing the basic knowledge of key phenomena which may occur {{in the event of a}} severe accident in a nuclear power plant. Applications are foreseen in the nuclear safety field for the physico-chemical interaction modelling, on the one hand the in-vessel core degradation producing the corium (fuel, zircaloy, steel, control rods) and on the other hand the ex-vessel molten <b>corium-concrete</b> <b>interaction</b> (MCCI). The key O-U-Zr ternary system, previously modelled, allows us to describe the first interaction of the fuel with zircaloy cladding. Then, the three binary systems Fe-U, Cr-U and Ni-U were modelled as a preliminary work for modelling the O-U-Zr-Fe-Cr-Ni multicomponent system, allowing us to produce the steel components in the corium. In the existing database (TDBCR, thermodynamic database for corium), Ag and In were introduced for modelling AIC (silver-indium-cadmium) control rods which are used in French pressurized water reactors (PWR). Elsewhere, B 4 C is also used for control rods. That is why it was agreed to extend in the next years the database with two new components, B and C. Such a work needs the thermodynamic modelling of all the binary and pseudo-binary sub-systems resulting from the combination of B, B 2 O 3 and C with the major components of TDBCR, O-U-Zr-Fe-Cr-Ni-Ag-In-Ba-La-Ru-Sr-Al-Ca-Mg-Si + Ar-H. The critical assessment of the very numerous experimental information available for the C-U and B-U binary systems was performed by using a classical optimization procedure and the Scientific Group Thermodata Europe (SGTE). New optimized Gibbs energy parameters are given, and comparisons between calculated and experimental equilibrium phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties are presented. The self-consistency obtained is quite satisfactory...|$|E
