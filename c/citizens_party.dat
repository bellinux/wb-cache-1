25|$|During his mayoralty, Sanders {{called himself}} a socialist {{and was so}} {{described}} in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first <b>Citizens</b> <b>Party</b> City Councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party.

2500|$|The 39-year-old Sanders {{ran against}} {{incumbent}} Democratic mayor Gordon [...] "Gordie" [...] Paquette, a five-term mayor {{who had served}} {{as a member of the}} Burlington City Council for 13 years before that, building extensive community ties and a willingness to cooperate with Republican leaders in controlling appointments to various commissions. Republicans had found Paquette so unobjectionable that they failed to field a candidate in the March 1981 race against him, leaving Sanders as his principal opponent. Sanders's effort was further aided by the decision of the candidate of the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Party,</b> Greg Guma, to exit the race so as not to split the progressive vote. Two other candidates in the race, independents Richard Bove and Joe McGrath, proved to be essentially non-factors in the campaign, with the battle coming down to Paquette and Sanders.|$|E
