5|$|Because of its {{geographic}} position, Croatia {{represents a}} blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a <b>crossroad</b> of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures.|$|E
5|$|Determined Egyptian {{resistance}} {{made progress}} extremely slow for the Israelis, who suffered heavy losses. The Israelis were repeatedly reinforced with armor but {{were unable to}} make much headway, only managing to seize an important <b>crossroad</b> on the second day.

They were tasked with clearing anti-tank defenses for the armor, but they became pinned down by heavy Egyptian fire. The paratroopers drew Egyptian attention long enough for the Israelis to move bridging equipment to the canal undetected. Armored forces later extricated the paratroopers.|$|E

Specifically, the complex consists of the Old Town fortified by King Casimir IV, the Old Castle rebuilt by Kings Sigismund I and Stephen Báthory, and the New Castle founded by Kings Sigismund III and Władysław IV.

5|$|Like Ladislaus I, Coloman {{proved to}} be a great legislator, but he {{prescribed}} less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a <b>crossroad</b> of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Mount Vision, the two roads {{parallel}} {{each other}} {{into the town}} of Hartwick, where both intersect with another highway crossing Otego Creek, CR11D. The roads enter the hamlet of Jones Crossing, intersecting with another <b>crossroad,</b> the locally maintained Jones Crossing Road. In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing, NY205 intersects with CR45's western terminus. The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 end a short distance to the north in the hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the community on the east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego.|$|E

5|$|Following US 30, Route 73 {{passes through}} a small corner of Berlin Boro before it goes under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line near the Atco station. At the {{railroad}} crossing, the route enters Berlin Township and meets CR 534 at a <b>crossroad.</b> After the intersection with this route, the road proceeds back into Berlin Boro, where the route runs through a mix of residences and businesses. Route 73 widens to a six-lane highway and comes to the former Berlin Circle, where it meets both CR 689 and CR 708. From here, the road turns north and reenters Berlin Township as a four-lane divided highway, continuing through developed areas and intersecting CR 692. Prior to the junction with CR 693, the route enters Voorhees Township, where it encounters CR 675.|$|E
5|$|I-97 {{continues}} {{north as}} a six-lane freeway and is closely paralleled {{on the east}} by Veterans Highway on {{the western edge of}} Severna Park. The highways cross Severn Run within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate's partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard; access from northbound I-97 to the <b>crossroad</b> is via Veterans Highway. I-97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway's northern end at I-97's partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business (Robert Crain Highway) and New Cut Road. The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Business. The freeway continues north along the west side of Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 (Quarterfield Road) at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and MD 100 at a cloverstack interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I-97.|$|E
5|$|Kunu-ri is a <b>crossroad</b> {{village on}} the {{northern}} bank of the Kaechon River, one of Ch'ongch'on River's southern tributaries. As the Chinese counteroffensive grew in strength against the Eighth Army's center, Kunu-ri had become a major bottleneck for the US IX Corps' retreat. In an effort to stabilize the front on November 28, Walker ordered the US 2nd Infantry Division to retreat from Kujang-dong and {{to set up a}} new defensive line at Kunu-ri. The importance of Kunu-ri was also noted by the Chinese, and on November 27, Peng instructed the PVA 38th Corps to cut the US IX Corps retreat route. The PVA 114th Division of the 38th Corps would capture Kunu-ri by marching westward on the road from Tokchon, while the PVA 112th Division would follow on a parallel route through the hills north of the road.|$|E

5|$|The 8th Parachute Battalion, {{tasked with}} {{destroying}} two bridges near Bures {{and a third}} by Troarn, was widely scattered {{with a number of}} its paratroopers landing in the operational area of 5th Parachute Brigade. When the commanding officer, Alastair Pearson, arrived at the battalion rendezvous point at 01:20, he found only thirty paratroopers and a small group of sappers with a Jeep and trailer. By 03:30, this number had increased to just over 140 paratroopers yet there were still no sign of the sappers who would be required to demolish the bridges. Pearson therefore decided to send a small force to demolish the bridges at Bures, and lead the rest of the battalion to a <b>crossroad</b> north of Troarn where it would await more reinforcements before it attacked. The force sent to Bures discovered that the two bridges had already been demolished by a group of sappers, who had reached the bridges a few hours earlier, and so rejoined the battalion near Troarn that had now increased in numbers after another fifty men had arrived. A reconnaissance party, and a party of sappers, was sent into Troarn to ascertain the status of the bridge. These troops came under fire, from a German-occupied house near the bridge. After a brief fire-fight, the paratroopers captured a number of Germans from the 21st Panzer Division. The airborne troops then {{made their way to the}} bridge, which they discovered had been partially demolished already. Once the sappers had widened the length of the bridge demolished, using their explosives, the reconnaissance force withdrew back to the rest of the battalion at the <b>crossroad.</b> Having achieved its objective, the battalion then moved north and took up positions near Le Mesnail to widen the airborne bridgehead formed by the division.|$|E
5|$|Maryland and Delaware plan to {{continue}} to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project {{for the construction of}} an interchange between US113 and MD12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the <b>crossroad.</b> The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and Brick Kiln Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and {{the south end of the}} Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.|$|E
