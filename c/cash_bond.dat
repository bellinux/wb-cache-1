Both pleaded not guilty to the two charges and were later released on a $2,500 <b>cash</b> <b>bond.</b> At their arraignment, Assistant Attorney General John Grossman claimed that the two were trying to [...] "get attention by causing fear and unrest that there was a bomb in that location." [...] Michael Rich, the lawyer representing both men, disputed Grossman's claim, asserting that even a VCR could be found to fit the description of a bomb-like device. Judge Leary said that it would be necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate an intent on the part of the suspects to cause a panic. The judge continued, [...] "It appears the suspects had no such intent ... but the question should be discussed in a later hearing." [...] After making bail, Berdovsky and Stevens appeared for a live press conference. As Rich had advised them not to discuss the case, they spent the entire conference discussing and inviting press questions about hair styles of the 1970s, and ignoring any questions relating to the bomb scare.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, then Police Chief David McCoy {{ordered the}} {{responding}} officers {{to arrest the}} Mayor, stating that he believed Thomas was [...] "a danger to himself and others". [...] Interestingly, Thomas was transported to the Henderson County Jail instead of the Gun Barrel City jail. [...] Chief David McCoy later told a local newspaper that he made that decision because a nurse was on duty at the County Jail and he wanted Thomas to be monitored by a nurse. [...] Thomas was granted a phone call {{when he arrived at}} the Henderson County Jail. [...] It was approximately 2:00AM and Thomas called recently elected Justice of the Peace Dale Blaylock at home. [...] The phone call woke Judge Blaylock from his sleep, but Thomas nonetheless asked him to come to the jail right away and arraign him, presumably so Thomas could be released quickly. [...] It was reported in a local newspaper that Judge Blaylock immediately traveled at least thirty miles to the Henderson County Jail in Athens, Texas and arrived at approximately 3:00AM. [...] He arraigned Thomas first and set his bail at $500.00, the maximum allowed by law for the offense. [...] It was also reported that while Judge Blaylock was at the jail, he arraigned and set bond for all other inmates waiting to see a Judge the following day. [...] It was reported in the local newspaper that Thomas' father, Larry Ray Thomas, was waiting at the jail and posted the $500.00 <b>cash</b> <b>bond</b> only a few minutes after Judge Blaylock set his bail, and Thomas was immediately released.|$|E

Traditionally, fixed income investors who expected rates to fall would purchase <b>cash</b> <b>bonds,</b> whose value increased as rates fell.

40|$|Individual {{as well as}} {{institutional}} investors face the decision of how to allocate assets in their portfolios. In general, it is distinguished between strategic and tactical asset allocation. While strategic asset allocation concentrates on the allocation and diversification of a portfolio among major asset classes such as <b>cash,</b> <b>bonds,</b> stocks and real estate, tactical asset allocation is a dynamic adjustment of the strategic asset allocation weights {{with the intent to}} add value due to a changing fundamental market environment. This dissertation, which consists of three self-contained chapters, focuses on strategic asset allocation. In the first chapter the inflation-hedging abilities of <b>cash,</b> <b>bonds,</b> stocks and real estate and optimal horizon-dependent inflation-protecting asset allocations are analyzed. In the second chapter the standard stationary vector autoregressive (VAR) model to capture asset return dynamics is extended by cointegration influences. The resulting differences compared to the standard VAR approach with respect to the term structure of risk and the optimal portfolios are subsequently investigated. In the last chapter different influences of macroeconomic variables on stock prices and their cash flows (dividends and earnings) are analyzed. These different influences are of significant importance for stock return predictability and consequently for the strategic asset allocation...|$|R

Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.|$|R

40|$|Based on an {{analysis}} of high-frequency panel data for U. S. firms, this paper finds that inventory investment has been liquidity-constrained in most periods during 1975 - 97, but less so, or not at all, during recessions. This result can be justified {{on the grounds that}} inventory fluctuations are largely attributable to unexpected sales shocks, and that firms increase liquid assets before recessions. Moreover, this results holds irrespective of whether the firm has a bond rating, contrary to the finding of Kashyap, Lamont, and Stein (1994) that inventory investment is liquidity-constrained during recessions only for firms without bond ratings.
