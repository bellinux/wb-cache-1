For instance, the forestay is bolted right through the hull and secured with a bolt hidden at the centre of a bronze casting of a thistle which becomes a feature of the bow. The shrouds and backstay are secured to u-bolts through the deck, eliminating the need for rigging screws. The u-bolts provide a <b>compression</b> <b>packing</b> that can be screwed down tight, and owners report that they seldom leak. The deck is moulded with a lip that turns up to fit inside the hull moulding, and after being glued and glassed in, the join is covered with a custom-designed vinyl moulding that eliminates the common problem of deck/hull leaks, and also serves as a practical rubbing strake. The mast is deck-stepped on an aluminium channel that sits above the two main internal bulkheads - a solution that allows easy passage below decks to the forecabin, while ensuring a solid base for the mast. Many of the boats were delivered with an outboard engine that was mounted in a cutout in the rear cockpit bench seat and could be removed and stowed below the cockpit - a configuration that was later adopted in other production yachts. These models were also delivered with an arch in the companionway cutout instead of a sliding hatchway, thus simplifying construction, retaining bulkhead strength and removing another possible source of leaks.|$|E

The dependency of surface pressure changes on temperature and compression rate is strongly influenced by the conformations of PNIPAM chains at the interface, which can be adjusted by varying the packing density. Specifically, when loops or tails are formed at the interface, PNIPAM chains display thermosensitive properties due to hydration/dehydration and obvious dependence on compression rate. When PNIPAM chains take train conformation at the air/water interface, however, the surface pressure changes are nearly independent of temperature and compression rate because almost all segments of the PNIPAM chains are adsorbed at the interface and the nonpolar isopropyl groups are preferentially oriented toward the air.

40|$|Biogas from {{anaerobic}} digestion {{of sewage sludge}} is a renewable resource with high energy content, which is composed mainly of CH 4 (40 – 75 vol %) and CO 2 (15 – 60 vol %). Other components, such as water (H 2 O, 5 – 10 vol %) and trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes, can also be present.

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to assess the technical and economic performance of biogas upgrading processes using ionic liquids that physically absorb CO 2. The simulation methodology is based on the COSMO-SAC model as implemented in Aspen Plus. Three different ionic liquids, namely, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide, 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazoliumbis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide, and trihexyl(tetradecyl) phosphonium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide, are considered for CO 2 capture in a pressure-swing regenerative absorption process. The simulation software Aspen Plus and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer is used to account for mass and energy balances as well as equipment cost. In all cases, the biogas upgrading plant consists of a multistage compressor for biogas <b>compression,</b> a <b>packed</b> absorption column for CO 2 absorption, a flash evaporator for solvent regeneration, a centrifugal pump for solvent recirculation, a preabsorber solvent cooler, and a gas turbine for electricity recovery.

We carry out an exergy analysis for a single charge–storage–discharge cycle to see where the main losses are likely to transpire and we find that the main losses occur in the compressors and expanders (accounting for nearly 20 % of the work input) rather than in the packed beds. The system is then simulated for continuous cycling and it is found that the build-up of leftover heat from previous cycles in the packed beds results in higher steady state temperature profiles of the packed beds.

40|$|During {{the filling}} of a {{container}} by a dry granular material (ex. storage in a silo, mixer container, packaging), the powder flow {{interacts with the}} side walls and {{the bottom of the}} bowl, and leads {{to the creation of a}} semi-confined free surface in the “feeding zone” and of particle jamming under the free surface. The “feeding zone” corresponds to a zone of strong energy dissipation induced by shocks and frictions between the grain bed formed, the particles in movement and walls of the bowl. The resultant free surface takes the shape of a heap and the surface rises upward the bowl with the powder filling. Once "buried" within the heap, particles are immobilized under the free surface. Particle jamming can be postponed according to the possible local mobility. The stabilization of the intergranular force network inside the heap leads to the establishment of a local stress field. The intensity and the distribution of these stresses can be very different according to the elastic and frictional properties of the particles and also according to the powder filling conditions (size of the bowl, mechanical properties of the walls, flowing properties of the particles, initial velocity of the particles, etc.). The knowledge of the local stress field is important for a mechanical stability of storages or a grain re-mobilization grains under the influence of a shear stress (mixing, flowing) or a <b>compression</b> stress (<b>packing,</b> tapping, compaction). This work concerns the experimental identification of the static mechanical state within an ensiled granular material by measuring the force applied on a sensor immersed inside the heap. The experimental analysis of the powder filling and of the stabilized bed formation is realized with granular materials of contrasted properties (durum wheat semolinas, agglomerates), which are poured according to a calibrated protocol in a cell in order to follow the evolution of the free surface by recording successive pictures. The results allow to characterize the formation of a heap with repose rest angle more or less important. This structure, which results from local granular arrangements, suggests the expression of two main modes of layout: the one by "layering" with a lateral homogeneity of the local stresses (at least until a certain distance of the side walls), the other one in "dune", (sloping heap) with a lateral heterogeneity of the local stresses. The joint analysis of the local vertical stresses in the granular bed, reveals a direct relation between the structure of the free surface and the distribution of the local stresses. Several modes of stress distribution could be distinguished and could be classified according to a parameter of uniformity and their gap from an ideal hydrostaticity...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and theoretical study of compaction, flow and hydrodynamic dispersion in a chromatographic column containing non-rigid particles is presented. Experiments were performed using chromatographic columns packed {{with either a}} dextran-based chromatographic gel or glass beads. It was found that both the velocity variations and the dispersion irregularities in the column containing the compressed gel was smaller in the wall region than in the column packed with glass beads. This indicated that the <b>compression</b> made the <b>packing</b> more uniform. The hydrodynamic dispersion coeffcients measured at high Peclet numbers {{were found to be}} approximately twice that expected for a rigid packing, which was interpreted as an increase in the correlation (dispersion) lenght. A cubic plane strain tester was used to determine Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio of the compressible, water-saturated gel at stress levels < 7 kPa. The wall friction coeffcient was determined using a modified version of a Jenike shear cell. A model for flow and compaction based upon Darcy's law and elastic analysis was presented, which incorporated a constant Poisson ratio and a void fraction dependent Young's modulus. The packed bed was assumed to be locally isotropic and the permeability was calculated using the Kozeny-Carman equation. A control-volume method was used to solve the set of coupled equations obtained. Simulations were performed without any parameter fitting. Experimental velocity and pressure profiles, reflecting the structural changes along the column, were predicted well. The predicted velocity profiles across the column agreed qualitatively with experimental measurements and the flow rate could be predicted within 30 %.

A K-type thermocouple whose hot junction located in the close proximity of the specimen was used to monitor the temperature accurately. The specimen inside the furnace was heated by a microprocessor-controlled programmer up to 250 oC. The temperature dependent conductivity study conducted for the samples activated at 700, 800 and 9000 C had revealed that energy gap value of the samples were 0. 1023 ev, 0. 0745 ev and 0. 052 ev respectively, determined from the linear plot of ln I versus 1 /T (K- 1). The meso porous RHAC samples were characterized using electron spin resonance, FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction for quantitative evaluation of free electrons, functional groups and crystallites to support the mechanism of electrical conduction in mesoporous non-sinterable carbon samples. 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{compaction}} properties of two experimental starches, namely yam starch obtained from Dioscorea rotundata and rice starch obtained from Oryza sativa and the mechanical properties of their tablets, in comparison with those of official corn starch. The influences of the physical and geometric properties of the starch particles on the compression properties of the starches were determined. Further analysis of the compaction properties was done using density measurements, and the Heckel and Kawakita equations. The mean particle diameter and the shape factor of the starches were directly related to the loose initial density (Do) and rearrangement at low pressures (DA) characteristics of the starches, but inversely related to the rearrangement of the particles {{in the early stages of}} <b>compression</b> (DB). The <b>packed</b> initial relative density (DI) was also directly related to the particle diameter and shape factor. The three starches deform mainly by plastic flow. The values of the mean yield pressures, which are inversely related to the onset of plastic deformation in the starches were in the rank order rice>corn>yam. Another pressure term, inversely related to the amount of plastic deformation during compression, was in the rank order yam>corn>rice. The ranking of the values of both the tensile strength and brittle fracture index of tablets made from the starches was rice>corn>yam, indicating that rice starch tablets exhibited the highest bond strength and brittleness while yam starch exhibited the lowest values. The compaction properties of the experimental starches as characterized compared well with those of official corn starch. The results obtained showed that in tablet formulations, yam starch would be more useful in minimizing the problems of lamination and capping while rice starch would be more useful when high bond strength of the tablet is desired. Thus, yam and rice starches could be useful in formulations to produce tablets with desired mechanical properties for particular purposes...|$|R
40|$|Alginate hydrogels {{are widely}} used in {{biomedicine}} due to alginate availability, hydrophilic nature, biocompatibility and biodegradability. Alginate microbeads are particularly attractive for applications in pharmacy and regenerative medicine due to high surface to volume ratio, low mass transfer limitations and simple implantation by injection. Aim of this work was to investigate possibilities for controlled degradation of alginate microbeads in cell culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) with Na-citrate added in small concentrations (0. 05 - 0. 5 mM). Alginate microbeads (1. 5 % w/w, 800 m in diameter) were produced by electrostatic droplet extrusion and evaluated {{over a period of}} 10 days regarding appearance, kinetics and degree of swelling as well as biomechanical properties determined in a novel bioreactor with mechanical stimulation under in vivo-like conditions in articular cartilage (10 % strain, 337. 5 m/s compression rate). In the citrate concentration range investigated, microbeads initially swelled reaching an equilibrium value (~ 150 - 170 % with respect to the initial mass), upon which they appeared stable for {{a certain period of time}} (1 to over 7 days) followed by bead bursting and degradation. This degradation process indicated that Na+ ions from the solution initially replaced Ca 2 + ions bound mainly to COO- groups in polymannuronate sequences inducing electrostatic repulsion of polymer chains and, consequently, swelling of the beads. Citrate ions assisted in this process by forming insoluble calcium citrate. Thus, the specific rate of the bead swelling increased with the increase in citrate concentration approaching a maximal value of ~ 0. 34 d- 1. In the last phase, the beads burst into pieces, which slowly continued to degrade by replacement of Ca 2 + ions bonded to polyguluronate blocks in the egg-box structure. <b>Compression</b> moduli for <b>packed</b> beds of control, freshly produced microbeads, and microbeads swelled at the equilibrium degree after 3 days of staying in 0. 2 mM Na-citrate solution were 136. 6 ± 2. 8 and 30. 8 ± 1. 3 kPa, respectively. By day 7 in this solution, the beads still appearing structurally intact, further lost their mechanical strength due to continued polymer chain relaxation so that the compression modulus was 20. 7 to 22. 6 kPa owed almost solely to undegraded polyguluronate parts. Results of these studies are important from a fundamental standpoint for determination of structure and degradation mechanisms of alginate hydrogels but also from a practical point of view for optimization of hydrogel properties and behavior for potential applications in controlled drug release as well as in tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|Gland sealing {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform <b>packing</b> <b>compression</b> to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of gland sealing and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a gland seal in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump gland seal to cause wear of the sacrificial shaft sleeve. Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the shaft sleeve. The wear of the shaft sleeve was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the shaft sleeve and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the shaft sleeve SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.
