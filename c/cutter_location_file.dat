The {{relationship between the}} cam profiles and the meshing element’s surface is established by the conjugate surface theory. In the machining process, the cutter location for the rough and the finish machining using cylindrical-end mill is derived. To avoid interference, the principal curvatures and the principal induced normal curvatures between the cam surface and the cutting tool are analyzed. The geometric error {{was used as a}} basis for generating appropriate toolpaths. The postprocessor are developed for converting the <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> <b>file</b> to the five-axis numerical control program. The generated NC program is verified before actual machining through solid cutting simulation.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{focuses on the}} process of machining complex and varying contour aerofoil parts used in aerospace industry like wings, blades of turbine and diffusers, etc. The main theme is to enhance productivity {{and on the other hand}} achieving accurate machining results for complex profile parts. The research consists of three main parts viz. Accurate and optimized tool path generation of complex profile, understanding and conversion of a 5 -axes machine kinematics into mathematical relationships and developing a post processor which converts <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> <b>file</b> into machine readable file, and finally a time and accuracy study has been made and compared with techniques used previously for machining of such components. Tool path is generated on CAM software from where CL (<b>Cutter</b> <b>Location)</b> <b>file</b> is generated, then by use of mathematical calculations post processor is developed and used for the conversion of that CL file into machine readable file. Time and accuracy analysis has been made in the end on an impeller blade machining. Tool paths generated in CAM software requires to be very closely analyzed in order to ensure collision free tool paths as movement in all 5 -axes increases the chances of collision of head to work piece or with the table. For the study of 5 -axes machine kinematics and calculations, a general 5 -axes machine having 3 linear axes and two axes in rotary/tilting table has been used. By applying mathematical relationships using rotational matrix theorem and dot product of two vector quantities, equations were derived for rotary and tilting axes and then written in programming language (Visual C++) for line to line conversion of CL file into machine readable file. For the generation of CL file three different tool paths were generated. First process was the roughing of the area between every two adjacent blades then the next step was to finish the surface of the blades and the leading/trailing edge and the last process was to finish the hub surface of the impeller. The cutting parameters like feed, speed, axial depth of cut, radial depth of cut are dependent on the spindle power of the machine and the type of the material of part to be machined and that of the cutter itself. The selection of the size of the cutting tool used for the machining of each process is also dependant on the minimum area between two adjacent surfaces of the blades of impeller and maximum curvature of the blade from shroud surface to hub surface in order to avoid collision of the cutting tool with the blade surfaces. In the end, how the new approach has benefited is analyzed. The need for research on new approach was very demanding as to manufacture complex profile parts mostly used in aerospace industry with traditional machining approaches causes unpredictable delays due to manual calculations, inaccurate machining results like poor surface finish, tool breakage, etc, as well as requirement of various jigs/fixtures and skilled workers for accomplishing the task all the time. Now by adopting the approach as explored in this research gives a lot of advantages over traditional manufacturing approach. Some important features compared are presented in the tabular form...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of the swept volume of {{a cutting tool}} is es-sential in NC verification algorithms for detecting deficiencies in a proposed tool path, such as gouging, undercutting and interfer-ence. This paper explores a new technique for generating the swept volume of a toroidal endmill, and analyzes the results ob-tained for two test cases. For a given tool location along a path, a curve on the cutting surface of the tool is identified that rs:presents the imprint of the tool on the machined surface. This curve will be designated a space curve as it is defined in 3 D spa. ce. The method relies on forward difference information obtained from a G-code or <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> data <b>file</b> in order to compute the space curves. Once several su. ccessive space curves have been identi-fied, a facetted surface model of the footprint of the tool along a pass may be readily calculated and compared with the design sur-face. The method has b,een verified for two test cases: a) 5 -axis tool path on a hemispherical cavity and b) a 5 -axis tool path on the complex surface of a turbine blade. Results from the new method are compared with the slow, but dependable my- casting technique.

A manufacturing part {{is represented by}} mathematical curves and surfaces. Using the mathematical representation of the manufacturing part, we generate reliable and near optimal tool paths as well as <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> (CL) data <b>file</b> for postprocessing. This algorithm includes two components. First is the forward-step function which determines maximum distance called forward- step between two cutter contact (CC) points with given tolerance.

The selection of cutter parameter and calculation of <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> were put forward. The new efficient machining <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> via the advanced optimization on cutter machining strip width was gained.

The result showed that the efficiency of this method was increased to {{more than three times}} compared to the machining with a ball cutter. In the manufacturing of turbine parts, a blisk is more difficult to machine compared to separated blades, owing to the limited spacing between neighboring blades. To avoid interference between the cutter and blades, additional constraints have to be brought into the tool path generation and into the cutter size selection.

40|$|Five-axis flank milling {{has been}} {{commonly}} used in the manufacturing of complex workpieces because of its greater productivity than that of three-axis or five-axis end milling. The advantage of this milling operation largely depends on effective <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> planning. The finished surface sometimes suffers from large geometrical errors induced by improper tool positioning, due to the non-developability of most ruled surfaces in industrial applications. In addition, a slender flank-milling cutter may be deflected when subjected to large cutting forces during the machining process, further degrading the surface quality or even breaking the cutter. This paper proposes a novel tool path planning scheme to address those problems. A simple but effective algorithm is developed to adaptively allocate a series of <b>cutter</b> <b>locations</b> over the design surface with each one being confined within an angular rotation range. The allocation result satisfies a given constraint of geometrical errors on the finished surface, which consists of the tool positioning errors at each <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> and the sweeping errors between consecutive ones. In addition, a feed rate scheduling algorithm is proposed to maximize the machining efficiency subject to the cutting force constraint and the kinematical constraints of a specific machine configuration. Simulation and experimental tests are conducted to validate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms. Both the machining efficiency and finish surface quality are greatly improved compared with conventional <b>cutter</b> <b>locations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The APT code {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{software}} tools for complex numerically controlled (N/C) machining. APT is an acronym for Automatically Programmed Tool and is used to denote the programming language. Development of the APT language and software system was begun in the late 1950 's as a U. S. government sponsored industry and university research effort. APT is a "problem oriented" language that was developed for the explicit purpose of aiding the N/C machine tools. The original APT program contained undocumented nonstandard FORTRAN, thus making porting of the processor to different operating systems difficult. P-APT (Portable APT) is a revised version of APT that was written to conform to the FORTRAN 77 standard. All machine-dependent code has either been replaced or isolated and documented. Machine-tool instructions and geometry definitions are written in the APT language to constitute a "part program". The APT part program is processed by the P-APT software to produce a <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> (CL) <b>file.</b> This CL file may then be processed by user supplied post processors to convert the CL data into a form suitable for a particular N/C machine tool. This current offering of the P-APT system represents an adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of APT IV/SSX 8. Enhancements include the super pocket feature that allows concave pockets with curved sides and islands. The P-APT system software is organized into two separate programs: the load complex and the APT processor. The load complex handles the table initiation phase and is usually only run when changes to the P-APT processor capabilities are made. This phase initializes character recognition and syntax tables for the P-APT processor by creating FORTRAN block data programs. The P-APT processor consists of four components: the translator, the execution complex, the subroutine library, and the CL editor. The translator examines each APT statement in the part program for recognizable structure and generates a new statement, or series of statements, in an intermediate language. The execution complex processes all of the definition, motion, and related statements to generate <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> coordinates. The subroutine library contains routines defining the algorithms required to process the sequenced list of intermediate language commands generated by the translator. The CL editor re-processes the <b>cutter</b> <b>location</b> coordinates according to user supplied commands to generate a final CL file. The APT language is a statement oriented, sequence dependent language. With the exception of such programming techniques as looping and macros, statements in an APT program are executed in a strict first-to-last sequence. In order to provide programming capability for the broadest possible range of parts and machine tools, APT input (and output) is generalized, as represented by 3 -dimensional geometry and tools, and is arbitrarily uniform, as represented by the moving tool concept and output data in absolute coordinates. P-APT is written in FORTRAN 77 for execution on Sun 4 series computers running SunOS. Although P-APT is written in standard FORTRAN 77 and was designed to be readily portable code, it has only been fully tested on a Sun 4 series computer running SunOs. By making documented modifications to the source code, it may also be ported to a DEC VAX series computer running VMS. P-APT required 3. 1 Mb of RAM for execution. A minimum of 16 Mb of RAM and 32 Mb of disk space used for swap space is recommended. The standard distribution medium for this program is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. P-APT is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product includes the P-APT source code, makefiles, examples, and one set of supporting documentation.

This June, 1989 offering of the APT system represents an adaptation, with enhancements, of the public domain version of APT IV/SSX 8 to the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 for use by the Engineering Services Division of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Enhancements include the super pocket feature which allows concave and convex polygon shapes of up to 40 points including shapes that overlap, that leave islands of material within the pocket, and that have one or more arcs as part of the pocket boundary. Recent modifications to APT include a rework of the POCKET subroutine and correction of an error that prevented the use within a macro of a macro variable cutter move statement combined with macro variable double check surfaces. Former modifications included the expansion of array and buffer sizes to accommodate larger part programs, and the insertion of a few user friendly error messages. The APT system software on the DEC VAX- 11 / 780 is organized into two separate programs: the load complex and the APT processor.
