40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of platinum adsorption on Si (111) - 7 x 7 r surface were studied by using ultra high vacuum {{scanning tunneling microscope}} (UHV-STM). 	 There are three kinds of island structures on Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface. They are single island on terrace, island with hole structure on terrace and the island along at steps. The island at the different position on Si(111) - 7 x 7 is the same structure. The island structure is Pt siliside island (6. 28 x 6. 28). At the different bias, the island structures image by using STM like different structures. Actually, {{they are the same}} structure. We can mark the <b>corner</b> <b>hole</b> position of Si (111) - 7 x 7, the blue point, and then extend to the island structures to calculate the island structures,finally we can sure they are the same island structure and have the same lattice constant. The reason for form the island structure is the Si atoms diffusion from the Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface and Pt atoms interaction. The Si atoms diffusion from the Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface because we anneal let sample at the high temperature break the band,so that the Si atoms diffusion. We compare with order metals, Au and Cu,they all have the same inference. On the disorder area,we can deposit Pt and anneal to form the island structure. And we calculate the island structure on the disorder area by the Si (111) - 7 x 7 lattice constant, they have the same lattice constant. We conclusion so reached the same reason from the Si atom diffuse form the surface, Si atoms diffusion from the Si(111) - 7 x 7 surface because we anneal let sample at the high temperature break the band. 本篇將使用超高真空掃描式穿隧顯微鏡觀察高蒸鍍量的鉑原子蒸鍍在矽(111) 表面上，經由熱處理後形成島狀結構，觀察此島狀結構分析並討論之。 觀察將高蒸鍍量蒸鍍在Si(111) - 7 x 7 重構表面上，經由高溫退火後有三種不同位置類型的島狀結構，分別為(A) 在平台(terries) 上單獨的島狀結構(B) 在平台(terries) 上的島狀結構伴隨著一凹陷結構 (C) 在階梯(step) 邊緣的島狀結構等三種。雖然所聚集形成的位置不一樣，其實島狀結構的內部構造都是相同的，並且我們推論島狀結構的形成，主要是經由擴散的矽原子和蒸鍍上的鉑交互作用產生的島狀結構，擴散形成島狀結構的矽原子來源是高溫環境下，打破了Si(111) - 7 x 7 重構表面的鍵結，使得矽原子擴散了出來。最後我們對所得到的影像做幾何分析與數據統計，可以得到其結構為矽化鉑的島狀結構大小相較於Si- 1 x 1 是 6. 28 x 6. 28 。 我們也把鉑原子蒸鍍到disorder區域上，同樣也觀察到有島狀結構的形成，分析並計算STM的影像中可以發現，disorder區域上的島狀結構和Si(111) - 7 x 7 重構表面的島狀結構都具有相同的晶格常數。摘要…………………………………………………………………………………… 6 Abstract……………………………………………………………………………… 7 目錄…………………………………………………………………………………… 8 圖表目錄 …………………………………………………………………………… 9 CHAPTER 1. 序論……………………………………………………………………… 12 CHAPTER 2. 原理……………………………………………………………………… 14 	 2. 1. 掃描式穿隧顯微鏡……………………………………………………… 14 	 2. 2. 穿隧效應………………………………………………………………… 15 2. 3. 取像方法………………………………………………………………… 16 	 2. 4.

40|$|Odors of {{biological}} relevance (e. g. predator odors, sex odors) {{are known to}} effectively influence basic survival needs of rodents such as anti-predatory defensiveness and mating behaviors. Research focused {{on the effects of}} these odors on rats’ behavior mostly includes multi-trial paradigms where animals experience single odor exposures in subsequent, separated experimental sessions. In the present study, we introduce a modification of the olfactory hole-board test that allows studying the effects of different odors on rats’ behavior within single trials. First, we demonstrated that the <b>corner</b> <b>holes</b> of the hole-board were preferentially visited by rats. The placement of different odors under the <b>corner</b> <b>holes</b> changed this hole preference. We showed that holes with carnivore urine samples were avoided, while <b>corner</b> <b>holes</b> with female rat urine samples were preferred. Furthermore, <b>corner</b> <b>holes</b> with urine samples from a carnivore, herbivore and omnivore were differentially visited indicating that rats can discriminate these odors. To test whether anxiolytic treatment specifically modulate the avoidance of carnivore urine holes, we treated rats with buspirone. Buspirone treatment completely abolished the avoidance of carnivore urine holes. Taken together, our findings indicate that the olfactory hole-board test is a valuable tool for measuring avoidance and preference responses to biologically-relevant odors...|$|R

40|$|The {{site-specific}} surface {{interactions and}} film growth mechanisms of adsorption {{of gold and}} of proteinogenic sulfur-containing amino acids, i. e., L-cysteine and L-methionine, on Si(111) 7 × 7 are studied {{for the first time}} by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) at room temperature under ultrahigh vacuum condition. The results are supported with large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction for biomolecule adsorbates, to provide precise modeling of the equilibrium adsorption geometries of adsorbates on a Si 200 H 49 slab used as the model Si(111) 7 × 7 surface. Growth evolution of gold on the 7 × 7 surface is found to follow the Stranski-Krastanov mode, starting with completion of two distinct gold silicide layers to individual gold nanoisland formation. Of special interest is the formation of two-dimensional self-assembled gold silicide honeycomb nanonetwork at 0. 76 monolayer coverage at room temperature. Observed for the first time, this honeycomb nanonetwork is made up of six triangular gold clusters (surrounding each <b>corner</b> <b>hole)</b> interconnected to one another at the dimer rows of the Si(111) 7 × 7 substrate. With the corner holes of the 7 × 7 surface exposed, this novel gold silicide template offers a unique honeycomb network (4 nm in grids size) for surface functionalization and a nanopore pattern (~ 1 nm in pore size) for molecular trapping application. In analogy to common simple aliphatic amino acids, such as glycine and alanine, sulfur-containing aliphatic amino acids, cysteine and methionine, exhibit an “universal” three-stage growth sequence on Si(111) 7 × 7 surface at room temperature under ultra-high vacuum condition. In particular, the biomolecule first anchors to specific dangling bond sites on the 7 × 7 reconstruction via strong short-range covalent bonds (through Si–N and/or Si–S linkages in unidentate and/or bidentate arrangement of cysteine adsorption, and through Si–N linkage in unidentate arrangement of methionine adsorption), forming the interfacial layer (the first adlayer). This is then followed by the formation of a transitional layer (the second adlayer) and finally of a zwitterionic film (multilayer), both of which are driven by intralayer and interlayer hydrogen bonding. XPS study of thermal stabilities of these adlayers indicates that these proteinogenic biomolecules can be used to transform a highly reactive Si(111) 7 × 7 surface to not just a permanent bio-organic surface but also a semi-permanent (or renewable) and a temporary bio-organic surfaces by manipulating the exposure and the post-annealing temperature. Our results on all the adsorbed proteinogenic biomolecules on Si(111) 7 × 7 surface studied to date enable us to construct a reference XPS data table to guide future studies of biofilm growth on reconstructed Si(111) surface. The STM study of adsorbed cysteine on Si(111) 7 × 7 provides strong evidence for coverage-dependent adsorption structures of cysteine, from bidentate to unidentate attachments to self-assembled multimers, which involves formation of intralayer horizontal N⋯H–O hydrogen-bond as reported in our XPS study. In contrast to cysteine adsorption, high-resolution STM imaging demonstrates self-organization of methionine into a novel, stable Y-shaped trimer within a half unit cell on the 7 × 7 surface at room temperature, which is driven by hydrogen bonding among the unattached carboxylic acid groups in a ring configuration. The near-perfect match of the Y-shaped trimer with three-fold symmetry within the half-unit cell represents the first supported “magic-number” molecular cluster reported to date. Our XPS experiments provide the primary experimental evidence for the formation of covalent bond between substrate and adsorbates and the feasibility of the intralayer and interlayer hydrogen bonding mediated dimers. They are also supported by our large-scale ab-initio DFT-D 2 calculations. Using ab-initio DFT-D 2 calculations, we also establish a common trend in the H-bond length among different types of hydrogen bonding (O–H⋯N < O–H⋯O < N–H⋯N < N–H⋯O) for di-molecular structures in the gas phase. Except for the N–H⋯N H-bond due to covalent bonding of the amino group with the surface, this trend can also be applied to biomolecular H-bonding surface interaction. These calculated results and the observed trends can be used to predict the adsorption behavior of larger biochemical materials, such as peptides and proteins. The ultimate goal of the present study is to examine the molecular interaction of these aliphatic amino acids with gold clusters and other metallic nanostructures supported on the 7 × 7 surface. We have performed preliminary XPS and STM studies on the molecular interactions of cysteine with three distinct gold nanoassemblies on Si(111) 7 × 7, including Au monomers and dimers, Au silicide honeycomb nanonetwork, and Au nanocrystallite film. These studies show unidentate and/or bidentate bonding arrangement of adsorbed cysteine with rather minor perturbation due to the presence of the supported Au monomers and dimers. On the Au silicide honeycomb nanonetwork, we observe the coexistence of two chemisorption states, involving unidentate adspecies through the thiol group interaction with Au atoms and of the amino group with Si atoms. Cysteine is found to chemisorb via the sulfur in neutral form on the supported Au nanocrystallite film to form the interfacial layer. These STM/XPS studies are reinforcing our hypothesis that the novel gold silicide honeycomb nanonetwork offers a number of interesting potential applications for molecular trapping and biofunctionalization...|$|E

On this surface, it became possible to investigate the influence of the down step edges on the formation of the 7 · 7 reconstruction because the influence of the upper step edge, which is located at {{the other side of the}} terrace, did not reach to the down step edge. A considerable decrease in the existence probability of the 7 · 7 reconstruction was observed near the down step edges. This decrease cannot explained by electromigration and steps advancement caused by the difference in adatom density between the 7 · 7 and disordered structure.

Without the H atoms on the Si surface, we observe that the charge accumulates around the Ag atom, and strongly depletes around the Si adatom, rest atom {{and the third}} adjacent Si atom at the second layer (not in the plane) when Ag adsorbs at H 3 sites on Si(111)- 7 × 7 (see in Fig. 4 c). These Ag–Si bonds caused by nearly absolute charge diversion are considered as an electrovalent-like bond. However, when Ag adsorbs on the most stable site (S), the charge depletes around Ag atom and transfer toward the Si rest atom and the Si atom at the second layer. It is surprising to find {{that there is no}} influence on the charge density around the Si adatom (see in Fig. 4 d). Brommer et al.

40|$|The {{durability}} of powder metallurgy nickel base superalloys employed as compressor and turbine disks is often limited by {{low cycle fatigue}} (LCF) crack initiation and crack growth from highly stressed surface locations (<b>corners,</b> <b>holes,</b> etc.). Crack growth induced by dwells at high stresses during aerospace engine operation can be particularly severe. Supersolvus solution heat treatments {{can be used to}} produce coarse grain sizes approaching ASTM 6 for improved resistance to dwell fatigue crack growth. However, the coarse grain sizes reduce yield strength, which can lower LCF initiation life. These high temperature heat treatments also can encourage pores to form. In the advanced General Electric disk superalloy KM 4, such pores can initiate fatigue cracks that limit LCF initiation life. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) during the supersolvus solution heat treatment has been shown to improve LCF initiation life in KM 4, as the HIP pressure minimizes formation of the pores. Reduction of boron levels in KM 4 has also been shown to increase LCF initiation life after a conventional supersolvus heat treatment, again possibly due to effects on the formation tendencies of these pores. However, the effects of reduced boron levels on microstructure, pore characteristics, and LCF failure modes in KM 4 still need to be fully quantified. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of boron level on the microstructure, porosity, LCF behavior, and failure modes of supersolvus heat treated KM 4...|$|R
