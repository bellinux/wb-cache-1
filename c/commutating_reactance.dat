40|$|Abstract: A {{useful and}} {{systematic}} dynamic {{model of a}} battery energy storage system (BES) is devel-oped for a large-scale power system stability study. The model takes into account converter equivalent circuits, battery characteristics and internal losses. Both charging mode and dis-charging mode are presented. The model is expressed in equivalent transfer function blocks, {{and it can be}} easily used in dynamic stability analysis of a power system. To examine the dynamic behaviour of the model, applications to the damping of turbogenerator torsional oscil-lations are performed. Active and reactive power modulation by the BES can be controlled accord-ing to system requirements. Eigenvalue analysis and dynamic simulations are performed to demonstrate the damping effect of the BES.

40|$|Abstract: A dynamic {{modeling}} of thyristor rectifier which {{is useful for}} the study of power electronics controlled rectifiers with the help of using MATLAB and SIMULINK is presented in this paper. This dynamic model is very simple, fast and effective simulation method for the output variables of thyristor rectifiers. The rectifier output voltage static and dynamic variables behavior are represented by an accurate non linear function of the pulse number (p), trigger angle control voltage (�) and displacement angle (�). And also it allows the study in open and closed loop thyristor rectifier simulation of loads which are fed by high power thyristor rectifiers with any pulse number greater than one (�> �) or their association by solving only the differential equation(s) of the load(s). The simulation time is always small and independent of the pulse number. This paper gives an approach to establish a general pulse(�> �) thyristor rectifier dynamic model which is based on the steady state rectifier behavior and corrected to accurately represent its dynamic transients. In this paper we considered only null <b>commutating</b> <b>reactances</b> having instantaneous switching, no conduction loss and zero overlap angle...|$|R
