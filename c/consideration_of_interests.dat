25|$|Singer's Practical Ethics (1979) {{analyzes}} {{why and how}} living beings' interests {{should be}} weighed. His principle of equal <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> does not dictate equal treatment of all those with interests, since different interests warrant different treatment. All {{have an interest in}} avoiding pain, for instance, but relatively few have an interest in cultivating their abilities. Not only does his principle justify different treatment for different interests, but it allows different treatment for the same interest when diminishing marginal utility is a factor. For example, this approach would privilege a starving person's interest in food over the same interest of someone who is only slightly hungry.|$|E

The {{article is}} devoted to the problem <b>of</b> {{cognitive}} <b>interest.</b> The theoretical aspect of the categories <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and cognitive interest, scientific approaches to determination of these concepts are considered. Today there are two lines of interpretation of the concept <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> One <b>of</b> them is based on <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> as attitude. Another line is based on <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> as the need transformed into behavior motive. Motivation essence <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> is traditionally considered as the basis for efficient educational and cognitive activities. Despite of great amount of researches on cognitive interest, its concept needs further investigation. This fact speaks for the article subject-matter to be topical. A variety of interpretations requires the clearing up of the concept <b>of</b> cognitive <b>interest.</b> For this purpose content-analysis and modeling methods are applied. Different scientific approaches are described to study the psychological mechanism for the development <b>of</b> cognitive <b>interest.</b> Own determinations are suggested for interest / cognitive interest. The psychological & linguistic aspect of the development <b>of</b> cognitive <b>interests,</b> their classification and importance for personality development and education process are described. The model <b>of</b> personality <b>interests</b> and the model o f cognitive interest development are presented...|$|R
2500|$|On the {{strength}} of his review, The New York Review of Books took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject, published in 1975 as Animal Liberation, now one of the animal rights movement's canonical texts. Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism – the view, in its simplest form, that an act is right if it leads to the [...] "greatest happiness of the greatest number", a phrase first used in 1776 by Jeremy Bentham. He argued in favor of the equal <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests,</b> the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a human—for example, an interest in not suffering—is different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore a simple but {{profound}} question. How should our legal system deal with the claims of animals for protection against harms inflicted by humans? Rather than a comparative rights analysis as used by some writers, this article will use the non-comparative approach based upon an interest analysis. The short answer is that our legal system can and should do what it always has done, balance the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> competing individuals in a public policy context, always seeking to strike an ethically appropriate balance. It will be shown that the legislative branch of our government presently promotes the <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>interests</b> on this basis. This article examines how the legal system presently balance such interests and how common law judges could expand, in a forthright manner, the <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> an animal’s <b>interests.</b> Finally, this article will suggest a more expansive <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> animals’ <b>interests</b> through {{the adoption of a}} new tort: the intentional interference with a fundamental <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> a non-human animal...|$|R

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} some {{of the ways in which}} {{political}} participation and the principle of equal advancement and <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> might come into conflict. The principle of equal advancement and <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> is considered by some, most notably Thomas Christiano, to be the guiding principle and the strongest normative justification for liberal democracy. Political participation is usually understood to be a constitutive element of this principle; however there might be times when the two could come into conflict. This paper argues that while political participation has a critical value in a liberal democracy and should be guaranteed and promoted, it should yield when it comes into conflict with the equal advancement and <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Also, this paper considers the definition of political participation itself. An activity should be considered a form of active political participation if it is a genuine attempt to assist in advancing the interests of a group or individual in the public sphere. From this, a taxonomy of various forms of political participation is created, where forms of active political participation are classified as expressive, policy, and supportive forms of political participation. This paper argues that this taxonomy is an improvement over previous taxonomies of political participation, most notably the one provided by Inglehart and Barnes, and allows us to make a better assessment of the state of civic engagement in liberal democracies today...|$|E

His theory says that animals have their own interests, just like humans, because they are able to feel pleasure and pain. On the basis of this assumption he recurs to the principle of equal <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests.</b> Nevertheless this principle applies only to animals and human beings. However, modern research proves that humans and animals are not the only sentient beings on the Earth. Plants are not simply passive things in vegetative state. According to the current research, plants are active individuals who communicate with each other, have their own system of self-defence and basically their own way of life. In accordance with this new scientific knowledge we should include plants into the application of the principle of equal <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>interests</b> that is if we do not want to be proponents of species superiority...|$|E
