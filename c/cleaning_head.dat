50|$|A {{hydraulically}} activated pig {{consists of}} three units (Fig. 3): a brake unit, a seal unit and the <b>cleaning</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{units have}} {{openings}} {{that allow the}} entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The brake unit ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following seal unit, which channels it into the openings of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>head.</b> The seal unit and <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the cleaning head's nozzles, creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulically {{activated}} pigs apply {{high pressure}} liquid jets either supplied by high pressure hoses (depended) or made {{available by the}} kinetic energy locally available. Depended hydraulically activated pigs are limited in reach due to the hose which needs to be inserted into the pipeline and guides the <b>cleaning</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hydraulically {{activated}} pipeline pigging (HAPP) is a pigging technology {{applied for}} pipeline cleaning. The basic principle {{is that a}} pressure drop is created over a by-passable pig held back against a pipeline's fluid flow. The pipeline fluid passing through the pigs <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> is accelerated by this pressure drop, forming strong cleaning jets. These jets are directed onto the inner wall {{in front of the}} pig, removing all kinds of deposits.|$|E

50|$|Upright vacuum {{cleaners}} are {{popular in the}} United States, Britain and numerous Commonwealth countries, but very unusual in Continental Europe. They {{take the form of}} a <b>cleaning</b> <b>head,</b> onto which a handle and bag are attached. Upright designs generally employ a rotating brushroll or beater bar, which removes dirt through a combination of sweeping and vibration. There are two types of upright vacuums; dirty-air/direct fan (found mostly on commercial vacuums), or clean-air/fan-bypass (found on most of today's domestic vacuums).|$|E
50|$|The {{brake unit}} {{ensures that the}} travel speed of the pig is much slower than the fluid velocity, thus {{allowing}} it to entirely remove deposits from the pipe wall before it travels across the cleaned surface. The deposits removed are immediately flushed down the pipeline with the main jet of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> which is directed {{to the middle of}} the pipeline. With all deposits removed from the pipe wall and transported downstream by the fluid flow there remains no risk of the pig getting stuck in debris accumulated in front of it.|$|E

50|$|Central vacuum cleaners, {{also known}} as {{built-in}} or ducted, are a type of canister/cylinder model which has the motor and dirt filtration unit located in a central location in a building, and connected by pipes to fixed vacuum inlets installed throughout the building. Only the hose and <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> need be carried from room to room, and the hose is commonly 8 m (25 ft) long, allowing a large range of movement without changing vacuum inlets. Plastic or metal piping connects the inlets to the central unit. The vacuum head may be unpowered, or have beaters operated by an electric motor or by an air-driven turbine.|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{cleaning}} is {{a classic}} application of water jets technology. In the late 1950 s, when reliable high pressure pumps were built, the usage of water jets spread widely {{in the field of}} pipes and sewerage cleaning. In our particular case, water jets using pressure between 100 and 200 bars are being used. The operational behaviour of these systems is dependent on the process parameters, which can vary, causing variations in the impact force. The experiment consists in the research method used {{in the study of the}} impact forces that occur in the sewerage <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> system. To determine the influence process parameters have on impact forces, the full factorial method was used. In order to measure the impact forces between the water jet and a flat and rigid surface, a stand was designed and built for generating pressure water jets, as well as a device to measure the impact forces...|$|E
40|$|The dry-ice sublimation-impulse {{cleaning}} (DIC) technique using a two component ring jet {{has been}} proven as a highly efficient cleaning process for niobium and copper surfaces. The liquid carbon dioxide flows through a ring-type nozzle assembled in a purpose-built <b>cleaning</b> <b>head,</b> expands to form a dry-ice / gas mixture and is accelerated by the surrounding nitrogen. A set-up for the HORIZONTAL cleaning of single-cell niobium cavities has been successfully commissioned during the last years. A preliminary parameter set for effective final cleaning is established. Several cavities have been cleaned and tested without any detectable field emission up to 36 MV/m. As application of the DIC technique might result in additional cleaning potential for accelerator structures, {{an extension of the}} set-up and testing of nine-cell cavities is planned until mid of 2008. Furthermore, DIC was applied to the copper injector "gun " cavity for TTF/FLASH [1] recently. In order to reduce the dark current of the gun cavity, a vertical cleaning setup was developed and tested...|$|E

40|$|Present grit {{blasting}} technology for hull cleaning is very pollutant, environmentally unaffordable, {{and it is}} progressively forbidden in the most environmental countries (mainly north of Europe). At the time being, the above methodology has been partially substituted by ultra highpressure water blasting, however they do not show as good performance as the {{grit blasting}} systems. This paper describes a service robot for hull blasting. The technology we developed consists of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>head,</b> the robot body, the remote control unit and the teleoperation platform. This solution allows a reliable and cost effective operation regarding hull grit blasting, obtaining a high quality surface preparation (SA 2 ½) together with a dramatic reduction of waste and zero emissions to environment.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the accelerated ageing of commercially available silvered polymer film by contact cleaning using brushes {{and water in}} the presence of soiling created by dust and sand particles. These conditions represent cleaning regimes in real concentrating solar power (CSP) solar fields in arid environments, where contact cleaning using brushes and water is often required to clean the reflecting surfaces. Whilst suitable for glass reflectors, this paper discusses the effects of these established cleaning processes on the optical and visual characteristics of polymer film surfaces, and then {{describes the}} development of a more benign but effective contact cleaning process for cleaning polymer reflectors. The effects of a range of cleaning brushes are discussed, with and without the presence of water, {{in the presence of}} sand and dust particles from selected representative locations. The experiments were repeated using different experimental equipment at Plataforma Solar de Almería (PSA) in Spain and Cranfield University in the UK. The results highlight differences that are attributable to the experimental methods used. Reflectance measurements and visual inspection show that a soft cleaning brush {{with a small amount of}} water, used in a <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> with both linear and rotational motion, can clean polymer film reflecting surfaces without inflicting surface damage or reducing specular reflectance...|$|E
40|$|The Liquid Waste Technology Development {{organization}} is investigating technologies to support closure of radioactive waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank closure includes {{removal of the}} wastes that have propagated to the tank annulus. Although amounts and types of residual waste materials in the annuli of SRS tanks vary, simple salt deposits are predominant on tanks with known leak sites. This task focused on developing and demonstrating a technology to inspect and spot clean salt deposits from the outer primary tank wall located in the annulus of an SRS Type I tank. The Robotics, Remote and Specialty Equipment (RRSE) and Materials Science and Technology (MS&T) Sections of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) collaborated to modify and equip a Force Institute magnetic wall crawler with the tools necessary to demonstrate the inspection and spot cleaning in a mock-up of a Type I tank annulus. A remote control camera arm and <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> were developed, fabricated and mounted on the crawler. The crawler was then tested and demonstrated on a salt simulant also developed in this task. The demonstration showed that the camera is capable of being deployed in all specified locations and provided the views needed for the planned inspection. It also showed that the salt simulant readily dissolves with water. The crawler features two different techniques for delivering water to dissolve the salt deposits. Both water spay nozzles were able to dissolve the simulated salt, one is more controllable and the other delivers a larger water volume. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>head</b> also includes a rotary brush to mechanically remove the simulated salt nodules in the event insoluble material is encountered. The rotary brush proved {{to be effective in}} removing the salt nodules, although some fine tuning may be required to achieve the best results. This report describes the design process for developing technology to add features to a commercial wall crawler and the results of the demonstration testing performed on the integrated system. The crawler was modified to address the two primary objectives of the task (inspection and spot cleaning). SRNL recommends this technology as a viable option for annulus inspection and salt removal in tanks with minimal salt deposits (such as Tanks 5 and 6.) This report further recommends that the technology be prepared for field deployment by: (1) developing an improved mounting system for the magnetic idler wheel, (2) improving the robustness of the cleaning tool mounting, (3) resolving the nozzle selection valve connections, (4) determining alternatives for the brush and bristle assembly, and (5) adding a protective housing around the motors to shield them from water splash. In addition, SRNL suggests further technology development to address annulus cleaning issues that are apparent on other tanks that will also require salt removal in the future such as: (1) Developing a duct drilling device to facilitate dissolving salt inside ventilation ducts and draining the solution out the bottom of the ducts. (2) Investigating technologies to inspect inside the vertical annulus ventilation duct...|$|E
