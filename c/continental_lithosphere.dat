40|$|Large-scale folding {{is a key}} {{mechanism}} of lithospheric deformation and has been described {{in many parts of}} the Earth, both for the <b>continental</b> and oceanic <b>lithospheres.</b> Some aspects of this process such as the presence of coupling/decoupling between the crustal deformation and the mantle lithosphere, or between different lithospheres, make it necessary to accurately control the periodic characteristics of the elevation and of the gravity signal. 1 D spectral analysis of gravity and topography profiles is sensitive to a series of factors: the location, length and orientation of the profiles, as well as the number of samples taken. We carry out a systematic analysis of the periodicities in the topography and gravity, both 1 D and 2 D, along the western border of the Africa-Eurasia plate tectonic boundary. We analyze the sensitivity of the 1 D and 2 D spectral analysis in order to compare the results along a plate boundary where oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres</b> are in contact with different tectonic, kinematic and rheological aspects.

40|$|International audienceDeep crustal and mantle {{rocks are}} exhumed in core complex mode of {{extension}} in {{three types of}} structures: metamorphic core complexes, oceanic core complexes and magma poor passive margins. Using available analogue and numerical models and their comparison with natural examples, the present paper reviews the mechanical processes involved in these different types of extensional setting. Three main aspects are considered: i) the primary role of lithosphere rheology, ii) the lithosphere-scale patterns of progressive deformation {{that lead to the}} exhumation of deep metamorphic or mantle rocks and iii) the initiation and development of detachment zones. Crustal core complexes develop in <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres</b> whose Moho temperature is higher than 750 °C with “upper crust-dominated” strength profiles. Contrary to what is commonly believed, it is argued from analogue and numerical models that detachments that accommodate exhumation of core complexes do not initiate at the onset of extension but in the course of progressive extension when the exhuming ductile crust reaches the surface. In models, convex upward detachments result from a rolling hinge process. Mantle core complexes develop in either the oceanic lithosphere, at slow and ultra-slow spreading ridges, or in <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres,</b> whose initial Moho temperature is lower than 750 °C, with “sub-Moho mantle-dominated” strength profiles. It is argued that the mechanism of mantle exhumation at passive margins is a nearly symmetrical necking process at lithosphere scale without major and permanent detachment, except if strong strain localization could occur in the lithosphere mantle. Distributed crustal extension, by upper crust faulting above a décollement along the ductile crust increases toward the rift axis up to crustal breakup.

25|$|According to {{the plume}} model, {{the source of}} Icelandic {{volcanism}} lies deep beneath {{the center of the}} island. The earliest volcanic rocks attributed to the plume are found {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Their ages have been determined to lie between 58 and 64 million years. This coincides with the opening of the north Atlantic in the late Paleocene and early Eocene, which has led to suggestions that the arrival of the plume was linked to, and has perhaps contributed to, the breakup of the North Atlantic continent. In the framework of the plume hypothesis, the volcanism was caused by the flow of hot plume material initially beneath thick <b>continental</b> <b>lithosphere</b> and then beneath the lithosphere of the growing ocean basin as rifting proceeded. The exact position of the plume at that time is a matter of disagreement between scientists, as is whether the plume is thought to have ascended from the deep mantle only at that time or whether it is much older and also responsible for the old volcanism in northern Greenland, on Ellesmere Island, and at Alpha Ridge in the Arctic.|$|E

2500|$|Tectonic {{lithosphere}} plates {{consist of}} lithospheric mantle overlain {{by one or}} two types of crustal material: oceanic crust (in older texts called sima from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (sial from silicon and aluminium). Average oceanic lithosphere is typically [...] thick; its thickness {{is a function of}} its age: as time passes, it conductively cools and subjacent cooling mantle is added to its base. Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid-ocean ridge where it was formed. For a typical distance that oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted, the thickness varies from about [...] thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than [...] at subduction zones; for shorter or longer distances, the subduction zone (and therefore also the mean) thickness becomes smaller or larger, respectively. <b>Continental</b> <b>lithosphere</b> is typically about 200km thick, though this varies considerably between basins, mountain ranges, and stable cratonic interiors of continents.|$|E
2500|$|Where plate {{boundaries}} {{occur within}} the <b>continental</b> <b>lithosphere,</b> deformation is {{spread out over}} a much larger area than the plate boundary itself. In {{the case of the}} San Andreas fault continental transform, many earthquakes occur away from the plate boundary and are related to strains developed within the broader zone of deformation caused by major irregularities in the fault trace (e.g., the [...] "Big bend" [...] region). The Northridge earthquake was associated with movement on a blind thrust within such a zone. Another example is the strongly oblique convergent plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates where it runs through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains. The deformation associated with this plate boundary is partitioned into nearly pure thrust sense movements perpendicular to the boundary over a wide zone to the southwest and nearly pure strike-slip motion along the Main Recent Fault close to the actual plate boundary itself. This is demonstrated by earthquake focal mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|If the Earth's crust was {{expanding}} {{along the}} oceanic ridges, Hess and Dietz reasoned like Holmes and others before them, {{it must be}} shrinking elsewhere. Hess followed Heezen, suggesting that new oceanic crust continuously spreads away from the ridges in a conveyor belt–like motion. And, using the mobilistic concepts developed before, he correctly concluded that many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches – very deep, narrow canyons – are formed, e.g. along {{the rim of the}} Pacific Ocean basin. The important step Hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process, arriving at the same conclusions as Holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using Heezen's mechanism of spreading along the ridges. Hess therefore concluded that the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking. As old oceanic crust is [...] "consumed" [...] in the trenches (like Holmes and others, he thought this was done by thickening of the <b>continental</b> <b>lithosphere,</b> not, as now understood, by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle), new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins are perpetually being [...] "recycled," [...] with the creation of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously. Thus, the new mobilistic concepts neatly explained why the Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading, why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks.|$|E

The tomographic images also allow us to trace the boundary between the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian plates at Moho depth, revealing some tears in the Adriatic-Ionian subducting lithosphere. The complex lithospheric structure described by this study is the result of a long evolution; the heterogeneities of continental margins, lithospheric underthrusting, and plate indentation have led to subduction variations, slab tears, and asthenospheric upwelling at the present day.

30|$|Our seismic data confirm that, {{unlike the}} {{southern}} Okinawa Trough, the faulting {{style in the}} northern Okinawa Trough is significantly asymmetric (e.g., eastward dipping normal faults shown in Fig.  8). It is generally known that such deformation style and faulting pattern in a rift basin vary depending on several parameters, such as the strength and thermal structure of the plate and the extension rate (e.g., Ruppel 1995). Gungor et al. (2012) argue that the subduction of the thick Amami Plateau at the northern Ryukyu Trench plays a primary role for the diffuse rifting in the northern Okinawa Trough by producing a local disturbance in speed of the trench rollback and the resultant back-arc rifting rate. As another effect, we here {{point out that the}} lithosphere consisting of the northern Ryukyu arc and the northern Okinawa Trough is probably hotter and weaker than typical <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres</b> due to the active upwelling of magma from the subducting slab (Wang et al. 2008). Within such a hot and weak plate, extensional strain tends to be delocalized and a broad deformation zone is formed more easily (Buck et al. 1999). We also note that the rifting rate decreases as it goes northeastward along the Okinawa Trough and the current extension is thought to occur at a slow rate of 22  mm/year around the study area (Argus et al. 2011). If this slow rate has been persistent over the rifting history, it also contributes to forming a diffuse basin (Huismans and Beaumont 2003).|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} issues of the {{evolution}} of <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres</b> is the detachment of the lithospheric mantle that may occur under certain conditions {{and its impact on the}} surface. In order to investigate the dynamics of continental delamination, we performed a parametric study using physically scaled laboratory models. The adopted setup is composed of a three-layers visco-elastic body (analog for upper crust, lower crust, lithospheric mantle) locally thickened/thinned to simulate a density anomaly (lithospheric root) and an adjacent weak zone, lying on a low viscosity material simulating the asthenosphere. The results emphasize the interplay between mantle flow, deformation, surface topography and plate motion during a three-phases process: (1) a slow initiation phase controlled by coupling and bending associated with contraction and dynamic subsidence, (2) lateral propagation of the delamination alongside with extension and a complex topographic signal controlled by coupling and buoyancy, while poloidal mantle flow develops around the tip of the delaminating lithospheric mantle, and (3) a late phase characterized by a counterflow that triggers retroward motion of the whole model. A semiquantitative study allows us to determine empirically two parameters: (1) an initiation parameter that constrains the propensity of the delamination to occur and correlates with the duration of the first stage, (2) a buoyancy parameter characterizing the delamination velocity during late stages and therefore its propensity to cease. Finally, we point out similarities and differences with the Sierra Nevada (California, USA) in terms of topography, deformation and timing of delamination.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} geodynamic {{concepts}} and models related to transform continental margins, and their implications {{on the structure}} of these margins. Simple kinematic models of transform faulting associated with continental rifting and oceanic accretion allow to define three successive stages of evolution, including intra-continental transform faulting, active transform margin, and passive transform margin. Each part of the transform margin experiences these three stages, but the evolution is diachronous along the margin. Both the duration of each stage and the cumulated strike-slip deformation increase from one extremity of the margin (inner corner) to the other (outer corner). Initiation of transform faulting is related to the obliquity between the trend of the lithospheric deformed zone and the relative displacement of the lithospheric plates involved in divergence. In this oblique setting, alternating transform and divergent plate boundaries correspond to spatial partitioning of the deformation. Both obliquity and the timing of partitioning influence the shape of transform margins. Oblique margin can be defined when oblique rifting is followed by oblique oceanic accretion. In this case, no transform margin should exist in the prolongation of the oceanic fracture zones. Vertical displacements along transform margins were mainly studied to explain the formation of marginal ridges. Numerous models were proposed, one of the most used is being based on thermal exchanges between the oceanic and the <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres</b> across the transform fault. But this model is compatible neither with numerical computation including flexural behavior of the lithosphere nor with timing of vertical displacements and the lack of heating related to the passing of the oceanic accretion axis as recorded by the Côte d'Ivoire-Ghana marginal ridge. Enhanced models are still needed. They should better take into account the erosion on the continental slope, and the level of coupling of the transform continental margin with the adjacent oceanic lithosphere...|$|R

Pioneer work has recently boosted interest in fractal analysis for quantifying and correlating patterns. Fractal-like patterns relate to a degree of multiscale organization, and fractal dimensions (FD) and their potential variations {{can be used to}} infer the physical conditions of rock formation at various scales of observation. Here, we characterize quantitatively the shape and distribution of orthopyroxene grains in ultramafic xenoliths in terms of FD and their relation with temperature of equilibration. Fractal analysis has been applied to several populations of mantle xenoliths: 7 xenoliths collected in the vicinity of Pico Santa Isabel on Bioko Island, an alkaline basaltic volcano in oceanic domain (Gulf of Guinea, Equatorial Atlantic), 9 samples from Sangilen, in the Agardag alkaline lamprophyre dyke (Russia), and 11 samples form Śnieżnik (Lutynia, Poland), in the continental domain. Fractal analysis has been conducted to characterize the degree of complexity of the petrographic textures: it is indeed known that large values of FD are associated to more complex textures. The correlation here observed between the orthopyroxene fractal dimension and the temperature of equilibration suggests that FD captures a significant textural feature directly related to the temperature (i. e. generated by a temperature-controlled process). The significant difference in the FD–T correlation observed for the continental and oceanic mantle domains suggests that the mechanical and rheological behaviour is distinct in the oceanic and <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres.</b> These first promising results should be confirmed by analysing other mantle suites of rocks in different geodynamic settings.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Aleutian islands earthquake of 1946 and the Sanriku earthquake of 1896 is studied {{on the basis of}} the data on seismic waves from 5 to 100 s and on tsunamis. These earthquakes generated, despite their relatively small earthquake magnitude, two of the largest and most widespread tsunamis in history. The data obtained at different periods are interpreted in terms of the effective moment, M_e. The effective moment at a certain period is defined as a seismic moment of a virtual step function dislocation that explains the observation at this period. The effective moment of the tsunami earthquakes increases rapidly towards 0. 5 to 1. 0 × 10 ^(29) dyne · cm as the period increases while, for ordinary earthquakes, it is more or less constant. This dependence can be explained in terms of a source deformation having a time constant of about 100 s. The M_c versus ƒ (frequency) diagram provides a diagnostic method of estimating the tsunami potential of earthquakes. If the M_e - ƒ diagram for an earthquake has a steep upgrade towards low frequency implying an effective moment exceeding 10 ^(28) dyne · cm at zero frequency, the earthquake has a high tsunami potential. Since the determination of the effective moment at various periods can be made by a simple procedure, this method could be incorporated in the tsunami warning system. The abnormal slow deformation at the source of the tsunami earthquakes may be a manifestation of viscoelasticity of a weak zone beneath the inner margin of the trenches. The weak zone which is implied by large normal-fault earthquakes such as the 1933 Sanriku and the 1929 Aleutian islands earthquakes may be a result of frictional heating at the interface between the oceanic and the <b>continental</b> <b>lithospheres...</b>|$|R
