Throughout his career, comparisons have been made between him and Kevin Garnett due to their similar style of play and physique.|$|E

These missions resemble the use of a sniper rifle during normal missions but the player cannot switch to a third-person view.|$|E

In this episode, Scully, Doggett, and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) discover several returned alien abductees. Doggett <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> another agent, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), to assist the case.

5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal {{that if he}} can feel {{compassion}} for Amfortas, then {{he should be able}} to feel it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> the earth to swallow him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems to borrow {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E

In response to international <b>calls,</b> <b>on</b> 24 October Jibril announced that a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert. Seeking vengeance for the killing, Gaddafist sympathizers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi, Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Raymond grows {{furious with}} Rusty's {{handling}} of the case, but admits that he had also been romantically involved with Carolyn at one time. Rusty <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> Sandy Stern, a top defense attorney. At trial, it is revealed that the beer glass is missing, and Stern persuades Judge Larren Lyttle to keep this from the jury. Raymond testifies and perjures himself, claiming that Rusty insisted on handling the investigation, thus confirming the defense's claim of a frame-up. Rusty discovers that Carolyn had acquired a file for a bribery case involving a man named Leon Wells. Upon being confronted by Rusty and Lipranzer, Wells confesses that he paid Judge Lyttle $1,500 to have criminal charges against him dropped, with Carolyn acting as a facilitator.|$|E

5|$|The Edict on Maximum Prices (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} {{two to three}} months after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone. In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.|$|E
5|$|During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but {{he barely}} {{acknowledges}} their acquaintance. Marianne later learns {{that he is}} engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, {{but he had to}} marry a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually falling in love with Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several <b>calls</b> <b>on</b> its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E
