40|$|MM - P&DMCitizen {{participation}} in the budgetary processes in Malawi {{can be traced back}} to the PRSP era in the 1990 s. This provided a window of opportunity for citizens through civil society organisations to get involved in issues of economic governance. The purpose of this study was to investigate, explore and analyse citizen {{participation in}} the budgetary in Malawi. Using qualitative research methodologies, the study interviewed a number of key informants. One of the main findings of the study is that there is some participation of citizens in budget processes for instance through the pre budget <b>consultative</b> <b>meetings.</b> However, it was found that there is room for improvement on the way the pre budget <b>consultative</b> <b>meetings</b> are conducted. Other possibilities for enhancing participation include using members of parliament and operationalising the decentralisation initiative. The study concludes that citizen participation in budgetary process in Malawi remains weak and recommends a number of ways to enhance participation These recommendations include capacitating civil society organisations to enhance their advocacy role and their linkages with the grassroots. The study recommends that the Consolidated Budget Calendar as developed by the Ministry of Finance should be given a binding status, and be popularised. The pre- budget <b>consultative</b> <b>meetings</b> should be improved so that the power balance should not be tilting to the Ministry of Finance...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{traditional and}} {{new forms of}} citizen participation at the local level. The traditional forms of citizen participation are referendum, citizens’ initiative, deliberative assemblies, sub-municipal governance, and occasional <b>consultative</b> <b>meetings.</b> The main new forms are introduction of the direct election of mayors and recall referendum, strengthening the role of local mayors, and independent actors in local politics. Special attention is devoted to comparative situation with sub-municipal governments. Five modes of fostering local democracy in Croatia are analysed: minority representation, classic forms of direct democracy, direct election of mayors and recall procedure, youth councils, and independent local political actors. Data from 2014 research show that citizens’ initiative, referendum, and <b>consultative</b> <b>meetings</b> are not frequently used participatory mechanisms in Croatia. Sub-municipal governments have not been established in one third of local units, indicating their smallness and – probably – {{the low level of}} decentralization in Croatia...|$|R
