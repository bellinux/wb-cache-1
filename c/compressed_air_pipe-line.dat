40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.

40|$|Air {{compressors}} are {{a significant}} industrial energy user. Based on a survey (conducted by Oregon State University and the Bonneville Power Administration) of energy audit reports from 125 plants, air compressors account for roughly 10 % of total plant energy use. Furthermore, air compression is inefficient with up to 95 % of compressor power dissipated as heat. Thus even minor improvements in system operation, control strategies, and efficiency can yield large energy savings and significant non-energy or productivity benefits from reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> is often called the ""fourth utility"" in industrial facilities after electricity, natural gas, and water. It provides motive power for machinery, cooling, materials handling, and hand tools. It is a safe, flexible, and powerful resource, but one that is seldom run for low operating costs or best productivity. Learning the basics of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems represents the beginning of both reducing energy costs and enjoying the productive benefits of reliable <b>compressed</b> <b>air.</b> <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> management systems, including a system approach to managing demand, stabilizing pressure, reducing leaks and compressor controls, can allow the industrial end user to save 20 % - 50 % of their air compressor electricity usage. The monitoring capabilities of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> management systems provide a useful tool through power, pressure and flow trending to maintain both the energy savings and increased system reliability. More efficiently managed <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> systems are less costly to maintain and have less impact on the environment.

40|$|<b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{is a low}} {{efficiency}} media, and is thus {{very expensive}} to produce. This thesis work began by mind mapping how to create savings on the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> system at Billerud Skärblacka AB. Certain issues have been chosen for further studies. In order to identify the consumption of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> at PM 8 and 9, several measurements were made. At PM 8 there were not found any pressure drop, only large pressure variations for short periods of time. The causes of these pressure variations were not established. At PM 9 a registered pressure drop of around 1 bar was found. The cause of the pressure drop at PM 9 was not found. A solution for the pressure drop was presented, which also could give an opportunity to reduce the nominal pressure in the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> system.
