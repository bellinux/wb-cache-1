5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded there. This ensured almost <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E

5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents of criticism against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E
5|$|By 1946, Mara {{had given}} over <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> {{of the team}} to his two sons.

The Giants advanced to their eighth championship game in fourteen seasons, where they were beaten by the Sid Luckman led Bears 24–14.|$|E

A divided Court held that the search was not unconstitutional because there was a reasonable law-enforcement need to acquire a warrant, namely, to prevent the potential destruction of evidence within the home.|$|E

Several quarries operated on the mountain, including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company, and the James Cement Company. No one company had <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of the entire mountain.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish coup of July 1936 {{fractured}} the Spanish Republican Armed Forces {{and marked}} the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Following a period of troubles in the Second Spanish Republic, a group of officers attempted to overthrow the left-wing Popular Front government, elected five months previously, in a military coup. Planning started in early 1936, and the coup was launched on 17 and 18 July. The coup failed to take <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of the country and civil war ensued.|$|E
5|$|The network {{largely ignored}} the {{standard}} business model of 1950s TV, {{in which one}} advertiser sponsored an entire show, enabling it to have <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> over its content. Instead, DuMont sold commercials to many different advertisers, freeing producers of its shows from the veto power held by sole sponsors. This eventually became the standard model for US television. Some commercial time was sold regionally on a co-op basis, while other spots were sold network-wide.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have <b>complete</b> <b>control.</b> Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E

5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the set of rules Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E

The Armory, the state's largest location mainstay which houses the Illinois State National Guard, was provided to the studio by the Illinois State Film Commission.

5|$|Benchley {{continued}} to freelance, submitting humor columns {{to a variety}} of publications, including Life (where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley's columns were the only reason the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of the drama section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E
5|$|By noon of 7 August, {{the early}} morning fog had dispersed, and large numbers of Allied {{aircraft}} appeared over the battlefield.

Despite assurances by the Luftwaffe that German forces would have adequate air support, the Allied aircraft quickly achieved <b>complete</b> <b>control</b> of the airspace over Mortain. The Luftwaffe reported that its fighters were engaged by Allied aircraft {{from the moment they}} took off, and were unable even to reach the battlefield.
