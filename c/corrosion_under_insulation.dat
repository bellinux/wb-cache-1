CO 2 corrosion in gas wells temperature can be divided into three regions: A) Temperature below 140 degrees Fahrenheit (C 60) does not protect the product and the level of corrosion caused by severe corrosion exists. B) Above 300 degrees F (C 150), Mgntayt is formed and the environment unless the presence of large amounts of salt water, is slightly corrosive. C) Between 300 - 140 degrees Fahrenheit (C 150 - 60) has the ability to protect the metal carbonate product layer does not even need a deterrent.

40|$|This thesis details a {{non-destructive}} type of tomographic {{technique to}} monitor <b>corrosion</b> <b>under</b> <b>insulation.</b> This method requires a radioactive source, where a detector-source pair {{is mounted on}} a circular gantry located around the periphery of a steel pipe. A radioactive source with an appropriate activity was chosen based on {{the thickness of the}} pipe under test. In order to detect gamma rays, photon scintillation detectors are required. A Thallium-activated Sodium Iodide (NaI(Tl)) detector crystal was used. Stability tests were conducted on the detectors before they were ready to be used. A portable hardware to house the detector and source was then designed and built. The system is able to operate without the need for an outlet socket to enable it to be used in remote locations where power supply may be unavailable. For testing purposes, artificial corrosion defects were created by grinding the surface of the pipeline under the insulation by a minimum of 2 mm in depth and by placing foreign objects (wood splinters and pebbles) under the pipeline insulation. A modified parallel beam sensor geometry was implemented to measure the intensity of the incident beam after passing through the pipeline under test. The Backprojection method of tomogram reconstruction without the need for sensitivity matrices was used. The software written generates three tomograms, which are the ideal pipe tomogram, the tomogram of the pipe under test and the error tomogram which compares the first two tomograms and then highlights in red the suspected <b>corrosion</b> <b>under</b> <b>insulation.</b> The system was able to achieve an average accuracy of 96. 283 % when a comparison was done between actual dimension of the objects under test and the dimension based on the intensity profiles.

40|$|<b>Corrosion</b> <b>under</b> <b>insulation</b> (CUI) is a {{major problem}} for {{petroleum}} and chemical process industries. Historically, there have been limited options for evaluating the presence and extent of CUI. Locating corrosion under wet insulation (CUWI) is of primary importance in the petrochemical industry. Unseen corrosion can lead to the release of process materials and cause costly downtime. Removing insulation and examining the equipment is very effective, but it’s costly and time-consuming. Moisture density gauges (MDG) give good results to trained individuals, but they are cumbersome and slow to work with and require maintaining a radioactive isotope that must have specific licensing and regulatory monitoring.

40|$|<b>Corrosion</b> <b>under</b> <b>insulation</b> (CUI) {{is one of}} {{the serious}} damage {{mechanisms}} experienced by insulated piping systems. Optimizing the inspection schedule for insulated piping systems is a major challenge faced by inspection and corrosion engineers since CUI takes place beneath the insulation which makes the detection and prediction of the damage mechanism harder. In recent years, risk-based inspection (RBI) approach has been adopted to optimize CUI inspection plan. RBI approach is based on risk, a product of the likelihood of a failure and the consequence of such failure. The likelihood analysis usually follows either the qualitative or the semi-qualitative methods, thus precluding it to be used for quantitative risk assessment. This paper presents a framework for estimating quantitatively the likelihood of failure due to CUI based on the type of data available...|$|E
