40|$|Canned {{foods are}} {{increasingly}} used in food packaging. Packaging serves mainly to preserve, inform and sell foodstuffs. In {{order to avoid}} migration issues of chemical compounds from tin cans to foods, covering internal surface of the tin cans with epoxyphenolic and organosol resins is widespread. However, monomers like Bisphenol A Diglycidyl Ether (BADGE), number among the constituents of these resins capable of migrating to foods. This chemical compound (BADGE) is highly toxic {{not only for the}} immune, reproductive and hepatic systems but also for biomolecules such as DNA, nucleic acids, proteins, and hormones. Simulation tests of migration can be used to assess the significance of BADGE migration. For this study, the migration and degradation tests were realized with metallic sheets and <b>cans</b> <b>lacquered</b> with epoxyphenolic or organosol resins.

50|$|While lacquer {{is a hard}} material, it is best {{to first}} prevent damage and loss by {{maintaining}} proper environmental conditions. Lacquer is susceptible to cracks and loose joins from fluctuating temperatures and relative humidity. Extended exposure to light <b>can</b> also cause <b>lacquer</b> to lose its durability. Over exposure can also cause discoloration and loss of lustre. Avoiding exposure to unfiltered daylight and fluorescent lamps can help to prevent this type of damamge. Temperatures should be kept as low and consistent as possible to avoid changes in relative humidity which can cause condensation. Condensation can cause shrinkage and swelling in the wood that he lacquer is applied to.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to health}} risks and {{environmental}} considerations {{involved in the}} use of solvent-based lacquers, much work has gone into the development of water-based lacquers. Such lacquers are considerably less toxic and more environmentally friendly, and in many cases, produce acceptable results. While water-based lacquer's fumes are considerably less hazardous, and it does not have the combustibility issues of solvent based lacquers, the product still dries fairly quickly. Even though its odor is weaker, water-based <b>lacquer</b> <b>can</b> still produce airborne particulates that can get into the lungs, so proper protective wear still needs to be worn. More and more water-based colored lacquers are replacing solvent-based clear and colored lacquers in under hood and interior applications in the automobile and other similar industrial applications.

PUE binders were specially made from Japanese lacquer and epoxy resin, where Japanese lacquer has been traditionally used for bond and paint because it has excellent beauty. Japanese lacquer solidifies with oxygen contained in air's moisture, which has difficulty in making composite, but we improved Japanese lacquer's solidification properties by use of epoxy resin. We made 10 mm thickness composite samples and cut them into toroidal shape to measure permittivity, permeability, and reflection loss in frequencies ranging from 50 Hz to 20 GHz. Electric magnetic absorber's composites synthesized from a PUE binders mixed either with Soot or CNT showed significantly higher wave absorption over - 27 dB than the others at frequencies around 18 GHz, although Japanese lacquer itself doesn’t affect absorption.

40|$|The momentous {{signing of}} the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854 marked the turning point to end Japan’s long {{seclusion}} from the West. Its subsequent ‘opening’ unveiled the refreshingly different aesthetic canon of Japanese art which was enthusiastically hailed by nineteenth century Western artists and designers. As a much sought after commodity, Japanese art was collected in unprecedented quantities throughout Europe, the British Empire and the United States. The mania for things Japanese also reached the far-flung colonies in Australia and New Zealand. This phenomenon, {{referred to in the}} English-speaking world as ‘Mikado Mania’ or the ‘Cult of Japan’, coincided with the establishment of public museums, the proliferation of international exhibitions and ease of global travel. These innovations fostered and facilitated the formation of Japanese art collections internationally. A survey of Australian and New Zealand collections and a particular examination of the Art Gallery of South Australia’s collection formed between the years 1904 - 1940 reveal the circumstances and personalities that shaped the nature and content of the collections. It is argued in this thesis that while nascent colonial public museums and private collectors such as those in South Australia were guided by British tastes, the genesis of which predated the nineteenth century ‘opening’ of Japan, the collecting of Japanese art in nineteenth-century Australia and New Zealand served as a signifier of international discourse and modernity. For Japan, its art became a tool to fend off foreign hegemony. Driven by the slogan bunmei kaika ‘civilisation and enlightenment’, Japan throughout the Meiji era (1868 - 1912) exploited the mania for its art in order to achieve status and recognition as a world power. It will be further argued that the spirit of bunmei kaika also encapsulated the cultural aspirations of the fledgling colonies in Australia and New Zealand which, by the late nineteenth century, were endeavouring to articulate their own ‘civilisation and enlightenment’ within the British Empire. Through their efforts to advance onto the world stage, the Australian colonies played a significant, though unrecognised role in Japan’s experimentation and investment in its self-promotion as a civilised country. The cause and effect of measures undertaken by the Japanese government to achieve bunmei kaika through the applied arts of ceramics, metalware, ivories and <b>lacquer</b> <b>can</b> be directly demonstrated through the very objects collected in South Australia and the other colonies. A study of their intrinsic qualities and provenance provides tangible evidence of Japan’s strategic efforts to advance its national identity through art. It also serves to shed light on the curatorial expertise and connoisseurship being exercised at the time by colonial museums and collectors. Japanese objects acquired during the formative period of Australian and New Zealand museums have long been ignored or dismissed as hybridised and inauthentic. Recently their technological ingenuity and cross-cultural aesthetic have been more generously acknowledged. They are the beacons of Japan’s quest for ‘civilisation and enlightenment’. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Avaliou-se o desempenho de quatro tipos de latas, sendo duas produzidas por tecnologias de soldagem elétrica Soudronic e Conoweld e duas pelo processo convencional (solda Sn/Pb), Com exceção da lata produzida pelo processo Conoweld, que foi fabricada em folha cromada, o {{material}} de embalagem foi a folha-de-flandres. Todas as latas eram envernizadas internamente. O produto estudado foi refrigerante de limão. A vida-de-prateleira do produto nas diversas embalagens foi determinada em teste de estocagem óelo período de seis meses em duas condições de temperatura, 23 ºC e 35 ºC. Os principais parâmetros considerados foram a avaliação visual interna das embalagens, a concentração de ferro e a avaliação organoléptica do produto. Verificou-se que, embora apresentem pequenas diferenças entre si, todos os tipos de latas de folha-de-flandres (soldadas pelo processo convencional e eletricamente) apresentaram um bom desempenho pelos seis meses de estocagem, enquanto a lata em folha cromada soldada eletricamente sofreu um processo de corrosão acentuado, e o produto nela acondicionado atingiu concentrações de ferro acima do admissível (2 ppm aos seis meses de estocagem) entre 90 e 120 dias no armazenamento a 23 ºC e entre 75 e 90 dias no armazenamento a 35 ºC. Para a estocagem a 23 ºC esse foi o tempo estabelecido para a vida-de-prateleira do produto nessa embalagem enquanto para a estocagem a 35 ºC a vida-de-prateleira estabelecida foi entre 62 e 75 dias devido ao sabor metálico percebido na avaliação sensorial. A avaliação sensorial do refrigerante de limão permitiu verificar a ocorrência de deterioração do sabor do produto durante a estocagem, nas duas condições de temperatura, ocorri da no produto acondicionado nos diversas tipos de embalagem metálica e também na garrafa de vidro utilizada como referencia. Em função disso, o fator limitante da vida-de-prateleira do refrigerante de limão nas embalagens em folha-de-flandres foi a alteração organoléptica, sendo o produto considerado inaceitável aos 150 dias de estocagem a 23 ºC e 105 dias de estocagem a 35 ºc. A caracterização das embalagens quanto à porosidade do verniz e proteção da região de soldagem mostrou-se diretamente relacionada as diferenças no desempenho encontradas entre as embalagens. A avaliação de amostras da região de soldagem no tempo zero e aos 180 dias de estocagem a 23 ºC por meio de microscopia eletrônica e difração de raiosX possibilitou a visualização e confirmação da formação de pontos de corrosão e existência de defeitos no sistema de envernizamento das embalagens. The {{performance of}} four kinds of cans, {{two of them}} produced by Soudronic and Conoweld welding technologies, {{and the other two}} by the conventional process (soldered), was evaluated. With the exception of the can produced by the Conoweld process that was manufactured from tin free steel, the packaging material was tinplate. All of the <b>cans</b> were <b>lacquered</b> internally. The product studied was a lemon soft drink. The shelf-life of the product in the several packagings was determined by storage test within a period of six months at two temperature conditions, 23 ºC and 35 ºC. The main parameters considered were the internal visual evaluation of the packaging, the concentration of iron and the sensorial evaluation of the product. It was verified that although the tinplate cans presented some small differences among them selves, all of the types of tinplate cans (welded and soldered) presented a good performance during the six months of storage, while the welded tin free steel can suffered a process of accentuated corrosion and the product packaged in it reached concentrations of iron above the permissible tolerance (2 ppm at six months of storage) between 90 and 120 days in storage at 23 ºC and between 75 and 90 days in storage at 35 ºC. For the storage at 23 °C, that was the period established for the shelf-life of the product in this packaging, while for the storage at 35 °C the shelf-life was between 62 and 75 days in function of the metallic flavor detected in the sensorial evaluation. The sensorial evaluation of the lemon soft drink allowed us to detect the product flavor deterioration during the storage at the two temperature conditions that occured in the product packaged in several types of metalic packaging and also in glass used as reference. In function of that, the limitating factor of the shelf [...] life of the lemon soft drink in tinplate packagings was the sensorial alteration. The product was considered unacceptable at 150 days of storage at 23 ºC and at 105 days of storage at 35 ºC. The caracterization of the packagings as to lacquer porosity and protection of the region of welding proved to be directly related to the differences in performance verified among the packagings. The evaluation of samples of the region of welding at time zero and at 180 days of storage at 23 °C in Scanning Electron Microscope and X-Ray Diffraction enabled the visualization and confirmation of points of corrosion formation and the existence of defects in the system of packaging lacquering...|$|R
