40|$|Wax {{morphology}} {{and chemical}} composition are widely accepted {{to be important}} for the protective properties of the leaf’s surface and also valuable characteristics in plant systematics. The leaves of Sorbus domestica L. and Cotoneaster granatensis Boiss., species of two large genera with intricate taxonomy referred to subtribe Pyrinae, Rosaceae (formerly subfamily Maloideae), were studied by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and performing different methods of wax isolation. The aim {{of the study was}} to acquire a suitable, cost and time effective method for wax removal. <b>Chloroform</b> and <b>methanol</b> <b>extractions</b> and freeze-embedding method for direct isolation of the wax crystals were applied. Immersing the leaves for 3 minutes in chloroform was sufficient to extract the waxes whereas the efficiency of the methanol solvent was lower. Wax layers with wellpreserved structures of the crystals from both upper and lower epidermis were successfully transferred to artificial surfaces. The recrystallization experiment demonstrated that waxes from chloroform extracts could recrystallize in in vitro conditions on artificial surfaces. The crystals showed same micromorphology as on the intact leaves.

40|$|Analysis of Nocardia asteroides 14759 cell {{walls were}} done to {{determine}} the chemical and structural composition during the growth cycle. It {{was found that the}} ultrastructural profiles of the cell wall become altered as the cultures aged. Chemical analysis revealed corresponding shifts in cell wall components as the culture went from lag to logarithmic to stationary phases of growth. The peptidoglycan from lag-phase cells (5 h) represented 15 % of the total cell wall weight, and the percentage of peptidoglycan progressively increased so that, in 1 -week stationary-phase cells, it represented approximately 40 % of the total wall weight. In lag-phase cells it was found that 36 % of the cell wall weight was lipid in nature, whereas stationary-phase cells had only 7 % lipid in their wall. The overall sugar composition of the walls remained relatively constant at about 28 to 31 % however, the arabinose to galactose ratio changed from approximately 1 : 1 in lag-phase to 2 : 1 in stationary-phase cells. Gas-liquid chromatography demonstrated that the fatty acids making up the cell wall lipids changed relative to one another as the cells aged. Based upon the removal of lipids by ethanol-ether, <b>chloroform,</b> and alkaline <b>methanol</b> <b>extraction,</b> it was shown that the classes of loosely and firmly associated lipids changed as the cells aged.
