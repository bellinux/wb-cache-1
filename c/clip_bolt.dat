500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] premiered on November 3, 2008 on Disney Channel. The video commences with a <b>clip</b> from <b>Bolt</b> {{in which one}} of the film's characters, Rhino, shouts [...] "Let it begin!" [...] Then several clips from the film play rapidly until Cyrus and Travolta are shown {{performing}} in a recording studio. Throughout the rest of the video, scenes alternate between Cyrus and Travolta performing to <b>clips</b> from <b>Bolt.</b> It ends with Rhino performing a brief dance move.|$|R
5000|$|Box beams have no inset step, instead {{have four}} flat sides like a box. All load beams {{typically}} mount onto an upright frame column with integral rivets or hooks. Some systems utilize an extra <b>clip</b> or <b>bolt</b> {{to lock the}} beam to the upright.|$|R
50|$|An anvil {{needs to}} be placed upon a sturdy base made from an impact and fire {{resistant}} material. It requires being fastened firmly to the base, so it will not move when struck with a hammer. A loose anvil is extremely unsafe, as it can fall off the base and is an ineffective forging tool. Common methods of attaching an anvil are spikes, chains, steel or iron straps, <b>clips,</b> <b>bolts</b> where there are holes provided, and cables. A smith would use whatever was at hand, {{as long as it}} held the anvil firmly in place. The anvil is placed as near to the forge as is convenient, generally no more than one step from the forge to prevent heat loss in the work piece.|$|R
50|$|Luggage locks are, by definition, low {{security}} locks. The shackles {{have a small}} diameter, and {{are easy}} to <b>clip</b> using <b>bolt</b> cutters or similar equipment. Luggage locks based on a pin tumbler lock design usually use {{only three or four}} pins, making them susceptible to lockpicking, even with tools as simple as a bent paperclip.|$|R
500|$|... "I Thought I Lost You" [...] was {{nominated}} for Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, but lost both to Bruce Springsteen's [...] "The Wrestler" [...] from The Wrestler (2008). The song's accompanying music video has Cyrus and Travolta performing the song in a recording studio and features <b>clips</b> from <b>Bolt.</b> [...] "I Thought I Lost You" [...] was promoted by few live performances by Cyrus.|$|R
50|$|Hudson {{supplied}} a {{vast array}} of track components, from the rail in all of its multitude of sections and weights per yard, through to individual bolts, nuts and washers. The smallest rail section is usually found around 12 lb/yard, while the heaviest rail shown in the 1957 catalogue is 60 lbs/yard. With the rail, Hudson supplied fishplates and bolts to suit, spikes for wooden rails, chairs and screws for wooden rails, metal sleepers of various sections, including <b>clips</b> and <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
40|$|Spring clips seal {{housings}} {{for electronic}} circuitry, preventing electromagnetic interference from entering or leaving housings. Clips also keep dust out of housing. Since no bolts are used, housing can be opened quickly; unlike <b>bolts,</b> <b>clips</b> {{can be used}} on thin-walled housing. Seal was developed for an X-band array amplifier...|$|R
50|$|The kaleidoscopes {{consist of}} panels of clear and {{reflective}} acrylic material. The reflective and dichroic panels are <b>clipped</b> and <b>bolted</b> to the masonry window sill of the structure. The acrylic was chosen {{due to its}} sturdiness as a shatterproof, heat resistant, fire retardant product that also resists sunlight fading. Three fiber optic illumination boxes with a central halide fixture are installed with multiple fiber optic cables that serve as lighting sources for the kaleidoscopes. They are secured with steel beams and platforms, which {{also serve as a}} rotating table for the lights.|$|R
50|$|Top-roped {{climbing}} is safer, psychologically easier, {{and less}} physically demanding than sport climbing, {{in which the}} lead climber must <b>clip</b> into preplaced <b>bolts</b> in the rock as they ascend, or traditional climbing, in which protection is placed along the route by a lead climber. Many novice climbers initially experience the sport through top-roping.|$|R
50|$|Reconstruction of the viaduct {{began in}} the summer of 1882:in the rebuilt viaduct, the three inner columns in each pier were still cast-iron, but the two outer 'rakers' were each a single wrought-iron tube filled with {{concrete}} and provided with timber ice fenders. The original raker foundation piles were retained, but cast-iron <b>clips</b> were <b>bolted</b> around them, and the annulus between clips and pile filled with cement. Although by August 1883 the viaduct reconstruction was sufficiently far advanced that construction traffic was run over it, passenger services over the line did not resume until 1 May 1884.|$|R
50|$|The Winchester Model 131 is a <b>clip</b> feed <b>bolt</b> action repeater. The {{magazine}} holds 7 rounds. Unlike {{the model}} 121 the safety is manual {{and it is}} not turned on when a round is loaded. The safety may be on or off when a round is loaded. Incorrect assembly of the safety mechanism on the Model 131 can cause accidental discharge and failure of the safety mechanism by allowing the safety mechanism to walk on the retaining bolt. Verify the safe operation of the safety mechanism before operating this firearm. This firearm was also sold as a Sears Model 2C and should be given the same consideration.|$|R
50|$|The vz. 52 feeds from a {{detachable}} box {{magazine with}} a 10-round cartridge capacity but {{could also be}} rapidly recharged from stripper <b>clips</b> with the <b>bolt</b> retracted. For this purpose, a stripper clip guide is milled into the front face of the bolt carrier, aligning with the magazine when the bolt is locked in the open position. This is the primary method of reloading the rifle as infantrymen were only issued 2 magazines per rifle. It ejects cartridge cases vigorously forward and to the left.|$|R
50|$|Kamps and Powell {{made the}} first free ascent of a route called Chingadera on Tahquitz Rock in California in 1967. Kamps's {{placement}} of a critical protective bolt while on lead, using a manual twist drill, earned him the admiration of later generations of climbers, who have found even <b>clipping</b> onto the <b>bolt</b> is difficult. The climb was an early 5.11. That same year, Kamps and Higgins - both highly proficient on slabs and faces with tiny holds - climbed Lucky Streaks on Fairview Dome in Tuolumne Meadows, (Hard 5.10).|$|R
50|$|Finger spools are a simple, compact {{low tech}} {{alternative}} to reels {{best suited to}} relatively short lengths of line. They are simply a pair of circular flanges {{with a hole in}} the middle, connected by a tubular hub, which is suitably sized to use a finger as an axle when unrolling the line. Line is secured by <b>clipping</b> a <b>bolt</b> snap through a hole on one of the flanges and over the line as it leaves the reel. Line is reeled in by holding the spool with one hand and simply winding the line onto the spool by hand. Spools are most suitable for reasonably short lines, up to about 50m, as it becomes tedious to roll up longer lengths. The small, compact size, and low cost make them useful for various purposes where long line is not required.Spools may be made from any material that is strong enough and suitable for underwater service, but engineering thermoplastics are most common.|$|R
50|$|Schmidt cameras {{have very}} {{strongly}} curved focal planes, thus requiring that the film, plate, or other detector be correspondingly curved. In {{some cases the}} detector is made curved; in others flat media is mechanically conformed {{to the shape of}} the focal plane through the use of retaining <b>clips</b> or <b>bolts,</b> or by the application of a vacuum. A field flattener, in its simplest form a planoconvex lens in front of the film plate or detector, is sometimes used. Since the corrector plate {{is at the center of}} curvature of the primary mirror in this design the tube length can be very long for a wide-field telescope. There are also the drawbacks of having the obstruction of the film holder or detector mounted at the focus halfway up the tube assembly, a small amount of light is blocked and there is a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction and its support structure.|$|R
25|$|Lead {{climbing}} is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends {{with the}} rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, {{rather than through}} a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses he or she clips the rope into, using a runner and carabiners, intermediate points of protection such as active cams, or passive protection such as nuts; this limits {{the length of a}} potential fall. The leader also may <b>clip</b> into pre-placed <b>bolts.</b> Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, we have {{developed}} computer vision methods for measurement of rail gauge, and reliable identification and localization of structural defects in railroad tracks. The rail gauge is {{the distance between the}} innermost sides of the two parallel steel rails. We {{have developed}} two methods for evaluation of rail gauge. These methods were designed for different hardware setups: the first method works with two pairs of unaligned video cameras while the second method works with depth maps generated by paired laser range scanners. We have also developed a method for detection of rail defects such as damaged or missed rail fasteners, tie <b>clips,</b> and <b>bolts,</b> based on correlation and MACH filters. Lastly, to make our algorithms perform in real-time, {{we have developed}} the GPU based library for parallel computation of the above algorithms. Rail gauge is the most important measurement for track maintenance, because deviations in gauge indicate where potential defects may exist. We have developed a vision-based method for rail gauge estimation from a pair of industrial laser range scanners. In this approach, we start with building a 3 D panorama of the rail out of a stack of input scans. After the panorama is built...|$|R
5000|$|For the {{restoration}} of WHR (Caernarfon), the Ffestiniog Railway imported not only South African steam engines (some built in Manchester by Beyer Peacock and Company as recently as 1958) but also the rails and steel sleepers on which to run them. This track included eighty completely made up panels of [...] gauge (adjusted before use to [...] gauge) straight track (for the laying of which a special rail mounted track laying gantry - 'The Forth Bridge' - was built by Winson Engineering Ltd). The greater part of the rail came with a job lot of steel sleepers, <b>clips,</b> screws, <b>bolts</b> and fishplates, all to several different patterns, {{which had to be}} sorted by WHR and FR volunteers before they could be used. The bulk of the track including all the curved sections was built up on site with rails moved forward to the railhead using specially built rail grab trolleys known as RRMs - [...] "Roland's Rail Movers", named after WHLR Ltd construction manager Roland Doyle. These proved to be a highly successful innovation and they have been used on all subsequent tracklaying. Amusingly, they have also acquired the nickname [...] "Roland Rats", a title believed to have originated among the track gangs at the Porthmadog end, who also use the same technology.|$|R
