When mode-converted waves contain two different frequencies, waves can show modulation of the amplitude in time. For X = 0.06, because frequency ratio of two resonant waves Ωhigh/ Ωlow is 6.27 and the amplitude of Ωlow is greater than Ωhigh, wave amplitude beating is not significantly appeared in the third panel. Different to case of X = 0.06, for X = 0.7 in Fig. 3 (c), Ωhigh/Ωlow = 1.31 and the wave amplitudes are similar for both frequencies, therefore, the amplitude beating in time is clearly shown in the third panel of Fig. 3 (c). In this case, when two wave amplitudes are assumed to be the same and constant in time, the beat period Tbeat can be approximated to be 1 /(ΔΩ) ≈ 7.7, which is consistent with the simulation results.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the safety of {{composite}} components, structural health monitoring is needed to detect structural performance in real-time at the early stage of damage occurred. This is difficult to detect complex <b>components</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> sensor detection technology, so that ultrasonic phased array technology using multisensor detection will be selected. Ultrasonic phased array technology can scan the structure in all directions and angles without moving or less moving the probe and becomes the first choice of structural health monitoring. However, a large amount of data will be generated when using ultrasonic phased array with Nyquist sampling theorem for structural health monitoring and is difficult to storage, transmission, and processing. Besides, traditional Nyquist sampling cannot satisfy the sampling of large amounts of data without distortion, so a more efficient acquisition technique must be chosen. Compressive sensing theory can ensure that if the signal is sparse, it can be sampled in low sampling rate which is much less than two times of the sampling rate as defined by Nyquist sampling theorem for a large number of data and reconstructed in high probability. Then, the experiment result indicated that the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm can reconstruct the signal completely and accurately...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{associations}} of individual and combined physical fitness <b>components</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> and clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors in children. SUBJECTS/METHODS: This 2 -year longitudinal study included a total of 1635 European children aged 6 - 11 years. The test battery included cardio-respiratory fitness (20 -m shuttle run test), upper-limb strength (handgrip test), lower-limb strength (standing long jump test), balance (flamingo test), flexibility (back-saver sit-and-reach) and speed (40 -m sprint test). Metabolic risk was assessed through z-score standardization using four components: waist circumference, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), blood lipids (triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein) and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment). Mixed model regression analyses were adjusted for sex, age, parental education, sugar and fat intake, and body mass index. RESULTS: Physical fitness was inversely associated with clustered metabolic risk (P< 0. 001). All coefficients showed a higher clustered metabolic risk with lower physical fitness, except for upper-limb strength (beta = 0. 057; P = 0. 002) where the opposite association was found. Cardio-respiratory fitness (beta = - 0. 124; P< 0. 001) and lower-limb strength (beta = - 0. 076; P = 0. 002) were the most important longitudinal determinants. The effects of cardio-respiratory fitness were even independent of the amount of vigorous-to-moderate activity (beta = - 0. 059; P = 0. 029). Among all the metabolic risk components, blood pressure seemed not well predicted by physical fitness, while waist circumference, blood lipids and insulin resistance all seemed significantly predicted by physical fitness. CONCLUSION: Poor physical fitness in children is associated with the development of cardio-metabolic risk factors. Based on our results, this risk might be modified by improving mainly cardio-respiratory fitness and lower-limb muscular strength...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, Finite-element {{fracture}} simulation methodology {{has been}} very well established at NASA Langley to predict the residual strength of damaged aircraft structures. This methodology has been experimentally verified at NASA Langley for structures ranging from laboratory coupons up to full-scale built-up structural <b>components</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> and multiple-site damage cracking. The methodology uses the critical crack-tip-opening-angle (CTOA) fracture criterion to characterize the fracture behavior of the material. The CTOA fracture criterion assumes that stable crack growth occurs when the crack-tip angle reaches a constant critical value. The use of the CTOA criterion requires an elastic-plastic, finite-element analysis. The critical CTOA value is determined by simulating fracture behavior in laboratory specimens, such as a compact specimen, to obtain the angle that best fits the observed test behavior. The critical CTOA value appears to be independent of loading, crack length, and in-plane dimensions. However, it {{is a function of}} material thickness and local crack-front constraint. Modeling the local constraint requires either a three-dimensional analysis or a two-dimensional analysis with an approximation to account for the constraint effects. In recent times as the aircraft industry is leaning towards monolithic structures with the intension of reducing part count and manufacturing cost, there has been a consistent effort at NASA Langley to extend critical CTOA based numerical methodology in the analysis of integrally-stiffened panels. In this regard, a series of fracture tests were conducted on curved aluminum-alloy integrally-stiffened panels. These curved panels were subjected to uniaxial tension and pressure loading. During the test, applied load-crack extension, out-of-plane displacements and local deformations around the crack tip region were measured. Compact and middle-crack tension specimens were tested to determine the critical angle (psi(sub c) using three-dimensional code (ZIP 3 D) and the plane-strain core height (h(sub c)) using two-dimensional code (STAGS) ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of data-driven automated techniques to enhance performance assessment methods. These techniques include process control loop status monitoring, fault localisation in a number of interacting control loops and the detection and isolation of multiple oscillations in a multi-loop situation. Not only do they make use of controlled variables, but they also make use of controller outputs, indicator readings, set-points and controller settings. The idea behind loop status is that knowledge of the current behaviour of a loop is important when assessing MVC-based performance, because of the assumptions that are made in the assessment. Current behaviour is defined in terms of the kind of deterministic trend that is present in the loop at the time of assessment. When the status is other than steady, MVC-based approaches are inappropriate. Either the assessment must be delayed until steady conditions are attained or other methods must be applied. When the status is other than steady, knowledge of current behaviour can help identify the possible cause. One way of doing this is to derive another statistic, the overall loop performance index (OLPI), from loop status. The thesis describes a novel fault localisation technique, which analyses this statistic to find the source of a plant-wide disturbance, when a number of interacting control loops are perturbed by a single dominant disturbance/fault. Although the technique can isolate a single dominant oscillation, it is not able to isolate the sources of multiple, dominant oscillations. To do this, a novel technique is proposed that is based on the application of spectral independent component analysis (ICA). Spectral independent component analysis (spectral ICA) is based on the analysis of spectra derived via a discrete Fourier transform from time domain process data. The analysis is able to extract dominant spectrum-like independent components each of which has a narrow-bank peak that captures the behaviour of one of the oscillation sources. It is shown that the extraction of independent <b>components</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> spectral peaks can be guaranteed by an ICA algorithm that maximises the kurtosis of the independent components (ICs). This is a significant advantage over spectral principle component analysis (PCA), because multiple spectral peaks could be present in the extracted principle components (PCs), and the interpretation of detection and isolation of oscillation disturbances based on spectral PCs is not straightforward. The novel spectral ICA method is applied to a simulated data set and to real plant data obtained from an industrial chemical plant. Results demonstrate its ability to detect and isolate multiple dominant oscillations in different frequency ranges. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{is based}} on several {{research}} and development programs to implement the use of fibre lasers in the manufacturing of medical devices like stents and pacemakers. In general, the medical device manufacturing industry has a high demand for laser micromachining applications. The content of the thesis describes laser micromachining of metallic <b>components</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> mode fibre lasers. At the started of the research work for this thesis, most laser machining processes used flash-lamp pumped solid-state lasers for those applications. Reliable laser operation and low maintenance are required to meet the yields and up-time requirements for medical devices, such as stent cutting and pacemaker welding. Many lasers for micromachining applications are configured to operate near the diffraction limited beam performance to achieve very small feature sizes. It is challenging to maintain such a laser system performance in a production environment. The fibre laser provides a number of attractive features that could address the needs to maintain high up-time and high yields: • A single mode fibre laser does not require mirror alignment. • Diode pumped fibre lasers reduce maintenance due to eliminating the lamp change. • The compact air-cooled design helps to save expensive clean room space on the production floor. By 2000 the increases in average laser power extended {{the use of the}} fibre lasers into industrial applications such as cutting and welding [...] The lasers investigated in this thesis generated 50 W to 200 W of laser power, representing the highest power levels commercially available at that time. For the microcutting of medical implants such as stents and guide wires, kerf width and sidewall surface quality are of special interest. Developing processes capable of achieving these criteria was the primary objective of the research described in this thesis. A secondary concern is the heat affected zone created by the laser machining process. Operation conditions to minimize this effect are also discussed in this thesis. Many microwelding applications in the electronics, telecom and medical device industry require smaller and smaller laser joining areas. The quality of a laser welded joint is very dependant on the temporal and spatial parameters of the laser beam. These parameters must be adjusted to match to the processing speed and the materials being welded. Switching continuous wave fibre lasers can achieve the parameters for processes requiring low average power. However the pulse-to-pulse stability can effect the process and has been investigated. Some welding applications require focus spot diameters in the order of 50 μm and pulse energy levels as low as 10 mJ. The fibre laser’s excellent single mode beam quality provides the desired spot size and laser power density. The research summarized in this thesis was performed to prove that fibre lasers are viable tools for micromachining. This thesis compares fibre laser machining results with those using legacy laser processes and describes ways {{to improve the quality of}} the fibre laser machining process...|$|E

Here, the largest enhancements in V 350 F and V 350 M activity were for the synthesis of methoxyhydroquinone from o-methoxyphenol and methylhydroquinone from o-cresol. For the first time, random mutagenesis of a nitroarene dioxygenase was performed. ^ Saturation mutagenesis of the naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Ralstonia sp. strain U 2 at position F 350 of the α-subunit (NagAc) created variant F 350 T that was able to degrade 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene (26 DNT) to 3 -methyl- 4 -nitrocatechol (3 M 4 NC), aw well as 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrotoluene (2 A 46 DNT) to 3 -amino- 4 -methyl- 5 -nitrocatechol (3 A 4 M 5 NC) and 2 -amino- 4, 6 -dinitrobenzyl alcohol (2 A 46 DNBA) (wild-type NDO has no activity on these two substrates). DNA shuffling of NDO nagAcAd generated the beneficial NagAc mutations G 407 S, which enhanced the reactions catalyzed by the NagAc variant F 350 T 3 -fold, and L 225 R, which increased the degradation rate of 4 -amino- 2 -nitrotoluene, generating 4 -amino- 2 -nitrobenzyl alcohol and 4 -amino- 2 -nitrocresol, and 23 DNT, generating 2, 3 -dinitrobenzyl alcohol and 4 -methyl- 3 -nitrocatechol. For the first time, random mutagenesis of NagAc discovered two new residues, G 407 and L 225, which influence the regiospecificity of Rieske, non-heme dioxygenases. ^ Combining two different terminal oxygenase <b>components</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> electron transfer components, we created novel hybrid dioxygenase systems for the degradation of aromatic pollutants. In the presence of naphthalene, the engineered orthric dioxygenase NDO-R 34 DDO (nagAa-dntAcAd-nagAbAcAd) increased the formation rate of 4 M 5 NC from 24 DNT 2 -fold relative to R 34 DDO alone (NDO does not oxidize 24 DNT). The construct R 34 DDO-NBDO (dntAa-nbzAcAd-dntAbAcAd) generated 3 A 4 M 5 NC and 2 A 46 DNBA from 2 A 46 DNT 4 -fold and 3 -fold faster, respectively, than NBDO alone and formed 3 A 6 M 5 NC from 4 A 26 DNT (R 34 DDO alone has no activity on 4 A 26 DNT). This is the first report to describe a Rieske dioxygenase system capable of simultaneously degrading mixtures of 24 DNT/naphthalene or 2 A 46 DNT/ 4 A 26 DNT, and to expand the substrate range of a Rieske dioxygenase by investigating the compatibility of the ferredoxin subunit with a dual terminal dioxygenase system. ^ Through chemical mutagenesis methods, the Burkholderia sp. strain DNT variant DNT- 8 was generated with a 2 -fold increase in the rate of 24 DNT degradation, a 3 -fold increase in the formation rate of 4 M 5 NC, and a 2 -fold increase in the nitrite release rate compared wild-type strain DNT. In addition, the variant DNT- 8 was able to degrade 4 M 5 NC 6 -fold faster than wild-type DNT. This is the first report to enhance the degradation of nitroaromatic compounds through random chemical mutagenesis. ...|$|E

Both galaxies are known to host 2 counter-rotating stellar disks, with the ionized gas co-rotating with one of them. We measured in each galaxy the ionized gas kinematics and metallicity, and the surface brightness, kinematics, mass surface density, and the stellar populations of the 2 stellar components to constrain the formation scenario of these peculiar galaxies. We applied a novel spectroscopic decomposition technique to both galaxies, to separate the relative contribution of the 2 counter-rotating stellar and one ionized-gas components to the observed spectrum. We measured the kinematics and the line strengths of the Lick indices of the 2 counter-rotating stellar components. We modeled the data of each stellar <b>component</b> <b>with</b> <b>single</b> stellar population models that account for the alpha/Fe overabundance. In both galaxies we successfully separated the main from the secondary stellar component that is less massive and rotates {{in the same direction}} of the ionized-gas component. The 2 stellar components have exponential surface-brightness profiles. In both galaxies, the two counter-rotating stellar components have different stellar populations: the secondary stellar disk is younger, more metal poor, and more alpha-enhanced than the main galaxy stellar disk. Our findings rule out an internal origin of the secondary stellar component and favor a scenario where it formed from gas accreted on retrograde orbits from the environment fueling an in situ outside-in rapid star formation. The event occurred ~ 2 Gyr ago in NGC 3593, and ~ 7 Gyr ago in NGC 4550.

Analytical expressions are derived in the limit of weak interactions within the local density approximation for an arbitrary number of components and for one plus one particle using an exact solution.

40|$|A {{framework}} for modeling componential data using item response theory models for polytomous items is presented. This framework models response accuracies on complex cognitive tasks, which are decomposed {{in terms of}} more basic elements (com-ponents), such as knowledge structures, cognitive processes, and strategies. Response categories of polytomous items correspond to possible response patterns on the <b>components.</b> Models <b>with</b> only <b>single</b> <b>component</b> effects are distinct from models that allow for component combination effects. For the latter, a further distinction is made between constant and dimension-dependent component combination effects {{as a function of}} whether these effects depend on an examinee’s ability. The proposed models ar...|$|R
40|$|In the {{evolving}} voter model, {{when an individual}} interacts with a neighbor having an opinion different from theirs, they will with probability 1 -α imitate the neighbor but with probability α will sever the connection and choose a new neighbor at random (i) from the graph or (ii) from those with the same opinion. Durrett et al. used simulation and heuristics to study these dynamics on sparse graphs. Recently Basu and Sly have studied this system with 1 -α = ν/N on a dense Erdős-Rényi graph G(N, 1 / 2) and rigorously proved {{that there is a}} phase transition from rapid disconnection into <b>components</b> <b>with</b> a <b>single</b> opinion to prolonged persistence of discordant edges as ν increases. In this paper, we consider the intermediate situation of Erdős-Rényi random graphs with average degree L=N^a where 0 < a < 1. Most of the paper is devoted to a rigorous analysis of an approximation of the dynamics called the approximate master equation. Using ideas of LMR and Silk we are able to analyze these dynamics in great detail. Comment: 35 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} for sequential logic optimization include (1) explicit state-based {{techniques such as}} state minimization, (2) structural techniques such as retiming, and (3) methods that exploit sequential don't-cares derived from unreachable states. These approaches optimize a logic circuit as a <b>single</b> <b>component</b> <b>with</b> a <b>single</b> input/output behavior. In this paper we present a novel concept for sequential optimization referred to as temporal decomposition, which distinguishes the logic that initializes the circuit from the logic needed for the behavior after startup. This work was motivated by a recent observation made for bounded property verification: There is a substantial optimization potential for transition relations when the first execution steps are applied as satisfiability don't-cares. This result suggests that current designs include circuitry that is only used {{during the first few}} clock periods after reset and could be discarded or disabled after startup. In this paper we describe how temporal decomposition could be applied to treat the logic for startup separately from the remaining circuitry and discuss multiple alternatives to exploit this for an improved implementation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In component-based systems, two {{interacting}} {{components are}} compatible if all sequences of services requested by one components {{can be provided}} by the other component. In the case of several <b>components</b> interacting <b>with</b> a <b>single</b> provider, as is typically the case in client–server computing, the requests from different components can be interleaved and therefore verifying component compatibility must check all possible interleavings of requests from all interacting components. Incremental composition of interacting components eliminates this need for exhaustive combinatorial checking of the interleavings by imposing some restrictions on the interleavings. The paper introduces simple conditions which must be satified by the interacting components for their composition to be incremental and illustrates the concepts using simple examples of interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|According to the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate’s requirements, in the {{regulations}} concerning structural components in nuclear installations, in-service inspection must be performed using inspection methods {{that have been}} qualified. Also new demands on production optimization and light weight products require new improved techniques to ensure the product quality. The increased use of fabricated light weight products requires in general higher demands on {{the reliability of the}} techniques and the ability for them to detect and characterize smaller defects. In order to elaborate corresponding procedures, efforts have to be taken towards the development of mathematical models of applied NDT methods. A thorough validated model has the ability to be an alternative and a complement to the experimental work, {{in order to reduce the}} extensive cost that often is associated with the conventional qualification procedure. The UTDefect computer code has been developed during a decade and simulates the entire ultrasonic testing situation. The model is limited to a thick-walled <b>component</b> <b>with</b> a <b>single</b> defect of simple shape. An important issue regarding all models is the validation, and thus a number of benchmarking projects have been initiated by the World Federation of NDE Centers. Experiment...|$|R
40|$|The General Electric Reliable and Affordable Controls effort {{under the}} NASA Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Program has designed, fabricated, and tested {{advanced}} controls {{hardware and software}} to reduce emissions and improve engine safety and reliability. The original effort consisted of four elements: 1) a Hydraulic Multiplexer; 2) Active Combustor Control; 3) a Variable Displacement Vane Pump (VDVP); and 4) Intelligent Engine Control. The VDVP and Intelligent Engine Control elements were cancelled due to funding constraints and are reported here only to the state they progressed. The Hydraulic Multiplexing element developed and tested a prototype which improves reliability by combining the functionality of up to 16 solenoids and servo-valves into one <b>component</b> <b>with</b> a <b>single</b> electrically powered force motor. The Active Combustor Control element developed intelligent staging and control strategies for low emission combustors. This included development and tests of a Controlled Pressure Fuel Nozzle for fuel sequencing, a Fuel Multiplexer for individual fuel cup metering, and model-based control logic. Both the Hydraulic Multiplexer and Controlled Pressure Fuel Nozzle system were cleared for engine test. The Fuel Multiplexer was cleared for combustor rig test which must be followed by an engine test to achieve full maturation...|$|R
