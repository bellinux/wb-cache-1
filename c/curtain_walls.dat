The most radical change Saladin implemented in Egypt was the enclosure of Cairo and al-Fustat within one city wall. Some of the techniques of fortification were learned from the Crusaders, such as <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> following the natural topography.

The inner bailey was levelled and William built a hall and service buildings inside the castle, again in stone.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> {{system is}} widely used in {{high-rise}} buildings because of its many advantages. With the increasing demands for building energy efficiency, thermal performance has become an important consideration in developing <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> systems. Even though the relative impact of the edge effect becomes more important as the thermal performance of glazing and the frame increases, the percentages of the frame out of the total <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> area have not been considered in evaluating its thermal transmittance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the effect of the frame ratio on the thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. The state of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> frame ratio is analyzed by investigating recently constructed office buildings. Eight cases of different frame ratios and three types of glazing U-values are selected, and the total thermal transmittance of the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> (Ucw) for each case was calculated by using TRISCO 12. 0 W. This study found that when the higher frame ratio is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system, the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> is higher. Furthermore, the frame ratio has greater effect on the thermal transmittance of <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> when high performance glazing is applied to the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system. It is recommended that the certificates of a <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> system should show the frame ratio that was applied during testing or the accurate Ucw value considering actual frame ratio should be submitted for more reasonable building energy simulation...|$|R

However, there are many cases where the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> actually constructed was of narrow gauge, giving a point of reduction where the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> and turret wing walls join. To facilitate bonding with the <b>curtain</b> <b>wall,</b> wing walls were constructed longer at the base, and stepping inwards as they were built upwards.

5|$|The castle {{is built}} to an Edwardian {{concentric}} design, with a {{keep in the}} south-eastern corner, protected by an inner and outer bailey with stone <b>curtain</b> <b>walls</b> extending out to the north-west. The castle is built using stones from the local beach bonded with a liquid mortar, with the finer stonework, such as the doorways and windows, made from red ashlar sandstone imported from the mainland.

5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls.</b> There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured.

The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been run from the town of Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.|$|E

Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria– from Roman and Eastern origins respectively– were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13thcentury, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the <b>curtain</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo achieve {{national}} {{greenhouse gas}} {{reduction in the}} building sector, heating and cooling energy in buildings should be reduced. The government has strengthened regulations on insulation performance for building energy savings. However, the building envelope has various thermal bridges. In particular, a metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> comprises a number of thermal bridges at joints between the panels and the fixing units, thus degrading the overall thermal performance. To reduce building energy, {{it is necessary to}} reduce thermal bridges in building envelopes. This study aims to analyze the energy saving potential achieved by reducing thermal bridges. For this, the insulation performance and building energy needs of the existing and alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> were evaluated. The alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> that uses plastic molds at joints between panels and the thermally-broken brackets was suggested to reduce heat loss through thermal bridges. As results, the effective U-value of the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> was reduced by 72 % compared with the existing metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> In addition, annual heating energy needs of the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> building was reduced by 26 %, and annual total energy needs was reduced by 6 % because annual cooling energy needs of it slightly increased compared with the existing metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall.</b> In conclusion, the alternative metal panel <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> considerably influenced the savings in building energy needs by reducing thermal bridges...|$|R
50|$|A <b>curtain</b> <b>wall</b> {{system is}} an outer {{covering}} {{of a building}} in which the outer walls are non-structural, but merely keep the weather out and the occupants in.

The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building.
