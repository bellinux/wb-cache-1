However, when subjected to moulding in a <b>compression</b> <b>press,</b> both composites extruded at different speeds suffered significant damage. Nevertheless, the extruded samples did show a lower thermal conductivity compared to the virgin polymer. Further, it was observed that the sample extruded at 5 r/min had a lower damage coefficient value with an overall loss of around 33 % to the aerogel structure when compared to the material extruded at 65 r/min, which endured a structural loss of 41 % to the aerogel in it...|$|E

A large piece of pure platinum, a Ag/AgCl/ 1  M KCl electrode (0.235  V vs. NHE), and 1  M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution served as the counter electrode, reference electrode, and electrolyte, respectively. The working electrode was prepared by mixing the nanocomposite, super P carbon black, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) in a weight ratio of 75 : 20 : 5 onto a stainless steel foil of ~ 0.3  cm 2 area. The electrodes were dried in a vacuum oven at 80  °C overnight, and then pressed at a pressure of 20  MPa using a PHI manual <b>compression</b> <b>presses.</b> The loading of each electrode was controlled to be 1 – 2  mg cm− 2, and the thickness was ~ 50  μm. Before the cell assembly, the electrolyte was bubbled with Ar for 60  min while the platinum foil was first rinsed in acetone and then repeatedly ultrasonicated in deionized water. Cells were assembled in an Ar atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a Solartron SI 1287 Electrochemical Interface at a scan rate of 0.5  mV s− 1 from 0 to 0.8  V (vs. the reference electrode) while galvanostatic tests were performed on a BT 2000 battery tester. The electrochemical performances of this nanocomposite in a non-aqueous system were also tested as a reference. The electrode fabrication was the same as above except that here Al foil was used and electrodes were ~ 8  mm in diameter. The loading and thickness of each electrode was 1 – 2  mg cm− 2 and ~ 50  µm, respectively. 2032 -type coin cells were assembled in an MBraun glove box (O 2  <  0.1  ppm, H 2 O <  2  ppm) while a Celgard 3501 microporous membrane was used as the separator. CV was performed on a Solartron SI 1287 electrochemical interface at a scan rate of 0.05  mV/s while galvanostatic tests were performed on a BT 2000 battery tester. 1  M NaClO 4 in EC/DMC (w/w =  1 : 2) and Na foil were used as the electrolyte and counter electrode.|$|R

Characterizations of the natural fiber polymer composites were analyzed using scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. It was found that in all measured composites, the sound absorption coefficients increased as the frequency increased. Also, as the fiber loading increased, the sound absorption coefficients of the natural fiber polymer composites were increased. It was found that the alkaline treated fiber reinforced composites increased the sound absorption coefficients due to removal of impurities and change in the structure of composites. The alkaline treatment of fibers showed better adhesion interface between fiber and polymer as compared to untreated fibers.

This compression scheme is known as “dictionary-based compressor” and consists of squeezing an input string by replacing some of its substrings with (shorter) codewords which are actually pointers to a dictionary of phrases built as the string is processed. Surprisingly enough, although many fundamental results are nowadays known about the speed and effectiveness of this compression process, “we are not aware of any parsing scheme that achieves optimality [...] . under any constraint on the codewords other than being of equal length” [N.

40|$|Abstract. Both {{strength}} and elastic modulus of rocks are usually determined by compression testing at the mesoscopic scale (UNE-EN 1926; ASTMD 3148 - 96), {{and the values}} obtained are representative of homogeneous rocks. However, heterogeneous and texturally complex rocks show a broad dispersion range and their {{strength and}} elastic modulus depend {{on the presence of}} different textures and their mechanical properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} quantify the mechanical behaviour of these textures individually in order to understand the strength and elasticity of the whole rock. Four varieties of brecciated carbonates (limestones and dolostones) were studied. These rocks have a very complex fabric, presenting a dense network of fractures and clasts between fractures (mm-cm size). The fractures are completely filled with calcite cement, and clasts can have one or two different textures, each presenting differences in crystal size, mineralogy and porosity percentage and type. Samples measuring 4 x 4 x 4 mm were obtained in order to test each texture individually. These micro-samples were tested in a uniaxial <b>compression</b> <b>press</b> and the stress-strain curve was recorded. In addition, mean strength and Young’s moduli were calculated for each texture.

Three different alloys containing various amounts of Mg (0. 5, 0. 8 and 1. 2 wt%) were prepared through the cooling slope casting technique, before they were thixoformed using a <b>compression</b> <b>press.</b> Several of the thixoformed samples were then treated with a T 6 heat treatment, that is, solution treatment at 525 °C for 8 h, quenching in warm water at 60 °C, followed by aging at 155 °C for 4 h. All of the samples were then characterised by optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis {{as well as by}} tensile tests. The results revealed that magnesium was able to refine the size of α-Al globules and the eutectic silicon in the samples.

40|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{strength of}} nail and screw fasteners {{has been studied}} in rice straw fibre-thermoplastic composites. Two types of thermoplastic, virgin polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), were selected as separate composite matrices. Three levels of dry rice straw fibre, 45 %, 60 % and 75 %, based on the composition by weight and passed through a 40 -mesh size screen was mixed with the polymeric matrices without and with 2 % (based on weight) maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) as Coupling agent. A dry-blending method was used for compounding the materials. The 12 formulations for the polymer composites were used to prepare samples with dimensions 25 cm by 15 cm by I cm. The final composites were made by pressing the prepared mats between the hot plates of a <b>compression</b> <b>press</b> by employing combinations of temperature and pressure in three stages.

Withdrawal strengths were also measured after immersion of the composites for 24 h in distilled water (wet condition). The results showed that the withdrawal strength of screws is more than that of nails. Also, irrespective of the type of polymer, the percentage of rice straw fibre may significantly influence the withdrawal strength of fasteners, especially at the higher fibre to polymer ratios.

40|$|Fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} are hybrid materials {{designed for}} the needs of the 21 st century. With their capability to form low weight structures, while preserving high stiffness and excellent damping, these composites provide solutions for a broad range of markets. Unfortunately, some of these advantages are not used in practice because there exist no fast and automated manufacturing processes for efficient production. In the research field of continuous-reinforced thermoplastic composites, industry is facing a challenge of high viscose polymer melt and thereby an imperfect fiber wet-out. As a result, synergy effects of fibers within a polymer could not be fully exploited. The topic of this work is to adapt new processing technologies for reactive thermoplastic polymers. On one hand, fast heating and cooling options offer processes with shorter cycle time, and on the other hand, low viscosity of reactive polymers impregnates the textile structures faster. This results in faster and cheaper manufacturing of composites that are yet to be realized for the market. All FRPCs were produced on a continuous <b>compression</b> molding <b>press.</b> As a noncontinuous technology, an inductive heated CageSystem® from RocTool has been selected. Entropically driven ring-opening cyclic oligomers form Cyclics with waterlike melt viscosities are chosen as reactive matrix. The viscosity of Cyclic Butylene Terephthalate (CBT*) was measured using a rheometer. The rheological behavior is determined under isothermal conditions for various temperatures. The chemical transformation from oligomer to macromolecule pCBT 1 was assessed by size exclusion chromatography. Based on these studies, a kinetic polymerization model was constructed which involved an Arrhenius-type equation. By using the activation energy and pre-exponential factor, it was possible to offer an exact mathematical solution for the prediction of isothermal conversion. A numerical solution of the Arrhenius equation helped to predict the polymerization for any timetemperature conditions. Furthermore, the polymerization model was extended to describe the chemo-rheology. Inserting specific material parameters, the bipartite model was able to provide a numerical prognosis for the viscosity with the input parameters time-temperature. All models were calibrated and validated with the experimental data. The continuous <b>compression</b> molding <b>press</b> was used to consolidate CBT-prepregs and PBT-prepregs. As reinforcing phase, a multiaxial non-crimp-fabric from Ahlstrom was used. This fabric contained glass fibers with a “CBT*-compatible” sizing. The design of experiments was mainly focusing on the variation in the temperature distribution in process direction with respect to process speeds. An extensive analysis, from optical to energy absorption, was performed on the resulting FRPC-product, called organic sheet. All test results showed a better performance for GF-pCBT compared to GF-PBT. Even for much higher process speed, the material properties of GF-pCBT did not deteriorate strongly in contrast to GF-PBT. The enhancement was traced to a better fiber-matrix interface (e. g., ILSS values) and to an excellent fiber wet-out with pCBT (e. g., SEM pictures). Viscosity and impregnation are the main factors behind the transversal visco-elastic impregnation model that was deduced. An arithmetic function that tracks the impregnation process for the classical thermoplastic PBT and its reactive pendant CBT* was derived. This was based on the dimensionless B-factor which was considered as technology independent performance indicator. The model was able to link the fast impregnation with CBT* - the viscosity of which is 10 - 5 magnitude lower than PBT - to all temperature-time-conditions. An optimization method was used to find process parameters to realize a minimum cycle time for the continuous process. This model was adapted to the non-continuous pressing technology to find the minimum cycle time. To evaluate the economic potential, a transparent process analysis was set up in form of a static cost calculation. In a first step, all monetary activities from each technology were identified and rated. The cycle time - as main capacity indicator - was based on the chemo-rheological model introduced above. Different break-even analyses and production costs highlighted the techno-economic potential of the related process-material-combination. A synergistic effect between innovative process technologies and reactive thermoplastic polymer was found. Faster and more efficient technologies for the production of fiber-reinforced plastics have been systematically developed and evaluated. The results were achieved with an intelligent combination of manufacturing technology and modern reactive thermoplastic polymers. Moreover, the approach of this work can be transferred to the other reactive thermoplastic matrix-based composites...|$|R

Patients were treated with the current standard of care: combined decongestive therapy. All three patients met obstacles in achieving independent self-care, which impeded their discharge to home care. The use of two currently available programmable pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) was investigated to determine if these devices could enable these difficult-to-manage patients to meet their discharge goals. Results indicate that programmable PCDs can be effective in managing complicated cases of leg and trunk lymphedema, and that differences may exist between devices. In this trial, the device with lower applied pressures and smaller pneumatic chambers provided better tolerated treatment and overall better patient outcomes. These three case reports show that in-home use of an appropriate PCD can help patients with stage 3 and advanced stage 2 lymphedema achieve stable limb volumes with no exacerbation of lymphedema-related symptoms.

40|$|PNNL {{conducted}} a systematic optical modeling effort {{to study and}} compare retroreflector designs with respect to available optical materials. The optical Strehl ratio (SR) and cross section figures of merit were {{used to compare the}} performance of candidate optical designs. Further modeling was conducted to assess the relationships between standoff range and retroreflector diameter and cross section. Analysis showed that small diameter retroreflectors have very high optical link loss, since the net loss scales by retroreflector diameter to the 4 th power. Optical retroreflection efficiency is also important, but extracting ideal performance from a complicated design must be tempered {{by the fact that the}} effective retroreflector range varies only as the fourth root of the cross section. It's therefore imperative to maintain a reasonable retroreflector diameter, but striving for perfect optical performance may be a costly effort that does not merit the modest performance gain. Several promising designs were developed for visible and mid-infrared applications, which embraced lessons learned in the standoff range study. These designs included a polymer clad glass core approach for visible wavelengths and a concentric shell design using chalcogenide glass for the mid-infrared. Injection molding feasibility studies demonstrated that it was practical to fabricate visible polymer retroreflectors using this approach. Such an approach may be a practical solution for the LLNL project. Our primary focus is to develop mid-infrared designs; therefore compression molding chalcogenide glass was adopted for fabricating mid-infrared retroreflectors. A significant effort was focused on developing practical compression molding methods that provided reasonable device yield. A custom <b>compression</b> molding <b>press</b> was developed in collaboration with a private engineering firm. Many successful molding studies were conducted during this effort, but ultimately the fragile nature of the chalcogenide glass and the unfavorable thermal expansion properties limited the feasibility of fabricating the thin shell structures needed for this design. An alternative Cat's Eye retroreflector design was therefore adopted. This design is constructed using two hemispherical structures that can be fabricated by conventional grinding and polishing methods or by molding with high yield. The cross section of this design is very good (and can be further improved by applying a highly reflective coating to the rear surface), but has reduced field of view as a design trade off as well as the isotropic nature of Luneburg-style retroreflector...|$|R

The D-LFT process {{has a number of}} advantages when compared to the two step pre-compounded LFT pellet process, of which the most relevant are the cost reduction associated to the elimination of an intermediate step of producing pellets, the flexibility of modifying material formulations in-house at convenience and the reduction of heat and shear history of the material. Among the various configurations commercially available for D-LFT systems, two processes were considered for the present project. In the first process reinforcing fibres are fed and mixed with a molten polymer in a twin screw compounder and then extruded into a rectangular cross-section profile. This extrudate (sometimes referred to as a "log") is automatically cut to a specific length and transferred by a robot arm to a vertical <b>compression</b> moulding <b>press</b> where the polymer/fibre compound is moulded to the desired shape. The moulding can be done by means of direct compression of the log or by its placement into a mould shot-pot device that actuates after the mould is completely closed. A second approach involves the use of an injection moulding compounding unit, comprised of a twin screw compounder and a shot-pot (incorporated this time into the compounding-injection unit) that discharges material through a long nozzle into the sprue of the mould in similar fashion as the conventional injection moulding process. This paper deals with the hypothesis that the differences in the geometry of the flow channels for these two approaches affect the length, dispersion and distribution of fibres in the polymer matrix. It has been well documented in literature that fibre length affects the mechanical properties of the composite material while dispersion and distribution affect the uniformity of these properties ['"]. A systematic analysis of composite material produced with the two processing methods described above was carried out. A Coperion-Dieffenbacher D-LFT system, using a shot-pot mould, and a Coperion-Husky, using the compounding-injection moulding process, were employed to mould identical parts under similar compounding conditions. Samples were taken from the parts for a comparison of the respective fibre lengths and distribution patterns of the two moulding technologies using the micro computed tomography (CT) scanning technique. A characterization of fibre length distribution was performed on the samples using image analysis software after pyrolysis. Resulting mechanical properties were compared to provide a comprehensive picture of the two processing technologies. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In {{the central}} stage of {{material}} science, natural fibres {{appear to be}} the outstanding materials which come as the viable and abundant substitute for the expensive and nonrenewable synthetic fibre. The synergized effect of this natural fibre and thermoplastic polymer in composite include low cost, low density, acceptable specific properties, ease of separation, enhanced energy recovery, biodegradability, reduce wear on processing machinery and reduced health hazard. In this research, short pineapple leaf fibre (PALF) reinforced polypropylene (PP) composite was studied. The main objective was to achieve the optimum PALF loading in PP matrix towards better mechanical properties. PALF was prepared from raw pineapple leaf. It was then chemically treated to hinder the water content. Both PP and PALF were compounded using two-roll mill machine prior to <b>compression</b> via hot <b>press</b> machine to form a sheet. After forming the composite sheet, samples were prepared for tensile test (ASTM D 638), flexural test (ASTM D 790) and impact test (ASTM D 256). Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to investigate the miscibility between the fibre and the matrix. It was found that the Youngâ€™s modulus increased slowly and curved down after 30 wt% of PALF. Meanwhile, the composite tensile strength as well as the elongation at break reduced. However, flexural modulus and strength increased linearly with increment of fibre loadings. This trend was similar for impact strength where it exhibited a slight reduction at the initial stage but increased later on as the fibre loading increased. The study has demonstrated that the optimum fibre loading for peak performance was at 30 wt% of PALF. This was clarified further by SEM where fibres and matrix have shown better miscibility at 30 wt% of PALF...|$|R

Easy and rapid processing capability, high impact and delamination resistance, low moisture absorption and infinite shelf {{life of the}} raw materials are the attractive properties of continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite materials. Therefore, thermoplastic based composites find in many application areas in automobile, aerospace, construction, defense, transportation and marine industries. In recent years, hybrid fabrics; composed of continuous glass fibers and polymer fibers such as polypropylene (PP), {{have been used to}} fabricate thermoplastic composite with higher fiber volume fraction and improved performance. In this study, hybrid fabrics were developed by commingling the continuous PP and glass fibers using air jet and direct twist hybrid yarn preparation techniques. The hybrid commingled fabrics obtained with 450 fiber orientation and non-crimp fabric pattern. Non-crimp fabrics were obtained various fiber sizing that are compatible and incompatible with PP matrix to investigate the effect of interfacial adhesion on the properties of the thermoplastic composites.

40|$|Purpose The goal of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} correlations between the physicomechanical properties of different grades of starches with their tabletability. Methods Corn-starch grades (PURE-DENT® B 700, PURE-DENT® B 810, and PURE-DENT® B 830) and pregelatinized corn-starch grades (SPRESS® B 818, SPRESS® B 820, and SPRESS® B 825) were studied for physicomechanical properties, dynamic sorption isotherm, moisture content [MC] (% w/w), dehydration enthalpy (J/g) [ΔHd], and percent crystallinity (%). Tablets (6 mm) were compressed from hand-weighed powders (constant true volume) using Gamlen Tablet <b>Press</b> (<b>Compression</b> pressure- 100 MPa; Compression speed- 5 mm/s, 50 mm/s). Tablet mechanical strength (TMS) and Heckel parameters were evaluated. Correlation between physicomechanical properties and compression descriptors was evaluated by multivariate method. Results All starches followed Type-III sorption isotherm with open hysteresis loop indicating their large amorphous content. High amorphous content was further confirmed with hollow diffraction peaks of starches in the powder X-ray diffraction studies. Glass transition temperature of all starches was about 101 °C. The moisture content and percent crystallinity of all starches was found statistically insignificant. However, PURE-DENT® B 830 and SPRESS® B 818 showed significantly low ΔHd values. Principle component analysis (PCA) loadings plot calculated with measured physicomechanical properties and TMS showed positive correlation between high Heckel Yield pressure values of plastic and elastic deformation and negative correlation with percent crystallinity, ΔHd, and MC along PC 1. These relationships confirmed expected phenomenon in PCA score plots that Starches (PURE-DENT® B 830 and SPRESS® B 818) with plastic deformation followed by low elastic recovery in the decompression phase shows better tabletability. Furthermore, positive correlation of low ΔHd with TMS might indicate that starches with easy availability of associated water (low ΔHd) might have better tabletability due to water induced material plasticization. Conclusion Out of the six different grades of starches studied PURE-DENT® B 830 and SPRESS® B 818 showed better tabletability regardless of similar MC and amorphous nature. The better tabletability of these two starches might be attributed to their better plasticization due to loosely bound associated water, and low elastic recovery in the decompression phase...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} project was to research and to gain insight into the effects of fabrication methods and of modifying cure cycles for Newport NB- 301 12 l 2 x 2 Twill Weave Carbon Fiber material properties. The two fabrication methods used were autoclave and heat <b>press</b> (<b>compression</b> molding) methods. Each fabrication method used two cure cycles, a recommended cure cycle of 275 °F for 1 hour and a modified cure cycle of 250 °F for 1. 5 hours. The exact product data sheet of the composite used could not be found, this project attempted to generate an estimate for the missing material properties. To find tensile properties and flexural properties for each sample, testing was completed for the different cure methods. Material properties were found using the same standard of testing used by Newport Adhesives and Composites for their published data. The tensile standard used by Newport was ASTM D- 638 Type 1, however due {{to the complexity of}} manufacturing the samples a simpler standard was found (ASTM D- 3039). The flexure standard using for this project and by Newport was ASTM D- 790. After testing seven tensile samples and eight flexure samples {{for each of the four}} different configurations, it was concluded that for plate fabrication the compression molding method of the heat press resulted in the best material properties (highest modulus and highest ultimate strength. The best mechanical properties for tensile testing resulted from the recommended 275 °F cure cycle. The tensile mechanical properties that resulted from samples cured with the heat press at 275 °F had an average tensile strength of 85. 5 ksi (590 Mpa) and an average tensile modulus of 7. 08 Msi (48. 8 GPa). Unfortunately the flexure testing was not effective in displaying a clear trend for the best cure cycle. Thus no conclusion could be drawn to determine the best curing cycle for flexure...|$|R
40|$|Three {{distinct}} approaches {{were investigated}} {{in the development}} of new high and low temperature lead-free solders. These solutions include using the thermodynamic size effect to reduce melting temperature of current lead-free solders, creating a solderless interconnect through core-shell copper-silver particles, and designing of a partially molten Bi-Ag alloy for high temperature applications. ^ Suppressed melting temperatures were observed at temperatures up to 100 °C below the material 2 ̆ 7 s bulk melting temperature through DSC analysis for various tin and tin alloy nanosolders. Secondary Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the phases present as well as the particle sizes. Melting of nanoparticle solder pastes on copper coupons revealed some adhesion to the copper substrate, although the presence of flux residue prevented solid joints from forming. ^ Alloys of varying composition within the Bi-Ag binary system were investigated for high temperature applications to replace Pb 5 Sn. Microstructure analysis revealed that the binary alloy consists of a silver-rich dendritic phase within a bismuth-rich eutectic mixture. Increasing silver concentrations leads to improved mechanical properties such as hardness and strength. Electrical resistivity decreased with the addition of silver reducing from 1. 72 e- 6 2 ̆ 6 ohm;*m to 4. 23 e- 7 2 ̆ 6 ohm;*m. Micro tensile test microstructure revealed the presence of silver dendrites impeding crack propagation through the bismuth-rich eutectic by silver dendrite bridging. Wetting to a copper substrate and grain boundary grooving were observed with alloys that were heated below their liquidus temperature. ^ Copper-silver core-shell particles were used to create a solderless joint for electronics. DSC analysis identified temperatures (200 - 250 °C) which sintering of the silver shell was activated. Pressed pellets which were heated in argon were analyzed with SEM and TEM. Neck formation both before and after annealing were assessed by SEM. TEM analysis confirmed the initial silver shell thickness of 5 nm in addition to observing the silver diffusion to the neck regions at the particle contacts using EFTEM analysis before and after annealing. <b>Compression</b> tests on <b>pressed</b> pellets both as pressed and annealed revealed fractured necks in the sintered compacts.

40|$|Compression {{moulding}} is {{the ideal}} candidate for large series production of thermoplastic composite parts. Improvements in this production technique will make it more appealing for those markets that are reluctant to use composites because of their development costs. Unlike other composites processing systems, the <b>compression</b> moulding <b>press</b> is capable of producing fibre-reinforced plastic parts in significant volumes, with the accuracy, repeatability and speed to which, for example, the automotive industry has been accustomed in the stamping of metal parts. This thesis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the behaviour of the rubber mould during compression moulding of thermoplastics and consequently at the reduction of the development costs and improving the design of the rubber mould. The classical problems that need to be addressed when designing a rubber mould are the correct dimensions to accommodate the laminate and the positions of the details. The standard process, though, does not take into account the temperature changes in the mould during production and in particular the effect of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the rubber. In this thesis, an envisioned method to reduce this problem is to add a certain amount of aramide in the rubber mould, in order to restrict the expansion due to increased temperature. The second issue that has to be considered is the friction between the melted thermoplastic and the rubber mould. The use of lubricant is extremely effective, but can be used only in a prototyping phase, as the lubricant affects the mechanical properties of the thermoplastic composite. Proper modelling of the rubber forming process, considering the correct rubber parameters, allows identification of the problems that might occur during manufacturing. The way to eliminate those problems numerically, though, is computationally challenging as well as uncertain and time consuming. With those results in mind, an improved method was developed which substitutes the flexible rubber mould with a collection of rubber particles. The collection of rubber particles acts in a way similar to that of a fluid and has the advantage of filling the mould completely so that there is always contact between the rigid and the flexible mould. The new method allows the manufacturing of a wider range of products and allows the reduction of development costs related to the definition of the proper rubber mould shape. To be able to describe the collection of rubber particles as a homogeneus material, a series of tests has been designed for the determination of some of their physical parameters. The obtained material has a very variable stiffness, from a very low modulus when the particles are not compressed, to two orders of magnitude higher values when compaction is almost complete. Bulk and shear modulus are related to the Poisson’s ratio that does not vary much during the entire process, having a value always slightly below 0. 5. This value is consistent with the fluid-like behavior in the beginning of the process and with the, almost incompressible, solid rubber block at the end of the process. Finally, the parameters found have been used to model the compression moulding process with a collection of rubber particles. Modeling is not strictly necessary because most of the existing problems in the conventional production method have been eliminated. However it might become useful when the limitations of the new production technique will be explored and in particular for those geometries that are not possible with the conventional method.

Bauer-Brandl: 'Prediction of tablet manufacturability from compression parameters: a basic study using simple model materials' (manuscript) Although the tablet has been produced in large quantities for a long time, {{there is a need}} for better understanding of the manufacturing process. This thesis deals with compression analysis for assessment of mechanical properties and tablet manufacturability prediction. The goal was to increase the understanding of the response in the powder material during the tableting process. For this purpose, compression testing of powder material was conducted. This method allows for poorly compacted materials to be studied, but the critical point is the physical interpretation of the compression parameters derived. Therefore, the first part of the thesis deals with investigation of the interpretation of parameters from the Kawakita and Shapiro- model. It was found that a combination of the Kawakita a and b- 1 parameters into an ab- index could reflect the incidence of particle rearrangement. Furthermore, it was found that for materials showing low degree of particle rearrangement, the initial curvature in a Heckel profile was a reflection of the degree of particle fragmentation, described mathematically by the Shapiro f parameter. In addition, the deformability of the particles could be assessed by the Heckel yield pressure. These three descriptors were combined into a classification system which was challenged by compression analysis of a large set of pharmaceutically relevant materials. The results indicated that a sequential approach was effective for assessment of mechanical properties and a description of this in the form of a protocol was suggested. Furthermore, the tableting relevant information found in compression data was evaluated by multivariate calibration. The Kawakita a parameter was the only compression parameter able to point towards the resulting tablet strength. The results further indicated that the Kawakita b- 1 parameter corresponded to the pressure needed to initiate deformation of the bulk and hence needed to produce a coherent tablet. This thesis presents a protocol for the assessment of mechanical properties of pharmaceutical powders, and evaluates the tableting relevant information brought forward by compression data. This could be useful in a formulation development phase, enhance process understanding and possible also be applicable for monitoring of the tableting process...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of fibre-reinforced composites is, {{to a large}} extent, controlled by the properties of fibre-matrix interfaces. The interface chemistry and character is vital to a composite material. Good interfacial properties are essential to ensure efficient load transfer from matrix to reinforcement, which helps to reduce stress concentrations and improves overall sustainability of mechanical properties. The strength of composite materials depends {{not only on the}} substrate but also on the interface strength. The interface here does not have unique fracture energy unlike homogeneous materials. Consequently, there is a great interest in developing new concepts for tailoring the strength of fibre-matrix interface. Some of researchers have been reported the mechanisms responsible for improved fibre-matrix interface adhesion is removing weak boundary layer, and thereby improving wettability. However, a high performance composite functions because a weaker interface or matrix stops a crack running continuously between the strong brittle reinforcements. Fibre reinforced composite materials do, however, suffer some serious environmental limitations. Environmental exposures include temperature, moisture, radiations, UV and other different alkali treatments, which cause deterioration in the mechanical and/or physical behaviour, adhesion between fibre/matrix interface regions of the composite material over a period of time. The aim of the current investigation is to present the variation of mechanical properties of glass fiber/epoxy composite under the synergistic effect of temperature and rate of loading. In case of temperature we performed 2 types of cases as above and below glass transition temperature (Tg) and in second case abobe and below-ambient temperature. Glass fibre reinforced polymer composites (GFRP), carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites (CFRP) and Kevlar fibre reinforced polymer composites were fabricated by hand-lay up method followed by <b>compression</b> molding <b>press.</b> The composite specimens were subjected to elevated and high temperatures as + 60 °C,+ 100 °C,+ 150 °C and + 200 °C temperatures. 3 -Point short beam shear test and 4 -point short beam shear test were conducted in order to characterize the mechanical behavior of laminated composite and to determine the influence of loading rate on interlaminar shear strength. To understand the interactions between various failure mechanisms in the fiber, matrix and fiber/matrix interface, microscopic analyses were conducted. In second case we performed in-depth analysis of interlaminar shear test and failure mechanisms of glass fibre/epoxy, carbon fibre/epoxy and Kevlar fibre/epoxy composites under + 50 °C,- 50 °C,+ 100 °C and- 100 °C temperatures and different crosshead velocity. Different high and low temperature conditioning were performed using Instron with environmental chamber providing additional information regarding in-situ failure of laminated composites. Following the test, the fracture surfaces of the samples were scanned under SEM to understand the dominating failure modes. Microstructural assessments can also reveal the response of each constituent viz. fibre, matrix resin and the interface/interphase; under temperature and mechanical loading. This section comprehensively presents the mechanical behaviour and structural changes in fibrous polymeric composite systems during the mechanical loading under high and low temperature service environment. We specifically tailored this potential to describe the contradiction and confusion at polymer composite interface which may not be underestimated by material scientists. Fibre/matrix adhesion involves very complex physical and chemical mechanisms. One of the most important physical aspects is the geometry of reinforcing fibres, which influences adhesion between fibre and matrix, stress transfer and local mechanisms of failure. In addition to chemical bonding, the fibre/matrix bond strength in shear is largely dependent on the roughness of the fibre surface and the fibre/matrix contact area. At cryogenic temperatures, due to difference in coefficient of thermal expansion between the fibre and the matrix phase, microcracks initiate and propagate through the laminated composites. Therefore, knowledge of the resistance to different failure modes of woven fabric composites laminates at cryogenic temperatures is essential to the materials scientist and design analyst. The aim of this investigation was to study deformation and mechanical behaviour of glass fibre/epoxy composites subjected to 3 -point short beam shear test at low and ultra-low temperature with different loading speeds. The laminates were tested at ambient (+ 27 °C) temperature and at (- 20 °C,- 40 °C,- 60 °C) temperatures using liquid nitrogen in an environmental chamber installed on an Instron testing machine. Testing was carried out in different loading covering low to high medium speeds. Following the test the fracture surfaces were scanned under SEM microscope. A need probably exists for an assessment of mechanical {{performance of}} such potentially promising materials under the influence of changing environment and loading speed. Using fractography study to characterize the onset and growth of failure modes has become generally accepted method. During thermal cycling differential coefficient of thermal expansions and residual stresses is a prime cause in fibre reinforced polymer composites (FRP) material. The behavior of the interfacial contact between fibre and matrix is strongly influenced by the presence and nature of residual stresses. GFRP and CFRP composite laminates are used to analyze the thermal cycle effect on the mechanical behavior with different loading rates. 3 -point short beam shear test was performed for the analyze the mechanical behavior. To study the failure modes which have great impact on mechanical behavior, Scanning electorn microscope (SEM) was used. The ensuing research revealed a number of key challenges regarding interface issues in producing polymer nanocomposites that exhibit a desired behavior. The greatest stumbling block to the large-scale production and commercialization of nanocomposites is the dearth of cost effective methods for controlling the dispersion of the nanoparticles in polymeric matrix. Current interest in alumina/epoxy nanocomposites, Cu nano particle and Multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) has been generated and maintained because nanoparticles filled polymers exhibit unique combinations of properties not achievable with conventional composites. In the present study, glass fiber reinforced composites filled with nanoparticle have been prepared. 3 -point short beam shear test was conducted to analyze the Interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) variation with different loading rate. Alumina nanoparticle was well dispersed in epoxy polymer matrix to achieved high mechanical performance. The results show {{that it is possible to}} improve the interlaminar shear strength with the loading rate variations. Clearly, no follow-up work in this area will be commendation for better understanding of effect of nanoparticle in FRP composites in assessment of loading rate sensitivity. Under these conditions, fibre reinforced polymer nanocomposites have been shown to exhibit two glass-transition temperatures, Tg: one associated with polymer chains far from the nanoparticles, and a second, larger Tg, associated with chains in the vicinity of the particles. To analyze different failure modes SEM analyses was conducted. Good interfacial properties are essential to ensure efficient load transfer from matrix to fillers, which helps to reduce stress concentrations and improves overall mechanical properties. Consequently, there is great interest in developing new concepts for improving the strength of fibre−matrix interface. ...|$|R
