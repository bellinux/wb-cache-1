40|$|Abstract: Wool used in {{this study}} was {{collected}} from Falahi sheep after shearing and from Falahi hides after unhairing process by both chemical and enzymatic treatments. The underlying study investigates the possibility of increasing the percent of pulled wool via blending with wool. Unhairing process using enzyme treatment not only considered as environmentally friendly but also gives better pulled wool compared with chemical one. As much as we increase pulled wool in the blend, the profit tended to increase while yarn strength and yarn regularity tended to decrease. Pulled wool percentage is reasonable at 25 %, risky at 50 % and not favorable at 75 %. Yarns from pulled wool is preferable to use in hand made fabric, which needs 100 % wool and low yarn quality compared with mechanical textile. <b>Chemical</b> <b>unhairing</b> treatment significantly decrease the wool content of amino acids, sulfur content as sulfur ion and as sulfur amino acid (Methionine), as well as some physical properties like staple and yarn strength, yarn elongation and yarn regularity expressed by increasing number of fine and thick places as well as number of nodes.

40|$|Abstract Many {{factors such}} as {{production}} methods fibre quality and structural parameters have distinctive influence on the quality and performance of a hand woven carpet. Because the most common fiber used for producing handmade carpet is wool this experiment was aimed to identify virgin and pulled wool characteristics of Tunisian sheep breeds. A total of 84 sheep and 15 samples of commercial pulled wool were used in this study. Samples of fiber were analyzed using standard objective measurements for staple length SL mean fiber diameter MFD coefficient of variation of fiber diameter FDCV fine fiber contain FC Breaking strength and Elongation. Results showed that Tunisian wool {{can be considered as}} medium wool. By conducting well-planned sorting Fine Queue of west sheep breed can supply the wool needed for textile industries. The wool of other sheep breeds can be used in handmade carpets. Also staple strength as one of the important wool characteristic affected significantly by alkali treatment during <b>chemical</b> <b>unhairing</b> process compared with wool collected by shearing process. Great attention must be paid to know the real characteristics of pulled wool before using it in handmade carpet industry...|$|E
40|$|Proteases {{are used}} in leather {{manufacture}} in the processes of soaking, unhairing and bating of hides and skins. However proteases can be relatively non-specific in their usage, and for improved efficacy of enzyme biocatalysis within the industry, an analysis of specific activities of enzymes towards skin proteins was undertaken. Most commercial proteases for soaking showed substantial activity against the substrates elastin-Congo Red and Azocoll but little or no activity against keratin-azure and hide powder black. Enzymes used for unhairing in conjunction with 30 % of the usual concentration of sulfide to effect <b>chemical</b> <b>unhairing</b> showed moderate activity against all substrates tested (selected as representative of skin proteins), while proteases used in bating showed activity against Azocoll and elastin-Congo Red but had no keratinase activity and little activity against hide powder black. Bating proteases and soaking proteases displayed similar activities at pH 8. Microbes isolated in the screening of organisms from putrefied skins included one fungal and two bacterial isolates whose extracellular enzymes had efficient unhairing activity without the addition of sulfide. Enzyme activities for these proteases included high activity measured against Azocoll {{with little or no}} activity against elastin-Congo Red, keratin-azure and hide powder black. Neither elastase nor keratinase activities were determined as being essential for unhairing...|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{diminish}} the pollution being discharged into wastewaters through changes in the unhairing process. To this aim, we are replacing a reductive hair degrading process with a process which combines a reductive hair degrading process with an oxidative hair degrading process. Hydrogen peroxide is used to decrease the supply of sulfide as <b>unhairing</b> <b>chemical.</b> As a result, commercially acceptable leather regarding both costs and quality is obtained and significant reductions in the contaminant load of the wastewater being discharged are observed. Results indicate that wastewater conductivity is cut by 26...|$|R
