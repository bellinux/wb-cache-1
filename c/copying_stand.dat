30|$|A LuminousFilm {{fiber optic}} light sheet was placed beneath the {{manuscript}} leaves and images were captured with a Canon EOS digital camera {{mounted on a}} <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Copy</b> <b>stands</b> are {{sometimes}} recommended as a low-cost {{alternative to a}} full-featured animation stand for traditional cel animation, especially when using small film formats such as Super 8.|$|R
50|$|In film cameras, <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> are {{traditionally}} used with slide film. The fine resolution of slide film allows the images to be reproduced with high fidelity {{when they are}} projected.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} statue [...] "Boy with a Fish" [...] by Verrocchio is on {{exhibit in}} one of the smaller rooms (the <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> on the fountain in the first courtyard).|$|R
5000|$|The Clonmacnoise crosses: Cross of the Scriptures (the {{original}} 9th century {{cross is}} housed in a museum, but a <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> on the original site), and the North and South Crosses.|$|R

50|$|Numerous copies {{exist in}} museums and {{galleries}} around the world; {{one of the}} best-known <b>copies</b> <b>stands</b> outside the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas. The first FIFA World Cup trophy, commissioned in 1930 and designed by Abel Lafleur, was based on the model.|$|R
50|$|The House of the Faun in Pompei, {{dating from}} the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the {{centerpiece}} of the large garden. The original now resides in the National Museum in Naples and a <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> in its place.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Copy</b> <b>stands</b> can be {{used for}} {{reprography}} (that is, to copy documents). To do so, the camera is mounted, usually with a standard 1/4" [...] tripod-mount screw, onto the stand, pointing the lens down at the base, where the document to be copied would be placed.|$|R
5000|$|The camera {{must be on}} a {{grounded}} platform, such as a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> or tripod. In general, {{the human}} body cannot stop natural vibrations with a camera shutter speed slower than 1/60 of a second. Using a grounded platform will allow the subject matter to be in complete focus.|$|R
50|$|Flat art {{was created}} by {{using a variety of}} {{standard}} graphic illustration techniques, using pen and ink, airbrush, paints, from clip art, colored paper, transfer lettering such as Letraset, and by copying from existing materials on a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> or on optical slide camera. Cel art, such as found in cel animation, was also used.|$|R
50|$|The bronze {{sculpture}} Judith and Holofernes (1457-64), {{created by}} Donatello {{at the end}} of his career, can be seen in the Hall of Lilies (Sala dei Gigli), in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, Italy.

5000|$|The {{prominently}} sited statue {{was well}} liked by the Ancient Romans, and copies {{have been found}} in Roman palaces and gymnasiums: another, coarser <b>copy,</b> <b>stood</b> in the courtyard of Palazzo Farnese; one with the feigned (but probably ancient) inscription [...] "Lykippos" [...] has stood in the court of Palazzo Pitti, Florence, since the sixteenth century.Ancient copies of the statue include: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} hardware {{used for}} herbarium specimen imaging is the [...] "HerbScan" [...] scanner. It is an inverted flat-bed scanner {{which raises the}} specimen up to the scanning surface. This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed book scanner or a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> {{to achieve the same}} effect.|$|R
50|$|In photography, a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> is {{a device}} used to copy images and/or text with a camera. The stand {{consists}} of a board onto which the media is placed and a tripod-mount parallel to it, usually with an adjustable height. Light is provided by bright lamps mounted {{on either side of}} the media at 45° angles. This provides uniform lighting and reduces specular reflection, keeping glare low.|$|R
50|$|The Noddy {{video camera}} was {{servo-controlled}} {{to pan and}} tilt ('nod') across a matrix of pre-arranged physical objects - captions and mechanical models. The camera was black-and-white, with electronically synthesised colour added to its output. This system eliminated the delay associated with swapping graphics upon a conventional <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b> It also allowed for the depth required by mechanical objects such as clocks and a rotating globe.|$|R
50|$|A small {{permanent}} exhibition on the nunnery's {{history can}} be seen in the parish house of Rüegsauschachen, displaying finds from excavations in 1964, 1965 - 1968 and 1978 - 1979 (for example, colour-glazed oven tiles, shards of pottery, tools and the fragments of a reliquary box). The excavations also unearthed a statue of the Virgin Mary from the time of the nunnery, of which a <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> in the hall next to the church.|$|R

5000|$|Better Light scan backs {{replace the}} common 4x5 film {{cassettes}} used in all 4x5 view cameras {{of both the}} studio and field types and also works in <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> and microscopes that have 4x5 film stages on them as well. The form factor {{is close to the}} same one found in the Polaroid 545 Land Film Holder. As a scanning system (opposed to the instant capture systems), conceptually similar to a desktop flatbed scanner redesigned to fit into a Polaroid 545 back.|$|R
5000|$|His {{most famous}} {{work is the}} Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry Monument (1860), that {{originally}} stood in the Public Square in Cleveland, Ohio. The monument was relocated several times, and since 1991 has stood in Fort Huntington Park, beside the Cuyahoga County Courthouse. His weathered marble statue of Perry was replaced with a bronze copy in 1928. A second bronze <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> outside the Rhode Island Statehouse, in Providence, Rhode Island. The original marble is now displayed inside the visitor center at the Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial in Put-in-Bay, Ohio. Walcutt's statue appears on the 2013 [...] "Perry's Victory" [...] quarter.|$|R
50|$|The Horatio Nelson statue that {{originally}} stood atop Nelson's column in Place Jacques Cartier was relocated to the Montreal History Museum in 1997 for preservation. A <b>copy</b> now <b>stands</b> atop the column in its place.|$|R
50|$|Contrary to {{its name}} (Digital Negative) the DNG format doesn't {{distinguish}} negative and positive data - all data {{is considered to be}} describing a positive image. While this is not an issue when working with images from digital cameras (which are always positive), working with scanned (by a film scanner or DSLR <b>copy</b> <b>stand)</b> film negatives saved as raw DNG files is complicated, because the resulted image is not automatically inverted and thus impossible to be used directly. A way to get around this is using an inverted curve in the photo editing application, however this reverses the effect of the image controls (Exposure, Shadow and Highlight details, etc) which complicates the photo editing.|$|R
50|$|The armoury {{contains}} a unique collection of stabbing and cutting weapons, firearms, war relics, and heraldic emblems. The picture gallery {{is full of}} remarkable paintings dating {{as far back as}} the Renaissance era. A bronze elephant sculpture in the courtyard is a copy made in 2003. The original elephant from 1916, had been stolen from its original owners by Nazis and brought to the castle. The sculpture was installed and remained lost for 50 years, standing here in the courtyard. The owners found the elephant and it was returned to them to make amends for the Holocaust. Now the elephant is back home in Switzerland and the <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> in its place to delight visitors, who gently touch it.|$|R
50|$|The first {{attempts}} and prototypes {{were mostly}} simple video cameras on a <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b> During the mid-1970s these were assembled and equipped with additional lighting {{to ensure that}} they were able to operate in darkened rooms, and also to provide a consistent quality of projected image. The technology of video cameras during this time, was a key factor in the development of document camera systems. Document cameras have also frequently benefited from developments in other industries, which also facilitated significant advances in the field of document camera technology. A good example of this is the technology used in photographic equipment, which has contributed much to the development of the document camera as a high quality presentation tool.|$|R
50|$|The {{church at}} Valþjófsstaður {{contains}} a modern hand-carved {{copy of the}} door. Stephens mentions a copy in the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum).

5000|$|Donatellos Saint Mark (1411-1413) is {{a marble}} statue that stands {{approximately}} seven feet and nine inches high and is {{displayed in the}} museum of the Orsanmichele church, Florence. It originally was displayed in an exterior niche of the church, where a <b>copy</b> now <b>stands.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1910 she was {{commissioned}} {{to create a}} frieze for the Pan American Union building in Washington D.C. This work, called the Frieze of Discoverers, contributed to her winning a commission from the government of Venezuela to execute the equestrian Simon Bolivar (1921). Originally cast in duplicate, one <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> {{at the head of}} the Avenue of the Americas in New York City. Despite the complications of her divorce two years earlier, in 1916, Sally competed against twenty other sculptors to win this highly prized commission. At the time it was both the largest monument sculpted by a woman and the only equestrian monument of a man created by a female artist.. It took five years to complete and earned her the Order of Bolivar (the greatest civilian honor given by the Venezuelan government).|$|R
