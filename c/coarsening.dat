40|$|We study a {{two-stage}} mixed-integer linear program (MILP) {{with more}} than 1 million binary variables in the second stage. We develop a two-level approach by constructing a semi-coarse model (<b>coarsened</b> with respect to variables) and a coarse model (<b>coarsened</b> with respect to both variables and constraints). We <b>coarsen</b> binary variables by selecting {{a small number of}} pre-specified daily on/off profiles. We aggregate constraints by partitioning them into groups and summing over each group. With an appropriate choice of <b>coarsened</b> profiles, the semi-coarse model is guaranteed to find a feasible solution of the original problem and hence provides an upper bound on the optimal solution. We show that solving a sequence of coarse models converges to the same upper bound with proven finite steps. This is achieved by adding violated constraints to coarse models until all constraints in the semi-coarse model are satisfied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in cogeneration for buildings. The <b>coarsened</b> models allow us to obtain good approximate solutions {{at a fraction of the}} time required by solving the original problem.

40|$|We {{consider}} generalized {{linear models}} with a <b>coarsened</b> covariate. The term 'coarsened' is used here {{to refer to}} the case where the exact value of the covariate of interest is not fully observed. Instead, only some set or grouping that contains the exact value is observed. In particular, we propose a likelihood-based method for estimating regression parameters in a generalized linear model relating the mean of the outcome to covariates. We outline Newton-Raphson and EM algorithms for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the regression parameters. We also compare and contrast this likelihood-based approach with two somewhat "ad hoc" procedures: a complete-case analysis in which individuals with <b>coarsened</b> data are excluded and estimation is based on the remaining 'complete cases', and a <b>coarsened</b> data regression model in which the covariate values for all the complete cases are <b>coarsened</b> and then included in a regression model relating the mean to the <b>coarsened</b> covariate. The methodology that is presented is motivated by <b>coarsened</b> data on the racial-ethnicity categorization of patients in the US's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a study to examine the medical care that is provided to a patient in a physician's office. In this study, the outcome of interest is the level of tests (none, non-invasive tests or invasive tests) ordered for the patient at the doctor's visit. One of the covariates of interest is the patient's four-level discrete covariate comprised of four racial-ethnicity categories: white-Hispanic, white-non-Hispanic, African-American-Hispanic and African-American-non-Hispanic. However, of the 19 [*] 095 patients in the sample, 14 [*] 955 (or 78 %) have the exact category of race-ethnicity recorded and 4140 (or 22 %) have race-ethnicity <b>coarsened.</b> For the latter group of 4140 individuals, the ethnicity is not recorded, but we know that 3683 are white and 457 are African-American.

40|$|AbstractThe {{hot forging}} {{deformation}} experiments {{of a new}} type high performance powder metallurgy (P/M) turbine disk superalloy FGH 98 I has been performed under {{the conditions of the}} deformation temperatures of 1050 - 1100 °C and strain rates of 0. 0003 ∼ 0. 01 s- 1, and then with subsequent subsolvus and supersolvus heat treatments for 0. 25 - 1 h. The results show that FGH 98 I alloy exhibits the desired thermoplastic response under the testing conditions. The forging flow stress increases with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature. The mean grain size of as-forged FGH 98 I varies between 6. 0 μm and 8. 0 μm, and only slightly <b>coarsens</b> with the increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. The mean grain size of the subsolvus heat treated specimens varies between 8. 6 μm and 24 μm, slowly <b>coarsens</b> with increasing solution time, and moderately <b>coarsens</b> with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. The mean grain size under supersolvus heat treated varies between 10 μm and 46 μm, obviously <b>coarsens</b> with increasing temperature and solution time, and <b>coarsens</b> with decreasing strain rate. The above results can be used for optimizing the practical forging process of FGH 98 I disk alloy...|$|R

60|$|The Achilles heel of vivisection, however, {{is not to}} {{be found}} in the pain it causes, but in the line of {{argument}} by which it is justified. The medical code regarding it is simply criminal anarchism at its very worst. Indeed no criminal has yet had the impudence to argue as every vivisector argues. No burglar contends that as it is admittedly important to have money to spend, and as the object of burglary is to provide the burglar with money to spend, and as in many instances it has achieved this object, therefore the burglar is a public benefactor and the police are ignorant sentimentalists. No highway robber has yet harrowed us with denunciations of the puling moralist who allows his child to suffer all the evils of poverty because certain faddists think it dishonest to garotte an alderman. Thieves and assassins understand quite well that there are paths of acquisition, even of the best things, that are barred to all men of honor. Again, has the silliest burglar ever pretended that to put a stop to burglary is to put a stop to industry? All the vivisections that have been performed since the world began have produced nothing so important as the innocent and honorable discovery of radiography; and one of the reasons why radiography was not discovered sooner was that the men whose business it was to discover new clinical methods were <b>coarsening</b> and stupefying themselves with the sensual villanies and cutthroat's casuistries of vivisection. The law of the conservation of energy holds good in physiology as in other things: every vivisector is a deserter from the army of honorable investigators. But the vivisector does not see this. He not only calls his methods scientific: he contends that there are no other scientific methods. When you express your natural loathing for his cruelty and your natural contempt for his stupidity, he imagines that you are attacking science. Yet he has no inkling of the method and temper of science. The point at issue being plainly whether he is a rascal or not, he not only insists that the real point is whether some hotheaded antivivisectionist is a liar (which he proves by ridiculously unscientific assumptions as to the degree of accuracy attainable in human statement), but never dreams of offering any scientific evidence by his own methods.|$|E
6000|$|Three weeks {{afterward}} {{he stood in}} front of Olive Chancellor's house, looking {{up and down the street}} and hesitating. He had told Mrs. Luna that he should like nothing better than to make another journey to Boston; and it was not simply because he liked it that he had come. I was on the point of saying that a happy chance had favoured him, but it occurs to me that one is under no obligation to call chances by nattering epithets when they have been waited for so long. At any rate, the darkest hour is before the dawn; and a few days after that melancholy evening I have described, which Ransom spent in his German beer-cellar, before a single glass, soon emptied, staring at his future with an unremunerated eye, he found that the world appeared to have need of him yet. The [...] "party," [...] as he would have said (I cannot pretend that his speech was too heroic for that), for whom he had transacted business in Boston so many months before, and who had expressed at the time but a limited appreciation of his services (there had been between the lawyer and his client a divergence of judgement), observing, apparently, that they proved more fruitful than he expected, had reopened the affair and presently requested Ransom to transport himself again to the sister city. His errand demanded more time than before, and for three days he gave it his constant attention. On the fourth he found he was still detained; he should have to wait till the evening--some important papers were to be prepared. He determined to treat the interval as a holiday, and he wondered what one could do in Boston to give one's morning a festive complexion. The weather was brilliant enough to minister to any illusion, and he strolled along the streets, taking it in. In front of the Music Hall and of Tremont Temple he stopped, looking at the posters in the doorway; for was it not possible that Miss Chancellor's little friend might be just then addressing her fellow-citizens? Her name was absent, however, and this resource seemed to mock him. He knew no one in the place but Olive Chancellor, so there was no question of a visit to pay. He was perfectly resolved that he would never go near her again; she was doubtless a very superior being, but she had been too rough with him to tempt him further. Politeness, even a largely-interpreted [...] "chivalry", required nothing more than he had already done; he had quitted her, the other year, without telling her that she was a vixen, and that reticence was chivalrous enough. There was also Verena Tarrant, of course; he saw no reason to dissemble when he spoke of her to himself, and he allowed himself the entertainment of feeling that he should like very much to see her again. Very likely she wouldn't seem to him the same; the impression she had made upon him was due to some accident of mood or circumstance; and, at any rate, any charm she might have exhibited then had probably been obliterated by the <b>coarsening</b> effect of publicity and the tonic influence of his kinswoman. It will be observed that in this reasoning of Basil Ransom's the impression was freely recognised, and recognised as a phenomenon still present. The attraction might have vanished, as he said to himself, but the mental picture of it was yet vivid. The greater the pity that he couldn't call upon Verena (he called her by her name in his thoughts, it was so pretty) without calling upon Olive, and that Olive was so disagreeable as to place that effort beyond his strength. There was another consideration, with Ransom, which eminently belonged to the man; he believed that Miss Chancellor had conceived, in the course of those few hours, and in a manner that formed so absurd a sequel to her having gone out of her way to make his acquaintance, such a dislike to him that it would be odious to her to see him again within her doors; and he would have felt indelicate in taking warrant from her original invitation (before she had seen him) to inflict on her a presence which he had no reason to suppose the lapse of time had made less offensive. She had given him no sign of pardon or penitence in any of the little ways that are familiar to women--by sending him a message through her sister, or even a book, a photograph, a Christmas card, or a newspaper, by the post. He felt, in a word, not at liberty to ring at her door; he didn't know what kind of a fit the sight of his long Mississippian person would give her, and it was characteristic of him that he should wish so to spare the sensibilities of a young lady whom he had not found tender; being ever as willing to let women off easily in the particular case as he was fixed in the belief that the sex in general requires watching.|$|E
