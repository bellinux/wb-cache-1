40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on {{diseases}} of the limbs in high-yield dairy cows, causes of diseases and their treatment options. Here are described factors that influence the incidence of disease in farms and its expansion. In the reporting breed was assessed health status hoof total of 437 dairy cows in three cycles of treatment. As part of a treatment cycle of the treatment, cure or control individual hooves of dairy cows. The most common disease was Rusterholz´s ulcer (56 %), other diseases assessed were represented on average 10 %. It was a foot rot, dermatitis digitalis, dermatitis interdigitalis and mechanical damage to limbs cows. No health problems have been a total of 20 % of dairy cows. Here are described factors that influence the incidence of disease in farms and its expansion. Finally, they were also considered external factors that can influence {{the health of the}} hoof. It was mainly the effect of diet, environment, technology, housing or affect the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>hooves...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{adjustments}} hooves. In the literature review, this work focuses on {{the description of the}} anatomy and physiology of the hoof. In addition to the description and characterization of the hoof mechanism. The work also {{deals with the}} characteristics of regular and irregular hooves. The next part is focused on the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>hooves</b> and a description of each method barefoot trim and physiological hoof trimming by dr. Strasser, grating method for using white line, mustang roll and trim. The work also follows basic description of horse shoeing. The practical part concerns the development of the questionnaire and its evaluation to the graphs and tables. The result of this work is that from 631 horses, 176 and 455 shod horses are only grated. Furthermore, it is found that only eighteen from 631 horses uses orthopedic shoeing. Of the 120 respondents, 44 % said, that grates horse with farrier pasture trim, 17 % shredded by white line, 14 % uses a different method, than which has been listed in the questionnaire, 8 % do not know which method they use, 7 % use physiological adaptation by dr. Strasser, 5 % method by white line and mustang roll, 5 % use only mustang roll. Even 39 % of respondents sports with his bare horse. In this work, we can see that the popularity of barefoot trim is really great and the owners and breeders of horses starts to turn more and more on this method...|$|E
40|$|Our {{choice of}} horses {{is based on}} {{specific}} kriteria. We choose horses for work or sport. We can not expect any results in ether of those sectors, without the ringht <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>hooves.</b> Because of little interest in care hoof apparatus, there are occure other health problems, which cause problems {{in other parts of}} horse's limbs. Main part of this work includes description of chosen hoof apparatus diseases. There are stated causes of growth, its treatment and prevention. There are many diseases of hoof apparatus, so I chose the ones, which are most frequently seen in practice. Without anatomical knowledge of hood {{it would be impossible to}} horseshoeing a horse or treat it, so I think, that it is necessary for horseshoer to have this knowledge for application of shoeing in practice. I look into this topic in individual chapter. I sorted large amount of information about diseases of outter and inner part of hoof. Chapters included one of the most frequently occuring horse hoof diseases. Cause of development isn't clear to this day, so it is one of the most interesting diseases. Further, I mention quality of horn and it is diseases. For example: lair, cleft and rings hoof wall. Wrong diet and excessive work are one of the most frequent factors influencing and possibly causing those diseases. Last, but not least, is unsuitable environment, where are horses kept. That is the reason why the hoof care is very important, and also stable hygiene and dietary plan for every horse idividually, depending on horse's age, work load and other factors...|$|E
50|$|The {{village has}} {{a team of}} shoemakers that has subsisted to date, despite the {{national}} economic crisis and desertification of the countryside.It also {{used to have a}} bellows maker ("Foleiro") and a farrier ("Ferrador") that took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> horse's <b>hooves</b> <b>of</b> the village during many decades, but both activities are now extinct in Cerejais.|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} a farriery from the {{beginning}} of its history, through Middle Ages and Modern Era until present day. From barefoot horses through hipposandals through to nailed horseshoes toward modern specialities such as plastic "glued on" horseshoes and footwear. Mentions the anatomy <b>of</b> the horse <b>hoof.</b> The knowledge <b>of</b> anatomical structures and functionality <b>of</b> a <b>hoof</b> is crucial for horseshoeing and for barefoot walk as well. The ancient farriers were aware of this and merely thanks to their knowledge of anatomy and physiology of limbs they were able to cure most of the diseases <b>of</b> horse <b>hoof</b> at that time. Today these skills are just as important for chosing the right shoeing as well as customizing the conventional horse shoe to a particular horse. Further deals with the characteristics and materials used for production of horseshoes, their different types and tools used by farriers. <b>Care</b> <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> is essential,the regular care and especially the treatment before shoeing - (often neglected) which makes it far easier for the farrier. The main point of the work is farriery acts including corect selection of horseshoes and their shaping. I also mention pros and cons of horseshoeing. The most extensive chapter addresses horseshoeing of horses for different utilization, racing horses working at high speeds, draft horses for labour or horses for tourism. I focus on horseshoeing based on utilization and performance of the horse. The integral part of this work is a chapter condemning horseshoeing as such, stating different opinions from so-called barefooters presenting us with the other point of view Finally, points to the alternative ways of horseshoeing and their pros and cons...|$|R
40|$|Aim of this diploma thesis was {{to analyze}} the {{conditions}} of limbs and hooves of the horses in agrotourist businesses in the Czech Republic. In {{the first part of}} the analysis, the conditions of breeding (stabling type, work intensity, ground and surface of the riding halls, <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>hooves)</b> and study of these horses (number of horses, age, breed, numbers of geldings and mares) were evaluated. These values were then recorded into the prepared form. In the other part of the analysis, the ground measuring followed. Four basic parameters were measured and evaluated: posture of the forelimbs and its discrepancies, posture of the hindlimbs and its discrepancies, angle and defects of fore hooves, angle and defects of the hind hooves). From these four basic parametres, 32 various differentiations were assessed, whilst not all of them were present at the measured population of the horses. Those values were statistically processed and compared in the Unistat program. During the evaluation of particular bodily proportions, an effect of six factors was assessed: effect of breed, sex, age, way of trimming hooves, intensity of trimming hooves, and effect of stabling type. The highest rate of statistically conclusive effects was detected at the age effect, which was statistically conclusive to affect six differentiations and significantly statistically affected one differentiation. Also effect of the breed highly affected the measured parameters. Statistically conclusive effect was detected at two measured differentiations. Statistically significantly conclusive effect was detected at four more differentiations. The effect of sex, way and intensity of trimming hooves and stabling type was not that considerable, but still yielded some measured values...|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the jobs}} of farrier and {{blacksmith}} were practically synonymous, shown by the etymology of the word: farrier comes from Middle French: ferrier (blacksmith), from the Latin word ferrum (iron). A farrier's work in colonial America or pre-Industrial Revolution Europe would have included shoeing horses, {{as well as the}} fabrication and repair of tools, the forging of architectural pieces, and so on. Modern day farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing, focusing their time and effort on the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the horse's <b>hoof.</b> For this reason, farriers and blacksmiths are considered to be in separate, albeit related, trades.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDuring {{four months}} in the winter period of 2002 – 2003, a census of four species <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals (red deer, sika deer, roe deer, and musk deer) was {{conducted}} in the study areas of the Sikhote-Alin Reserve and the surrounding area, including {{the territory of the}} planned Reserve Tavayza. The census was conducted on a monthly basis at two sites in the pine and broadleaved forest (nature Reserve and surrounding area) and at three sites in the oak and broadleaved forest. A total of 40 counts were made. Five fieldworkers were working at each site for two days. During the first day, the fieldworkers counted daily hoof prints and removed them. During the second day, newly appearing hoof prints were counted. In addition to the usual counting <b>of</b> crossings <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals, the number of individual animals was counted, as well. Thus, the census was conducted by two methods: counting <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> prints in the tracks and counting of individual animals in a certain area. The results of these surveys were organized into a database which shows the relative density <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals (number <b>of</b> crossings <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> prints per 10 km of the route) and absolute density <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals (number <b>of</b> individuals per km 2). The analysis of absolute density <b>of</b> <b>hoofed</b> animals in different habitats and its correlation with the number <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> prints per 10 km was performed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect <b>of</b> regular <b>hoof</b> trimming on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> diseases and their impact on the culling of dairy cows. The experiment was carried at the farm located in northern Slovakia, at an altitude of 1000 m asl. The farm kept cattle Red and Black Holstein, Slovak Spotted, Slovak Pinzgau and their cross breeds. The status <b>of</b> <b>hooves</b> was assessed during each hoof trimming. During the first hoof trimming in December 2011, 130 dairy cows were evaluated. During the second trimming in May 2012 114 cows and during the third trimming in November 2012 105 cows were treated. The overall incidence <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> diseases and the overall incidence of diseases attributable to animal was evaluated (animal was evaluated as sick if at least one limb was affected). The incidence <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> diseases were assessed in whole herd (all animals), in group of culled cows and in the basic herd (cows treated in all three hoof trimmings – 86 cows). The highest incidence of all diseases was observed in culled animals during the study (46 %, 45 % respectively). The most common illnesses were ulcers and dermatitis. In the course <b>of</b> all three <b>hoof</b> trimmings the reduction in the incidence of disease in whole herd (mainly due to culling) and also in basic herd (due to the positive impact <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> trimming) was confirmed. The work highlights the importance <b>of</b> regular <b>hoof</b> trimming in the effective reduction <b>of</b> <b>hoof</b> diseases on the farms...|$|R
