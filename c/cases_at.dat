5|$|C# is more type safe than C++. The only {{implicit}} conversions {{by default}} {{are those that}} are considered safe, such as widening of integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.|$|E
5|$|Since many Soviet {{soldiers}} had lost {{family and friends}} during the German invasion and partial occupation of the USSR (about 17 million Soviet civilians plus 10 million Soviet soldiers died in World War II, more {{than in any other}} country), many felt a desire for vengeance. Murders of Axis prisoners of war and German civilians are known from <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> Soviet military tribunals. Also, when Soviet troops moved into East Prussia, large numbers of enslaved Ostarbeiter ("Eastern workers") were freed, and knowledge of the suffering and deaths of many of these workers hardened the attitude of many Soviet soldiers towards East Prussians.|$|E
5|$|The Kenyan government's {{attempt to}} defer the <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> the ICC by {{appealing}} {{to members of the}} UN Security Council failed without being voted on, however the government, represented by British lawyers Geoffrey Nice and Rodney Dixon, have subsequently applied directly to the Court. The Kenyan government's application to Pre-Trial Chamber II that the two cases were inadmissible was rejected unanimously by the judges. Many victims of the post-election violence voiced opposition to the government's stance, and a poll of Kenyans conducted by Synovate shortly after Moreno Ocampo's announcement that he intended to seek summonses showed that sixty percent of Kenyans supported the trial of the accused taking place in The Hague.|$|E

5|$|The Sharia {{courts have}} general {{jurisdiction}} over most {{civil and criminal}} <b>cases.</b> <b>At</b> present, {{there are two types}} of courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases. Cases are adjudicated by single judges, except criminal cases if the potential sentence is death, amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges. There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters. Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with Sharia.|$|E

5|$|A major {{reform to}} the Court {{happened}} {{soon after the}} restoration, {{with the introduction of}} a right of appeal to the House of Lords from the Chancery. Before this there had been no records of appeals to the Lords, and a committee had concluded that there was no precedent to give the Lords jurisdiction over equity matters, except when problems and cases were sent directly to Parliament (as occasionally had been the case). In 1660 the Convention Parliament claimed for itself the right of appellate jurisdiction over equity matters, and also the right of original jurisdiction to hear equity <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> first instance. After disputes which lasted into the next Parliament, this second measure was dropped, but the right to hear equity appeals was confirmed. Horowitz writes that despite these changes, one of the academic certainties is that the problems which had dogged the court for the last two centuries persisted; Observations on the Dilatory and Expensive Proceedings in the Court of Chancery, written in 1701, listed 25 different procedures, areas and situations which contributed to the problems of high fees and slow processes.|$|E

5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is {{reassigned to}} teach at the FBI Academy while Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is given lowly {{surveillance}} assignments. After he investigates extraterrestrial <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), and meets a secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be a mole working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek. When Krycek vanishes, Skinner re-opens the X-Files, claiming {{that is what the}} conspirators will fear most.|$|E
5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to be filed when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing <b>cases</b> <b>at</b> the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury threw down the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E
5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health {{and quality of life}} for the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained that the process of industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some <b>cases,</b> <b>at</b> least half of the workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted {{the quality of life of}} workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
