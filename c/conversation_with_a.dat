5|$|In the episode, {{a lonely}} Michael strikes up a {{pleasant}} <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman while giving blood, but passes out {{before he can}} learn her name. He holds a Valentine's Day singles party at the Dunder Mifflin office with the hopes of meeting her. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam go on an awkward double date with Phyllis and Bob Vance.|$|E
5|$|Although Finn {{has chosen}} {{to stay on the}} {{football}} team, all the other dual members instead quit to remain in the glee club. Ken reverses his ultimatum after a <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities. Meanwhile, Will and Emma spend more time together while Will prepares the mash-up, and soon realize they have strong feelings for one another. Will decides to remove himself from the equation and later tells Emma and Ken that he {{will not be able to}} create their mash-up.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Liz Friedlander and debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on March 7, 2000. It consists of performance footage of the trio in a warehouse {{in front of a}} wall decorated with photographs. In between verses, the photos' origins are explored through the different perspectives of individuals near the band. As the band prepares to play a show, a man has a <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl and is subsequently left alone. In another, while DeLonge and Hoppus read magazines inside a late-night convenience store, a melancholy woman attempts to make a call via a pay phone. Other montages show the trio in the company of friends and practicing, a man looking out upon the sea, and a solitary man deserted by others at an outdoor restaurant. The final montage consists of personal photos from the band's past.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he was young, and {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she will come back for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E

Kahn spoke of his universal approach to design and used his own Richards Medical Research Laboratories {{as an example of}} how new design solutions can be reached with new thinking about space and movement. A number of the Metabolists were inspired by this.|$|E

25|$|Piaget {{recognized}} that psychometric tests had its limitations, as {{children were not}} able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if a child who has a <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a stereotype about the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
25|$|Homer and Bart use {{fireworks}} {{to accomplish}} things Marge has {{told them to}} do: fix a stuck shelf, demolishing Santa's Little Helper's doghouse (while promising him another one would be built by January 2007), and attempting to fix Lisa's VCR, but end up destroying her room with fireworks instead. To {{make it up to}} her, the family spends a day at the Springfield Festival of Books. There, they encounter famous authors such as Stephen King, Tom Wolfe, John Updike, and Amy Tan. While waiting in line for an autograph from Krusty, Bart strikes up a <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl named Sophie. When she gets {{to the front of the}} line, she reveals to Krusty that she is his daughter.|$|E

25|$|On March 28, 2006, Oklahoma {{head coach}} Kelvin Sampson was named {{coach of the}} Hoosiers, despite a history of violating NCAA rules and {{sanctions}} imposed on him. Sampson fielded competitive teams and scored a major recruiting victory by persuading in-state star Eric Gordon to sign with Indiana. The Hoosiers, with Gordon and forward D.J. White, were {{considered one of the}} better teams during the 2007–2008 season. However, in October 2007 Sampson was found to have violated rules again, this time by engaging in a 3-way phone <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> recruit. Indiana punished Sampson by denying him a previously scheduled $500,000 raise, firing one of his assistant coaches, and taking away one of his scholarships for the 2008–2009 season.|$|E
25|$|Sex {{education}} may be taught informally, {{such as when}} someone receives information from a <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person {{what he or she}} should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.|$|E
25|$|On July 31, James Munro {{was arrested}} in his home city of Port Huron, Michigan; he was extradited to California, charged {{with the murder of}} Steven Wells.

Miley was arrested after having confessed to his culpability in these February 3 murders in a recorded phone <b>conversation</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend (thus substantiating Bonin's earlier confession). He initially pleaded innocent to two charges of first-degree murder on December 18, but formally pleaded guilty to both charges at two separate pretrial hearings in May 1981.|$|E
