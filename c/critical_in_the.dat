5|$|Horses {{were well}} suited to the warfare tactics of the nomadic {{cultures}} from the steppes of Central Asia. Several East Asian cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. Muslim warriors relied upon light cavalry in their campaigns throughout North Africa, Asia, and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the Middle Ages, and the best-known heavy cavalry warrior of the period was the armoured knight. With {{the decline of the}} knight and rise of gunpowder in warfare, light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the Americas. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the Napoleonic wars. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of indigenous people and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|On 30 December 1947, {{members of}} the Irgun, a Jewish {{underground}} militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside {{the gates of the}} Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42. In response Arab employees of the company killed 39 Jewish employees in {{what became known as the}} Haifa Oil Refinery massacre. The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing civil war, since it was the major industrial and oil refinery port in British Palestine.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Ages saw further {{improvements}} in agriculture. Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers {{for the collection}} of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The manorial system allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers, {{in the form of}} peasants or serfs. During the medieval period, the Arab world was <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed the beginnings of the plantation system of sugarcane growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.|$|E

5|$|The {{council was}} a {{virtually}} full-time institution {{by the late}} fifteenth century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council {{were some of the}} great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, {{towards the end of the}} period, archbishops. By the end of the fifteenth century, this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards, the clerically dominated post of Lord Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen.|$|E
5|$|The uptake of {{nutrient}} {{and water}} by the cluster roots peaks through winter and spring, but ceases when the upper layer of soil dries out in summer. The cluster roots are then allowed to die, but the laterals are protected from desiccation by a continuous {{supply of water}} from the sinker root. The water supplied to the laterals by the sinker root is continually lost to the soil; thus this plant facilitates the movement of ground water from the water table into surface soil, a process known as hydraulic redistribution. Cluster roots have been estimated as comprising about 30% of total root biomass in this species; the seasonal production of so much biomass, only for it to be lost {{at the end of the}} growing season, represents a substantial investment by the plant, but one that is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> competition for nutrients.|$|E
5|$|After the Crown {{the most}} {{important}} government institution was the Privy Council, composed of the king's closest advisers, but which, unlike in England, retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, {{some of whom were}} nominated by Parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent. The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late 15th century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were some of the great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings.

5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was very {{reluctant}} to take up the invitation and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first few days of April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E

25|$|While the XOR metric is {{not needed}} to {{understand}} Kademlia, it is <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis of the protocol.

Theoretical work on the concept was conducted between 1964 and 1966, while experimental work was ongoing between 1968 and 1973. The program received annual government funding of around £100,000-£200,000 (equivalent to £2m-£3m in 2005).

25|$|The {{tensions}} between Georgia and Russia, {{which had been}} heightened even before {{the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, climaxed during the secessionist conflict in Abkhazia in 1992–93. Support for the Abkhaz from various groups within Russia such as the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus, Cossacks, and regular military units, and support for South Ossetia by their ethnic brethren who lived in Russia's federal subject of North Ossetia proved <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> de facto secession of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia.|$|E
25|$|As at Edgbaston, Sri Lanka {{struggled}} batting {{first and}} Andrew Flintoff and Jon Lewis (who {{was in the}} side on debut replacing Sajid Mahmood) took 5 wickets between them to leave Sri Lanka on 139/8. However, England were unable to finish things off and Chaminda Vaas, who had shown resistance batting throughout the series, added 92 runs with the last two wickets. Muttiah Muralitharan hit 3 fours and 1 six in a very useful cameo, which included some remarkable shots. This late flurry of runs would prove <b>critical</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match.|$|E
