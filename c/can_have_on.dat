5|$|Keynes's {{prescription}} for strong public investment had ties to {{his interest in}} uncertainty. Keynes had given a unique perspective on statistical inference in A Treatise on Probability, written in 1921, years before his major economic works. Keynes thought strong public investment and fiscal policy would counter the negative impacts the uncertainty of economic fluctuations <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the economy. While Keynes's successors {{paid little attention to}} the probabilistic parts of his work, uncertainty may have played a central part in the investment and liquidity-preference aspects of General Theory.|$|E

5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the advancement of the spiritual aspirant. Some {{of the most important}} topics treated are: sanskaras (mental impressions), Maya (the principle of illusion), the nature of the ego, reincarnation, karma, violence and non-violence, meditation, love, discipleship, and God-realization. His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E

5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains often {{takes into account}} environmental factors that affect decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> a dumped body.|$|E
5|$|Susan was {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team asking for a character to be diagnosed with MS and for them to then show the impact MS <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as Susan was older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen Susan was seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she {{was diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis.|$|E

25|$|Whether or not aging {{directly}} affects women's sexual functioning during menopause {{is another}} area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically {{in the areas of}} desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning. This means {{that it is important to}} understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire. Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status. Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> quality of life is often underestimated.|$|E

25|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} rule have persistent, long term effects {{on the success of}} former colonies. Lakshmi Iyer, of Harvard Business School, conducted research to determine the impact type of rule <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> a region, looking at postcolonial India, where both systems were present under British rule. Iyer’s findings suggests that regions which had previously been ruled indirectly were generally better-governed and more capable of establishing effective institutions than areas under direct British rule. In the modern postcolonial period, areas formerly ruled directly by the British perform worse economically and have significantly less access to various public goods, such as health care, public infrastructure, and education.|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} no {{complete}} cure for stuttering, several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech. Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction, breathing regulation, and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words, and eventually more complex sentences. Furthermore, some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often elicited {{as a result of}} stuttering, and consequently exacerbates stuttering symptoms. This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach, in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker's attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the speaker's life. Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit people who stutter of any age.|$|E
