30|$|Temporary {{and fluid}} {{migration}} challenge dominant national policy paradigms of integration. Assimilationist civic integration policy – as implemented nowadays in many European countries - does not relate {{well to the}} presence of transients, that is, migrants that settle in a destination country temporarily. That also applies to multiculturalism: how to manage groups that do not want to, or cannot be fully attached to a destination country? And how to manage the enormous diversity of migration? A country such as the Netherlands now has migrants from 223 countries of origin. Over 200 origin groups and approximately 175 nationalities reside in cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Multicultural policy as shaped in the Netherlands in the 1980 s and 1990 s - state subsidised self-organisation of migrant groups, education in migrants’ native languages, facilitating migrant broadcasting and political <b>consultation</b> <b>facilities</b> for migrant communities - is difficult to organise and to finance in the current age of migration. This multicultural policy was based on group-differentiated rights for a limited number of large migrant groups that settled lastingly in the Netherlands (Entzinger, 2003). The recent repeal of the Minorities Policies (Consultation) Act (Wet Overleg Minderhedenbeleid, WOM) on Tuesday 18 June 2013 by the Dutch Upper House of Parliament was a symbolic measure. This brought to an end the Central Government’s consultation with national minority organisations on integration policy, as provided for by law. The WOM came into effect on 19 June 1997 and was implemented for sixteen years.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{healthcare}} managers’ perspective is quite different: {{they are not}} generally involved {{in the application of}} a specific CIG to a specific patient. However, they are focused on clinical processes, on their quality, and on their optimization. Thus, they can use the <b>consultation</b> <b>facilities</b> provided by CIG approaches {{in order to have a}} general view of how clinical processes should be organized, according to the best-practice derived from the medical evidence. In addition, managers can use approaches such as Bottrighi et al. (2012) in order to check the adherence (conformance) of the clinical processes executed in one or more healthcare organizations with the best-practice processes suggested by CIGs. This analysis might be helpful not only to study the quality of the treatments provided, but also for cost/process optimization purposes. Finally, and more important, healthcare managers are involved in the definition and application of healthcare processes in their organizations. Usually, CPGs are “general” bodies of knowledge, often developed by national/international committees, providing “high-level” best-practice recommendations and procedures. Thus, there is often quite a huge gap between general CPGs (and CIGs) and the actual procedures executed in a specific organization (e.g., in a specific hospital). Both local restrictions (e.g., not all the technological instruments are available in all the hospitals) and local optimizations must be considered, to contextualize a general CIG to a specific organization. So far few software tools have been developed to help managers in such a challenging task (consider, e.g., Terenziani et al. (2002)).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{opinions and}} experiences of health professionals concerning the management of people with comorbid substance misuse and mental health disorders. Method: We conducted a survey of staff from mental health services and alcohol and drug services across Queensland. Survey items on problems and potential solutions had been generated by focus groups. Results: We analysed responses from 112 staff of alcohol and drug services and 380 mental health staff, representing a return of 79 % and 42 % respectively of the distributed surveys. One or more issues presented a substantial clinical management problem for 98 % of respondents. Needs for increased facilities or services for dual disorder clients figured prominently. These included accommodation or respite care, work and rehabilitation programs, and support groups and resource materials for families. Needs for adolescent dual diagnosis services and after-hours alcohol and drug consultations were also reported. Each of these issues raised substantial problems for over 70 % of staff. Another set of problems involved coordination of client care across mental health and alcohol and drug services, including disputes over duty of care. Difficulties with intersectoral liaison were more pronounced for alcohol and drug staff than for mental health. A majority of survey respondents identified 13 solutions as practical. These included routine screening for dual diagnosis at intake, {{and a range of}} proposals for closer intersectoral communication such as exchanging client information, developing shared treatment plans, conducting joint case conferences and offering <b>consultation</b> <b>facilities.</b> Conclusions: A wide range of problems for the management of comorbid disorders were identified.

40|$|Background: Nurses {{and social}} workers caring for people with {{intellectual}} disabilities are increasingly confronted with clients in need of end-of-life care. Previous studies, however, suggest that professionals in intellectual disability care services lack knowledge and experience concerning end-of-life care. Moreover, the proportion of nurses within the staff of intellectual disability services has declined in recent years, while the proportion of social workers has increased, which may have consequences {{for the quality of}} end-of-life care. Objectives: To gain insight into the quality of end-of-life care, past vocational training, training needs and expert consultation opportunities of nurses {{and social workers}} working in intellectual disability care services. Design: Survey questionnaire study conducted in the Netherlands. Settings: Intellectual disability care services. Participants: The study sample was recruited from an existing nationally representative research panel of care professionals. In 2011, all 181 nurses and social workers in the research panel who worked in intellectual disability care services were sent our survey questionnaire. Methods: Postal survey addressing education, views and needs regarding end-of-life care. Results: The response was 71. 8 %. Respondents positively evaluated the quality of end-of-life care. However, most respondents felt inadequately trained in end-of-life care issues. Nurses had received more training in end-of-life care and had fewer training needs than social workers. Respondents wished for additional training, especially in supporting clients in dealing with the impending death and farewell process. Half of the respondents were unaware of the availability of external <b>consultation</b> <b>facilities.</b> Conclusions: This study shows that although nurses and social workers positively appraise the quality of end-of-life care for people with intellectual disabilities, the majority feel inadequately trained to provide good end-of-life care. As the number of people with intellectual disability in need of end-of-life care grows, organizations need to offer additional relevant training and must give information about the availability of external expert consultation for nurses and social workers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the supply of markers for the identification of syringes distributed by pharmacy needle exchanges and to determine if this product and service delivery offers a feasible method of marking syringes to promote the reduction of accidental sharing of syringes and needles amongst injecting drug users (IDU) and thereby reduce the risk of transmission of blood borne viruses (BBVs) and other related infections. This study involves the assessment, implementation and evaluation of syringe markers as a pilot study within three community pharmacy sites in Glasgow. The secondary aims of the study were to identify whether the supply of syringe markers from community pharmacy needle exchanges was acceptable to IDU and if it enabled them to mark their syringes. The literature review demonstrates that providing a means of identification of personal injecting equipment has been proposed as a viable option that should be promoted to prevent the inadvertent accidental sharing of syringes within a group setting. Needle exchanges (NEX) are important component parts of the harm reduction responses designed to reduce the physical health harms caused to individuals through injecting drug use. The literature is reviewed on BBV transmission and the historical, legal and policy context associated with the development of NEXs. Community pharmacies act as a source of health advice and can help to facilitate access to treatment services for those attending the NEX. However the specific {{aim of this}} study is not to investigate the totality of the benefits of a NEX but to examine the supply of a potential means of reducing accidental and unintentional sharing of all injecting equipment and thereby contribute to minimising some of the health harms linked to injecting drug use. Three established community pharmacies were identified as suitable sites to pilot the supply of syringe markers. A number of criteria were used to select the sites. These included an assessment of the geographic locations, staffing arrangements, NEX attendances and transactional activity and the availability of private <b>consultation</b> <b>facilities.</b> The health board central database which holds records on a range of factors including, the characteristics of those who attend NEX and detailed information on all transactions, was used to identify the most suitable sites to pilot the new intervention. This indicated that the characteristics of those who attended the three chosen sites were broadly similar to the wider NEX attending population. The evaluation was conducted in two separate periods. The first 4 week period was the supply phase where markers were distributed over this period to all patients receiving NEX packs from the 3 pharmacies. The second data collection phase was undertaken in the following 4 week period. Data was collected by means of a structured questionnaire. In order to reduce the potential interviewer bias it was decided to incorporate the use of peer researchers in the administration of the questionnaire. The Scottish Drugs Forum (SDF) was approached and agreement was reached to use members of the Service User Involvement Group (SUIG) to assist with the design and administration of the questionnaire. A submission was made to the health board Research Ethics Committee (REC) and approval was given to enable the study and the research evaluation to proceed. Before the start of the study, joint briefing and training sessions were held for pharmacy staff from the 3 sites and the 6 participating SUIG members. A total of 177 questionnaires were completed during the second data collection phase of the evaluation. Information was collected on personal details and injecting behaviours (including deliberate and accidental sharing), any current means of syringe identification, use of the markers and on the usefulness of the instruction card.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Email is an {{established}} method of communication in business, leisure and education {{but not yet}} health care. AIM: To evaluate an email service enabling communication between patients and their general practice regarding repeat prescriptions, appointment booking and clinical enquiries. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of interactions and an electronic user survey. SETTING: An urban practice in Dundee, Scotland. PARTICIPANTS: 150 patients aged 24 to 85. METHODS: We set up a practice facility to allow our patients to use email to book appointments, order repeat prescriptions and consult their general practitioner (GP). RESULTS: Patient satisfaction with the service was very high. Patients specifically commended the practice for setting up a facility to allow communication outside standard working hours and for the ease of ordering repeat prescriptions. Patients were pleased to have a means of seeking their doctor's comment or opinion without bothering him or her by making and attending a formal face-to-face consultation. Email dialogue was polite, factual, but less formal than standard letters. Staff did not experience any perceptible rise in workload. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an email <b>consultation</b> <b>facility</b> worked well within an urban practice, was deemed helpful by patients, and resulted in no apparent increase in GP workload.

40|$|Abstract Background Few {{questionnaires}} on outpatients' {{satisfaction with}} hospital exist. All {{have been constructed}} without giving enough room for the patient's {{point of view in}} the validation procedure. The main objective was to develop, according to psychometric standards, a self-administered generic outpatient questionnaire exploring opinion on quality of hospital care. Method First, a qualitative phase was conducted to generate items and identify domains using critical analysis incident technique and literature review. A list of easily comprehensible non-redundant items was defined using Delphi technique and a pilot study on outpatients. This phase involved outpatients, patient association representatives and experts. The second step was a quantitative validation phase comprised a multicenter study in 3 hospitals, 10 departments and 1007 outpatients. It was designed to select items, identify dimensions, measure reliability, internal and concurrent validity. Patients were randomized according to the place of questionnaire completion (hospital v. home) (participation rate = 65 %). Third, a mail-back study on 2 departments and 248 outpatients was conducted to replicate the validation (participation rate = 57 %). Results A 27 -item questionnaire comprising 4 subscales (appointment making, reception facilities, waiting time and consultation with the doctor). The factorial structure was satisfactory (loading > 0. 50 on each subscale for all items, except one item). Interscale correlations ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 59, Cronbach α coefficients ranged from 0. 79 to 0. 94. All Item-scale correlations were higher than 0. 40. Test-retest intraclass coefficients ranged from 0. 69 to 0. 85. A unidimensional 9 -item version was produced by selection of one third of the items within each subscale with the strongest loading on the principal component and the best item-scale correlation corrected for overlap. Factors related to satisfaction level independent from departments were age, previous consultations in the department and satisfaction with life. Completion at hospital immediately after consultation led to an overestimation of satisfaction. No satisfaction score differences existed between spontaneous respondents and patients responding after reminder(s). Conclusion Good estimation of patient opinion on hospital consultation performance was obtained with these questionnaires. When comparing performances between departments or the same department over time scores need to be adjusted on 3 variables that influence satisfaction independently from department.
