50|$|To prevent serial-number analysis, {{serial numbers}} can be excluded, or usable {{auxiliary}} information reduced. Alternatively, serial numbers that resist cryptanalysis can be used, most effectively by randomly choosing numbers without replacement {{from a list}} that is {{much larger than the}} number of objects produced (compare the one-time pad), or produce random numbers and <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>against</b> the list of already assigned numbers; collisions are likely to occur unless the number of digits possible is more than twice the number of digits in the number of objects produced (where the serial number can be in any base); see birthday problem. For this, a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator may be used. All these methods require a lookup table (or breaking the cypher) to back out from serial number to production order, which complicates use of serial numbers: a range of serial numbers cannot be recalled, for instance, but each must be looked up individually, or a list generated.|$|E

Tulane University established the Libraries Recovery Center in 2008 to sort the restored items, <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>against</b> the library’s historic catalogue, create an inventory of materials unaccounted for, and return the materials to the library’s collections.

5000|$|It is the {{interpretation}} of the rules that make immigration law so controversial. The practicalities of assessing large numbers of people arriving at ports mean that a great deal of discretion is given to the immigration officer, (although less now than was once the case). While the officer must obtain the approval of a Chief Immigration Officer or Inspector to refuse someone entry the way in which interviews are conducted and recorded are based on a lower level of proof than those in other areas of law enforcement. The immigration rules for visitors say that the immigration officer must be [...] "satisfied" [...] that the person is a genuine visitor not intending to stay longer than the rules allow and is not intending to seek employment. The idea that a relatively low ranking officer merely has to satisfy himself or herself as to the person intentions rather than prove an offence, {{as is the case in}} criminal matters, is a long-standing cause of legal and legislative tension. The level of proof is effectively a balance of probabilities rather than that of an overwhelming case being proven against the arriving passenger. In practice the immigration officer is required to conduct an in-depth interview, seek corroborative evidence from other sources and present a compelling case to a Chief Immigration Officer before refusing the person. The work of a port based immigration officer is to sift arriving passengers to detect those whose accounts of their intentions give some cause for concern. The officer will briefly interview all arriving people who are not British Citizens or EU nationals, check their document for alterations or forgery, verify any entry clearances held, assess their travel history against the stamps in their passport, <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>against</b> warnings lists and do all of this, usually, in less than two minutes. If the officer is satisfied they will stamp the passport with one of a variety of wordings, (conditions), depending on the reason for the persons stay and apply a time limit according to pre-set criteria. The pressure on port immigration officers is to do this quickly so as to satisfy various targets concerning waiting times. There has never been a quota or target for detecting and refusing inadmissible passengers - the performance standards for immigration officers at ports have always revolved around the quality of interviewing, decision making and their investigative qualities.|$|E

40|$|Goal-oriented agent {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} popular for developing complex applications that operate in highly dynamic environments. As with any software these systems {{have to be}} designed starting with the specification of system requirements. In this paper, we extend a popular agent design methodology, Prometheus, and improve the understandability and maintainability of requirements by automatically generating UML activity diagrams from existing requirements models; namely scenarios and goal hierarchies. This approach aims to overcome some of the ambiguity present in the current requirements specification in Prometheus and provide more structure for representing variations. Even though our approach is grounded in Prometheus, it can be generalised to all the methodologies that support similar notions in specifying requirements (i. e. notions of goals and scenarios). We present our approach and an evaluation based on user experiments.

40|$|Quality {{management}} {{is becoming a}} more and more {{important part of the}} software development process. As software testing is currently understood as the core function of the quality managment, developers start using software testing tools to facilitate their work. However most existing tools just manage given sets of test cases and <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>against</b> pre-defined testing criteria. The necessary test case discovery is usually up to user, who has to generate the test cases in an ad-hoc approach with only minimal support from the software. GlassTT, the tool we present in this paper, faces this problem by creating the needed test cases for a given criterion for a Java class file. It uses a symbolic Java virtual machine to generate constraints representing the conditions for the control flow under consideration. The system can employ a parameterizeable test criterion such as data-flow coverage. The constraint solvers embedded in the tool are capable of solving linear and non-linear constraints, which is sufficient for almost all constraints encountered in the execution of Java programs. They are encapsulated in an incremental constraint solver manager, which dynamically chooses an appropriate constraint solver and enables the efficient communication between constraint solvers and symbolical virtual machine...|$|E

On the other hand we only find agreement for 8 out of 20 targets where a spectroscopic rotation periods is in the literature. We confirm that several planetary signals of candidate planets reported in the literature are very different to the stellar rotation periods of host stars.

40|$|Bitmap {{indexing}} is {{a common}} technique for indexing high-dimensional data in data warehouses and scientific applications. Though efficient for low-cardinality attributes, query processing can be rather costly for high-cardinality attributes due to the large storage requirements for the bitmap indices. Binning {{is a common}} technique for reducing storage costs of bitmap indices. This technique partitions the attribute values {{into a number of}} ranges, called bins, and uses bitmap vectors to represent bins (attribute ranges) rather than distinct values. Although binning may reduce storage costs, it may increase the access costs of queries that do not fall on exact bin boundaries (edge bins). For this kind of queries the original data values associated with edge bins must be accessed, in order to <b>check</b> <b>them</b> <b>against</b> the query constraints. In this paper we study the problem of finding optimal locations for the bin boundaries in order to minimize these access costs subject to storage constraints. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal partitioning of attribute values into bins that takes into account query access patterns as well as data distribution statistics. Mathematical analysis and experiments on real life data sets show that the optimal partitioning achieved by this algorithm can lead to a significant improvement in the access costs of bitmap indexing systems for high-cardinality attributes...|$|E
