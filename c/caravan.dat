5|$|In March 624, Muhammad {{led some}} three hundred warriors in {{a raid on}} a Meccan {{merchant}} <b>caravan.</b> The Muslims set an ambush for the <b>caravan</b> at Badr. Aware of the plan, the Meccan <b>caravan</b> eluded the Muslims. A Meccan force was sent to protect the <b>caravan</b> {{and went on to}} confront the Muslims upon receiving word that the <b>caravan</b> was safe. The Battle of Badr commenced. Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl. Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed. Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation of their faith and Muhammad ascribed the victory as assisted from an invisible host of angels. The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils.|$|E

5|$|Complaints lodged to the {{authorities}} against Mansur ultimately led to his dismissal in 1579. He was replaced with his son Muhammad. Mansur died in 1580. According to Duwayhi, Muhammad was alleged by {{the authorities}} to {{have participated in the}} looting of an Istanbul-bound <b>caravan</b> from Egypt while it was passing through the Akkar and was consequently imprisoned in Istanbul. However, Ottoman sources mention that the <b>caravan</b> arrived safely in Istanbul and that the commander of the <b>caravan,</b> Ibrahim Pasha, backed by a 20,000-strong army, arrested Muhammad and Qurqumaz Ma'an while suppressing rebel activity in Mount Lebanon en route to Istanbul. About a year later, Muhammad was released and assigned the tax farm for Tripoli Eyalet's rural districts, not including Tripoli itself, which remained under Yusuf Sayfa. The Ottoman authorities were content with Muhammad's rule, but were vexed by the Maronites in his retinue.|$|E

The RACQ urged local authorities on tourist routes to provide [...] "well equipped camps" [...] to prepare for the boom.

5|$|The Indo-Parthian Kingdom, {{located in}} modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan made an {{alliance}} with the Parthian Empire in the 1st century BC. Bivar claims that these two states considered each other political equals. After the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited the court of Vardanes I of Parthia (r. c.40–47AD) in 42AD, Vardanes provided him with the protection of a <b>caravan</b> as he traveled to Indo-Parthia. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital Taxila, his <b>caravan</b> leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman {{government}} ensured adequate {{safety and}} {{funding for the}} annual pilgrimage <b>caravan</b> (qafilat al-hajj) from Damascus to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. This policy benefited Nablus economically. Pilgrimage caravans became the key factor in the fiscal and political relationship between Nablus and the central government. For a brief period in the early 17th century, the governor of Nablus, Farrukh Pasha, was appointed leader of the pilgrimage <b>caravan</b> (amir al-hajj), and he constructued a large commercial compound in Nablus for that purpose.|$|E

5|$|The <b>caravan</b> trade {{depended}} on patrons and merchants. Patrons owned the {{land on which}} the <b>caravan</b> animals were raised, providing animals and guards for the merchants. The lands were located in the numerous villages of the Palmyrene countryside. Although merchants used the patrons to conduct business, their roles often overlapped and a patron would sometimes lead a <b>caravan.</b> Commerce made Palmyra and its merchants among the wealthiest in the region. Some caravans were financed by a single merchant, such as Male' Agrippa (who financed Hadrian's visit in 129 and the 139 rebuilding of the Temple of Bel). The primary income-generating trade good was silk, which was exported from the East to the West. Other exported goods included jade, muslin, spices, ebony, ivory and precious stones. For its domestic market Palmyra imported variety of goods including slaves, prostitutes, olive oil, dyed goods, myrrh and perfume.|$|E
5|$|The {{relocation}} to Indianapolis was {{an arduous}} task. At {{the time it}} was an eleven-day journey by horseback from Corydon to the new capital. To complicate matters, no road existed and a path for the wagons had to be cut through the dense forests during the winter transit as the long <b>caravan</b> moved north. The <b>caravan</b> was large because it contained the state treasury, state library, state records, the furniture of the General Assembly, Supreme Court, and ExecutIve Offices, along with a whole host of other implements to aid the <b>caravan</b> on its long journey. Colonel Samuel Merrill, the state treasurer, was authorized by the General Assembly to oversee the move. Ultimately, it took more than a month to relocate the government to Indianapolis. The first session of the General Assembly convened there in January 1825.|$|E

Along with Shirley, they track Babe down to a <b>caravan</b> in Ramsgate, where Babe states she was evicted from her house. Later, Shirley discovers a scrapbook of photos of young pregnant girls with due dates written on the back and realises that Babe and Queenie had kidnapped these girls and had their babies adopted out. Shirley is disgusted by Babe's actions and threatens to set her fire to her <b>caravan,</b> but Mick stops her. However, Babe burns the <b>caravan</b> down herself, realising that she needs to move on, and returns to Walford with Shirley, Mick and Tina. Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), and her toyboy fiancé, Jason Adams (Scott Neal), temporarily move into the Vic. Babe does not trust Jason, although they have a passionate encounter, which is caught by Mick and Linda. Linda asks Babe to ensure Jason leaves Walford without informing Elaine of the reason, but when Elaine teases Babe, she reveals that she had sex with Jason. Elaine refuses to believe this, while Jason suggests that he and Babe steal from the pub and leave together. Babe secretly records the conversation and plays it to the Carters, who force Jason to leave. Babe admits to Elaine and Linda that she and Jason did not have sex and that she feels lonely.

5|$|In 1271, Niccolò, Maffeo and Marco Polo {{embarked}} on their voyage to fulfil Kublai's request. They sailed to Acre, and then rode on camels to the Persian port of Hormuz. The Polos wanted to sail straight into China, but the ships {{there were not}} seaworthy, so they continued overland through the Silk Road, until reaching Kublai's summer palace in Shangdu, near present-day Zhangjiakou. In one instance during their trip, the Polos joined a <b>caravan</b> of travelling merchants whom they crossed paths with. Unfortunately, the party was soon attacked by bandits, who used {{the cover of a}} sandstorm to ambush them. The Polos managed to fight and escape through a nearby town, but many members of the <b>caravan</b> were killed or enslaved. Three and a half years after leaving Venice, when Marco was about 21 years old, the Polos were welcomed by Kublai into his palace. The exact date of their arrival is unknown, but scholars estimate it to be between 1271 and 1275.

5|$|In late 1757, the Bani Saqr and Sardiyah tribes, who Zahir {{maintained}} ties with, {{launched an}} assault on the Hajj <b>caravan</b> as it was returning to Syria from Mecca. Thousands of Muslim pilgrims were killed in the raid, including Sultan Osman III's sister. The attack shocked the Sublime Porte (Ottoman imperial government), and discredited the governor of Damascus and amir al-hajj, Husayn Pasha ibn Makki, for failing to ward off the Bedouin. Husayn Pasha had been serving his first term as governor, having replaced As'ad Pasha al-Azm, who Zahir had peaceful relations with, and among Husayn Pasha's priorities were subduing Zahir and annexing his territories, which were part of Sidon Eyalet. Husayn Pasha lodged a complaint to the Sublime Porte alleging Zahir's involvement in the raid. Zahir denied the allegation and pressed for an investigation into the assault. He also sought to earn the Sublime Porte's favor by purchasing the looted goods of the <b>caravan</b> from the tribes, including the decorated banners representing Muhammad and the sovereignty of the sultan, and restoring them to Sultan Mustafa III (Osman III had died on 30 October). Moreover, Zahir's enemy Husayn Pasha was dismissed that year.|$|E
