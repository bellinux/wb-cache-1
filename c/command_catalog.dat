40|$|What is {{currently}} {{known about the}} orbital debris flux is {{from a combination of}} ground based and in-space measurements. These measurements have revealed an increasing population with decreasing size. A summary of measurements is presented for the following sources: the North American Aerospace Defense <b>Command</b> <b>Catalog,</b> the Perimeter Acquisition and Attack Characterization System Radar, ground based optical telescopes, the Explorer 46 Meteoroid Bumper Experiment, spacecraft windows, and Solar Max surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Orbital debris {{objects with}} sizes of 6 mm and larger were {{detected}} {{when they passed}} through the main beam of the high-power, 12. 6 -cm wavelength radar at the Arecibo Observatory. The number of objects detected at altitudes below 1000 km in the size range of 6 mm to 2 cm agreed with orbital debris model predictions to better than a factor of two. Radar detections of larger orbital debris (10 -cm diameter and above) were also compared with the objects in the U. S. Space <b>Command</b> <b>catalog</b> (the cataloged objects have UHF radar cross-sections larger than 0. 01 sq m). This experiment demonstrated that the large, earth-based radar telescopes normally used for planetary studies can provide useful data about the near-earth orbital debris populations...|$|E
40|$|The Johnson Space Center is {{processing}} optical data on {{orbital debris}} from five sources. The {{greatest amount of}} data so far obtianed is from the GEODSS system for which an analysis is presented of 80. 9 hours of zenith observations. A total of 622 satellites were found of which 255 have been identified with objects in the USAF Space <b>Command</b> <b>catalog</b> (SCC). When objects in the SCC but which are not seen by GEODSS are accounted for, an SCC completeness factor of 0. 46 over all diameters in the 500 to 1100 km height range is found. For objects with diameters between 8 and 30 cm this factor is 0. 26. Comparison of GEODSS-derived diameters with RCS-derived diameters yields a revised mean albedo of approximately 0. 08...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the example}} above, {{which is a}} closeup of a strip of 1996 [...] "flag over porch" [...] {{self-adhesive}} stamps, {{we can see a}} plate number comprising five digits, one for each color layer. The digits are quite small, and often hard to read because they are blurred by the halftone screen. Also, in this example, the numbers on the left, known as micro-printing, usually denote the year the issue is copyrighted or printed and, therefore, should not be mistaken as the plate number. While there are other factors such as condition and centering, the philatelic value of a PNC single or strip highly depends on its plate numbers with some plate numbers <b>commanding</b> higher <b>catalog</b> values due to their rarity and strong collector interest.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Strategic <b>Command</b> keeps a <b>catalog</b> {{of known}} orbital objects, using {{ground-based}} radar and telescopes, and a space-based telescope (originally to distinguish from hostile missiles). The 2009 edition listed about 19,000 objects. Other data {{come from the}} ESA Space Debris Telescope, TIRA, the Goldstone, Haystack, and EISCAT radars and the Cobra Dane phased array radar, {{to be used in}} debris-environment models like the ESA Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference (MASTER).|$|R
50|$|Synology's {{software}} architecture allows for third-party add-on application integration. Hundreds of third-party applications {{are available in}} addition to Synology's own <b>catalog.</b> <b>Command</b> line access via SSH or Telnet is available. Access to development tools and APIs are also available on Synology's website. Third-party applications can be written in an interpreted programming language such as PHP or compiled to binary format. Public APIs allow custom applications to integrate into Synology's web-based user interface. Installers using the SPK format can install third-party applications directly on the DSM operating system.|$|R
40|$|Orbital debris {{environment}} {{models are}} essential {{in predicting the}} characteristics of the entire debris environment, especially for altitude and size regimes where measurement data is sparse. Most models are also used to assess mission collision risk. The IDES (Integrated Debris Evolution Suite) simulation model has recently been upgraded by including a new sodium–potassium liquid coolant droplet source model and a new historical launch database. These and other features of IDES are described in detail. The accuracy of the IDES model is evaluated over a wide range of debris sizes by comparing model predictions to three major types of debris measurement data in low Earth orbit. For the large-size debris population, the model is compared with the spatial density distribution of the United States (US) Space <b>Command</b> <b>Catalog.</b> A radar simulation model is employed to predict the detection rates of mid-size debris in the field of view of the US Haystack radar. Finally, the small-size impact flux relative to a surface of the retrieved Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) spacecraft is predicted. At sub-millimetre sizes, the model currently under-predicts the debris environment encountered at low altitudes by approximately an order of magnitude. This is because other small-size debris sources, such as paint flakes have not yet been characterised. Due to the model enhancements, IDES exhibits good accuracy when predicting the debris environment at decimetre and centimetre sizes. Therefore, the validated initial conditions and the high fidelity future traffic model enables IDES to make long-term debris environment projections with more confidenc...|$|E
40|$|The Naval Space Command {{maintains}} {{a database of}} element sets for roughly 9, 000 Earth-orbiting objects, which is essentially the U. S. Space <b>Command</b> satellite <b>catalog.</b> NAVSPACECOM receives about 270, 000 observations per day and performs an average of 18, 000 element set updates per day. About 98. 5 % of the element sets are updated, without human intervention, by computer software called AUTODC. The purpose of our report is to elucidate {{the technical aspects of}} AUTODC for the astrodynamics community. The Naval Space Command {{maintains a}} database of orbital elements for the objects in the space catalog. This report is a documentation of the software which inputs new observations of a satellite and its old element set and outputs a new element set. Topics covered include: mathematics of batch least squares differential correction process, definition of fit span and passes, calculation of residuals and partials, inclusion of historical data, solution to normal equations, iterations and tolerances...|$|R
50|$|The {{advantages}} though, were significant, {{aside from}} just {{the increase in}} disk access speed. Apple Pascal {{increased the number of}} supported file types from the original eight by introducing a two-byte code to indicate type. A timestamp feature was also added, indicating the date and time of a file's creation or last modification. This data would then be shown on a line with the filename by the <b>CATalog</b> <b>command.</b> Previously only a file's name, basic type, and size would be shown. Strangely enough, the timestamp feature was not made a part of the later DOS 3.3.|$|R
40|$|Space debris {{presents}} {{many challenges}} to current space operations. Although, {{the probability of}} collision between an operational spacecraft {{and a piece of}} space debris is quite small, the potential losses can be quite high. Prior to 1990, characterization of the orbital debris environment was divided into two categories. Objects larger than 10 cm are monitored by the United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN) and documented in the U. S. Space <b>Command</b> (USSPACECOM) <b>catalog.</b> Knowledge of debris smaller than 0. 1 cm has come from the analyses of returned surfaces. The lack of information about the debris environment in the size range from 0. 1 to 1 0 cm led to a joint NASA-DOD effort for orbital debris measurements using the Haystack radar and the unbuilt Haystack Auxiliary (HAX) radars. The data from these radars have been critical to the design of shielding for the International Space Station and have been extensively used in the creation of recent models describing the orbital debris environment. Recent debris campaigns have been conducted to verify and validate through comparative measurements, the results and conclusions drawn from the Haystack/HAX measurements. The Haystack/HAX measurements and results will be described as well as the results of the recent measurement campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{understand}} the physical characteristics of debris at geosynchronous orbit (GEO). Our approach is to compare the observed reflectance {{as a function of}} wavelength with laboratory measurements of typical spacecraft surfaces {{to understand}} what the materials are likely to be. Because debris could be irregular in shape and tumbling at an unknown rate, rapid simultaneous measurements over a range of wavelengths are required. Acquiring spectra of optically faint objects with short exposure times to minimize these effects requires a large telescope. We describe optical spectroscopy obtained during 12 - 14 March 2012 with the IMACS imaging spectrograph on the 6. 5 -m 'Walter Baade' Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. When used in f/ 2 imaging mode for acquisition, this instrument has a field of view of 30 arc-minutes in diameter. After acquisition and centering of a GEO object, a 2. 5 arc-second wide slit and a grism are moved into the beam for spectroscopy. We used a 200 l/mm grism blazed at 660 nm for wavelength coverage in the 500 - 900 nm region. Typical exposure times for spectra were 15 - 30 seconds. Spectra were obtained for five objects in the GEO regime listed as debris in the US Space <b>Command</b> public <b>catalog,</b> and one high area to mass ratio GEO object. In addition spectra were obtained of three cataloged IDCSP (Initial Defense Communications Satellite Program) satellites with known initial properties just below the GEO regime. All spectra were calibrated using white dwarf flux standards and solar analog stars. We will describe our experiences using Magellan, a telescope never used previously for orbital debris spectroscopy, and our initial results...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} study of orbital debris in the early 1970 ’s, the number of {{orbiting}} objects cataloged by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has more than tripled. The Space Surveillance Network (SSN) operated by the U. S. Space <b>Command</b> (USSPACECOM) has <b>cataloged</b> and tracked about 7, 000 artificial objects orbiting the Earth [Kessler: 20]. In the near-vacuum of outer space, no forces act to slow the debris down, thus small objects with relatively high velocities can cause severe damage. Due to the concerns about spaceflight safety from the hazards of orbital debris, Advanced Space Traffic Regulation Organization (ASTRO) has been contracted under proposal #ASE 274 L to submit a comprehensive program for a space traffic control system. The proposed space traffic control system from ASTRO performs four main functions. The system is designed to 1) track and catalog both natural and manmade orbital debris, 2) monitor space traffic (such as the Space Shuttle or Station), 3) determine free orbits, orbits with minimal probability of collisions, for the insertion of new satellites or for avoidance maneuvers, and 4) predict and warn of collisions for both spacecraft/spacecraft and spacecraft/debris collisions. The system would utilize current technology and should be fully operational by {{the completion of the}} Space Station...|$|R
40|$|With the {{new space}} fence technology, the catalog of known space objects is {{expected}} to increase to the order of 100, 000 objects. Objects need to be initially detected, and sufficient observations need to be collected to allow for a first orbit determination. Furthermore, the objects have to be reobserved regularly, to keep them in the catalog, because the position uncertainty of the objects increases over time, due to unmodeled dynamic effects. Only a small number of ground-based and even fewer space-based sensors are currently available that are able to collect observations, compared to the large number of objects that need to be observed. This makes efficient sensor tasking, which takes into account the realistic ramifications of the problem, crucial in building up and maintaining a precise and accurate catalog of space objects. The time-varying sensor performance and specific sensor constraints are influenced by the sensor location and observational environmental effects, sensor hardware, processing software, and observation modes. This paper shows a new method of solving sensor tasking as an optimization problem translating the heuristic principles that have been successfully applied in sensor tasking of actual space situational awareness networks in a rigorous mathematical framework. A computationally fast near-optimal solution is presented, outperforming traditional heuristic sensor tasking methods. Applications of the methodology are shown via the example of the geosynchronous objects listed in the US Strategic <b>Command</b> two-line element <b>catalog.</b> The results are compared to state-of-the-art observation strategies...|$|R
