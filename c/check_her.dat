25|$|While {{out for a}} walk, Marianne {{gets caught}} {{in the rain and}} slips and sprains her ankle. The dashing John Willoughby sees the {{accident}} and assists her. Marianne quickly comes to admire his good looks and outspoken views on poetry, music, art, and love. His attentions lead Elinor and Mrs Dashwood to suspect that the couple have become secretly engaged. Elinor cautions Marianne against her unguarded conduct, but Marianne refuses to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> emotions. Abruptly, Mr Willoughby informs the Dashwoods that his aunt, upon whom he is financially dependent, is sending him to London on business, indefinitely. Marianne is distraught and abandons herself to her sorrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} woman (Min Hyo-rin) parking a car in a highway at night. After the woman opens her car trunk, the video flashes back to that morning where the woman was driving along a highway. Jieun {{proceeds}} to sing the first verse of the song while playing a piano in an abandoned building. Then Yongguk begins to rap in front a red wall and in a misty rice field while Jieun continues playing the piano in the abandoned building. After the interchanging shots between the three, Jieun proceeds to sing the chorus in the rice field and along with shots where she sings {{in the back seat}} of the car. After the first chorus, the woman stops the car to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> lighter, then continues driving to her destination.|$|E

500|$|She {{joined the}} staff of the {{newspaper}} in 1915, originally as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: [...] "Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' And I would say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long'". When her father went on vacation {{less than a year after}} her appearance in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at The Miami Metropolis whose greater familiarity with the history of Miami gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> facts better.|$|E
500|$|Shortly thereafter, Dorsetshire {{took part}} in the Bismarcks last battle; after the battleships [...] and [...] neutralised Bismarcks main battery early in the engagement, Dorsetshire and other warships—including her sister —closed in to join the attack. Dorsetshire opened fire at a range of [...] but poor {{visibility}} forced her to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> fire for lengthy periods. In the course of the engagement, she fired 254shells from her main battery. In the final moments of the battle, she was ordered to move closer and torpedo Bismarck and fired three torpedoes, two of which hit the crippled battleship. The Germans had by this time detonated scuttling charges, which with the damage inflicted by the British, caused Bismarck to rapidly sink at 10:40.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{rented the}} Sony Music Studios in New York City, and was {{influenced}} by her husband Jay-Z's method of collaborating with multiple record producers; she used four recording studios simultaneously. She booked Harrison, Jerkins and Garrett, each with a room to work in. During the sessions, Beyoncé would move from studio to studio to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> producers' progress, later claiming this fostered [...] "healthy competition" [...] among producers. When Beyoncé conceived a potential song, she would tell the group who would deliberate, and after three hours the song would be created. While Beyoncé and the team brainstormed the lyrics, other collaborators such as the Neptunes, Jerkins and Swizz Beatz would simultaneously produce the tracks. They would sometimes begin working at eleven o'clock, spending up to fourteen {{hours a day in}} the studios during the recording process. Beyoncé arranged, co-wrote and co-produced all the songs. Makeba Riddick, in an interview with MTV News, recounted her experience in the production: ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 29 (McCain's 72nd birthday), at the Nutter Center of Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, McCain's {{running mate}} was {{revealed}} in a surprise pick as Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. McCain had only {{talked to her}} a few times, and the campaign's vetting operation had mostly relied on Internet searches to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> background. Palin's career in Alaska had shown maverick tendencies similar to McCain's, and McCain hoped that Palin's youth, reformist record, appeal to social conservatives, and appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton voters would outweigh her lack of national and international visibility and experience. One of McCain's aides privately remarked via an American football metaphor during the announcement: [...] "We just threw long." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of [...] December 27, 1985, Fossey was {{discovered}} murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at {{the far edge of}} the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda. Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly [...] away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that [...] "when I reached down to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow." [...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor. Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks.|$|E
2500|$|These abrupt reforms, however, came without {{building}} support either at court {{or in the}} bureaucracy. [...] Cixi, whether concerned that they would <b>check</b> <b>her</b> power or fearful that they would lead to disorder, stepped in to prevent them going further. Some government and military officials warned Cixi that the ming-shi (reformation bureau) had been geared toward conspiracy. Allegations of treason against the emperor, as well as suspected Japanese influence within the reform movement, led Cixi to resume the role of regent and resume control at the court. The Manchu general Ronglu on 21 September 1898, took the Emperor to Ocean Terrace, a small palace on {{an island in the}} middle of Zhongnanhai linked {{to the rest of the}} Forbidden City only by a controlled causeway. Cixi followed this action with an edict that proclaimed the Guangxu Emperor's total disgrace and unfitness to be emperor. The Guangxu Emperor's reign effectively came to an end.|$|E
2500|$|Similar {{to other}} dwarf antelopes, Kirk's dik-diks exist in monogamous pairs on territories. Territories are marked with dung and urine that are {{deposited}} in a ritual that is performed to help helps maintain pair bonds. During the ritual, the female will excrete, {{followed by the}} male, which samples the female's urine stream to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> reproductive capacity. He paws over and then marks his dung and urine over her deposit. Finally, the pair marks nearby twigs with secretions from their pre-orbital glands. Kingon 1982 states that, [...] "The male courts the female by running up behind her with his head and neck stretched and his muzzle pointing out in front. Copulation begins with the male standing on his hind legs behind the female and waving his forelegs at an acute angle to his own body in the air over her back". Copulation typically occurs anywhere between three and five times within a 9-hour period.|$|E

2500|$|Siddiqui was {{provided}} {{care for her}} wound while incarcerated in the US. In September 2008, a prosecutor reported to the court that Siddiqui had refused to be examined by a female doctor, despite the doctor's extensive efforts. On 9 September 2008, she underwent a forced medical exam. In November 2008, forensic psychologist Leslie Powers reported that Siddiqui had been [...] "reluctant to allow medical staff to treat her". Her last medical exam had indicated her external wounds no longer required medical dressing and were healing well. A psychiatrist employed by the prosecutor to examine Siddiqui's competence to stand trial, Gregory B. Saathoff, noted in a March 2009 report that Siddiqui frequently verbally and physically refused to allow the medical staff to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> vital signs and weight, attempted to refuse medical care once {{it was apparent that}} her wound had largely healed, and refused to take antibiotics. At the same time, Siddiqui claimed to her brother that when she needed medical treatment she did not get it, which Saathoff said he found no support for in his review of documents and interviews with medical and security personnel, nor in his interviews with Siddiqui.|$|E
2500|$|The pair separated, with Mark {{unable to}} deal with the revelation. [...] Chrissie was {{informed}} that Mark was not her biological father, but the truth of her paternity was kept from her, resulting in a bitter fall out with her mother. [...] It took many months for Mark and Tricia's relationship began to heal again, and even when they had managed to set the past behind them and move on, things did not run smoothly. Powell elaborated: [...] "Mark and Tricia got back together. He was absolutely delighted. On top of that, he knew Tricia had asked for her breast reconstruction to be brought forward following a successful mastectomy." [...] However, Mark then discovered that he had a mild form of anemia that could be hereditary, meaning Chrissie needed to be informed. [...] Rather than revealing that Frank was her real father, Tricia suggested that she pretend to be the one with the condition. [...] Powell continued: [...] "'Chrissie's not stupid and is convinced Tricia's up to something. So, she decides to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> mum's file. Mark gets there first, but when he opens the file later he sees that Tricia has liver cancer and needs chemotherapy immediately - she'd found out recently." [...] He stated: [...] "The outlook is bleak and I've no idea how they'll manage to cope this time".|$|E
2500|$|Yates claimed that, {{despite his}} urging to <b>check</b> <b>her</b> medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed {{had refused to}} {{continue}} her regimen of the antipsychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999."The real question to me is: How could she have been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her...Rusty testified that he never {{knew that she had}} visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could have been found in medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital" [...] He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.|$|E
