40|$|AbstractA new {{ultrasonic}} {{fatigue testing}} device {{has been developed}} to test specimens under biaxial loading at 20 kHz. A flat smooth specimen with a disc geometry is placed on a <b>circumferential</b> <b>frame</b> and cyclically loaded {{at the center of}} its upper face. Disc bending generates a biaxial proportional stress state {{at the center of the}} lower face. Any positive loading ratio can be applied. A cast aluminum alloy (used to produce cylinder heads) has been tested under biaxial loading using this device in order to determine its fatigue strength at 109 cycles under high hydrostatic pressure. Self-heating is moderate but macroscopic fatigue cracks after testing are very long. First results in VHCF regime are consistent with literature results obtained under similar stress state for the same material, but in HCF regime and at 20 Hz...|$|E
40|$|Two archetypes (more {{specifically}} a glass {{sheet on}} a <b>circumferential</b> <b>frame</b> and a circular point fixing) of adhesively bonded glass to metal connections {{are subjected to}} extensive research in a two-year project run by Ghent University {{in cooperation with the}} Adhesion Institute of Delft University of Technology. The main objective of the project is to facilitate innovations by providing technology transfer on adhesively bonded glass to metal connections to the building industry. Consequently, the project is coached by a varied group of industrial partners, which has specified five relevant applications and appropriate performance criteria to be further investigated. Over ten adhesive manufacturers and suppliers have been approached to suggest adhesives for these applications. Of the 48 suggested adhesives, about 30 have been subjected to experimental testing in a broad screening to be able to select adhesives for further detailed investigations. This way, also adhesives which usually are outside the scope of glass research could be investigated, such as methacrylates. Furthermore, each major adhesive family is featured: silicones, polyurethanes, MS-polymers, acrylates, and epoxies. The screening constits of lap-shear tests on three sets of specimens for each adhesive. The first set is tested without conditioning. the other sets were tested after 4 weeks storage at 90 °C, 50 % RH and 12 weeks of storage at 90 °C, 50 % RH. The proposed paper summarises the experimental results of the screening research. Adhesives are proposed for further detailed research...|$|E
40|$|Salvage of diffuse ankle osteomyelitis, {{especially}} in compromised hosts, is a challenging problem. The {{purpose of this}} report was to evaluate early complications and results using a standardized salvage protocol. Eight patients with diffuse ankle osteomyelitis were treated by resection of all infected tissue and hybrid-frame compression arthrodesis. At presentation, five had open wounds. According to the Cierny/Mader classification, all had diffuse anatomic involvement and six of eight were compromised hosts. Seven had central distal tibial column involvement and one had primarily talar involvement. Surgical technique involved a two-incision approach, removal of all infected material and application of a compression <b>circumferential</b> <b>frame</b> with five thin wires across the foot, two across the tibia and two half-pins in the tibia. Fusion of eight ankles and four subtalar joints was attempted. All patients received six weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Open wounds were treated with wound vacuum assisted closure (VACs) devices until closure was achieved. Frames were removed at three months and walking casts were applied for one to two more months. Ankle sepsis was eradicated in all patients. Seven of eight ankles fused {{at an average of}} 13. 5 weeks (range, 10 to 16 weeks). One limb required below-knee amputation (BKA) at five weeks due to nonreconstructible vascular insufficiency. Three of four subtalar joints fused. Fixation problems included two pin-track infections cleared with oral cephalexin and one broken half-pin. Two diabetic Charcot patients required long-term ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) use due to subtalar instability. At average 3. 4 -year follow-up, none of the seven fused ankles has required further surgery. Use of this standardized salvage treatment protocol for these difficult problems in selected patients was effective with a relatively low associated complication rate...|$|E
40|$|Textile {{manufacturing}} processes offer potential cost and weight advantages over traditional composite materials and processes for transport fuselage elements. In the current study, design cost modeling relationships between textile processes and element design details were developed. Such relationships {{are expected to}} help future aircraft designers to make timely decisions {{on the effect of}} design details and overall configurations on textile fabrication costs. The fundamental advantage of a design cost model is to insure that the element design is cost effective for the intended process. Trade studies on the effects of processing parameters also help to optimize the manufacturing steps for a particular structural element. Two methods of analyzing design detail/process cost relationships developed for the design cost model were pursued in the current study. The first makes use of existing databases and alternative cost modeling methods (e. g. detailed estimating). The second compares design cost model predictions with data collected during the fabrication of seven foot <b>circumferential</b> <b>frames</b> for ATCAS crown test panels. The process used in this case involves 2 D dry braiding and resin transfer molding of curved 'J' cross section frame members having design details characteristic of the baseline ATCAS crown design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{aircraft}} fuselage {{shell is}} composed of stressed skin, longitudinal stringers, and <b>circumferential</b> <b>frames.</b> The skin {{is connected to the}} stringers and frames mostly by rivets. Due to presence of large number of rivet holes, the fuselage skin has a large number of high stress locations and these are locations of potential crack initiation. When the fuselage is pressurized and depressurized during each take-off and landing cycle of aircraft, the metal skin of fuselage expands and contracts resulting in fatigue crack initiation. In the present work, aircraft fuselage was selected as stiffened structure, Airbus A 340 and Airbus A 380 was selected for the process and modeling was done accordingly. The response of structure for the hoop stress and longitudinal stress developed in the fuselage due to cabin pressurization is studied by using finite element analysis technique. In addition, the tear strap can be used as bending material to increase the frame stiffness and static strength. The midway tear strap is installed by riveting. The possibility of starting a crack at a midway tear strap would be reduced if the strap were bonded to the skin without additional rivets. The tear strap will reduce the deformation and stress in the fuselage skin and the results are compared...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{aircraft}} is {{a highly}} complex structure. The aircraft fuselage shell is composed of stressed skin, longitudinal stringers, and <b>circumferential</b> <b>frames.</b> The skin {{is connected to the}} stringers and frames mostly by rivets. Fuselage has a number of riveted joints and is subjected to a major loading of differential internal pressurization. When the fuselage is pressurized and depressurized during each take-off and landing cycle of aircraft, the metal skin of fuselage expands and contracts resulting in metal fatigue. Due to presence of large number of rivet holes, the fuselage skin has a large number of high stress locations and these are locations of potential crack initiation. The wide bodied transport aircraft are designed to tolerate large fatigue cracks. This paper focuses attention on damage tolerance design of a fuselage structure of transport aircraft. In this paper, the stress intensity factor, quantifying the intensity of the stress field around a crack tip for a longitudinal crack under the pressurization load is studied. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate crack initiation, crack growth, fast fracture and crack arrest features in the stiffened panel. The longitudinal crack is initiated from the rivet hole and stress intensity factor is calculated using modified virtual crack closure integral (MVCCI) method at each stage of crack propagation. In order to arrest crack propagation which is capital importance of tear straps are used, which prevent the further crack propagation. In this paper the linear static stress analysis of stiffened panel of a fuselage is performed using MSC NASTRAN solver. The preprocessing of the model is done by using MSC PATRAN software...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of the natural frequencies and normal modes of vibration for con-tinuous panels, representing more or less typical fuselage skin-panel construction for modern airplanes, is discussed in this paper. The time-dependent boundary conditions at the supporting stringers are considered. A numerical example is presented, and analytical results for a particular structural configuration agree favorably with available experimental measurements. KNOWLEDGE is often required of the natural frequen-cies and normal modes of vibration for typical skin-stringer fu-selage panels of flight vehicles for studies in sonic fatigue, sound transmission, and panel flutter. It appears that analyses in the literature for panel vibration characteristics are based on over-simplified boundary conditions, corresponding either to knife-edge or clamped types of supports without consideration of the dynamic behavior of the structural members supporting the skin. This assumption is not justifiable at the longitudinal stringers, since they are generally fairly flexible both in bending and in torsion, and absorb {{a significant amount of}} energy in the over-all system. On the other hand, the exact nature of the boundary conditions at the <b>circumferential</b> <b>frames</b> are not normally critical in the study of panel vibrations, because the frames are generally spaced farther apart than are the stringers and are much more rigid in radial deformation. By assuming the boundary condi-tions at the frames as simple supports, only small errors will be introduced. The objective is to develop a vibration theory for typical air-plane skin-stringer panels considering the time-dependent na-ture of the restraints due to the stringers. The mathematical model of the structure is chosen as a row of panels between two frames. The skin is assumed to be continuous over the inter...|$|R
40|$|A part of {{aviation}} accident mitigation is a crash worthy airframe structure, {{and an important}} measure of merit for a crash worthy structure {{is the amount of}} kinetic energy that can be absorbed in the crush of the structure. Prediction of the energy absorbed from finite element analyses requires modeling the progressive failure sequence. Progressive failure modes may include material degradation, fracture and crack growth, and buckling and collapse. The design of crash worthy airframe components will benefit from progressive failure analyses that have been validated by tests. The subject of this research is the development of a progressive failure analysis for textile composite. <b>circumferential</b> fuselage <b>frames</b> subjected to a quasi-static, crash-type load. The test data for these frames are reported, and these data, along with stub column test data, are to be used to develop and to validate methods for the progressive failure response...|$|R
40|$|Adhesive bonding {{provides}} {{solutions to}} realize cost effective and low weight aircraft fuselage structures, in particular where the Damage Tolerance (DT) is the design criterion. Bonded structures that combine Metal Laminates (MLs) and eventually Selective Reinforcements can guarantee slow crack propagation, crack arrest and large damage capability. To optimize the design exploiting {{the benefit of}} bonded structures incorporating selective reinforcement requires reliable analysis tools. The effect of bonded doublers / selective reinforcements {{is very difficult to}} be predicted numerically or analytically due to the complexity of the underlying mechanisms and failures modes acting. Reliable predictions of crack growth and residual strength can only be based on sound empirical and phenomenological considerations strictly related to the specific structural concept. Large flat stiffened panels that combine MLs and selective reinforcements have been tested with the purpose of investigating solutions applicable to pressurized fuselages. The large test campaign (for a total of 35 stiffened panels) has quantitatively investigated the role of the different metallic skin concepts (monolithic vs. MLs) of the aluminum, titanium and glass-fiber reinforcements, of the stringers material and cross sections and of the geometry and location of doublers / selective reinforcements. Bonded doublers and selective reinforcements confirmed to be outstanding tools to improve the DT properties of structural elements with a minor weight increase. However the choice of proper materials for the skin and the stringers must be not underestimated since they play an important role as well. A fuselage structural concept has been developed to exploit the benefit of a metal laminate design concept in terms of high Fatigue and Damage Tolerance (F&DT) performances. The structure used laminated skin (0. 8 mm thick), bonded stringers, two different splicing solutions and selective reinforcements (glass prepreg embedded in the laminate) under the <b>circumferential</b> <b>frames.</b> To validate the design concept a curved panel was manufactured and tested under loading conditions representative of a single aisle fuselage: cyclic internal pressurization plus longitudinal loads. The geometry of the panel, design and loading conditions were tailored for the requirements of the upper front fuselage. The curved panel has been fatigue tested for 60 000 cycles before the introduction of artificial damages (cracks in longitudinal and circumferential directions). The crack growth of the artificial damages has been investigated for about 85 000 cycles. At the end a residual strength test has been performed with a “ 2 bay over broken frame” longitudinal crack. The reparability of this innovative concept has been taken into account during design and demonstrated with the use of an external riveted repair. The F&DT curved panel test has confirmed that a long fatigue life and high damage tolerance can be achieved with a hybrid metal laminate low weight configuration. The superior fatigue life from metal laminates and the high damage tolerance characteristics provided by integrated selective reinforcements are the key concepts that provided the excellent performances. The weight comparison between the innovative bonded concept and a conventional monolithic riveted design solution showed a significant potential weight saving but the weight advantages shall be traded off with the additional costs. ...|$|R
40|$|Braided {{composite}} materials, one of {{the advanced}} material forms which is under investigation in Boeing's ATCAS program, have been recognized as a potential cost-effective material form for fuselage structural elements. Consequently, {{there is a strong}} need for more knowledge in the design, manufacture, test, and analysis of textile structural composites. The overall objective of this work is to advance braided composite technology towards applications to a large commercial transport fuselage. This paper summarizes the mechanics of materials and manufacturing demonstration results which have been obtained in order to acquire an understanding of how braided composites can be applied to a commercial fuselage. Textile composites consisting of 1 D, 2 D triaxial, and 3 D braid patterns with thermoplastic and two RTM resin systems were investigated. The structural performance of braided composites was evaluated through an extensive mechanical test program. Analytical methods were also developed and applied to predict the following: internal fiber architectures, stiffnesses, fiber stresses, failure mechanisms, notch effects, and the entire history of failure of the braided composites specimens. The applicability of braided composites to a commercial transport fuselage was further assessed through a manufacturing demonstration. Three foot fuselage <b>circumferential</b> hoop <b>frames</b> were manufactured to demonstrate the feasibility of consistently producing high quality braided/RTM composite primary structures. The manufacturing issues (tooling requirements, processing requirements, and process/quality control) addressed during the demonstration are summarized. The manufacturing demonstration in conjunction with the mechanical test results and developed analytical methods increased the confidence in the ATCAS approach to the design, manufacture, test, and analysis of braided composites...|$|R
40|$|The goal of Boeing's Advanced Technology Composite Aircraft Structures (ATCAS) {{program is}} to develop the {{technology}} required for cost-and weight-efficient use of composite materials in transport fuselage structure. Carbon fiber reinforced epoxy was chosen for fuselage skins and stiffening elements, and for passenger and cargo floor structures. The automated fiber placement (AFP) process was selected for fabrication of stringer-stiffened and sandwich skin panels. <b>Circumferential</b> and window <b>frames</b> were braided and resin transfer molded (RTM'd). Pultrusion was selected for fabrication of floor beams and constant-section stiffening elements. Drape forming was chosen for stringers and other stiffening elements cocured to skin structures. Significant process development efforts included AFP, braiding, RTM, autoclave cure, and core blanket fabrication for both sandwich and stiffened-skin structure. Outer-mold-line and inner-mold-line tooling was developed for sandwich structures and stiffened-skin structure. The effect of design details, process control and tool design on repeatable, dimensionally stable, structure for low cost barrel assembly was assessed. Subcomponent panels representative of crown, keel, and side quadrant panels were fabricated to assess scale-up effects and manufacturing anomalies for full-scale structures.
