50|$|The rapid {{decompression}} {{in the cargo}} hold caused a partial collapse of the passenger compartment floor, which in turn jammed or restricted some of the control cables which led to various flight control hydraulic actuators. The jamming of the rudder control cable caused the rudder to deflect to its maximum right position. The <b>cable</b> <b>controls</b> to the number two (tail) engine were severed, causing that engine to shut down. Fortunately, there was no rupture of any hydraulic system, so the pilots still had control of the ailerons, the right elevator and the horizontal stabilizer. However, because the right elevator cable was partially restricted, both pilots had to apply back pressure on the yoke for the landing flare. Additionally, the approach and landing {{had to be made}} at high speed, to prevent the sink rate from becoming too high. The tendency to turn right was offset by using 45 degrees of left aileron, combined with asymmetrical thrust of the two wing engines. In spite of the partial restriction of the controls, the pilots were able to return to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and land safely with no major injuries.|$|E

This paper studies current travelling wave transmission characteristics in secondary <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> based on Alternative Transient Program (ATP). Valuable transmission characteristics of <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> have been got from the simulation results: current travelling waves which pass the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> will be distorted and some interfering current travelling waves will be generated; duration of interfering current travelling waves depends on the length of the control cable; the original fault generated current travelling wave wave-front is delayed and smoothed by the control cable; magnitude of fault generated current travelling wave wave-front has been varied by the <b>control</b> <b>cable.</b> And these transmission characteristic of <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> provide useful references to the protection algorithms based on fault generated current travelling waves...|$|R
50|$|Investigation {{revealed}} that the Redstone's engine shutdown was caused by two of its electrical cables separating in the wrong order. These <b>cables</b> were a <b>control</b> <b>cable,</b> which provided various control signals, and a power cable, which provided electrical power and grounding. Both cables were plugged into the rocket at the bottom edge {{of one of its}} tail fins and would separate at liftoff. The <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was supposed to separate first, followed by the power cable. However, for this launch, the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> was longer than expected—it was one designed for the military PGM-11 Redstone missile rather than the shorter cable designed for Mercury-Redstone. This <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> had been clamped to compensate for its greater length, but when the vehicle lifted off, the clamping did not work as planned and the <b>control</b> <b>cable</b> separation was delayed, eventually occurring about 29 milliseconds after the power cable had separated.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 47) The {{purpose of}} this study was to investigate the effect;s of an eloctrocutaneous sensory feedback system on the ability of below elbow amputees to discriminate hook opening while using a <b>cable</b> <b>controlled</b> voluntary opening prosthesis. Three below elbow amputees were selected from the Prosthetic and Orthotic Education Program at the University of California at Los Angeles. Subjects were fitted vvith <b>cable</b> <b>controlled,</b> voluntary opening Muenster prostheses employing an eleotrocutaneous sensory feedback system. Following an initial orientation to tho prosthesis, each subject underwent a series of practice and testing sessions designed to elicit information relevant to the experimental system. A total of four different experimental conditions based on varied combinations of kinesthetic, tactile, and electrocutaneous cues were tested. Descriptive techniques involving three distinct procedures, along with one non-parametric test, were used in statistically analyzing the data. Based on the results obtained in this study, conclusions were made concerning the decision of future eleotrocutaneous sensory feedback systems, the training and testing procedures to be used in future experiments, and the success of the present experimental supplemental sensory feedback system in affording the below elbow amputee more sensory input with regard to hook opening. The following general conclusion appears to be justified below elbow amputee subjects using electrocutaneous sensory feedback evaluated hook opening in a <b>cable</b> <b>controlled,</b> voluntary opening prosthesis more accurately than did these same subjects relying solely on tactile and kinesthetic forms of feedback...|$|R
