This paper proposed a new computation of encryption and decryption {{that was based}} on the computation of RSA and ElGamal Cryptosystems. The RSA is a public key encryption system that gets its security from the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

To this end, an extension of the „Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy‟ („LEACH‟) network routing protocol called, the „Security Enabled- Low-Energy Adap-tive Clustering Hierarchy ‟ („SE-LEACH‟) is proposed.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: How a host (the code consumer) can {{determine}} with certainty that a downloaded program received from untrusted source (the code producer) will maintain {{the confidentiality of}} the data it manipulates and {{it is safe to}} install and execute. Approach: The approach adopted for verifying that a downloaded program will not leak confidential data to unauthorized parties was based on the concept of Proof-Carrying Code (PCC). A mobile program (in its assembly form) was analyzed for information flow security based on the concept of proof-carrying code. The security policy was centered on a type system for analyzing information flows within assembly programs based on the notion of noninterference. Results: A verification tool for verifying assembly programs for information flow security was built. The tool certifies SPARC assembly programs for secure information flow by statically analyzing the program based on the idea of Proof-Carrying Code (PCC). The tool operated directly on the machine-code requiring only the inputs and outputs of the code annotated with security levels. The tool provided a windows user interface enabling the users to control the verification process. The proofs that untrusted program did not leak sensitive information were generated and checked on the host machine and if they are valid, then the untrusted program can be installed and executed safely. Conclusion: By basing proof-carrying code infrastructure on information flow analysis type-system, a sufficient assurance of protecting confidential data manipulated by the mobile program can be obtained. This assurance was come {{due to the fact that}} type systems provide a sufficient guarantee of protecting <b>confidentiality.</b> <b>Key</b> words: Proof-carrying code, secure information flow, assembly language, non-interferenc...|$|E

We present a mechanism for connecting server based IM infrastructure to our IM application for tactical networks. The Chat and Instant Messaging for Tactical Environments (CIM-TE) application enables real-time text message exchange in tactical mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).

40|$|Noninterference is {{a popular}} {{semantic}} security condition because it offers strong end-to-end guarantees, it is inherently compositional, {{and it can be}} enforced using a simple security type system. Unfortunately, it is too restrictive for real systems. Mechanisms for downgrading information are needed to capture real-world security requirements, but downgrading eliminates the strong compositional security guarantees of noninterference. We introduce nonmalleable information flow, a new formal security condition that generalizes noninterference to permit controlled downgrading of both confidentiality and integrity. While previous work on robust declassification prevents adversaries from exploiting the downgrading of <b>confidentiality,</b> our <b>key</b> insight is transparent endorsement, a mechanism for downgrading integrity while defending against adversarial exploitation. Robust declassification appeared to break the duality of confidentiality and integrity by making confidentiality depend on integrity, but transparent endorsement makes integrity depend on confidentiality, restoring this duality. We show how to extend a security-typed programming language with transparent endorsement and prove that this static type system enforces nonmalleable information flow, a new security property that subsumes robust declassification and transparent endorsement. Finally, we describe an implementation of this type system in the context of Flame, a flow-limited authorization plugin for the Glasgow Haskell Compiler...|$|R
