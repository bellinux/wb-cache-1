In this paper, {{we examine the}} call spread in a global framework, while controlling for firm-level, bond-level, and country-level variables. Using an international sample of 13, 936 bonds issued between 1991 and 2007, we find that <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> have a positive call spread, which is statistically and economically significant. Our empirical results hold after a battery of robustness checks. We also find that junk <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> have a higher call spread than investment-grade <b>callable</b> <b>bonds,</b> {{which is consistent with}} the signaling theory. The empirical results also show that highly leveraged firms have a higher call spread than firms with low leverage, a finding that is consistent with the risk-shifting arguments...|$|R

Our first objective is {{the test of}} a covenant effect on bond price. Comparing two samples of 323 make-whole call bonds and 759 non <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> from 133 identical firms, we provide evidence that make whole call bonds offer better returns than their equivalent non callable. Our study also focuses on the explanatory potential of growth opportunities to indorse the existence of makewhole <b>callable</b> <b>bonds.</b> A comparision is also displayed with 70 regular <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> extraced from 37 firms. Furthermore, we observe that contrary to traditional call provisions, make-whole ones are rarely exercised, a behaviour that seems difficult to explain with call prices, frequently overcome by bond prices...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically {{analyzes}} the call timing of <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> {{to see how}} refunding opportunity, cost of financial distress, agency cost of debt, and private information affect the call decision. The empirical results show that firms issue <b>callable</b> <b>bonds,</b> convertible or not, to enjoy future refunding options; {{that the cost of}} financial distress weakly expedites calling convertible bonds but not non-convertibles; that firms which are in debt delay calling non-convertibles but not convertibles; that <b>callable</b> <b>bonds,</b> convertible or not, are issued to mitigate adverse selection under information asymmetry; and that after the end of call protection periods the call intensity monotonically decreases for the non-convertible bonds but not for the convertible bonds. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of an MBS or <b>callable</b> <b>bond,</b> the {{embedded}} option relates primarily to the borrower's right to refinance the debt at a lower interest rate.

While firms that issue <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> do not consistently display the characteristics associated with severe agency problems, the issue choice for below investment grade non-financial and lower rated financial bonds, where we can expect agency problems to be more severe, is more consistent with agency theory than the issue choice for higher rated bonds...|$|R

50|$|The largest {{market for}} <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> {{is that of}} issues from {{government}} sponsored entities. They own a lot of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. In the U.S., mortgages are usually fixed rate, and can be prepaid early without cost, {{in contrast to the}} norms in other countries. If rates go down, many home owners will refinance at a lower rate. As a consequence, the agencies lose assets. By issuing a large number of <b>callable</b> <b>bonds,</b> they have a natural hedge, as they can then call their own issues and refinance at a lower rate.|$|R

50|$|With a <b>callable</b> <b>bond,</b> {{investors have}} the benefit of a higher coupon than they would have had with a non-callable bond.

This is comparable to selling (writing) an option — the option writer gets a premium up front, but has a downside if the option is exercised.|$|E
50|$|An {{embedded}} option is {{a component of}} a financial bond or other security, and usually provides the bondholder or the issuer {{the right to take}} some action against the other party. There are several types of options that can be embedded into a bond. Some common types of bonds with {{embedded option}}s include <b>callable</b> <b>bond,</b> puttable bond, convertible bond, extendible bond, exchangeable bond, and capped floating rate note. A bond may have several options embedded if they are not mutually exclusive.|$|E
40|$|Corporations in the US have {{significantly}} increased their usage of <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> {{in the past}} 10 - 15 years. Whereas callable debt was issued {{in the past for}} interest rate hedging motives, the vast majority of <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> issued today have call options that will enver be 2 ̆ 2 in the money 2 ̆ 2. This feature implies that previous explanations for the issuance of callable debt no longer rationalize the current pattern. We present evidence on the types of firms issuing these bonds and their usage of the proceeds, which motivates a new theory for why firms desire these eternally 2 ̆ 2 out of the money 2 ̆ 2 call options. This theory captures the motives of firms in matching the maturities of investment and financing and endogenously generates firm-specific refinancing risk. We then embed this theory into a production-based model and show that <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> can expand access to capital markets and increase investment...|$|R

50|$|Convertibles are {{bonds or}} {{preferred}} stock {{that can be}} converted, at {{the election of the}} holder of the convertibles, into the common stock of the issuing company. The convertibility, however, may be forced if the convertible is a <b>callable</b> <b>bond,</b> and the issuer calls the bond. The bondholder has about 1 month to convert it, or the company will call the bond by giving the holder the call price, which may be less than the value of the converted stock. This is referred to as a forced conversion.|$|E
50|$|A <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> (also called redeemable bond) {{is a type}} of bond (debt security) {{that allows}} the issuer of the bond to retain the {{privilege}} of redeeming the bond at some point before the bond reaches its date of maturity. In other words, on the call date(s), the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back the bonds from the bond holders at a defined call price. Technically speaking, the bonds are not really bought and held by the issuer but are instead cancelled immediately.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} numerically the semi-American <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> by means of finite difference methods. This study implies three results. First, the numerical error is greater for the <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> price than for the straight bond price, and too large for real applications Secondly, the numerical accuracy of the <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> price computed for the relevant range of interest rates depends entirely on the finite difference scheme which is chosen for the boundary points.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a firm's dynamic decisions: i) {{whether to}} issue a callable or non-callable bond; ii) when to call the callable bond; and iii) whether to refund it when it is called. We argue that a firm uses a <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> to reduce the risk-shifting problem in case its investment opportunities become poor. Our empirical findings support this argument. We find that a firm facing poorer future investment opportunities is more likely {{to issue a}} <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> than a firm facing better investment opportunities. In addition, a firm with a higher leverage ratio and higher investment risk {{is more likely to}} issue a <b>callable</b> <b>bond.</b> Finally, after a <b>callable</b> <b>bond</b> is issued, a firm with a poor performance and a low investment activity tends to call back a bond without refunding; a firm with the best performance and highest investment activity tends to call back a bond and refund its call; and a firm with mediocre performance and investment activity tends to not call its bonds. <b>Callable</b> <b>bond</b> Debt agency problem Risky shifting Investment uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|The {{correlation}} between {{interest rates and}} corporate bond yield spreads is a well-known feature of structural bond pricing models. Duffee (1998) argues that this correlation is weak once the effects of call options are removed from the data; a conclusion that contradicts the negative correlation expected by Longstaff and Schwartz (1995). However, Elton et al. (2001) point out that Duffee's analysis ignores {{the effects of the}} tax differential between U. S. Treasury and corporate bonds. Canadian bonds have no such tax differential, yet, after controlling for callability, we find that the {{correlation between}} interest rates and corporate bond spreads remains negligible. We also find a significant negative relationship for <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> with this relationship increasing with the moneyness of the call provision. These results are robust under alternate empirical specifications. Bond Yield Spread, Default Risk, <b>Callable</b> <b>Bonds,</b> Corporate Bonds...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} pricing <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> that are subject to default risk. The model incorporates three essential ingredients in the pricing of defaultable callable bonds: stochastic interest rate, default risk, and call provision. The stochastic interest rate is modeled as a square-root diffusion process. The default risk is modeled as a constant spread, with {{the magnitude of this}} spread impacting the probability of a Poisson process governing the arrival of the default event. The call provision is modeled as a constraint on the value of the bond in the finite difference scheme. This paper can be used both as a benchmark for models for pricing <b>callable</b> <b>bonds</b> that are subject to default risk and as a direction for future research...|$|R
