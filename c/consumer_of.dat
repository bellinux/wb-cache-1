In the polymer industry, which is the dominant <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> these reagents, alkyl lithium compounds are catalysts/initiators. in anionic polymerization of unfunctionalized olefins. For the production of fine chemicals, organolithium compounds function as strong bases and as reagents for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds.

Online interviews with <b>consumers</b> <b>of</b> counterfeit merchandise have been conducted.

5|$|The largest <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> {{tellurium}} is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, {{and lead}} alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soil. It has adapted to a fire-prone environment; plants lost in bushfires can {{regenerate}} through a ground-stored seed bank. Seedlings mostly germinate {{within two years}} of fires. Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers. Swamp wallabies are a main <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> its fruit, and the seeds are spread in wallaby faeces. Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years, though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates.|$|E

5|$|About 30% of agrichemicals contain fluorine, {{most of them}} {{herbicides}} and fungicides with a few crop regulators. Fluorine substitution, usually of {{a single}} atom or at most a trifluoromethyl group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. Trifluralin is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, {{but it is a}} suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. Sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two acetic acid hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the citric acid cycle. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> 1080, uses it to protect kiwis from the invasive Australian common brushtail possum. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{findings}} show human use of ivory to date {{back more than}} 35,000 years. It has been exported to Europe since at least Classical antiquity, but exporting accelerated during the Age of Exploration and colonisation of Africa. At its peak, {{at the end of}} the 19th century and early 20th century, with the rise of mass production, well over 1000 tons of ivory were exported to Europe yearly. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the city of Sheffield, England alone imported 180 tons just for cutlery handles. In the 1970s, Japan became the largest <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> ivory, accounting for about 40% of all trade worldwide, with Hong Kong acting as the largest trade hub.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> manganese ores.|$|E

5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{energy market}} is about 29,000 {{terawatt}} hours per year. Energy {{consumption per capita}} is 7.8tons (7076kg) of oil equivalent per year, the 10th-highest rate in the world. In 2005, 40% of this energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 22% from natural gas. The remainder was supplied by nuclear power and renewable energy sources. The United States is the world's largest <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> petroleum.The United States has 27% of global coal reserves. It is the world's largest producer of natural gas and crude oil.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{has strong}} jaws that readily crush {{shellfish}} and crustaceans. It feeds predominantly on benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms in the substrate {{of the bodies}} of water in which it forages. Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels, pipis, white sunset shells (Soletellina alba) and oysters (Crassostrea), crustaceans such as semaphore crabs and shrimp, and brown algae. The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab (Mictyris longicarpus) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black mussel did so in nearby Berowra Creek. Field experiments showed it was a <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> oysters and the gastropod Bembicium auratum, and had {{a major impact on}} their numbers.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this growth, on 9 April 2006 the OCC began to include {{download}} sales alongside physical sales when compiling the UK Albums Chart. That same day, the OCC also launched a dedicated weekly chart based solely on sales of album downloads in the UK. Approximately 64,000 albums were downloaded during the week of the chart's launch, of which just under 2,000 were of This New Day by the British band Embrace, the chart's first number one. By the end of 2006 nearly 2.8million album downloads had been purchased, which comprised 1.8% of the total album sales. The following year the UK's online music revenue grew to , which made the nation Europe's largest <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> online music. By the end of decade over 25million albums had been downloaded and the market comprised 12.5% of total album sales. Following Embrace, a further 99 artists topped the chart; fifteen did so with two albums.

5|$|Mughal-e-Azam takes {{numerous}} liberties {{with historical}} fact. Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{says that although}} the real Salim was a heavy <b>consumer</b> <b>of</b> alcohol and opium {{from the age of}} 18, he was not necessarily a mischievous boy, as depicted in the film. When the film's Salim returns from his time in the military, he is depicted as a gentle and romantic hero, in contrast to the real Salim, who was documented as a brutal drunk who would often beat people to death. The real Salim did lead a rebellion against his father, tried to replace him as emperor, and had Akbar's friend Abu al-Fazl murdered in 1602, but the film ascribes these actions to his desire to marry Anarkali, which is historically inaccurate. Further, there were also discrepancies in sets, costumes, and music of the film. The Sheesh Mahal, actually the royal bath of the queen, was depicted in the film as a dancing hall, and much larger. Music and dancing styles from the 19th century were depicted, although the story takes place in the 16th century. For example, thumri, a semi-classical music form developed in the 19th century, is adopted in a dance sequence in Kathak style, which is a 16th-century dance form.|$|E

40|$|As {{counterfeiting}} activity {{continues to}} thrive around the world, firms manufacturing genuine items {{work hard to}} discourage counterfeiting and protect their revenues. But the authors suggested the possibility that firms might benefit from counterfeits.
