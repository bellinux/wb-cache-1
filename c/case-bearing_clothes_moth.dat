5000|$|Tinea pellionella, the <b>case-bearing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of tineoid moth in the family Tineidae, the fungus moths. It is the type species of the genus Tinea, {{which in turn is}} the type genus of the subfamily, family, as well as the {{superfamily}} Tineoidea. Its scientific name is derived from [...] "tinea", a generic term for micromoths, and the Latin term for a furrier, pellionellus.|$|E
50|$|Tineids are unusual among Lepidoptera as {{the larvae}} {{of only a}} very small number of species feed on living plants, the {{majority}} feeding on fungi, lichens, and detritus. The most familiar members of the family are the clothes moths, which have adapted to feeding on stored fabrics. The most widespread of such species are the common clothes moth (Tineola bisselliella), the <b>case-bearing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (Tinea pellionella), and the carpet moth (Trichophaga tapetzella); the brown-dotted clothes moth (Niditinea fuscella) despite its name, preferentially feeds on feathers in bird nests.|$|E

50|$|This smallish moth has a {{wingspan}} of 14-22 mm when adult. They {{are more}} colorful than usual for the genus Tinea, though their colors usually fade considerably in dead specimens. The forewings are grey with a brownish tinge at the base, and rusty-red {{in the outer}} part. They have a black dot on the edge bordering the hindwings. The latter are a paler and purer grey. The body is dusky grey, but the head has a tuft of brick-red hair. The caterpillars feed on natural fibers, predominantly of animal origin, such as feathers, furs and wool; they {{have been found in}} bird nests and were recorded to eat rags and old clothes. But they are not notably synanthropic and generally eat only food that is outdoors; unlike the closely related <b>case-bearing</b> <b>clothes</b> <b>moth</b> (T. pellionella) the present species is rarely if at all recorded as a pest.|$|E
