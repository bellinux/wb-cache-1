500|$|The then-Civil Aviation Minister, Praful Patel {{said that}} the {{aircraft}} was following an Instrument landing system (ILS) approach for landing on the newer, longer, runway, which was commissioned in 2006.

5000|$|On 22 May 2010, Air India Express Flight 812, a Boeing 737-800 VT-AXV, {{flying on}} the Dubai-Mangalore route, {{overshot}} the 8033 ft runway number 06/24, killing 158 people, including 6 crew; only 8 survived. The aircraft crashed when it overshot the runway and veered into a steep gorge {{at the end}} of the runway. The starboard wing impacted the <b>concrete</b> <b>socket</b> of the instrument landing system (ILS) localiser antenna, rendering it unusable. This resulted in delayed or cancelled flights for two weeks during the monsoon rains, which reduced visibility. It took the airport a little under a month to repair and calibrate the ILS and bring it back online.|$|E

The pilot reported to ATC that it was 'established' on an ILS approach about 4.3 mi from touchdown; landing clearance was then given at 2000 ft from touchdown. The aeroplane concluded its ILS approach on runway 24, touching down 5200 ft {{from the start of}} the runway, leaving 2800 ft in which to stop. It overran the runway and ploughed through a 90 m sand arrestor bed which did not stop it. As the aircraft passed the arrestor bed, its starboard wing collided with the <b>concrete</b> <b>socket</b> of the ILS localiser antenna; it finally plunged over the edge of the table-top about 790 ft beyond the end of the runway and down the steep hillside coming to a stop 660 to 980 ft metres past the top of the slope.|$|E
500|$|The {{ground on}} which the wheel is built was {{previously}} used as an open cast fire clay mine, a coal mine, and a tar works, resulting in contamination of the canal with tar and mercury. [...] of loosely packed backfill from the mining operations containing large sandstone boulders was not considered adequately solid foundation for {{the size of the}} structure, so deep foundations with thirty [...] <b>concrete</b> piles <b>socketed</b> onto the bedrock were used.|$|R
