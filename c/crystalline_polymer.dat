50|$|<b>Crystalline</b> <b>polymers</b> {{are usually}} opaque because of light {{scattering}} on the numerous boundaries between the crystalline and amorphous regions.

For example, atactic polypropylene is usually amorphous and transparent while syndiotactic polypropylene, which has crystallinity ~50%, is opaque.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we review flow-induced mesophases in some <b>crystalline</b> <b>polymers</b> with rather {{different}} characteristics: polyethylene terephthalate, isotactic polypropylene and polydiethylsiloxane. Because these three polymers are representatives of flexible and semi-rigid-chain polymers, {{the occurrence of}} a mesophase suggests a similar behaviour for many other <b>crystalline</b> <b>polymers.</b> The question may be not so much whether <b>crystalline</b> <b>polymers</b> show mesophase behaviour, but rather under which conditions it can be obtained. A flow field {{turns out to be}} an effective tool to unravel structural information, even if hidden in quiescent conditions. The emergence of a mesophase affects strongly any subsequent crystallization. As a result of templating and nucleating effects, a mesophase may accelerate the crystallization rate, lead to different crystal modifications, change the morphology and guide the orientation of the crystals. On the basis of mesophase formation new insights into flow-induced polymer crystallization emerge, even though the nature of the mesophase ordering is still not fully understood. A re-evaluation of models for the polymer melt (random coil and folded-chain fringed-micellar grains) is proposed to understand the combined experimental observations on mesophase ordering and crystallization...|$|R

Immediately Kevlar was incorporated into a National Institute of Justice (NIJ) evaluation program to provide lightweight, able body armor to a test pool of American law enforcement officers to ascertain if everyday able wearing was possible. Lester Shubin, a program manager at the NIJ, managed this law enforcement feasibility study within a few selected large police agencies, and quickly determined that Kevlar body armor could be comfortably worn by police daily, and would save lives.|$|E
50|$|The monomer has an {{aromatic}} fluorene core -C13H6- {{with two}} aliphatic n-octyl -C8H17 tails {{attached to the}} central carbon. Polydioctylfluorene (PFO) {{can be found in}} liquid-crystalline, glassy, amorphous, semi-crystalline or β-chain formation. This variety is on account of the intermolecular forces that PFO can participate in. The secondary forces present in PFO are typically van der Waals, which are relatively weak. These weak forces makes it a solid that can also be used as a film on a substrate. The glassy films formed by PFO chains form solutions in good solvents, meaning it is at least partially soluble. These van der Waals also add complexity to the microstructure of PFO, which is why it has a wide range of solid formations. The solid formations though, typically form low density due to the low cooling rate of the polymer. The density of polydioctylfluorene is measured by using the process of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Chain stiffness is also prominent in PFO, because of this it is predicted that the molecular weight is a factor of 2.7 lower than polystyrene, which can produce an approximation of 190 repeat units in a standard PFO chain. By changing the strain and temperature applied to the polymer’s structure results in an alteration of the PFO’s properties. Thermal treatment such as friction transfer {{can be applied to the}} structure, this is a way to alter the properties. The friction transfer aligns the structure to become crystalline or liquid <b>crystalline.</b> <b>Polymer</b> 196 is the most commonly studied type of polydioctylfluorene. In studies, polymer 196 has shown the most promising properties and the best crystallinity. Within the crystal structure of polymer 196 octyl side chains are inserted between the layer of the polymer to provide more space for efficiency in structuring the material.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of polymerization {{is concerned}} with the difference in atom connectivity and spatial orientation in polymers that has the same chemical composition.Staudinger studied the stereoisomerism in chain polymerization of vinyl monomers in late 1920s, and it took another two decades for people to fully appreciate the idea that each of the propagation steps in the polymer growth could give rise to stereoisomerism. The major milestone in the stereochemistry was established by Ziegler and Natta and their coworkers in 1950s, as they developed metal based catalyst to synthesize stereoregular polymers. The reason why the stereochemistry of the polymer is of particular interest is because the physical behavior of a polymer depends not only on the general chemical composition but also on the more subtle differences in microstructure. [...] Atactic polymers consist of a random arrangement of stereochemistry and are amorphous (noncrystalline), soft materials with lower physical strength. The corresponding isotactic (like substituents all on the same side) and syndiotactic (like substituents of alternate repeating units on the same side) polymers are usually obtained as highly crystalline materials. It is easier for the stereoregular polymers to pack into a crystal lattice since they are more ordered and the resulting crystallinity leads to higher physical strength and increased solvent and chemical resistance as well as differences in other properties that depend on crystallinity. The prime example of the industrial utility of stereoregular polymers is polypropene. Isotactic polypropene is a high-melting (165 °C), strong, <b>crystalline</b> <b>polymer,</b> which is used as both a plastic and fiber. Atactic polypropene is an amorphous material with an oily to waxy soft appearance that finds use in asphalt blends and formulations for lubricants, sealants, and adhesives, but the volumes are minuscule compared to that of isotactic polypropene.|$|E
