40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of new high-performance mechanical seals working in severe conditions requires higher material performances. Sintered silicon carbide (SSC), widely used as a hard mating material, is a potential candidate but its friction and wear properties need to be investigated in the scope of these new applications. Silicon carbide offers good mechanical properties (high hardness, high Young modulus), good corrosion resistance and good thermal conductivity, that make it suitable for tribological applications in different atmosphere (in air, argon or vacuum) and in dry or lubricated sliding. Combined with a counter-face ring made of a softer carbon-graphite, the dry sliding of SSC can be sustained even under severe conditions of pressure and speed. Graphite has been intensively studied in tribology since Bragg first described its lamellar structure. It has been thought during many years that graphite could act as a solid lubricant thanks to this structure. In fact, the environmental conditions strongly influence its tribological behavior. The hardness of the ceramic facing the <b>carbon</b> <b>seal</b> has also an impact on its friction properties. A transfer layer of carbon is generally found on the ceramic surface. In this study, a first experiment assesses the tribological behavior of SSC sliding against itself and three different carbon-graphite materials.

A second test uses an infrared camera to estimate the temperature variations of a SiC/C couple during sliding, which determines relationship between displacement resistance and the heat generation...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveResidual clot strands {{within the}} excised saphenous vein are an {{increasingly}} recognized sequela of endoscopic vein harvest. We hypothesized that endoscopic visualization facilitated by <b>sealed</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide insufflation causes stagnation of blood within the saphenous vein. In {{the absence of}} prior heparin administration, this stasis provokes clot formation. MethodsForty consecutive patients having coronary artery bypass grafting underwent endoscopic vein harvest using sealed (Guidant VasoView, n = 30; Guidant Corp, Minneapolis, Minn) or open (Datascope ClearGlide, n = 10; Datascope Corp, Montvale, NJ) carbon dioxide insufflation followed by ex vivo assessment of intraluminal saphenous vein clot via optical coherence tomography. In the <b>sealed</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide insufflation groups, clot formation was compared with (preheparinized, n = 20) and without (control, n = 10) heparin administration before endoscopic vein harvest, either at a fixed dose or titrated to an activated clotting time greater than 300 seconds. Risk factors for clot formation were assessed. ResultsResidual saphenous vein clot was a universal finding in control veins (<b>sealed</b> <b>carbon</b> dioxide insufflation endoscopic vein harvest without preheparinization). At either dose used, heparin given before endoscopic vein harvest significantly decreased saphenous vein clot burden. A similar reduction in clot was observed when using open carbon dioxide insufflation endoscopic vein harvest without preheparinization. Intraoperative blood loss and blood product requirements were similar in all groups. Patient age and preoperative maximum amplitude of the thrombelastography tracing showed a linear correlation with saphenous vein clot volume. ConclusionBy enabling the quantification of this issue as never before possible, optical coherence tomography screening revealed that intraluminal saphenous vein clot is frequently found after endoscopic vein harvest. Systemic heparinization before harvest or an open carbon dioxide endoscopic vein harvest system are benign changes in practice that can significantly lessen this complication...|$|R
40|$|The {{assembly}} joints {{of modem}} solid rocket motor cases are generally sealed using conventional O-ring type seals. The 5500 + F combustion gases produced by rocket motors are kept {{a safe distance}} away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic insulation. Special compounds are used to fill insulation gaps {{leading up to the}} seals to prevent a direct flowpath to them. Design criteria require that the seals should not experience torching or charring during operation, or their sealing ability would be compromised. On limited occasions, NASA has observed charring of the primary O-rings of the Space Shuttle solid rocket nozzle assembly joints due to parasitic leakage paths opening up in the gap-fill compounds during rocket operation. NASA is investigating different approaches for preventing torching or charring of the primary O-rings. One approach is to implement a braided rope seal upstream of the primary O-ring to serve as a thermal barrier that prevents the hot gases from impinging on the O-ring seals. This paper presents flow, resiliency, and thermal resistance for several types of NASA rope seals braided out of carbon fibers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the seals when exposed to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. Rope seals braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over six minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Room and high temperature flow tests are presented for the <b>carbon</b> <b>seals</b> for different amounts of linear compression.

The unsatisfactory wear properties of various seal and propeller shaft material combinations on many of our submarines, particularly those of the deep-submergence class and those where the trend is towards the larger shaft diameters, prompted this investigation. While the fault may well lay in design, this paper approaches the problem as one in boundary lubrication; attempting to find the best combination of seal material and mating service in this particular service condition from a wear viewpoint. An additional aim was to attempt some correlation between wear, friction, and the physical properties involved. Results from this latter goal could well find application in the selection of steam turbine seals as well as those employed in the aircraft industry. The approach used by the authors was first to evaluate potential seal materials from different families in combination with various corrosion-resistant shaft materials. This work was done on the Kinetic Oiliness Testing Machine (KOTM) and the results are presented in Part I of this investigation. The testing involved obtaining friction and wear data on carbons and laminated phenolics, as well as teflon, in combination with chrome, bronze G, and stellite # 6 „ Synthetic sea water was the primary lubricant, although the effect of wetting agents was also checked. Results here conclusively demonstrated the superiority of commercial grade <b>carbon</b> <b>seals,</b> for the wear of the laminated phenolics was excessive, and transition temperature effects were experienced with the straight teflon samples at roughly 250 °F ambient temperature. While successful as a screening tool, the KOTM proved inadequate for wear measurements of carbons; and for this reason the pin on disc geometric configuration was utilized in Part II. This section involved a more extensive analysis of the friction and wear properties of carbons in combination with five potential shaft materials. Twenty-one commercial grade carbons in all were tested, the number representing a wide cross section in graphite content 8 hardness 9 impregnation and other physical properties. The effect of wetting agents, up to 50 $ by volume, are also presented. Results of this phase conclusively demonstrated the superiority of chrome as a mating surface for carbon, its high heat of reaction and resultant resistance to carbide formation giving reasonably low friction and wear values. Several carbons were grouped close to the top when all were compared from a wear and friction viewpoint, but one, Carbon 1, was shown to be the superior material of those tested in this boundary lubrication problem. The effect of wetting agents contradicted our original assumption, in that concentrations up to 50 $ by volume gave higher frictional values than that experienced with synthetic sea water.

40|$|Spherical {{carbon coated}} iron {{particles}} of nanometric diameter in the 5 - 10 nm range {{have been produced}} by arc discharge at near-atmospheric pressure conditions (using 5 - 8 · 10 4 Pa of He). The particles exhibit a crystalline dense iron core with an average diameter 7. 4 ± 2. 0 nm surrounded by a <b>sealed</b> <b>carbon</b> shell, shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected-area diffrac- tion (SAED), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (STEM-EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The SAED, EDX and EELS results indicate a lack of traces of core oxidized phases showing an efficient protection role of the carbon shell. The magnetic properties of the nanoparticles have been investigated in the 5 - 300 K temperature range using a {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID). The results reveal a superparamagnetic behaviour with an average monodomain diameter of 7. 6 nm of the nanoparticles. The zero field cooled and field cooled (ZFC-FC) magnetization curves show a blocking temperature (TB) at room temperature very suitable for biomedical applications (drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging-MRI-, hyperthermia) ...|$|R
