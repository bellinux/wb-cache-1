5|$|Tomb of Horrors is an {{adventure}} module written by Gary Gygax for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game. It was originally written for and {{used at the}} 1975 Origins1 convention.

All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E

5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory.

For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would <b>challenge</b> <b>the</b> validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
