40|$|AbstractWe {{partially}} {{characterized the}} transferrin-independent iron uptake (Tf-IU) of neuronal and glial {{cells in the}} previous report. In the present study, we further examined a mechanism of which glial cells protect neuronal cells against iron stress using neuron–microglia (N–MG) and neuron–astrocyte (N–AS) <b>co-cultures.</b> When each solely purified cell was treated with iron citrate, cell death occurred in N and MG. However, AS proliferated under the same condition. Both N–MG and N–AS <b>co-cultures</b> were effective in resistance to excessive iron. The total and specific Tf-IU activities of N–MG <b>co-cultures</b> {{similar to those of}} N did not increase in a density-dependent manner. Contrarily, the total activity of AS was extremely high and the specific activity was extremely low as a result of proliferation. Regarding of effect of <b>co-cultures</b> on H 2 O 2 -induced cell death, N–MG <b>co-cultures</b> were less effective, but N–AS <b>co-cultures</b> were more effective in protecting N from the oxidative stress. These results suggest that N–MG <b>co-cultures</b> suppress the Tf-IU and N–AS <b>co-cultures</b> stimulate AS proliferation to protect neuronal cells. Brain cells from aceruloplasminemia with mutations in the ceruloplasmin gene take up iron by Tf-IU. Therefore, the different mechanisms of neuronal cell protection by MG and AS may explain the pathophysiological observations in the brains of patient with aceruloplasminemia...|$|R

In Europe, the recent introduction of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus [the pinewood nematode (PWN) ] and some species of Meloidogyne has proved damaging to forest ecosystems and crop production. Due to the very laborious and environment-dependent nature of greenhouse or field assays, in vitro host with parasite <b>co-cultures</b> can be a useful biotechnological tool to evaluate potential nematotoxic essential oils (EOs). The present work intended to a) screen EOs against PWN motility and M. chitwoodi [Columbia root-knot nematode (CRKN) ] hatching, b) establish and characterize Pinus pinaster (maritime pine) in vitro cultures and Solanum tuberosum (potato) hairy roots (HR) cultures as well as P. pinaster with PWN and S. tuberosum HR with CRKN <b>co-cultures,</b> c) determine the effect of selected nematotoxic EOs on <b>co-cultures</b> growth or relative water content, nematode population and volatiles production. Ruta graveolens, Satureja montana and Thymbra capitata EOs revealed high activities against PWN. These and Dysphania ambrosioides and Filipendula ulmaria EOs also showed high inhibitory activity against CRKN. The established P. pinaster with PWN and S. tuberosum HR with CRKN <b>co-cultures,</b> displayed infection and developmental characteristics similar to those in nature. Of the most active EOs, those of R. graveolens and S. montana were chosen to be tested with in vitro <b>co-cultures.</b> S. montana EO was highly phytotoxic to both <b>co-cultures,</b> inhibiting potato HRs growth and inducing chlorosis and wilting in pine shoots. R. graveolens EO inhibited potato HRs with CRKN <b>co-cultures</b> growth but induced no macroscopic damages to in vitro P. pinaster with PWN <b>co-cultures.</b> In addition to constitutive compounds, biotransformation volatile compounds were detected after EOs addition to both <b>co-cultures</b> types. P. pinaster with PWN and S. tuberosum HR with CRKN <b>co-cultures</b> were a good system to mimic some of the natural infection conditions, allowing an overview of the combined host / parasite reactions, and being able to assist in the evaluation of EOs phytotoxicity and nematotoxic potential.

Damage to articular cartilage typically leads to long-term pain and disability, as current treatments are unable to fully restore the functional tissue. Thus, tissue engineers seek to develop technologies to enhance cartilage repair. This thesis investigated two strategies for cartilage engineering: flow perfusion bioreactor culture and <b>co-cultures</b> of chondrocytes with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). First, we designed a novel bioreactor and then investigated the effect of flow perfusion on chondrocytes when combined with chondrogenic stimuli, including hypoxia and transforming growth factor-β 3 (TGF-β 3). We demonstrated {{that the combination of}} flow perfusion and hypoxic conditions enhanced proliferation, cartilage-like extracellular matrix production, and chondrogenic gene expression compared to perfusion alone. However, these results also demonstrated the need for a more potent chondrogenic stimulus, and thus the effect of perfusion with TGF-β 3 was investigated on both chondrocytes and <b>co-cultures</b> of chondrocytes and MSCs. Here, we described the advantages of using exogenous growth factors in flow perfusion cultures, and the utility of flow perfusion for creating large tissue-engineered constructs. The second part of this thesis investigated <b>co-cultures</b> of chondrocytes and MSCs having the potential to reduce the demand for chondrocytes, which overcomes a significant challenge to current approaches toward cartilage repair. We first investigated the sensitivity of this cell population to TGF-β 3 and then investigated the stability of the cell phenotype resulting from growth factor supplementation. The results demonstrated that <b>co-cultures</b> of chondrocytes and MSCs enable a reduced concentration and duration of TGF-β 3 exposure to achieve an equivalent level of chondrogenesis compared to chondrocyte or MSC monocultures. Thus, the present work implicates that the promise of <b>co-cultures</b> for cartilage engineering is enhanced by their robust phenotype and heightened sensitivity to TGF-β 3. The final section of this thesis investigated the ability of such <b>co-cultures</b> to repair cartilage in a rat osteochondral defect model.
