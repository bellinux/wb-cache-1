5|$|Besides {{being one}} of the oldest {{surviving}} examples of Spanish architecture in California, the house gained much prominence by association with Helen Hunt Jackson's wildly popular 1884 novel Ramona. The <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> Estudillo is one of three National Historic Landmarks in Southern California that were closely tied to Ramona, a novel of Californio life shortly after the American acquisition of California; the other two are Rancho Camulos and Rancho Guajome.|$|E
5|$|In {{the museum}} <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> la Libertad at Sucre, Bolivia, {{there is an}} Argentine flag, {{protected}} by a glass case and in a deteriorated condition, which they {{claim to be the}} original one raised by Belgrano for first time in 1812. The ensign was one of two abandoned and hidden inside a small church near Macha after the battle of Ayohuma, during the retreat from Upper Peru in 1813. The other flag was given back to Argentina by the Bolivian authorities in 1896.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Spain from September 1964 until April 1965, with a break in filming from late December until late February. Welles's {{limitations}} on the film included a budget of $800,000 and actors Jeanne Moreau and John Gielgud being available for five and ten days respectively, while Margaret Rutherford was only available for four weeks. Welles later joked that during one scene which included seven principal characters, none of the actors were available and stand-ins were used for over-the-shoulder shots of all seven characters. Filming began in Colmenar and included all of John Gielgud's scenes. Welles then traveled to Cardona, where the Royal Court scenes and Marina Vlady's scenes were shot, and to Madrid's <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> Campo Park, where the Gadshill robbery scene was filmed. Madrid was also {{the location of the}} Boar's Head Tavern set, where Welles shot Moreau's and Rutherford's scenes. The production then traveled to Pedraza for some outdoor street scenes, and then to Soria to shoot in the snow for the opening shots. After shooting some scenes with Justice Shallow and Justice Silence in the Basque country, Welles returned to Madrid in December to film the battle scenes in <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> Campo Park for ten days.|$|E

Apparently a single, elderly man lives in the house to this day.|$|E

5|$|In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen {{people were}} injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and glass was broken, but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> Fruta, a service station sustained structural damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass.|$|E
5|$|At {{the most}} extreme points of its perceptibility, it was felt with {{intensity}} II or III (Weak) at Healdsburg {{in the north and}} Santa Barbara in the south, Visalia in the central valley and Twain Harte in the Sierra Nevada foothills. It was also listed as having been felt (with no specific intensity level given) by residents in high-rise buildings in Reno, Nevada. Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
5|$|SR94 is an east–west freeway {{that begins}} at {{the eastern end of}} the one-way couplet of F and G streets in {{southeast}} San Diego. The freeway continues through an interchange with I-5 just east of downtown. Following this, the route goes through the neighborhoods of Sherman Heights, Grant Hill, Stockton, and Mount Hope, where there is an interchange with SR 15. Shortly thereafter, SR94 intersects I-805 in Chollas View before continuing east through Emerald Hills and Chollas Creek into the city of Lemon Grove. Passing by the Marketplace at the Grove Mall, the freeway forms the boundary between Lemon Grove to the south and La Mesa to the north, up to the SR 125 interchange where SR 94 turns east. At this point, SR94 leaves both cities and enters unincorporated Spring Valley and <b>Casa</b> <b>de</b> Oro.|$|E
