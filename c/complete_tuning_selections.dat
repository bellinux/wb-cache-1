40|$|Selection {{pressure}} {{controls the}} selection of individuals from the current population to produce a new population in the next generation. It gives individuals of higher quality a higher probability of being used to create the next generation so that Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can focus on promising regions in the search space. An evolutionary learning process is dynamic and requires different selection pressures at different learning stages in order to speed up convergence or avoid local optima. Therefore, it desires selection mechanisms being able to automatically <b>tune</b> <b>selection</b> pressure during evolution. Tournament selection is a popular selection method in EAs. This paper focuses on tournament selection and shows that standard tournament selection is unaware of the dynamics in the evolutionary process thus is unable to <b>tune</b> <b>selection</b> pressure automatically. This paper then presents a novel approach which integrates {{the knowledge of the}} Fitness Rank Distribution (FRD) of a population into tournament selection. Through mathematical modelling, simulations and experimental study, this paper shows that the new approach is effective and using the knowledge of FRD is a promising way to modify the standard tournament <b>selection</b> method for <b>tuning</b> the <b>selection</b> pressure dynamically and automatically along evolution...|$|R

It is shown that the shrinkage problem with the Lasso penalty {{is not always the}} true reason for the over-selection phenomenon in the cross-validation based <b>tuning</b> parameter <b>selection.</b> After identifying the potential problems with the standard cross-validation methods, we propose a new procedure, Consistent Cross-Validation (CCV), for selecting the optimal tuning parameter. CCV is shown to enjoy the <b>tuning</b> parameter <b>selection</b> consistency under certain technical conditions. Extensive simulations and real data analysis support the theoretical results and demonstrate that CCV also works well in terms of prediction. ...|$|R

40|$|A <b>complete</b> <b>tuning</b> {{procedure}} of designing a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) {{and a new}} stability evaluation using root locus criterion for fuzzy dynamic systems are presented. The importance of FLC in industrial applications arises {{from the fact that}} a nonlinear mapping between inputs and outputs of the process that leads to a preferred controller performance which can be easily described by fuzzy linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. However, tuning a FLC based on trial-and-error basis is usually a tedious and timeconsuming task. Stability issues of FLC systems still remain unknown as well. All of these bring over criticisms and attacks in fuzzy logic technology. In this paper, we developed a <b>complete</b> <b>tuning</b> guideline for FLC parameters (membership functions, scaling factors, rules) to simplify the tuning process. Moreover, we introduced a novel stability evaluation criterion for FLC systems based on root locus technique to design a stable fuzzy control system. Finally, simulation results [...] ...|$|R

40|$|An {{exhaustive}} search as required for traditional variable selection methods is impractical in high dimensional statistical modeling. Thus, to conduct variable selection, {{various forms of}} penalized estimators with good statistical and computational properties, have been proposed {{during the past two}} decades. The attractive properties of these shrinkage and selection estimators, however, depend critically on the size of regularization which controls model complexity. In this paper, we consider the problem of consistent <b>tuning</b> parameter <b>selection</b> in high dimensional sparse linear regression where the dimension of the predictor vector is larger than the size of the sample. First, we propose a family of high dimensional Bayesian Information Criteria (HBIC), and then investigate the selection consistency, extending the results of the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC), in Chen and Chen (2008) to ultra-high dimensional situations. Second, we develop a two-step procedure, the SIS+AENET, to conduct variable selection in p>n situations. The consistency of <b>tuning</b> parameter <b>selection</b> is established under fairly mild technical conditions. Simulation studies are presented to confirm theoretical findings, and an empirical example is given to illustrate the use in the internet advertising data.

40|$|As light {{intensity}} increases in photoacoustic imaging, the saturation of optical absorption {{and the temperature}} dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient result in a measurable nonlinear dependence of the photoacoustic (PA) signal on the excitation pulse fluence. Here, under controlled conditions, we investigate the intensity-dependent photoacoustic signals from oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin at varied optical wavelengths and molecular concentrations. The wavelength and concentration dependencies of the nonlinear PA spectrum {{are found to be}} significantly greater in oxygenated hemoglobin than in deoxygenated hemoglobin. These effects are further influenced by the hemoglobin concentration.

We demonstrate the various ways selection pressure can be varied in a spatially distributed EA and show that, from a performance point of view, no optimal selection pressure can be defined since it also depends on the fitness landscape of the problem being solved.

Here we use the mathematical concepts of stochastic optimal control to study {{what is needed to}} control evolving populations. Following established routes to calculate control strategies, we first study how a polymorphism can be maintained in a finite population by adaptively <b>tuning</b> <b>selection.</b> We then introduce a minimal model of drug resistance in a stochastically evolving cancer cell population and compute adaptive therapies, where decisions are based on monitoring the response of the tumor, which can outperform established therapy paradigms. For both case studies, we demonstrate the importance of high-resolution monitoring of the target population in order to achieve a given control objective: to control one must monitor.

40|$|Regularized {{variable}} selection {{is a powerful}} tool for identifying the true regression model from a large number of candidates by applying penalties to the objective functions. The penalty functions typically involve a tuning parameter that control the complexity of the selected model.

In this study we develop a consistent <b>tuning</b> parameter <b>selection</b> method for regularized Cox 2 ̆ 7 s proportional hazards model with a diverging number of parameters. The tuning parameter is selected by minimizing the generalized information criterion. We prove that, for any penalty that possesses the oracle property, the proposed <b>tuning</b> parameter <b>selection</b> method identifies the true model with probability approaching one as sample size increases.
