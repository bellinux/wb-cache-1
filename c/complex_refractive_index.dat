25|$|Upon the {{analysis}} of the change of polarization of light, ellipsometry can yield information about layers that are thinner than the wavelength of the probing light itself, even down to a single atomic layer. Ellipsometry can probe the <b>complex</b> <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> or dielectric function tensor, which gives access to fundamental physical parameters like those listed above. It is commonly used to characterize film thickness for single layers or complex multilayer stacks ranging from a few angstroms or tenths of a nanometer to several micrometers with an excellent accuracy.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{ellipsometry}} is {{done only}} in the reflection setup. The exact nature of the polarization change {{is determined by the}} sample's properties (thickness, <b>complex</b> <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> or dielectric function tensor). Although optical techniques are inherently diffraction-limited, ellipsometry exploits phase information (polarization state), and can achieve sub-nanometer resolution. In its simplest form, the technique is applicable to thin films with thickness of less than a nanometer to several micrometers. Most models assume the sample is composed of a small number of discrete, well-defined layers that are optically homogeneous and isotropic. Violation of these assumptions requires more advanced variants of the technique (see below).|$|E
25|$|Ellipsometry {{can be used}} {{to model}} the (<b>complex)</b> <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> of a surface of a bulk material. It is also very useful in {{determining}} parameters of one or more thin film layers deposited on a substrate. Due to their reflection properties, not only are the predicted magnitude of the p and s polarization components, but their relative phase shifts upon reflection, compared to measurements using an ellipsometer. A normal ellipsometer does not measure the actual reflection coefficient (which requires careful photometric calibration of the illuminating beam) but the ratio of the p and s reflections, as well as change of polarization ellipticity (hence the name) induced upon reflection by the surface being studied. In addition to use in science and research, ellipsometers are used in situ to control production processes for instance.|$|E

2500|$|Single-wavelength {{ellipsometry}} {{employs a}} monochromatic light source. This {{is usually a}} laser in the visible spectral region, for instance, a HeNe laser [...] with a wavelength of 632.8nm. Therefore, single-wavelength ellipsometry is also called laser ellipsometry. The advantage of laser ellipsometry is that laser beams can be focused on a small spot size. Furthermore, lasers have a higher power than broad band light sources. Therefore, laser ellipsometry {{can be used for}} imaging (see below). However, the experimental output is restricted to one set of [...] and [...] values per measurement. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources, which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. By that the <b>complex</b> <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> or the dielectric function tensor in the corresponding spectral region can be obtained, which gives access to a large number of fundamental physical properties. Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) can probe lattice vibrational (phonon) and free charge carrier (plasmon) properties.
