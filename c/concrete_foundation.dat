5|$|Stone later {{returned}} to the United States, where he worked as an engineer for the Florida Ship Canal Company in 1883. He also served as the Chief Engineer {{for the construction of}} the Statue of Liberty's pedestal and <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation.</b> He fell ill after the dedication ceremony and died in New York City. Stone is buried in West Point National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match {{the look and}} texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation,</b> with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E
5|$|The {{open air}} burn pits were located {{east of the}} new gas {{chambers}} and refuelled from 4a.m. (or after 5a.m. depending on work-load) to 6p.m. in roughly 5-hour intervals. The current camp memorial includes a flat grave marker resembling one of them. It is constructed from melted basalt and has a <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation.</b> It is a symbolic grave, as the Nazis spread the actual human ashes, mixed with sand, over 22,000 square metres (237,000 square feet).|$|E
50|$|Thermal Integrity Profiling is a {{non-destructive}} testing method of evaluating {{the integrity of}} <b>concrete</b> <b>foundations.</b> It is standardized by ASTM D7949 - Standard Test Methods for Thermal Integrity Profiling of <b>Concrete</b> Deep <b>Foundations.</b>|$|R

5|$|When the Orange Line was {{originally}} constructed in 1977, foundations for the bridges {{to carry the}} Silver Line over I-66 to the median of the Dulles Access Road were built up to ground level. These foundations included steel piles that were driven {{into the ground and}} capped with concrete. However, detailed records for these original foundations were lost. As a result, engineers asked for the foundations to be inspected by digging around them to determine the condition of each pile under the <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> caps.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) {{side of the}} home, near the {{carriage}} house, is a miniature Stick style house known as Little House. Little House is 13 feet (4 m) by 15 feet (4.6 m) and stands 14 feet (4.3 m) above its <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation.</b> The Little House's roof is an exact replica of the original roof of the Ellwood House. Little House was built in 1892 with assistance from every carpenter in DeKalb; the house was {{to be used as}} a float in a local parade. After the parade Isaac Ellwood's son, Will, bought the house and had it placed on the Ellwood House property in the same location it stands today. The house was used by Will's two daughters and later by Perry Ellwood's children.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} New Paltz station {{burned down}} around 4:45 A.M. on April23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire {{originated in the}} office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A passenger car {{was used as a}} temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December31, 1907, and in active use by February7, 1908. While the original station had a gabled roof, the rebuilt station was hipped. The direction of the new station's battens was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.|$|E

5|$|Time, wear, {{and severe}} weather {{conditions}} led to many identified problems, {{the single most}} pervasive being water damage. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed {{to take into account}} how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.|$|E

25|$|Next to the tower, at {{the corner}} of the road and the summit {{clearing}} east of it, is the observer's cabin. It is a one-story batten-sided gable-roofed hut on a <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> with a metal roof. Just inside the woods to the north is the wooden privy. In the summit clearing there is also a more contemporary wooden picnic table and, at the south end, the remains of an older foundation.|$|E
25|$|The Public Square is a {{city park}} that houses a {{pavilion}} and the village hall. It {{is located in the}} heart of the village's residential district. The Scales Mound Village Hall was built around 1875â€“90. It has a false front design and stands one and one half stories tall. It sits on a stone and <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> and has an early-20th-century addition at the rear. The Scales Mound Village Hall is now available to rent for events.|$|E
25|$|Single or two story wood-frame {{domestic}} structures {{built on}} a perimeter or slab foundation are relatively safe in an earthquake, but in many structures built before 1950 the sill plate that sits between the <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> and the floor diaphragm (perimeter foundation) or studwall (slab foundation) may not be sufficiently bolted in. Additionally, older attachments (without substantial corrosion-proofing) may have corroded {{to a point of}} weakness. A sideways shock can slide the building entirely off of the foundations or slab.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has <b>concrete</b> <b>foundations,</b> staircase, verandah floors and strong room. The {{external and internal}} walls are rendered brickwork. Internally the floors are timber The terracotta tiled roof is pyramid-shaped, with wide-eaves.|$|R

25|$|Morgan {{later told}} biographer Myra Friedman that, as a non-musician, {{he had felt}} {{excluded}} whenever he had visited Sunset Sound Recorders. Instead, he stayed at Joplin's Larkspur home while she stayed alone at the Landmark, although several times she visited Larkspur {{to be with him}} and to check the progress of renovations she was having done on the house. She told her construction crew to design a carport to be shaped like a flying saucer, according to biographer Ellis Amburn, the <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> for which was poured the day before she died.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War it was {{the site}} of a {{tracking}} station for anti-aircraft gunnery practice. The set up was that an aircraft flew up and {{down in front of the}} guns, which would try to bring it down. Initially, radio-controlled 'Queen Bee' aircraft were used, and the flat <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> by the white tower on the cairn, now the location of the Solway Harvester memorial stone, was laid down for one of the control huts. The memorial stone to the Solway Harvester is in the form of an anchor set in a granite block.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{unexpected}} challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El NiÃ±o weather front dumped {{two inches of}} rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just {{three days before the}} scheduled <b>concrete</b> <b>foundation</b> pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete. Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.|$|E
