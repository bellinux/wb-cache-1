5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> their {{depictions of}} the dogs of Polynesia and {{possibly}} many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate {{depictions of the}} dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> several different ways. One such way {{is if it}} moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open warm water, such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of the attack is to observe a certain {{differential}} <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> a block cipher (or {{in a part of}} it), a permutation or another type of primitive. Finding values fulfilling the characteristic is achieved by splitting the primitive [...] into three parts such that [...] [...] is called the inbound phase and [...] and [...] together are called the outbound phase. The attacker then chooses values that realize part of the differential <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> the inbound phase deterministically, and fulfill the remainder of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> a probabilistic manner.|$|R
30|$|In the {{multistage}} processes, {{the process}} capability indices are calculated when {{the process is}} in control. The conditions of the processes are determined using case-selecting control charts. As mentioned former, in a two-stage process, the quality <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> the first stage affects the quality <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> the second stage {{referred to as the}} cascade property. Therefore, using the traditional process capability index to measure the capability of the second stage may provide misleading results due to ignoring the cascade effect. In other words, if one is going to measure the capability of the second stage specifically, she cannot use the traditional process capability indices on the quality <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> the second stage and she must use a statistic independent from the quality <b>characteristic</b> <b>in</b> the first stage. This is the main point which is not considered in any studies so far.|$|R
5|$|As a {{commander}} Marlborough preferred battle over slow moving siege warfare. Aided by an expert staff (particularly his carefully selected aides-de-camp such as Cadogan), {{as well as}} enjoying a close personal relationship with the talented Imperial commander, Prince Eugene, Marlborough proved far-sighted, often far ahead of his contemporaries in his conceptions, and was a master at assessing his enemy's <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> battle. Marlborough {{was more likely to}} manoeuvre than his opponents, and was better at maintaining operational tempo at critical times, yet the Duke qualifies more as a great practitioner within the constraints of early 18th century warfare, rather than as a great innovator who radically redefined military theory. Nevertheless, his predilection for fire, movement, and co-ordinated all-arms attacks, lay at the root of his great battlefield successes.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{overlaid}} the Avatars of {{the fictional}} universe with an elaborate order of succession by blood, similar to the ascent of royal families. The descriptors Royals, King and Prince are replaced in the series with Vectori, Prophet and Prince.

These Wild Card Avatars have special rules in addition to, or replacing, the normal ones.

5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing.

5|$|In the r/K-selection model, {{the first}} {{variable}} r is the intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} in population {{size and the}} second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population. Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An r-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r-selected species. Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r-selected <b>characteristics.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, a K-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and {{the bowl}} of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top left. Other general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E

5|$|The Limousin {{cattle breed}} has been popular in France {{for more than}} two centuries because of its meat qualities and the breed's {{production}} efficiency. Since the early 1990s scientists have quantified these breed <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> comparisons with other breeds, and identified a natural variant of the myostatin gene found in Limousins which has a significant influence on them. The myostatin gene is found in all mammals and influences the production of a protein that controls muscle development. Variants of the gene produce proteins that are less effective at controlling muscle development, which results in increased muscle mass.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} is migratory, {{moving to}} higher latitudes following warm water masses. In the eastern Pacific, males travel further than females, reaching {{as far as}} Vancouver Island {{in the late summer}} and early fall. Juveniles tend to remain in warm nursery areas. There appear to be separate populations with different life history <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> the eastern Pacific and western Indian Ocean and possibly elsewhere; this species is not known to make transoceanic movements. In the northwestern Indian Ocean, males and females segregate by location and depth during the pupping season from January to May. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed substantial regional genetic variation within common threshers in all three oceans. This could support the idea that, despite being high mobile, sharks from different areas rarely interbreed.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a heterozygote and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E

5|$|The {{forms in}} which the gods are shown, {{although}} diverse, are limited in many ways. Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography. Others could represent many deities, often because these deities had major <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> common. Bulls and rams were associated with virility, cows and falcons with the sky, hippopotami with maternal protection, felines with the sun god, and serpents with both danger and renewal. Animals that were absent from Egypt {{in the early stages}} of its history were not used as divine images. For instance, the horse, which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1550 BC), never represented a god. Similarly, the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom: a kilt, false beard, and often a shirt for male gods and a long, tight-fitting dress for goddesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{services}} sought different <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> their aircraft – the RAF desired a single-seat fighter with secondary intercept capability, {{while the}} Fleet Air Arm (FAA) sought a two-seat interceptor capable of secondary low-level strike capability. Accordingly, HSA's submission involved {{the development of}} two distinct variants of the same P.1154 aircraft, each aimed towards a particular service and its stated requirements. Although financially and politically committed to a joint requirement with the Royal Navy, the RAF's single-seat design took precedence over the two-seat version of the Royal Navy. However, RAF P.1154s would have to accommodate the Navy's large airborne intercept (AI) radar. When HSA submitted the design on 8August, the Royal Navy criticised the proposal, which had a tandem undercarriage layout incompatible with catapult operations; consequently, a tricycle undercarriage design was investigated and accepted as practical. The aircraft would have been armed with the Red Top missile.|$|E

A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, {{but there are}} only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval <b>characteristics</b> <b>in</b> their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries close to the surface.|$|E
