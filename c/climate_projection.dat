This article examines the impact of the external institutional context on the use and usability of <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> in local government through an analysis of 44 planning and climate change (adaptation) documents and 54 semi-structured interviews with planners in England and Germany conducted between July 2013 and May 2014. We show that there is little demand for <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> in local adaptation planning in either country due to existing policy, legal and regulatory frameworks. Local government in England has not only experienced a decline in use of <b>climate</b> <b>projections,</b> but also the waning of the climate change adaptation agenda more widely, amidst changes in the planning and regulatory framework and severe budget cuts. In Germany, spatial planning makes substantial use of past and present climate data, but the strictly regulated nature of planning prevents the use of <b>climate</b> <b>projections,</b> due to their inherent uncertainties. Findings from the two countries highlight that if we are to better understand the usability of <b>climate</b> <b>projections,</b> we need to be more aware of the institutional context within which planning decisions are made.

This study examines the implications of coupled model biases on regional <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> in the tropical western Pacific. Model biases appear in the simulation of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, the location and movement of the South Pacific Convergence Zone, rainfall patterns, and the mean state of the ocean-atmosphere system including the cold tongue bias and erroneous location of the edge of the Western Pacific warm pool. These biases are examined in the CMIP 3 20 th century climate models and used to provide some context to the uncertainty in interpretations of regional-scale <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> for the 21 st century.

Focus on NWP and <b>climate</b> <b>projection,</b> the satellite instruments provide near-global coverage observations that not only would benefit the performance of weather forecast and climate prediction but also {{could be used for}} model evaluation. This study uses the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) to simulate the satellite-observed radiance at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) by the NWP model outputs from Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) global model forecast. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis datasets will be used as the reference. Therefore, the brightness temperature difference (BTD) between model and observation in two window channels (11 and 12) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra/Aqua will be analyzed to help the evaluation of CWB global model forecast. The preliminary result indicates that both CWB’s initial forecast and MODIS BTDs are less than 1 K. However, MODIS’s shows some noise which could be caused by the high spatial resolution or the cloud contamination in the clear sky pixels. The efforts will continue to diagnose the long-term BTD datasets at different forecast time and quantify the model performance in the future. 1...|$|E
30|$|Generally, in the {{forestry}} domain three {{major sources of}} uncertainty are to be considered. Uncertainty may arise from sampling errors, measurement errors and prediction errors (Kangas and Kangas 2004). In our analysis {{we focus on the}} latter as we compare the effects of three <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> on drought risk and height growth. The purpose of our uncertainty analysis is to quantify a range of possible outcomes. Especially in the case of <b>climate</b> <b>projections,</b> Jones (2000) precisely distinguishes between scenarios, forecasts and projected ranges of outcomes. In his definition a scenario is one possible projection with no probability assigned to it. A forecast, on the other hand, is the most likely projection with high probability and little uncertainty left. And eventually, a projected range of outcomes, {{as is the case in}} our analysis, includes uncertainties due to different probabilities. Of course, the probabilities of <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> are unknown also in our analysis. The range of results simply illustrates the potential effects on, for example, drought risk or height growth. Using this information in the course of the decision process the forest manager might define his risk attitude and thus, consequently, assigns probabilities to the <b>climate</b> <b>projections.</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>projections</b> of <b>climate</b> change and the responses to those projections. First, it discusses uncertainty {{and its role in}} shaping not only the production of <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> but also the use of these projections by decision makers. We find that uncertainty critically affects the way <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> move from useful to usable, where usefulness is defined by scientists' perception of users' needs, and usability is defined by users' perception of what knowledge can be readily applied to their decision. From {{the point of view of}} the natural scientist, we pose that there is an uncertainty fallacy, that is, a belief that the systematic reduction of uncertainty in <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> is required in order for the projections to be used by decision makers. Second, we explore the implications of <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> for policy and decision making, using examples from the seasonal climate forecast applications literature as an analog. We examine constraints and opportunities for their application in policy and practice and find that over-reliance on science and technical solutions might crowd out the moral imperative to do what is needed to improve livelihoods and to guarantee ecosystems' long-term sustainability. We conclude that, in the context of high uncertainty, decision makers should not look for ‘perfect’ forecasts, but seek to implement knowledge systems that integrate <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> with other kinds of knowledge and that consider the multiple stressors that shape their decision environment.

The hydrological regime of the recent past and the regimes of 30 <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> are considered. The potential hydrological regimes are simulated for <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> from five general circula-tion models (GCM) for two greenhouse gas emission scenarios and three temporal horizons (2020, 2050 and 2080). For each hydrological regime, weekly reservoir operating rules are calculated with a dynamic and stochastic optimization model.

For the majority of <b>climate</b> <b>projections,</b> the analysis of simulations in the context of climate change shows an increase in hydropower and in annual unproductive spills. These increases reach 22 % and 300 %, respectively, compared to the control period. Also, the reliability of a reservoir is compromised for half of the <b>climate</b> <b>projections,</b> with annual probabilities reaching above the maximum operating levels, up to 0. 3 %, whereas these probabilities were null for the control period.

This manuscript presents a set of methods meant to support flood frequency evaluation based on current downscaled <b>climate</b> <b>projections</b> and the potential implications of changing flood risk on how evaluations are made. Methods are demonstrated in four case study basins: the Boise River above Lucky Peak Dam, the San Joaquin River above Friant Dam, the James River above Jamestown Dam, and the Gunnison River above Blue Mesa Dam.
