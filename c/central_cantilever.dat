25|$|In 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was {{organized}} {{to finance the}} construction. Among the prominent backers was Henry Clay Frick, the coal tycoon and associate of Andrew Carnegie. The Union Bridge Company of Athens, Pennsylvania, which had completed the Michigan <b>Central</b> <b>cantilever</b> bridge at Niagara (see Niagara Cantilever Bridge), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by Charles Macdonald and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction {{was carried out by}} constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with falsework. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.|$|E
50|$|The Foyle Bridge is {{a bridge}} in Derry, Northern Ireland. The <b>central</b> <b>cantilever</b> {{span of the}} bridge is the longest in the island of Ireland, at 234 metres (767 ft), and the whole {{suspended}} bridge structure including the approach spans is also the longest in Ireland at 866 metres (2839 ft).|$|E
50|$|In Plan, {{the house}} is an 80 ft long by 14 ft wide rectangle, with a {{mezzanine}} centred over the <b>central</b> <b>cantilever</b> point. Given that {{the house is}} accessed from below and that the individual enters {{the house in the}} middle, the dimensions and features within the residence are mirrored either side of the cantilever point. With no member of the 80 ft long truss bigger than 2.5 in, the house is very lightweight and even bounces at either end, some 40 ft from the cantilever point.|$|E
50|$|Tranan {{features}} four trains, each {{consisting of}} two, bobsleigh-style vehicles. These vehicles each seat four people inline and are suspended from a <b>central,</b> <b>cantilevered</b> support structure. The two vehicles, which rest {{on either side}} of a roller coaster track, feature an air suspension system which allows for smooth, longitudinal rotations. The ride was installed by Ride Entertainment Group.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, GSA {{approved}} Lundy's {{concept for}} a building with strong end masses, a <b>central</b> <b>cantilevered</b> courtroom block, and a landscaped plaza. Despite enthusiastic {{support for the}} project, the Vietnam War triggered funding cuts that delayed construction until 1972, when GSA secured a site and held a groundbreaking ceremony. The completed building was dedicated on November 22, 1974, the fiftieth anniversary of the Revenue Act that created the court. Employees occupied the building on January 20, 1975. Due to escalating construction costs, the plaza was not completed until 1981.|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{elevation}} is original and comprises a <b>central</b> <b>cantilevered</b> verandah with turned timber posts and balusters, and an ogee shaped corrugated iron awning with oversized dentils to the eaves. A pediment with oversized dentils to the entablature surmounts the awning fronting the parapet, and {{is flanked by}} the letters WR on the southern side, and the date 1901 on the northern side. Above these are short sections of balustrade to the parapet. The verandah has a raked boarded ceiling, a central timber partition, and multi-paned French doors with fanlights and expressed architrave mouldings.|$|R

50|$|The Niagara Cantilever Bridge or Michigan <b>Central</b> Railway <b>Cantilever</b> Bridge was a {{cantilever}} {{bridge across the}} Niagara Gorge. An international railway-only bridge between Canada and the United States, it connected Niagara Falls, New York, and Niagara Falls, Ontario, located {{just south of the}} Whirlpool Bridge, and opened to traffic in 1883, it was replaced by the Michigan Central Railway Steel Arch Bridge in 1925.|$|R
50|$|From the {{conceptual}} design and vision of Pramukh Swami, the architect C. B. Sompura {{and his team}} created the mandir entirely from stone. It is a shikharbaddha (or pinnacled) mandir: seven tiered pinnacles topped by golden spires crowd the roofline, complemented by five ribbed domes. The temple is noted for its profusely carved <b>cantilevered</b> <b>central</b> dome, {{believed to be the}} only one in Britain that does not use steel or lead. Inside, serpentine ribbons of stone link the columns into arches, creating a sense of levitation.|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Southern or Michigan <b>Central</b> <b>Cantilever</b> Bridge {{was built}} in 1883 by the Central Bridge Works of Buffalo and {{engineer}} Charles Conrad Shneider. This double-track railway bridge of steel and wrought iron was commissioned by the Vanderbilt family who owned the Canadian Southern and Michigan Central Railroad lines and had the bridge built {{to compete with the}} Great Western and Grand Trunk Railway which had the use of the Roebling Railway Suspension Bridge. It was replaced in 1925 by a steel arch bridge still in place today.

50|$|The oldest {{houses in}} the system (Krayenkamp 10/11 - houses a, n and m) are also the oldest {{surviving}} residential buildings in <b>central</b> Hamburg. With <b>cantilevered</b> floors and ornamental cut cleats, they were built around 1620 (Rear houses 1615-20; Vorderhaus 1625) as a country house and summerhouse on what were otherwise ornamental and pleasure gardens. Their exposed 17th century ceiling paintings are evidence that the original owners {{were members of the}} upper class. At the time, Neustadt had just been included within the fortified ramparts of Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|<b>Central</b> Park’s <b>cantilevered</b> {{heliostat}} {{figures as}} another defining {{feature of the}} building. Suspended from the 28th floor of One Central Park’s east tower, it serves {{not only as a}} predominant design element to the building but as a way of reflecting light to the gardens and atrium below. It operates through a series of motorised mirrors that are positioned 100 metres below the cantilever on the rooftop of the west tower. Daylight is automatically tracked from these mirrors and the light is reflected up to the cantilever. 220 fixed reflecting panels are positioned across the underbelly of the cantilever and are able to then bounce light throughout the retail atrium, pedestrian corridor, pool terrace and communal areas. On the upper side of the cantilever a sky garden has been erected. At night the cantilever is transformed into an LED light display through the work of international lighting artist Yann Kersalé.|$|R
500|$|Construction on a {{link between}} the {{northern}} and southern sections of Tonkin Highway began in 1988. Included in this $48million stage was the Redcliffe Bridge over the Swan River, and an interchange with Guildford Road, north of the bridge. The [...] Redcliffe Bridge, also built using the incremental launching technique, was designed to carry six traffic lanes, as well as pedestrian and cycle paths that could be converted into traffic lanes when required. The bridge deck is supported by a narrow <b>central</b> section with <b>cantilever</b> extensions on each side, as a [...] "big heavy bridge would have looked out of place" [...] at a relatively narrow section of the river. The bridge opened on 16 April 1988, and received awards for engineering excellence from both the national and state branches of the Institute of Engineers, Australia.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{one-dimensional}} continuous formulation {{to analyze the}} vibrational modes of antenna-like nanomechanical resonators consisting of two symmetric arrays of cantilevers affixed to a <b>central</b> nano-beam. The <b>cantilever</b> arrays can have arbitrary density and length profile along the beam. We obtain the secular equation that allows for the determination of their frequency spectrum and illustrate the results on the particular examples of structures with constant or alternating cantilever length profiles. We show that our analytical results capture the vibration spectrum of such resonators and elucidate key relationships that could prove advantageous for experimental device performance. Furthermore, using a perturbative approach to treat the nonlinear and dissipative dynamics of driven structures, we analyze the anharmonic coupling between two specific widely spaced modes of the coupled-element device, with direct application to experiments.

40|$|The Gateway Bridge in Brisbane, Australia, {{is a major}} {{structure}} {{by world}} standards. It crosses the Brisbane River to form a link in an easterly bypass {{of the city of}} Brisbane. The total length of the structure is 1, 527 m, comprising approach spans of precast two-cell prestressed concrete box girders, and a single-cell prestressed concrete cast-in-place box girder <b>central</b> span and <b>cantilevers.</b> The 260 -m long central span is the longest of its type in the world. Considerable and varied geotechnical input was required for the design and construction of the bridge. The foundation conditions encountered varied locally and were highly variable {{along the length of the}} project. Foundation design changes were necessary during the course of construction and quite different foundation systems were employed along the length of the structure. These ranged from shallow pad footings on rock to deep-rock socketed piles. Approach embankment settlement problems were also encountered. Of most significance was the design of the rock socketed piles, used for the first time in the Brisbane are...|$|R
50|$|The Standard Bank Centre is in Fox and Simmond Streets {{in central}} Johannesburg. During the excavation, three stories below ground level, they came across an old stope. It {{was part of}} the {{workings}} of the old Ferreira Mine. The building's foundations were stabilised by backfilling the No. 1 level of the workings with concrete grout, but part of the stope was preserved as a museum. The building was completed in 1970. It was constructed by first building a <b>central</b> core and <b>cantilever</b> arms and then suspending the floors from the arms. The Centre houses a renowned art gallery.The enormous Carlton Centre, built at a cost of R88 million, contained a fifty-storey office tower, the thirty-storey luxury Carlton Hotel, a five-storey Garlicks department store, three-and-a-half-acre public plaza with a two-story underground shopping centre beneath it and parking garages with space for 2000 cars. The Carlton Hotel (Johannesburg) opened for business on October 1, 1972.Ponte City is a skyscraper in the Berea neighbourhood, just next to Hillbrow. It was built in 1975 to a height of 173 m (567.6 ft), making it the tallest residential skyscraper in Africa.|$|R
40|$|Past {{research}} in vibration energy harvesting {{has focused on}} the use of variable capacitors, magnets, or piezoelectric materials as the basis of energy transduction. How- ever, few of these studies have explored the detailed circuits required to make the energy harvesting work. In contrast, this thesis develops and demonstrates a circuit to support variable-capacitor-based energy harvesting. The circuit combines a diode-based charge pump with an asynchronous inductive flyback mechanism to re- turn the pumped energy to a <b>central</b> reservoir. A <b>cantilever</b> beam variable capacitor with 650 pF DC capacitance and 347. 77 pF zero-to-peak AC capacitance, formed by a 43. 56 cm 2 spring steel top plate attached to an aluminum base, drives the experimental charge pump near 1. 56 kHz. HSPICE simulation confirms that given a maximum to minimum capacitance ratio larger than 1. 65 and realistic models for the transistor and diodes, the circuit can harvest approximately 1 lW of power. This power level is achieved after optimizing the flyback path to run at approximately 1 / 4 of the mechanical vibration frequency with a duty ratio of 0. 0019. Simulation also shows that unless a source-referenced clock drives the MOSFET, spurious energy injection can occur, which would inflate the circuit's conversion efficiency if the harvester is driven by an external clock. A working vibration energy harvester comprising a time varying capacitor with a capacitance ratio of 3. 27 converted sufficient energy to sustain 6 V across a 20 MQ load. (cont.) This translates to an average power of 1. 8 pW. Based on a theoretical harvesting limit of 40. 67 luW, the prototype achieved a conversion efficiency of 4. 43 %. Additional experiments confirm that the harvester was not sustained by clock energy injection. Finally, the harvester could start up from a reservoir voltage of 89 mV, suggesting that the circuit can be initiated by an attached piezoelectric film. by Bernard Chih-Hsun Yen. Thesis (S. M.)
