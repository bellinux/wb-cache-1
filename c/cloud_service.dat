40|$|Abstract. A {{large number}} of cloud {{providers}} offer diverse types of <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> for constructing complex ”cloud-native ” software. How-ever, {{there is a lack}} of supporting tools and mechanisms for accelerating the development of cloud-native software-defined elastic systems (SESs) based on elasticity capabilities of <b>cloud</b> <b>services.</b> In this paper we in-troduce QUELLE – a framework for evaluating and recommending SES deployment configurations. QUELLE presents models for describing the elasticity capabilities of <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> and capturing elasticity require-ments of SESs. Based on that QUELLE introduces novel functions and algorithms for quantifying the elasticity capabilities of <b>cloud</b> <b>services.</b> QUELLE’s algorithms can recommend SES deployment configurations from <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> that both provide the required elasticity, and fulfill cost, quality, and resource requirements, and thus can be incorporated into different phases of the development of SESs. We present several ex-periments based on real-world <b>cloud</b> <b>services</b> for the development of an elastic machine-to-machine data-as-a-service system...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cloud Computing is {{increasingly}} booming in industry with many competing providers and services. Accordingly, evaluation of commercial <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> is necessary. However, the current evaluation studies are relatively chaotic. There exists tremendous confusion and gap between practices and theory about <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> evaluation. Aim: To facilitate relieving the aforementioned chaos, this work aims to synthesize the existing evaluation implementations to outline the state-of-the-practice and also identify research opportunities in <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> evaluation. Method: Based on a conceptual evaluation model comprising six steps, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method {{was employed to}} collect relevant evidence to investigate the <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> evaluation step by step. Results: This SLR identified 82 relevant evaluation studies. The overall data collected from these studies essentially represent the current practical landscape of implementing <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> evaluation, and in turn can be reused to facilitate future evaluation work. Conclusions: Evaluation of commercial <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> has increasingly become a world-wide research topic. Some {{of the findings of}} this SLR identified several research gaps in the area of <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> evaluation (e. g. the Elasticity and Security evaluation of commercial <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> could be a long-term challenge), while some other findings suggested the trend of applying commercial <b>Cloud</b> <b>services</b> (e. g. compared with PaaS, IaaS seems more suitable for customers and is particularly important in industry).

2500|$|In {{the case}} of elastic cloud {{services}} where a huge and abnormal additional workload may incur significant charges from the <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> provider, this technique {{can be used to}} stop or even scale back the elastic expansion of server availability in order to protect from economic loss. In the example analogy, imagine that the department store had the ability to bring in additional employees on a few minutes' notice and routinely did this during [...] "rushes" [...] of unusual customer volume. If a mob shows up that never does any buying, after a relatively short time of paying for the additional employee costs, the store can scale back the number of employees, understanding that the non-buying customers provide no profit for the store and thus should not be serviced. While this may prevent the store from making sales to legitimate customers during the period of attack, it saves the potentially ruinous cost of calling up huge numbers of employees to service an illegitimate load.|$|E

He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating [...] "Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the [...] "excitement of revolution", but argues that people want [...] "the comfort that comes with harmony". Furthermore, he writes that [...] "a device is only {{the starting point of}} an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that Walkman didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the iCloud <b>cloud</b> <b>service</b> with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an Apple Watch can unlock a Mac in close proximity).
