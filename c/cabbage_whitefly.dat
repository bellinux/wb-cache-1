During the first year, adverse weather conditions affected the study. However, first results indicate, that even under relatively low host densities the parasitation by E. tricolor was enhanced after their release inside the nets, in comparison to corresponding controls with nets only.

40|$|The <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> (Aleyrodes proletella) is a phloem-feeding insect that is {{a serious}} problem in Brassica oleracea crops like Brussels sprouts, kale and savoy cabbage. In order to develop whitefly-resistant {{varieties}} it is essential to identify effective sources of resistance. In this study, we screened a large collection of 432 accessions, including wild material and landraces of Brassica oleracea as well as crop wild relatives, to determine whitefly performance in a no-choice field experiment. Putatively resistant accessions were further tested under greenhouse conditions. Resistant accessions were identified among B. oleracea var. capitata (cabbage) landraces and in the species B. villosa, B. incana and B. montana. Whereas resistance in cabbage is only expressed in plants of at least 12 weeks old, some wild relatives were already starting to express resistance at 6 weeks. This could open up possibilities for breeding cabbages that are resistant at a young(er) plant age. Our research also shows again the importance of crop wild relatives for finding pest resistances...|$|E
50|$|Big-eyed bugs {{are true}} bugs {{in the order}} Hemiptera. The two most common species are Geocoris pallens and Geocoris punctipes. Both are predators and occur in many habitats, {{including}} fields, gardens, and turf grass. Big-eyed bugs are considered an important predator in many agricultural systems and feed on mites, insect eggs, and small insects such as pink bollworm, <b>cabbage</b> loopers, and <b>whiteflies.</b> Adult big-eyed bugs are small (about 3 mm) black, gray, or tan with proportionately large eyes. Eggs are deposited singly or in clusters on leaves near potential prey. They develop with incomplete metamorphosis (there is no pupa) and take approximately 30 days to develop from egg to adult depending on temperature. Both nymphs and adults are predatory, but can survive on nectar and honeydew when prey are scarce. Big-eyed bugs, like other true bugs, have piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by stabbing their prey and sucking or lapping the juices. Although their effectiveness as predators is not well understood, {{studies have shown that}} nymphs can eat as many as 1600 spider mites before reaching adulthood, while adults have been reported consuming as many as 80 mites per day.|$|R
50|$|Parasitoids {{are among}} the most widely used {{biological}} control agents. From {{the point of view of}} the farmer or horticulturalist, the most important groups are the Ichneumonid wasps, which prey mainly on caterpillars of butterflies and moths; Braconid wasps, which attack caterpillars and a wide range of other insects including greenfly; Chalcid wasps, which parasitise eggs and larvae of greenfly, <b>whitefly,</b> <b>cabbage</b> caterpillars, and scale insects; and Tachinid flies, which parasitize a wide range of insects including caterpillars, adult and larval beetles, and true bugs. Commercially, there are two types of rearing systems: short-term daily output with high production of parasitoids per day, and long-term low daily output with a range in production of 4-1000 million female parasitoids per week. Larger production facilities produce on a yearlong basis, whereas some facilities produce only seasonally. Rearing facilities are usually a significant distance from where the agents are to be used in the field, and transporting the parasitoids from the point of production to the point of use can pose problems. Shipping conditions can be too hot, and even vibrations from planes or trucks can adversely affect parasitoids.|$|R
40|$|The {{commercial}} production of Brussels sprouts generally involves a high input of insecticides. Conservation biological control in this crop is {{hampered by the}} diversity of economic pests involved, and by the high economic losses associated with failing pest control. Within the Dutch Functional Agro Biodiversity (FAB) project, other methods of non-chemical pest control have also received attention. One of these methods is the identification and containment of local sources of winter pest propagation. Another method to prevent pests from entering the crop may be the growing trap plants in the field margins. Some possible trap plant species have been identified, but more studies are required to show the feasibility of this method. Finally, monitoring insecticide-free sprout plots with flowering field margins showed that during summer, natural enemies can contribute considerably, although not always sufficient, to the control of cabbage aphids and caterpillars. For <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> some natural enemies have been identified, but in 2007 they arrived with too little and too late to have sufficient impact on the fast growing whitefly populations...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} some of {{the activities}} and achievements of the Plant Genetic Resources (PGR) Secure project, which aims to: (i) identify host plant resistance to the <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> (Aleyrodes proletella) and cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) via a germplasm screen where both are specialist phloem-feeding insects that feed only on members of the Brassicaceae family; (ii) elucidate the resistance mechanism; and (iii) provide tools to breeders that will facilitate resistance breeding. It is shown that the PGR Secure project has delivered valuable information {{on the extent of}} whitefly and aphid resistance in landrace accessions of Brassica oleracea var. capitata, as well as in wild relatives of B. oleracea. The whitefly resistance present in Brassica villosa, B. incana and B. montana is expressed both in 6 - and 12 -week-old plants, which indicates that this form of resistance is probably different from that already present in B. oleracea. These sources can be used in breeding resistant varieties. By combining novel phenomics, genomics and transcriptomics technologies, resistance breeding can be speeded up significantly. The developed and publicly available 90 k Affymetrix Axiom Brassica array can {{play an important role in}} this. The single nucleotide polymorphism markers linked to the resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) will facilitate an efficient introgression of the QTLs into high-yielding varieties...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cabbage</b> <b>whiteﬂy,</b> Aleyrodes proletella L., is {{emerging}} as a signiﬁcant pest of ﬁeld brassica crops in certain regions of the United Kingdom. In order to investigate the contribution of pesticide resistance to this phenomenon, A. proletella populations were sampled from ﬁve different areas in England in 2008 and 2009. Adult residual leaf-dip bioassays were carried out using pyrethroid and neonicotinoid insecticides. RESULTS: Signiﬁcant resistance to pyrethroids was found in multiple samples collected from two areas. No evidence of crossresistance to neonicotinoids {{was found in a}} subset of the pyrethroid-resistant populations. While the patterns of resistance to different pyrethroids were broadly correlated, the magnitude of resistance factors differed substantially. Survival of strains at a putative diagnostic concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin was found to provide a guide to their LC 50. Signiﬁcant differences in LC 50 were found when different brassica crops were used in the bioassay, although the resistance patterns between strains were maintained. CONCLUSION: Reduced susceptibility to multiple pyrethroid insecticides exists in populations of A. proletella in the United Kingdom, corresponding to recent major outbreaks. The mechanism(s) of resistance are yet to be determined, but molecular structural differences in pyrethroids probably inﬂuence the magnitude of cross-resistance within this group of insecticides...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> [Aleyrodes proletella L. (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) ] is {{becoming}} a serious pest in Brassica oleracea L. (Brassicaceae) crops. However, almost nothing {{is known about the}} interaction of this insect with its host plants. Previous studies have shown differences in the natural occurrence of adults, eggs, and nymphs on the closely related B. oleracea cultivars Christmas Drumhead and Riviera grown in the field. In this study, we aimed to identify the nature of these differences and to gain insight into the resistance mechanisms against A. proletella. We used no-choice experiments on field- and greenhouse-grown plants to show that {{the differences between the two}} cultivars are mainly based on antibiosis (traits that reduce herbivore performance) and not on antixenosis (traits that deter herbivory). This was further supported by laboratory choice experiments that indicated little or no discrimination between the two cultivars based on plant volatiles. We showed that resistance is dependent on plant age, that is, resistance increased during plant development, and is mainly independent of environmental factors. Analysis of probing behaviour revealed that the resistance trait affects A. proletella at the phloem level and that morphological differences between the two cultivars are most likely not involved. We suggest that compounds present in the phloem reduce sap ingestion by the whitefly and that this explains the observed resistanc...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> Aleyrodes proletella (L) has {{recently}} {{become a more}} serious pest within certain European brassicae crops. This study investigated the level of attractiveness of different cauliflower cultivars to this whitefly pest, aiming to identify varieties that could contain genes for controlling this whitefly in the future, useful for development of crop protection strategies. Greenhouse choice assays were carried out to obtain daily infestation rates of A. proletella on seven cauliflower cultivars (Matra, Freemont, Nautilus, Pierrot, Arbon, Mayfair and Picasso). Ten replicates of these 48 day-old cultivars were placed in a insect-free greenhouse in a randomised design at 20. 6 º ± 0. 1 ºC and 68. 1 ± 0. 1 % r. h. Three days after, plants were all infested by releasing A. proletella adults from a stock lab-colony. After seven days, the number of adults was counted daily in situ on all leaves of all plants until {{the emergence of new}} adults. In our study, “Picasso” and “Nautilus” were the most and less attractive cauliflower cultivars, respectively, in terms of the percentage of infested plants. Further studies are needed aiming to identify useful genes for controlling this whitefly in brassicae plants in the future. A better understanding of the dynamics of insect–plant interactions may be useful and for coping with the threatening loss of biodiversity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{a variety of}} ways to defend {{themselves}} against biotic attackers. This has resulted in the presence of substantial variation in defense mechanisms among plants, even within a species. Genome-wide association (GWA) mapping is a useful tool to study the genetic architecture of traits, but has so far only had limited exploitation in studies of plant defense. Here, we study the genetic architecture of defense against the phloem-feeding insect <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> (Aleyrodes proletella) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We determined whitefly performance, i. e. the survival and reproduction of whitefly females, on 360 worldwide selected natural accessions and subsequently performed GWA mapping using 214, 051 SNPs. Substantial variation for whitefly adult survival and oviposition rate (number of eggs laid per female per day) was observed between the accessions. We identified 39 candidate SNPs for either whitefly adult survival or oviposition rate, all with relatively small effects, underpinning the complex architecture of defense traits. Among the corresponding candidate genes, i. e. genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with candidate SNPs, none have previously been identified as a gene playing a role in the interaction between plants and phloem-feeding insects. Whitefly performance on knock-out mutants of a number of candidate genes was significantly affected, validating the potential of GWA mapping for novel gene discovery in plant-insect interactions. Our results show that GWA analysis is a very useful tool to gain insight into the genetic architecture of plant defense against herbivorous insects, i. e. we identified and validated several genes affecting whitefly performance that have not previously been related to plant defense against herbivorous insect...|$|E
40|$|Hyperaccumulator {{plant species}} grow in metalliferous soils and {{accumulate}} exceedingly {{high concentrations of}} metals. They are increasingly studied because of their potential for cleaning up land contaminated with heavy metals, but another aspect of study relates to the reason for hyperaccumulation. The most accepted hypothesis {{over the last few}} decades is the ‘elemental defence’ hypothesis, which states that high levels of metals defend the plant against herbivores. Whilst some of the literature is contradictory, some is supportive. An added complication is that many hyperaccumulators belong to the Brassicaceae and produce glucosinolates as organic defences against herbivory. The question to be answered is whether metals or glucosinolates act as the primary defence in these plants and the most recent suggestion is the ‘joint effects’ hypothesis, which states that both classes of chemical work together to benefit the plant and protect it from herbivores. This study investigates these hypotheses and utilized three experimental systems. The hyperaccumulator studied was Thlaspi caerulescens (Gange ecotype) which hyperaccumulates zinc. Plants were grown in a series of glasshouse experiments at a range of soil zinc amendments. There was a positive relationship between soil and foliar zinc; optimum growth occurred at 2000 mg Zn kg- 1 soil and this equated to approximately 8000 mg Zn kg- 1 shoot, although plants took up as much as 14000 mg Zn kg- 1 shoot tissue at higher levels of soil amendment. The herbivore systems studied were generalist thrips (Franklinella occidentalis) and the specialist <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> (Aleyrodes proletella). In addition, artificial damage caused by clipping served as a positive control. Four aromatic glucosinolates were extracted from T. caerulescens and two were identified as benzyl and p-OH-benzyl. Glucosinolates were synthesized 32 hours after damage occurred and reached a maximum concentration after 48 hours. Generally, lower concentrations of glucosinolates were observed in plants with higher foliar Zn concentrations and vice versa. However, when plants were subjected to a sustained and heavy herbivore attack, as was the case when thrips infested the plants, glucosinolate production occurred irrespective of foliar Zn concentration. This observation supports the ‘joint effects’ hypothesis, which states that both defences work in tandem and enhance overall defence. Nitrogen was an important component that directed herbivore response. Thrip feeding damage was negatively correlated with foliar nitrogen whilst <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> (CWF) benefitted from higher N. Nitrogen was positively correlated with glucosinolate concentrations and glucosinolate content negatively affected the generalist thrips but not the specialist CWF. Data were analysed by accumulated general linear regression and the explanatory model for thrip feeding was C/N ratio + GS + Zn whilst the explanatory model for CWFs was C/N ratio + Zn. Use of the specialist feeder (CWF) allowed for study of the effects of zinc without glucosinolates confounding the results since the CWF was unaffected by foliar glucosinolates. Zinc acted as a defence against CWF but only at high concentrations. The data taken together show that zinc acts as a defence against herbivores that are unaffected by glucosinolates, but only at high concentrations. Zinc also defends the plant against generalist thrips, but glucosinolates are more influential in this case. This might be because of the severe and sustained damage that these plants suffered and systemic effects (i. e. higher concentrations of glucosinolates in undamaged leaves relative to attacked leaves) suggests flexibility in the Zn-glucosinolate relationship. The overall conclusion is in support of the joint effects hypothesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly,</b> Aleyrodes proletella, has {{in recent}} years become a primary pest of several {{brassica}} crops in Europe. In the UK, its greatest impact has been on kale, where nymphs, wax deposits and sooty mould caused by honeydew excretion reduce the marketable portion of the crop, particularly later in the year. In order to test the contribution of insecticide resistance to these outbreaks, a leaf-dip bioassay method was developed. Resistance to several pyrethroids was found in multiple populations in Lincolnshire and Kent, with similar patterns between compounds but differing magnitudes of resistance. This resistance was expressed to a similar degree by both adults and nymphs. The host plant used in bioassays influenced lethal concentrations but not resistance factors. A diagnostic concentration of lambda-cyhalothrin was identified and used to screen further populations over successive years. No cross-resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides was evident in highly pyrethroid-resistant populations. Bioassays with the synergist piperonyl butoxide provided no evidence of mixed-function oxidase or associated nonspecific esterase involvement in pyrethroid resistance. Attempts to sequence the sodium channel gene of susceptible and resistant whiteflies to check for target-site resistance were unsuccessful. Field surveys of whitefly populations on wild cabbage were carried out to identify candidate native biological control agents for use in IPM strategies in field crops. These identified several parasitoid wasps and a coccinellid beetle, Clitostethus arcuatus. One of the parasitoids, Encarsia tricolor, and C. arcuatus were successfully cultured at NRI and tested in outdoor cage trials. In 2011, a multiple generation trial demonstrated the superiority of parasitoid release during {{the development of the}} first generation of whiteflies over later releases of E. tricolor or C. arcuatus. A Horticultural Development Company funded field trial in 2012 showed that insecticide application early in a whitefly infestation could provide prolonged control equivalent to regular spraying. This research will {{contribute to the development of}} future integrated pest IV management programmes for A. proletella through avoiding ineffective pyrethroid applications, facilitating insecticide resistance management and identifying non-chemical approaches...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{protection}} in arable and horticultural production {{was one of}} the central topics for research in the Federal Programme for Organic Agriculture. Since 2002, 53 projects have been carried out on this subject. After several status quo analyses (2002 - 2004), methods for control and prevention of pests and diseases were further developed and adapted to organic farming conditions. Focus areas included copper replacement, resistant varieties and improved cultivation methods. Plant health issues were also addressed in various speciality crops where pests and diseases often lead to the need to import produce from other European countries (e. g. Brussels sprouts), as domestic production cannot cover the ever-increasing demand; in this area, several projects were set up to improve growing conditions and establish new methods for plant protection. One important focus was the control of downy mildew, particularly in organic onion cultivation. In this case insights from conventional farming were adapted to organic farming conditions, e. g. in the control of downy mildew in summer onion cultivation. The growing risk of the occurrence of downy mildew in organic onion cultivation could be further reduced through the use of new, mildew-resistant varieties. New alternatives to the use of copper, such as plant extracts of sage and liquorice or microbial preparations with Aneurinibacillus migulanus demonstrated a significant reduction of infestation in onion and cucumber. In organic potatoes, primary stem infection by late blight (Phytophthora infestans) was significantly reduced by seed dressing using small amounts of copper (120 g/ha, compared to higher amounts that would be needed for a foliar treatments in the field); this led to yields increases by up to 55 %. Alternative pesticides were tested against the pea moth (Cydia nigricana); here, a pyrethroid formulation showed variable effects and Spruzit-Neu® was unable to reduce pest infestation at high insect densities. The use of beneficial insects and other cultural methods was extensively studied. Covering Brussels sprouts with fine-meshed nets from the time of transplanting until the end of October achieved a 77 % reduction in the infestation with <b>cabbage</b> <b>whitefly</b> (Aleyrodes proletella) during the main infestation period in September. In field trials with point releases of the parasitic wasp Encarsia tricolor, parasitism was up to 50 % higher than in the reference without release; bringing the first release forward in time resulted in a significant pest reduction by about 60 %. Studies on the control of carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae) showed that a major risk factor for infestation is the distance to fields where carrot had been grown in the previous year, and thus field selection offers a major control option. In addition, the research showed that infestation can be limited by growing either early or late sets of carrots. Another project dealt with the natural control of the grain weevil (Sitophilus granarius) by a continuous release of the ectoparasitoid Lariophagus distinguendus in grain stores. This method is intended to be an affordable, easy-to-use and effective alternative to existing release methods.
