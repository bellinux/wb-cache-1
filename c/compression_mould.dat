40|$|Problem statement. Improvement of {{thermoelectric}} {{figure of}} merit is connected with the usage of nanostructured thermoelectric materials fabricated from powders by the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method. Preservation of powder nanostructure during sintering is possible at optimum temperature modes of thermoelectrics fabrication. The choice of these modes becomes complicated because of anisotropic properties of semiconductor thermoelectric materials. The decision of the given problem by sintering process simulation demands the competent approach to the problem formulation, a correct specification of thermoelectric properties, the properties of materials forming working installation, and also corrects boundary conditions. The paper deals with the efficient model for sintering of thermoelectrics. Methods. Sintering process of the bismuth telluride thermoelectric material by means of SPS- 511 S installation is considered. Temperature dependences of electric and thermal conductivities of bismuth telluride, and also temperature dependences of installation elements materials are taken into account. It is shown that temperature distribution in the sample can be defined {{within the limits of}} a stationary problem. The simulation is carried out in the software product Comsol Multiphysics. Boundary conditions include convective heat exchange and also radiation under Stefan-Boltzmann law. Results. Computer simulation of electric and thermal processes at spark plasma sintering is carried out. Temperature and electric potential distributions in a sample are obtained at the sintering conditions. Determinative role of graphite <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> in formation of the temperature field in samples is shown. The influence of geometrical sizes of a graphite <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> on sintering conditions of nanostructured thermoelectrics is analyzed. Practical importance. The optimum sizes of a cylindrical <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> for fabrication of volume homogeneous samples based on bismuth telluride are determined.

40|$|A {{new process}} of {{combining}} gas injection with compression moulding {{was developed and}} studied in this research work. The process is called Gas Assisted Compression Moulding (or GasComp). The principle {{is based on the}} injection of nitrogen gas during a conventional compression moulding cycle. The flow of the material due to the compressive force of the press is assisted by the injection of gas into the centre of the molten material. The gas assists in the flow by coring out the material, reducing the weight by up to 45 percent and increasing the dimensional stability of the component. Novel glass matt thermoplastic mould tools were designed and developed {{during the course of the}} research program for use with the process. These designs were of a flash <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> tool design with a horizontal clamping face, rather than the conventional positive plug <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> tool with a vertical shear edge. This created a fixed volume mould tool, which when used in conjunction with a short shot of material, would allow the gas to flow the material to fill the remaining volume. Several materials were investigated for their suitability with the process. Their characterisation showed that they contained different glass fibre contents and architectures. A material with a short, dispersed glass fibre content of 11 percent proved to consistently contain a significant gas cavity. The glass architecture proved to be the most significant contributing factor in the creation of a successful gas cavity. The most significant processing parameter in the creation of a large volume cavity proved to be the gas injection delay time. The gas pressure and gas ramp time affected the cavity shape, length and extent of gas fingering. The shrinkage was reduced in the presence of a gas cavity, along with the visible reduction of sink marks. The presence of other moulding features, such as hesitation marks, gas packing and the change in fibre orientation were also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The polymer {{composites}} {{consist of}} phenolic resin, natural graphite, carbon fiber and copper powder, are fabricated by hot <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> or <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites are analyzed {{to determine the}} influences of post-curing temperature and preparing method on the physical, electrical and mechanical properties of composites. It is found that the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites increase with increasing post-curing temperature for composites prepared by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> followed by post-curing. The flexural strength is more strongly dependent on post-curing temperature. At 170 ℃, the density, electrical conductivity and flexural strength of composites were 1. 85 g/cm 3, 2. 94 × 103 S/m and 40 MPa respectively. The cross-linking skeleton structure well established in the composites could be {{the main reason for}} the largely increasing of flexural strength as post-curing temperature increases.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the lightweight}} potential of long fibre-reinforced and local continuous fibre-reinforced foam injection moulded components. Using the LFT-D foam process and breathing mould technology, long glass fibre-reinforced polypropylene foams were manufactured with a constant weight {{per unit area}} and varying density reductions. As the area moment of inertia increases with the wall thickness to the third power, in these investigations small density reductions were sufficient to increase the flexural rigidity by several hundred percent compared to a compact reference sample. The fibre length advantage generated by the direct process (injection moulding compounding) also meant that even at higher density reductions the ductility was not reduced by the foaming. In order to achieve even better mechanical properties, foam injection moulding can be combined with local continuous fibre reinforcement. To demonstrate the existing potential, sandwich integral foam components with local continuous fibre-reinforced facing were in-situ produced in an injection mould and characterised. Fully consolidated tape blanks and self-reinforced PP fabrics were positioned {{on both sides of the}} cavity and heated. Afterwards a gas-loaded melt was injected between them. A short embossing stroke generated sufficient interfacial adhesion between the facing layers and the core material, and the foaming process was initiated by the pressure drop resulting from the precision opening of the injection <b>compression</b> <b>mould...</b>|$|E
40|$|The tribo-potential of {{sugarcane}} fibre reinforcement in the thermoset polymers {{for enhancing}} the adhesive wear resistance {{has not been}} explored so far. Hence, the present work aims to explore {{the possibility of using}} this natural fibre to reinforce polyester and thus opens a new way to implement locally available inexpensive fibres and produce a new candidate tribo-material for bearing applications. Sugarcane fibre/polyester (SCRP) and glass fibre/polyester (GRP) composites (with chopped fibres of 1, 5, 10 mm length randomly distributed and unidirectional mat fibres) were prepared using <b>compression</b> <b>mould</b> and hand-lay-up techniques. Friction coefficients and wear rates of SCRP and GRP composites were determined under dry sliding contact conditions in parallel and anti-parallel orientations and subjected to different operating parameters such as load, speed and test duration. Results of friction and wear proved that SCRP composite is a promising composite which can be a competitive to GRP composite. In the case of chopped sugarcane/polyester (C-SCRP) composite, very smooth patches of polymer film (protective layer) due to plastic deformation shielded the surface of C-SCRP composite pin from damage by the metallic asperities and thereby contributed to the higher wear resistance. Furthermore, this layer provided enhancement to the bonding of SCFs fibre with matrix. In contrast C-GRP composite produced broken hard particles of GF at the interface which acted as a third body and restrained the formation of such protective layer. Wear resistance of C-SCRP composite increased significantly with increasing load but decreased drastically for C-GRP composite. In addition, wear rate of C-SCRP composite decreased by (20 - 50...|$|E

In this study, the influence of sample processing on the morphology and DC conduc- tivity of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) has been studied. Direct <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> of LDPE pellets is commonly used in research laboratories for obtaining plaque samples, whereas extrusion is an additional commonly used technique for dispersion of particles in nanocomposites prior to the <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> process. In this study LDPE plaques have been obtained by either <b>compression</b> <b>moulding</b> directly from pellets, or by extrusion followed by <b>compression</b> <b>moulding.</b> The morphology obtained in the first case consisted of band- ed spherulites, whereas the latter method yielded a mor- phology of small axialites.
