The role of BB in <b>dyeing</b> of human <b>hair</b> was studied by examining <b>hair</b> <b>dyed</b> with p-phenylenediamine and hydrogen peroxide. Solvent extraction of <b>dyed</b> <b>hair</b> or decomposition by dilute alkali yielded mixtures which contained little or no BB when they were examined by thin-layer chromatography. Based on these experiments, it is concluded that BB is not the main <b>colorant</b> of <b>hair</b> <b>dyed</b> with p-phenylenediamine...|$|R

40|$|Lawsone (2 -hydroxy- 1, 4 -napthoquinone), {{also known}} as hennotannic acid, is an orange red dye used as a popular skin and <b>hair</b> <b>colorant.</b> The <b>dye</b> is {{produced}} in the leaves of Lawsonia inermis L, {{often referred to as}} the ‘‘henna’’ tree. In this study, we report the production of lawsone by an endophytic fungus, Gibberella moniliformis isolated from the leaf tissues of Lawsonia inermis. The fungus produced the orange-red dye in potato dextrose agar and broth, independent of the host tissue. Presence of lawsone was confirmed spectrometrically using HPLC and ESI–MS/MS analysis. The fragmentation pattern of lawsone was identical to both standard lawsone and that extracted from plant tissue. This is a first report of lawsone being produced by an endophytic fungus, independent of the host tissue.

40|$|The use of {{cyanoacrylate}} (CA) as a fuming {{technique for}} the development of latent friction ridge skin impressions has been widespread for decades within the forensic lab {{as well as in the}} field at crime scenes. Important features of processing latent print impressions using this method include that it makes visible latent print impressions that for the most part cannot be seen with the unaided eye and it preserves latent print impressions for future processing/examination. The superglue fumes "fix" the latent print impression to the substrate making it difficult to wipe away, thereby decreasing the chances of destruction during packaging at the scene, transportation, and processing in the lab. One of the disadvantages to this technique is the lack of contrast between the white polymers that are formed on the latent print impression residue and light colored backgrounds on which the latent print impression may be present. Attempts were made to develop a one-step cyanoacrylate fuming method that would enhance visualization of latent print impressions on light colored backgrounds without the need for an alternative light source, dye staining, or powdering. Latent print impressions were applied to black and white ceramic tiles, white painted wood and white/translucent textured plastic. Protein and hemoglobin stains, commercial <b>colorants,</b> sublimation <b>dyes,</b> <b>hair</b> <b>dye,</b> and printer ink were added to ethyl-CA in an attempt to create a co-polymerization process of the vaporized cyanoacrylate monomers and colorant molecules on latent print residue. Fuming was also attempted using pre-colored commercial glues with the assumption that the attached CA polymers on the latent print impression residue would retain their original color properties. None of these methods proved successful. The practical use of a new fluorescent CA, Lumicyano^TM, was also examined. Following fuming, an ALS is utilized for the excitation of the developed latent print impressions using this technique. Strong fluorescence could not be observed on all substrates. In this particular study, fuming with traditional CA followed by the application of powder or dye stains to latent print impressions currently appears to be the most efficient technique for latent print enhancement on the white or light colored substrates used in this study...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Role of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in the {{etiology}} of breast cancer has occasionally raised concern but previous research has concluded with mixed results. Remnants of prohibited aromatic amines {{have been found in}} many <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products, and elevated levels of DNA-adducts of these amines have been detected from breast epithelial cells of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> users. However, the IARC working group has concluded that there is inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity of personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use and limited evidence in experimental animals for carcinogenicity of <b>hair</b> <b>colorants.</b> Material and Methods We investigated whether the use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> is associated with breast cancer risk in women. The study design was a retrospective population-based case-control study in Finland, with a self-administered questionnaire from 6, 567 breast cancer patients, aged 22 – 60 years and diagnosed in 2000 – 2007, and their 21, 598 matched controls. We report odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) from a conditional logistic regression model applied to the frequency matched sets of cases and controls. Bias-adjusted odds ratios from the sensitivity analysis are also presented. Results After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of breast cancer increased by 23 % (OR: 1. 23, 95 % CI: 1. 11 – 1. 36) among women who used <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> compared to those who did not. In women born before 1950 an increase of 28 % was noted (OR: 1. 28, 95 % CI: 1. 10 – 1. 48). We also observed a significant trend between the OR and cumulative use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (P: 0. 005). Bias-adjusted odds ratios varied between 1. 04 and 2. 50. Conclusions Our results suggest that use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> is associated with breast cancer incidence. The impact on public health may be substantial due to vast popularity of hair coloring in modern societies. It should be noted that regardless of all efforts, a possibility of bias cannot definitively be ruled out and use of a prospective design is warranted.

Methods: A 1 : 1 matched population-based case-control study of women conducted in Los Angeles County recruited 986 case-control pairs. Case participants were diagnosed with histologic confirmed primary B-cell NHL between 2004 and 2008. Control participants were individually matched to the index cases by age, gender, race, and neighborhood of residence. Exposure information was obtained by in-person interviews. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of B-cell NHL associated with personal <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use overall, by race, and by NHL subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders (alcohol status, smoking status, and education levels).; Results: Compared to women who had never used any <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products, those who had ever used personal <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> had a 38 % greater risk for B-cell NHL (OR= 1. 38, 95 %CI= 1. 05 - 1. 31).

Risk of multiple myeloma was significantly elevated (OR = 1. 9) among <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> users and was greatest among those using <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{at least once a month}} for a year or more (OR = 4. 3). These data, along with results from other studies, suggest that use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> contributes to the development of multiple myeloma...|$|R
40|$|Background p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) is {{the primary}} patch test {{screening}} agent for <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> contact allergy, and approximately 100 different <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> chemicals are allowed. Objectives To examine whether PPD is an optimal screening agent for diagnosing <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> allergy or whether other clinically important sensitizers exist. Methods Two thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine consecutive patients in 12 dermatology clinics were patch tested with five <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> available from patch test suppliers. Furthermore, 22 frequently used <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> ingredients not available from patch test suppliers were tested in subgroups of approximate to 500 patients each. Results A positive reaction to PPD was found in 4. 5 % of patients, and 2. 8 % reacted to toluene- 2, 5 -diamine (PTD), 1. 8 % to p-aminophenol, 1 % to m-aminophenol, and 0. 1 % to resorcinol; all together, 5. 3 % (n= 156). Dying hair was the most frequently reported cause of the allergy (55. 4 %); so-called temporary henna' tattoos were the cause in 8. 5 % of the cases. p-Methylaminophenol gave a reaction in 20 patients (2. 2 %), 3 of them with clinical relevance, and no co-reaction with the above five well-known <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Conclusions <b>Hair</b> <b>dyes</b> are the prime cause of PPD allergy. PPD identifies the majority of positive reactions to PTD, p-aminophenol and m-aminophenol, but not all, which justifies additional testing with <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> ingredients from the used product...|$|R
40|$|Background The use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> {{has been}} inconsistently {{associated}} with an increased risk of lymphomas. We explore <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use and lymphoma risk in a case–control study in Spain. Methods We studied 574 incident lymphoma cases and 616 hospital controls in a multicentric study in Spain. Information on <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> use was obtained through a personal interview together with information on other known or putative risk factors for lymphoma. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). All ORs were adjusted for pathology center, sex, age, and house ownership. Results Ever use of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> was associated with a non-significant 20 % increased risk of lymphoma (OR = 1. 2, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 7) with a slightly higher risk observed for those using permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 9). No association was observed with duration of use or lifetime doses of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Among all lymphomas categories, only chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was significantly {{associated with the use of}} <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> (OR = 2. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 – 4. 7). The risk of CLL increased with lifetime doses received. Conclusions Ever use of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products is unlikely to substantially modify the risk of lymphoma. The observed association with CLL needs to be replicated...|$|R
40|$|Background Toluene- 2, 5 -diamine (PTD) is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used <b>dye</b> in oxidative <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> on the Scandinavian market. However, little is known about immune responses to PTD-containing oxidative <b>hair</b> <b>dyes.</b> Objectives To study immune responses induced by PTD-containing <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in mice. Methods Immune responses against two different permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> products containing 1 · 60 % (w/w) and 0 · 48 % (w/w) PTD within the colour gel, and various concentrations of pure PTD were studied. The local inflammatory response was measured by ear swelling and cell infiltration, and T- and B-cell infiltration and proliferation was determined in the draining lymph nodes. Results Concentration-dependent immune responses were seen to PTD both in the skin and draining lymph nodes. The <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 1 · 60 % PTD induced strong local inflammation and caused T- and B-cell infiltration and proliferation as well as an increased number of regulatory T cells in the draining lymph nodes. In contrast, the <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> containing 0 · 48 % PTD induced skin inflammation but only minor responses in the draining lymph nodes. Conclusions Consumer-available PTD-containing permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> can be potent immune activators inducing both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. The outcome of the response is dependent on allergen dose, amount of additional allergens and exposure regime...|$|R

40|$|Hand eczema is a {{well-known}} problem in occupations that involve largely manual work, in combination with long periods of wet exposure and skin contact with chemicals. Hairdressing involves dermal exposure {{to a number of}} skin damaging substances. Hair cosmetic products such as <b>hair</b> <b>dyes,</b> permanent wave solutions and bleaches can cause contact allergy and extensive wet work can cause irritant contact dermatitis (ICD). In this thesis the occurrence of hand eczema was studied in a nation-wide retrospective longitudinal cohort study comprising 7, 203 female hairdressers attending the vocational hairdressing programme during a period of 25 years. A total of 7, 355 women from the general population constituted the control group. A hand rinse method for assessment of dermal exposure to permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> on hairdressers' hands was developed and validated. The validated hand rinse method was used during <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing</b> in hairdressing salons for assessment of the exposure to p-phenylenediamine (PPD), toluene- 2, 5 -diaminesulfate (TDS), m-aminophenol, resorcinol (RES) and 2 -methylresorcinol (MRE). Hand rinse samples were taken before the start of <b>hair</b> <b>dyeing,</b> after application of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> to the <b>hair</b> and after cutting newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> The hand rinse samples were analysed with highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) together with extracts from newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> In another study the permeation of PPD, TDS and RES through protective gloves frequently used in hairdressing was investigated. The gloves were made of natural rubber latex, polyvinyl chloride, nitrile rubber and polyethene. The incidence of hand eczema was 23. 8 cases/ 1, 000 person-years for the hairdressers and 9. 6 cases/person years for the controls, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2. 5 (95 % Cl 2. 2 - 2. 8), with an IRR of 3. 1 (95 % Cl 2. 6 - 3. 5) for hairdressers younger than 25 years. The attributable fraction of hand eczema cases from skin atopy was 9. 6 % in hairdressers. A high frequency of hair treatments that involves risk for exposure to skin damaging substances was reported by the hairdressers. The assessment of dermal exposure to permanent <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> in the salons showed that after application of <b>hair</b> <b>dye,</b> positive hand rinse samples were found in 26 out of 33 hairdressers. No statistically significant difference in the amount of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds found on the hairdressers' hands was observed between users and non-users of protective gloves. <b>Hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds were found in samples from 23 out of 29 hairdressers after cutting newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> Eleven out of twelve extracts of newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair</b> contained <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds. The exposure loadings of <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds found in the hand rinse samples are at a level at which there is a risk of sensitization. None of the tested protective gloves was permeated by the <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds before 30 minutes. In conclusion: the incidence of hand eczema among hairdressers was remarkably high. The hand eczema starts early in life for many individuals. About 10 % of the hand eczema cases would be prevented if no skin atopics entered the trade. The hairdressers are exposed to <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds during application of <b>hair</b> <b>dyes</b> and after cutting of newly <b>dyed</b> <b>hair.</b> The exposure levels found on hairdressers hand are in the level where there is a risk for sensitisation. All the tested protective gloves gave good protection against the <b>hair</b> <b>dye</b> compounds...|$|R
