Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as <b>ciment</b> <b>fondu.</b> However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.|$|E

50|$|Born in Singapore, Ng first showed {{sculpting}} {{talent as}} a child, playing with plasticine and creating figures for fun during classes in primary school. After graduating from Senior Cambridge examinations in 1955, he took {{painting and sculpture}} classes at the British Council, and with artist Liu Kang in 1958. Ng entered the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts in that year and showed promise as an aspiring artist, experimenting with art in various media while other students were merely following through the curriculum. In 1959 the young Ng met British sculptor Jean Bullock in Singapore, who exposed him to sculpture art and introduced him to <b>ciment</b> <b>fondu,</b> a relatively new sculpting medium.|$|E
50|$|The goal of {{the form}} is to provide an aesthetically {{pleasing}} miniature landscape for display and contemplation. The landscape is depicted in full three dimensions, and contained in a wide, low-sided tray. Raised areas representing river banks, hills, cliffs, or mountains are built up from sculptable materials like <b>ciment</b> <b>fondu,</b> clay, papier mache, or a dried and powdered peat called keto in Japan. These sculpted elements are frequently painted to resemble the natural environment as closely as possible, for example, through painting ice, rock, and vegetation colors onto sculpted mountains. Flat areas representing plains or open water are covered with colored sand or gravel. Real rocks may be embedded in the landscape.|$|E
50|$|He {{was awarded}} his ARCA degree in 1949 {{and became a}} {{sculptor}} in London until late 1956. During this time he carried out various commissions, exhibited and taught part-time at the Borough Polytechnic (now London South Bank University) and South East Essex Technical College Art Schools. He spent {{a considerable amount of}} time drawing at the London Zoo, as the basis for animal sculptures. During this time he exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy, R.B.A., London Group, S.E.A. and other shows. In 1956 he was appointed Head of Sculpture at Nottingham College of Art (now part of Nottingham Trent University). During these freelance years he worked in wood, stone, terracotta and clay for bronze and <b>ciment</b> <b>fondu.</b> He also made small scale models for renowned model soldier company Britains Ltd including the well respected “Trojans Warriors” designed in 1957.|$|E
40|$|This book {{locates the}} artist R. J. Lloyd as {{primarily}} a painter in the St Ives and Modernist traditions, but also addresses in depth, {{for the first}} time, the wider range of Lloyd's creative output represented by {{his work as a}} printmaker and illustrator (in collaboration with poet Ted Hughes) and his commissions in glass and <b>ciment</b> <b>fondu</b> for schools and churches across England. The book also comments on Lloyd's life-long career as a collector, principally of North Devon ceramics, and comments on his own ceramic work in that long tradition. The book is a richly illustrated monograph containing the widest and most recent pictorial summary of Lloyd’s work to date. It is based on extensive original research in Lloyd’s Bideford studio, where I had unfettered access to his unpublished materials and archive, including material relating to his major commissions in England. The research offers a comprehensive review of a significant artist's output in a very wide range of media from paintings to stained glass, murals, jewellery, ceramics and printmaking; it also connects this work with the artist’s vigorous career as a collector of studio and historic ceramics. In this project I have built on my earlier research for my edited book The RJ Lloyd Ceramics Collection: artist as collector, which was published to mark the permanent presentation of this collection, {{one of the largest and}} most comprehensive of its type in any museum, to the Burton Art Gallery and Museum in 2011. My work as a consultant to the Burton Art Gallery and Museum was the driver for these two publications. I wrote the successful bids for their applications to the Heritage Lottery Fund and The Art Fund (£ 450, 000) to acquire the slipware collection and set up a new permanent exhibition for The RJ Lloyd Collection...|$|E
40|$|Savannah River Site {{has five}} dormant nuclear {{production}} reactors. Long term disposition will require filling some reactor buildings with grout up to ground level. Portland cement based grout {{will be used}} to fill the buildings with the exception of some reactor tanks. Some reactor tanks contain significant quantities of aluminum which could react with Portland cement based grout to form hydrogen. Hydrogen production is a safety concern and gas generation could also compromise the structural integrity of the grout pour. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a non-Portland cement grout to fill reactors that contain significant quantities of aluminum. Grouts generate heat when they set, so the potential exists for large temperature increases in a large pour, which could compromise the integrity of the pour. The primary purpose of the testing reported here was to measure heat of hydration, specific heat, thermal conductivity and density of various reactor grouts under consideration so that these properties could be used to model transient heat transfer for different pouring strategies. A secondary purpose was to make qualitative judgments of grout pourability and hardened strength. Some reactor grout formulations were unacceptable because they generated too much heat, or started setting too fast, or required too long to harden or were too weak. The formulation called 102 H had the best combination of characteristics. It is a Calcium Alumino-Sulfate grout that contains <b>Ciment</b> <b>Fondu</b> (calcium aluminate cement), Plaster of Paris (calcium sulfate hemihydrate), sand, Class F fly ash, boric acid and small quantities of additives. This composition afforded about ten hours of working time. Heat release began at 12 hours and was complete by 24 hours. The adiabatic temperature rise was 54 C which was within specification. The final product was hard and displayed no visible segregation. The density and maximum particle size were within specification...|$|E
