50|$|Once {{they arrive}} in the wine sheds, the grapes are pressed. The process is carried out slowly {{in order to allow}} enough time for the must to be {{extracted}} from the virtually dried-out fruits. Even so, yields of juice are low.

40|$|Bright AGN {{frequently}} show ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) with outflow velocities vout ~ 0. 1 c. These outflows may be {{the source}} of AGN feedback on their host galaxies sought by galaxy formation modellers. The exact effect of the outflows on the ambient galaxy gas strongly depends on whether the shocked UFOs cool rapidly or not. This in turn depends on whether the shocked electrons share the same temperature as ions (one temperature regime; 1 T) or decouple (2 T), as has been recently suggested. Here we calculate the Inverse Compton spectrum emitted by such shocks, finding a broad feature potentially detectable either in mid-to-high energy X-rays (1 T case) or only in the soft X-rays (2 T). We argue that current observations of AGN do not seem to show evidence for the 1 T component. The limits on the 2 T emission are far weaker, and in fact {{it is possible that the}} observed soft X-ray excess of AGN is partially or fully due to the 2 T shock emission. This suggests that UFOs are in the energy-driven regime outside the central few pc, <b>and</b> <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> considerable amounts of not only momentum but also energy into the ambient gas. We encourage X-ray observers to look for the Inverse Compton components calculated here in order to constrain AGN feedback models further.

50|$|Two broods {{generally}} hatch {{each year}} throughout the United States, one {{in early spring}} and one in late summer. The moths eclose <b>and</b> then <b>must</b> <b>pump</b> their wings with fluid (hemolymph) to extend them. The females emit pheromones, which the male can detect through his large, plumose antennae. Males can fly for miles to reach a female. After the moths mate, the female spends {{the majority of the}} remainder of her life laying eggs, while the male may mate several more times. Adults of this family of moths have vestigial mouths, meaning their mouth parts have been reduced. Because of this, they do not eat and only live as adults for less than one week.In captivity, this moth is much more difficult to breed than other American saturnids such as the cecropia, promethea, or luna. Kept in a cage, the male and female tend to ignore each other, unless a food plant (particularly oak leaves) is present.|$|R
40|$|Recovery of {{hyaluronic acid}} by {{precipitation}} from a polyelectrolyte complex comprises reacting a hyaluronic acid-containing fermentation solution or brew {{with at least}} one equivalent of a chitosan salt solution. The resulting hyaluronic acid-chitosan complex is separated out and treated with aqueous alkali, the insoluble chitosan is separated off and the hyaluronic acid alkali salt is precipitated out from the alkaline or neutral solution before being washed and dried. USE - Hyaluronic acid is used in the pharmaceutical, medical and cosmetic industries. ADVANTAGE - The process avoids complexing hyaluronic acid with cationic detergents (e. g. cetyltrimethylammonium or cetylpyridinium salts) which are extremely difficult to remove, resulting in poor product quality. The detergents cannot be recycled <b>and</b> <b>must</b> be <b>pumped</b> out as waste, resulting in environmental damage.

The identification and quantification was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in free and bound form.

50|$|Dilution {{of sewage}} {{directly}} increases costs of pumping and chlorination, ozonation, or ultraviolet disinfection. Physical treatment structures including screens <b>and</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>must</b> be enlarged {{to handle the}} peak flow. Primary clarifiers must also be enlarged to treat average flows, although primary treatment of peak flows may be accomplished in detention basins. Biological secondary treatment is effective only while the concentration of soluble and colloidal pollutants (typically measured as biochemical oxygen demand or BOD) remains high enough to sustain a population of microorganisms digesting those pollutants. Secondary treatment is expected to remove 85 percent of soluble and colloidal organic pollutants from sewage containing 200 mg/L BOD; but BOD removal by conventional biological secondary treatment becomes less effective with dilution and practically ceases as BOD concentrations entering the treatment facility are diluted below about 20 mg/L. Unremoved organics are potentially converted to disinfection by-products by chemical disinfection prior to discharge.|$|R

The most promising improvements to the system are weight reducing and friction reducing measures, and in combination with understanding the wind conditions in the immediate vicinity of the rotor, changes will be made this summer so that unassisted wind pumping will be possible. by Aron Zingman.

40|$|Abstract—A {{huge amount}} of surplus soil and muddy soil was {{produced}} from the construction earth works in Japan. To reuse these soils in the construction sites, the soil improvements by mixing with cement or lime were sometime adopted. Recently, the {{case in which the}} improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted was supposed. As the improved soil was excavated, refilled and compacted, it was necessary to evaluate the strength of the improved soil. However, the strength of stabilized soil was decreased by repetition of excavation, refill and compaction processes. In this paper, the deterioration of strength of the lime-stabilized soil subjected to the repetition of <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction process was discussed. A series of unconfined compression tests were carried out to evaluate the deterioration of strength of the stabilized soil by repeating <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction processes. As a result, it is found that the strength was decreased by repetition of <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction processes from that without the <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> compaction process. However, the deteriorated strength of the stabilized soil which was repeatedly <b>crushed</b> <b>and</b> compacted had similar strength to that of the soil with one-time of <b>crush</b> <b>and</b> comaction process.
