40|$|The current {{investigation}} examines suitability of the hydraulic analog {{for analysis of}} fire-induced dispersion within a complex enclosure. This analog has been implemented using salt-water modeling and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) diagnostics providing quantitative visualization of simulated fire-induced flows. The non-intrusive PLIF diagnostics are used to temporally and spatially characterize dispersion from a buoyant source within a 1 / 7 th scale room-corridor-room enclosure. This configuration is geometrically similar to a full-scale fire test facility, where local fire conditions were characterized near five ionization type smoke detectors placed throughout the enclosure. The full-scale fire and salt-water model results were scaled according to the dimensionless fundamental equations that govern source dispersion. An evaluation of the local conditions and dispersive event times for both the systems was used to explore {{the ability of the}} hydraulic analog to predict smoke detector response times. The dispersive event (front arrival) times predicted by the salt-water model, which represents a necessary event for detector activation, were in excellent agreement with the fire test data. A methodology using these front arrival times along with local conditions at the detector location is introduced in this paper. However, the complex nature of detector response and fidelity limitations of the analog make precise predictions of detector response time challenging. The predicted dimensionless response times were within 25 % for all detector locations, {{with the exception of the}} first-room <b>ceiling</b> <b>detector</b> location. For this latter, a shorter dimensionless response time by less than 40 % of that in the actual fire was predicted. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
30|$|Computer and {{telecommunication}} {{facilities in}} that era were moving from electro-mechanical equipment to solid-state electronics. Increasing equipment densities and power consumption were leading to higher airflows being needed for cooling. Len Gibson and John Petersen at the Australian Post-Master Generals’ Department (PMG) were finding that <b>ceiling</b> mounted smoke <b>detectors</b> were failing to detect fires early enough, particularly smouldering fires, before significant damage occurred to more sensitive electronic equipment. Often this led to serious service interruptions and major business and community impacts. Longer-term, insidious damage was often caused by corrosion from the HCl vapours being emitted from overheated PVC cable insulation.|$|R
40|$|The {{means for}} {{predicting}} ceiling jet temperature under an unconfined ceiling {{has been well}} established by the previous work under an unconfined ceiling. However, a room ceiling is usually enclosed by walls so a fire plume rises in a stratified environment {{in the event of}} room fire. Previous work under an unconfined ceiling will not be sufficient to predict the ceiling jet temperature in such a configuration. On the other hand, a two layer zone model is often used for predicting fire temperature in a stratified configuration but it only gives average condition in the upper layer, which is too crude to predict the near ceiling temperature to assess the actuation of <b>ceiling</b> mounted <b>detectors</b> and sprinklers. In this study, a formula for ceiling jet temperature in a two layer configuration was derived by combining previous work under an unconfined ceiling, upper layer temperature and layer interface height. The validity of the formula was examined by comparing the results of prediction and the experiments using the test fires prescribed in an ISO/TC 21 /SC 3 draft standard. The predicted ceiling temperatures generally exhibit satisfactory agreement with the measured temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} {{provide insight into the}} behavior of jet fuel fires in aircraft hangars and to study the impact of these fires on the design and operation of a variety of fire protection systems. As a result, the test series included small fires designed to investigate the operation of UV/IR detectors and smoke detectors as well as large fires which were used to investigate the operation of <b>ceiling</b> mounted heat <b>detectors</b> and sprinklers. The impact of {{the presence or absence of}} draft curtains was also studied in the 15 m hangar. It is shown that in order to predict the plume centerline temperature within experimental uncertainty, the entrainment of the upper layer gas must be modeled. For large fires, the impact of a changing radiation fraction must also be included in the calculation. The dependence of the radial temperature profile of the ceiling jet as a function of layer development is demonstrated and a ceiling jet temperature algorithm which includes the impact of a growing layer is developed...|$|R
