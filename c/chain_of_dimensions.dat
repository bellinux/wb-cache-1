In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a statistical method for calculating the establishment of tolerances of a chain of complex dimensions, method which is applied quickly and efficiently by a computer program. The {{question that arises is}} the influence of a reducer shaft axis non-parallelism that can lead to some shortcomings in its operation. These deficiencies are based on the size of deviation from parallelism of the axes of the two shafts. For their removal was necessary to study the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> which was formed to mount the type of reducer 1400 - 30 / 7 ERC. Using the data obtained in practice by running a computer program achieved CALTOL was determined statistical tolerance deviation from parallelism between the axis reducer shafts...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{machining}} workshops, workpieces {{are produced}} according to dimensions known as manufacturing dimensions. For the same workpiece {{and the same}} manufacturing plan, several sets of manufacturing dimensions can be used but none satisfy simultaneously the two main missions workshops need to fulfil: (a) Ensuring conformity of products to their design dimension tolerances (also called blueprint tolerances) and (b) steering machines in order to compensate for tool wear. The set of manufacturing dimensions obtained from the design dimensions using the minimal <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> method is optimal for a conformity check of workpieces but is practically unusable for steering machines because {{of the complexity of}} its relationships toward the tool correctors and tools dimensions. The pilot dimensions method consists in, on the one hand, identifying and representing these tool correctors and these tool/program dimensions on the production drawings (besides the manufacturing dimensions) and, on other the other hand, determining their correction values through a mathematical set of relations after having measured the manufacturing dimensions on a workpiece. Doing so will strongly reduce adjustment time, reduce the number of workpieces used for adjustments and greatly enhance the quality of workpiece batches...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMaximum {{and least}} {{material}} requirements describe the strictly necessary fittability and accuracy functional requirements for an assembly involving connections with clearances. In the ISO 2692 : 2014 [1] dimensioning and tolerancing standard, {{the writing of}} this requirement violates the principle of independency and is limited to features of size. This paper proposes two complementary writings and several explanations {{for the application of}} the concepts. In order to make the definitions consistent with those of ISO 1101 : 2012 [2] standard, the requirements are defined by means of unilateral tolerance zones. For features of size, the dimension of the tolerance zone for the specified surface and for the reference is written directly between brackets in the specification. For all complex surfaces, the tolerance zone is defined by an offset surface of the nominal surface. The offset value is written between braces. The definitions of form, location and orientation specifications with these modifiers are given for simple elements and for a pattern of holes. Composite specifications, which associate orientation and location tolerance zones with respect to the same nominal, are defined. An example with flutter on a primary reference shows that it is no longer possible to use all the degrees of freedom to associate the subsequent references. The use of an orientation plane to deal with unidirectional chains of dimensions is defined. In terms of metrology, the characteristic to evaluate is the margin between the actual surface and the limit surface of the tolerance zone when the tolerance zone on the references is respected. This margin enables one, for example, to determine a capability. Three applications present an assembly of a mechanism with clearances, a connection with a complex surface and a 3 D <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimensions</b> at least material which requires a composite specification...|$|E

The transfer <b>of</b> the condition <b>dimensions</b> in manufacturing dimensions is therefore not always direct because the setup operator might also want to control the position of the unfinished surfaces during the adjustment of the machine.

40|$|Computing {{limit is}} a {{fundamental}} task in mathematics and different mathematical concepts are {{defined in terms of}} limit computations. Among these mathematical concepts, we are interested in three different types of limit computations: first, computing the limit points of solutions of polynomial systems represented by regular chains, second, computing tangent cones of space curves at their singular points which can be viewed as computing limit of secant lines, and third, computing the limit of real multivariate rational functions. For computing the limit of solutions of polynomial systems represented by regular chains, we present two different methods based on Puiseux series expansions and linear changes of coordinates. The first method, which is based on Puiseux series expansions, addresses the problem of computing real and complex limit points corresponding to regular <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimension</b> one. The second method studies regular <b>chains</b> under changes <b>of</b> coordinates. It especially computes the limit points corresponding to regular <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimension</b> higher than one for some cases. we consider strategies where these changes of coordinates can be either generic or guided by the input. For computing the Puiseux parametrizations corresponding to regular <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>dimension</b> one, we rely on extended Hensel construction (EHC). The Extended Hensel Construction is a procedure which, for an input bivariate polynomial with complex coefficients, can serve the same purpose as the Newton-Puiseux algorithm, and, for the multivariate case, can be seen as an effective variant of Jung-Abhyankar Theorem. We show that the EHC requires only linear algebra and univariate polynomial arithmetic. We deduce complexity estimates and report on a software implementation together with experimental results. We also outline a method for computing the tangent cone of a space curve at any of its points. We rely on the theory <b>of</b> regular <b>chains</b> and Puiseux series expansions. Our approach is novel in that it explicitly constructs the tangent cone at arbitrary and possibly irrational points without using a Standard basis. We also present an algorithm for determining the existence of the limit of a real multivariate rational function q at a given point which is an isolated zero of the denominator of q. When the limit exists, the algorithm computes it, without making any assumption on the number of variables. A process, which extends the work of Cadavid, Molina and V´elez, reduces the multivariate setting to computing limits of bivariate rational functions. By using regular chain theory and triangular decomposition of semi-algebraic systems, we avoid the computation of singular loci and the decomposition of algebraic sets into irreducible components...|$|R

40|$|Any {{partial order}} is an {{intersection}} of linear orders, generally in many ways. The smallest number of linear orders required {{in such an}} intersection is called the <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the given partial order. This concept <b>of</b> <b>dimension</b> can be trivially extended to quasi orders (i. e. reflexive and transitive relations), by using weak orders instead of linear orders. A further extension to general relations is obtained by replacing weak orders with biorders (also called Ferrers relations). These notions are now classical, see e. g. Trotter, Combinatorics and Partially Ordered Sets: Dimension Theory (1992). In this talk, we introduce several concepts <b>of</b> <b>dimension</b> for <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> relations. The motivation comes from the analysis of valued relations in preference modelling. A forerunner was Ovchinnikov (1984) who however worked in another theoretical setting than ours. Valverde (1985) investigation of the transitive closure of a valued relation paved {{the way to a}} fairly general concept <b>of</b> <b>dimension.</b> After having made a choice of definitions among many possible ones, we show that any valued quasi order is an intersection of valued weak orders. Our goal is to study the combinatorics <b>of</b> the resulting <b>dimension</b> concept, which is defined thus for valued quasi-orders, or equivalently for <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> quasi-orders. A similar dimension can also be defined for any valued relation (that is, for any <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> relations) if valued biorders take the place of valued weak orders as the one-dimensional relations. This remark directly follows from Fodor and Roubens (1995). Interesting, combinatorial questions arise about the new concept <b>of</b> <b>dimension</b> for a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> quasi orders. We stress that the <b>dimension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chain</b> is not just a plain function <b>of</b> the <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the quasi orders. For instance, if the chain has dimension at most two, all the quasi orders have also dimension at most two; however, the converse does not necessarily hold. Characterizing two-dimensional <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> quasi orders thus requires additional conditions that force the (two-dimensional) quasi orders to be coherent in some way. We describe several such conditions that are inferred from the study of transitive orientations of comparability graphs. Although progress towards a solution is reported, we leave open the problem <b>of</b> characterizing two-dimensional <b>chains.</b> Moreover, the computational complexity of the corresponding decision problem is presently unknown.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to present}} a method for the {{tolerance}} analysis of mechanical assemblies that is suitable to nonlinear problems where explicit functional equations are difficult or even impossible to write down. Such cases are usually modelled by linearised tolerance chains, whose coefficients (or sensitivities) are calculated from assembly data. Design/methodology/approach - The method {{is based on the}} free-body diagrams of force analysis, which are shown {{to be related to the}} sensitivities of linearised functional equations. Such an analogy allows the conversion <b>of</b> a tolerance <b>chain</b> into a corresponding static problem, which can be solved by common algebraic or graphical procedures. Findings - The static analogy leads to a correct treatment <b>of</b> tolerance <b>chains,</b> as the analysis of several examples has confirmed by comparison to alternative methods. Research limitations/implications - Currently, the method has only been tested on two-dimensional <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> linear <b>dimensions</b> for assemblies with nonredundant kinematic constraints among parts. Practical implications - The proposed method lends itself to ready application by using simple operations with minimal software assistance. This could make it complementary to current methods for calculating sensitivities, which are mathematically complex and require software implementation for deployment in industrial practice.
