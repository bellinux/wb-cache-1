30|$|The ADF 17 unit root test is {{used for}} {{individual}} <b>country</b> <b>analysis,</b> while the LLC 18 panel unit root test {{is used for}} the panel setting. In the same way, Johansen Maximum Likelihood cointegration test (Johansen, 1988) is deployed for individual <b>country</b> <b>analysis,</b> while Johansen Fisher panel cointegration test is deployed for the panel setting. The details of these two tests (Johansen and Fisher/ Maddala) are not discussed here due to space constraints and can be made available on request. Additionally, it can be noted that the evidences of cointegration and causality in the panel setting may be sensitive to the assumption of cross-sectional dependence. Hence, we deployed Pesaran (2004) test of cross sectional dependence (CD) to all the four variables. However, CD-statistics do not give any significant results. The results of these statistics are not reported in order to conserve space.|$|E

The paper further contribute to literature by supporting the clamor for moving away from region or <b>country</b> <b>analysis</b> to within country assessment in order to favor available location benefits considered crucial in mitigating political risk. The growing relevance of within <b>country</b> <b>analysis</b> can lead to finding how best to minimize political risk impact on FDI inflow...|$|E
