A retrospective analysis of coronary artery motion (CAM) was performed on coronary angiograms of 20 patients who subsequently had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated by primary or rescue angioplasty and {{an equal number of}} age and sex matched controls with normal angiograms. Findings There was no statistically significant difference between the frequency of CAM types of the ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction and control patients (p = 0. 97). The <b>compression</b> <b>type</b> of CAM is more frequent in the proximal and mid segments of all three coronary arteries. No statistically significant difference was found when the frequency of the <b>compression</b> <b>type</b> of CAM was compared between the ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction and control patients for the individual coronary artery segments (p = 0. 59). Conclusion The proportion of the <b>compression</b> <b>type</b> of coronary artery motion for individual artery segments is not different between patients who have subsequent ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions and normal controls. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To predict bearing {{capacity}} on mortar-rock interface of <b>compression</b> <b>type</b> rock anchor, the failure model of fixed anchor length is established. The maximal shear stresses {{on the interface}} {{in front of the}} bearing plate are determined based on tests. The relation of maximal shear stress and fixed anchor length is assumed. Double exponential function curves are adopted to simulate the ultimate state of the fixed anchor length. Two parameters are introduced to adjust the curve shape. According to the results of the field test, the values range of the parameters in soft rock is determined. After comparing ultimate {{bearing capacity}} measured in test with predicting value, it is shown that the empirical formula can calculate the bearing capacity of fixed anchor length reasonably. <b>Compression</b> <b>type</b> rock anchors have more capacity than ordinary tension type anchors and the capacity is convergent gradually with fixed anchor length increase...|$|R
