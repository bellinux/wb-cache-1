40|$|Review of the {{progress}} <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> series spacecraft with details on the Mariner 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 missions and equipment. The systems <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 9 are discussed in great detail. <b>Mariner</b> 9 photographs <b>of</b> Mars, Phobos, Diemos, Martian peaks, Nix Olympica, Martian equatorial region, and some other Martian surface details are included. Diagrams <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 9 daily operating profile, <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 9 TV coverage vs time in orbit, and <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 9 in superior conjunction on Sept. 7, 1972 are also given. It is hoped that Martian landing missions as planned in 1975 by the Viking project will be more productive than Mariner 9 in answering {{the question of whether}} life did, or does, exist on that planet...|$|R

40|$|Background: With the aim to {{increase}} the knowledge {{on the evolution of}} coleopteran genomes, we investigated through cytogenetics and nucleotide sequence analysis Mariner transposons in three Scarabaeinae species (Coprophanaeus cyanescens, C. ensifer and Diabroctis mimas). Results: The cytogenetic mapping revealed an accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> transposon in the pericentromeric repetitive regions characterized as rich in heterochromatin and C(0) t- 1 DNA fraction (DNA enriched with high and moderately repeated sequences). Nucleotide sequence analysis <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> revealed the presence of two major groups <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> copies in the three investigated coleoptera species. Conclusions: The Mariner is accumulated in the centromeric area of the coleopteran chromosomes probably {{as a consequence of the}} absence of recombination in the heterochromatic regions. Our analysis detected high diversification <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> sequences during the evolutionary history of the group. Furthermore, comparisons between the coleopterans sequences with other insects and mammals, suggest that the horizontal transfer (HT) could have acted in the spreading <b>of</b> the <b>Mariner</b> in diverse non-related animal groups...|$|R

40|$|A brief {{review of}} Martian crater data is {{presented}} and a short summary is provided of Martian fresh crater morphology and morphometry based on pre-Viking information. The pre-Viking Mars missions are considered, {{taking into account the}} flyby <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 4 in July 1965, the flyby <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 6 in July 1969, the flyby <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 7 in August 1969, and the insertion <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 9 into a Martian orbit in November 1971. The 7329 photographs of the planet and its moons transmitted by Mariner 9 to earth provide a substantial basis for formulating a large body of data on crater morphometry, morphology, and location. In general, fresh Martian crater morphology follows a diameter-dependent progression. The simplest morphology is found in the smallest craters. The morphology remains essentially constant through diameters of approximately 10 km. Morphologies rapidly become more complex in the diameter range of 10 - 40 km...|$|R

The absolute calibration <b>of</b> <b>Mariner</b> 9 and Mariner 6 differ {{by a factor of}} 1. 43 at L-alpha. The low values of the sky brightness measured by Mariner 9 near the sky minimum suggest that the nearby interstellar medium has a kinetic temperature of 200 - 1100 K and a relative velocity with respect to the sun in the range 13 - 14 km/sec...|$|R

40|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>mariner</b> {{transformation}} vectors {{based on}} the mauritiana subfamily of transposable elements were introduced into the genome of Drosophila melanogaster and examined {{for their ability to}} be mobilized by the mariner transposase. Simple insertion vectors were constructed from single mariner elements into which exogenous DNA ranging in size from 1. 3 to 4. 5 kb had been inserted; composite vectors were constructed with partial or complete duplications <b>of</b> <b>mariner</b> flanking the exogenous DNA. All of the simple insertion vectors showed levels of somatic and germline excision that were at least 100 -fold lower than the baseline level <b>of</b> uninterrupted <b>mariner</b> elements. Although composite vectors with inverted duplications were unable to be mobilized at detectable frequencies, vectors with large direct duplications <b>of</b> <b>mariner</b> could be mobilized. A vector consisting of two virtually complete elements flanking exogenous DNA yielded a frequency of somatic eye-color mosaicism of approximately 10 % and a frequency of germline excision of 0. 04 %. These values are far smaller than those observed for uninterrupted elements. The results imply that efficient mobilization <b>of</b> <b>mariner</b> in vivo requires the presence and proper spacing of sequences internal to the element as well as the inverted repeats...|$|R
