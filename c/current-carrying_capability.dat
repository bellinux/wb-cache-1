40|$|This book {{provides}} expert {{coverage of}} modern and novel {{aspects of the}} study of vortex matter, dynamics, and pinning in nanostructured and multi-component superconductors. Vortex matter in superconducting materials is a field of enormous beauty and intellectual challenge, which began with the theoretical prediction of vortices by A. Abrikosov (Nobel Laureate). Vortices, vortex dynamics, and pinning are key features in many of today’s human endeavors: from the huge superconducting accelerating magnets and detectors at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which opened new windows of knowledge on the universe, to the tiny superconducting transceivers using Rapid Single Flux Quanta, which have opened a revolutionary means of communication. In recent years, two new features have added to the intrinsic beauty and complexity of the subject: nanostructured/nanoengineered superconductors, and the discovery of a range of new materials showing multi-component (multi-gap) superconductivity. In this book, leading researchers survey the most exciting and important recent developments in the field. Topics covered include: the use of scanning Hall probe microscopy to visualize interactions of a single vortex with pinning centers; Magneto-Optical Imaging for investigating what vortex avalanches are, why they appear, and how they can be controlled; and the vortex interactions responsible for the second magnetization peak. Other chapters discuss nanoengineered pinning centers of vortices for improved <b>current-carrying</b> <b>capabilities,</b> current anisotropy in cryomagnetic devices in relation to the pinning landscape, and the new physics associated with the discovery of new superconducting materials with multi-component superconductivity. The book offers something for almost everybody interested in the field: from experimental techniques to visualize vortices and study their dynamics, to a state-of-the-art theoretical microscopic approach to multicomponent superconductivity.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{fabrication}} of high-performance MgB 2 bulk superconductors doped with amorphous carbon (aC), derived from PMMA polymer, {{a safe and}} cost effective carbon source as compared to explosive gaseous and expensive C-containing nanoadditives. The commonly used C-containing nanoadditives and boron (B) precursor nanopowders are usually prone to agglomeration in solid state mixing which causes poor reactivity and non-uniform distribution that leads to deterioration of critical current properties of MgB 2. We have overcome this problem by achieving uniform 3 - 4 nm thin coating of aC on B nanopowders by pyrolysis of PMMA through solution process. Compared to undoped MgB 2, significantly high <b>current-carrying</b> <b>capability</b> (J(c) (5 K, 8 T) similar to 3. 1 x 10 (4) A/cm(2) and J(c) (20 K, 6 T) > 10 (3) A/cm(2)) was obtained for aC-doped MgB 2, which {{is comparable to the}} record high in-field Jc reported for SiC-doped MgB 2 and much better than those reported in literature with other C sources. Furthermore, significant improvement in H-irr and H-c 2 were also observed for aC-doped MgB 2. The improved high-field properties in PMMA-derived aC-doped MgB 2 bulk suggest that the solution process could be a powerful technique to obtain uniform mixture of C-coated B to develop high-performance Mg(B 1 -xCx) (2) wires for practical applications.

40|$|Mg-B {{system with}} single glycine {{addition}} {{was composed of}} MgO phase rather than MgB 2 when sintered at 600 C for 2 to 5 h. Cu was further introduced into Mg-B-glycine system to active the low-temperature sintering efficiency, and more than 80 % MgB 2 superconducting phase was successfully obtained in Cu and glycine co-doped samples sintered at 600 C for 8 h, 12 h, and 15 h, respectively. The sample sintered for 8 h showed uncompetitive critical current density (Jc) because of the uncompleted MgB 2 phase and the unreacted Mg phase, while the 15 -h sample showed the best Jc of 1. 5 x 104 A cm - 2 at 3 T and 20 K. The pinning behavior of MgO (∼ 20 nm) and MgCu 2 (∼ 10 nm), which should {{be responsible for the}} exciting <b>current-carrying</b> <b>capability</b> that the Jc performance was improved over the entire field in contrast with pure MgB 2, was systematically investigated. According to the phase identification and the microstructure observation, both the pre-generated MgO involved in the MgB 2 grains and the MgCu 2 precipitated along the steps of the screw dislocation growth mechanism could serve as effective pinning centers. Finally, we illustrated the whole sintering process of the sample sintered at 600 C for 15 h. 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Novel contact {{architectures}} to n-Silicon (n-Si) and to n-Germanium (n-Ge) were benchmarked for {{the first}} time against the state-of-the-art contact architecture to n-Si. It was found that although the recently reported contact architectures to n-Ge exhibit markedly improved performance, more work must be done to match state-of the-art NiSi/n-Si contact architecture in terms of <b>current-carrying</b> <b>capability.</b> With the continued scaling of contact length in accordance with Moore’s law, the interface resistance between metal and semiconductor has become a critical area of focus to achieve the required targets for lower external series resistance (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Prior studies have shown effective pathways to lower the interface resistance for p-MOSFETs, like the use of narrow bandgap Silicon-Germanium (SiGe) compounds in Source/Drain (S/D) regions in silicon channel transistors. In addition, the use of a Germanium channel device provides inherent benefit of Fermi-level pinning near the valence band for contacts to p-Ge S/D. Alternative contact architectures are now being sought to improve the interface contact resistance to n-Si (for Silicon channel CMOS) and to n-Ge (for Germanium channel CMOS) by reducing the Schottky Barrier Height (SBH) between metal and n-type S/D semiconductors. In this work, a metric which is based on current density (J) at given semiconductor doping density (ND) was found to be most suitable for benchmarking contact architectures of widely varying maturities...|$|E
