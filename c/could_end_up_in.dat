25|$|Britain {{feared that}} the French naval fleet <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to {{maintaining}} North Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France {{had been allowed to}} retain the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never {{fall into the hands of}} Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to faraway territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. This did not satisfy Winston Churchill, who ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. Shortly after the Armistice (22 June 1940), Britain conducted the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir, killing 1,297 French military personnel, and Vichy severed diplomatic relations with Britain. The French squadron at Alexandria, under Admiral René-Emile Godfroy, was effectively interned until 1943 after an agreement was reached with Admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham, commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet. After the Mers el Kebir incident, the United Kingdom recognized Free France as the legitimate government of France.|$|E

It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the same place".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes and Riley become engaged. Riley's brother Seth (Miles Higson) {{discovered}} that she {{and his father had}} an affair, so she lied about falling pregnant to prevent the truth from coming out. On the advice from her mother Myra (Nicole Barber-Lane), Mercedes planned to fake a miscarriage, but Mercedes' sister Jacqui discovered the affair and Mercedes' intention to fake a miscarriage. Jacqui was [...] "disgusted" [...] and threatened to expose the affair; Metcalfe commented that this left Mercedes feeling like her [...] "world could collapse around her at any moment". [...] "On eggshells" [...] after Jacqui's discovery, Mercedes believed Jacqui would expose the affair. Metcalfe described Jacqui's attitude towards Mercedes, stating, [...] "Jacqui knows what Mercedes is, she knows what she's like - but she resorts to judging her because she's just trying to support her". Metcalfe explained that if Jacqui kept the affair secret Mercedes would be [...] "relieved" [...] that she still has Riley, and although she would not immediately think of Carl, Mercedes was worried that [...] "they <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> bed together again". Metcalfe {{went on to say that}} Mercedes [...] "loves Riley" [...] but [...] "can't help fancying Carl", adding that for Mercedes [...] "there's a difference between love and lust".|$|E
2500|$|On 13 November 2013, Air Force Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh {{revealed}} that the service {{was interested in the}} SR-72's hypersonic capabilities, but had not spoken with Lockheed about the aircraft. [...] Its high speed appeals to the service to reduce the time an adversary would have to react to an operation. [...] They are pursuing hypersonic technology, but don't yet have the material ability to construct a full-size plane like the unmanned SR-72. [...] The SR-72 was unveiled in the midst of sequestration budget cuts that have forced the Air Force to prioritize acquisition projects and sacrifice mission readiness. [...] By the mid-2020s, it is believed that foreign countries will produce and export advanced aerial technologies that <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> battlespaces against the United States. [...] This drives the Air Force to further develop new systems, including hypersonic, to replace legacy systems that would be outclassed in those situations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Given {{a set of}} {{flexible}} branched junction DNA molecules with sticky-ends (building blocks), called here tiles, we consider the problem of determining the proper stoichiometry such that all sticky-ends <b>could</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> connected. <b>In</b> general, the stoichiometry is not uniform, and {{the goal is to}} determine the proper proportion (spectrum) of each type of molecules present to allow for complete assembly. We partition multisets of tiles, called here pots, into three classes: weakly satisfiable, satisfiable and strongly satisfiable according to possible components that assemble in complete complexes. This classification is characterized through the spectrum of the pot, which can be computed in PTIME using the standard Gauss-Jordan elimination method. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{breeding}} bird {{community of the}} Tur River Nature Reserve was censused between 15 - 16 June 2005, by casual observations and a point-count method. Casual observations resulted the sighting of 17 species. By the other method we recorded 30 species. The most abundant bird in the 100 meter radius circle around the observation point was the skylark (Alauda arvensis), followed by the yellow wagtail (Motacilla flava), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), penduline tit (Remiz pendulinus) and magpie (Pica pica). This short qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows a relatively good state of the {{breeding bird}} communities, but with some alarming signes which <b>could</b> easily <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the so-called biotic homogenisation. For this reason we recommend a constant monitoring of the breeding birds in the protected area to recognize and prevent in time the negative processes...|$|R
