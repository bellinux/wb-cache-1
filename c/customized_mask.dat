The main challenge in these particular patients {{is to give}} them the possibility of a very short convalescence period and to make possible their agonistic activity as soon as possible. The authors here present an innovative technique to realize this-the Security Hi-tech Individual Extra-Light Device Mask, a customizable protective shield based on the player's face cast. A completely <b>customized</b> <b>mask</b> was forged over the player's face cast to protect the injured area.

40|$|Sleep apnea is a {{syndrome}} that {{is characterized}} by sudden breathing halts while sleeping. One of the common treatments involves wearing a mask that delivers continuous air flow into the nostrils so as to maintain a steady air pressure. These masks are designed for an average facial model and are often difficult to adjust due to poor fit to the actual patient. The incompatibility {{is characterized by}} gaps between the mask and the face, which deteriorates the impermeability of the mask and leads to air leakage. We suggest a fully automatic approach for designing a personalized nasal mask interface using a facial depth scan. The interfaces generated by the proposed method accurately fit the geometry of the scanned face, and are easy to manufacture. The proposed method utilizes cheap commodity depth sensors and 3 D printing technologies to efficiently design and manufacture <b>customized</b> <b>masks</b> for patients suffering from sleep apnea...|$|R

40|$|Simulated dose {{profiles}} in various irradiation and beam test conditions are {{compared to the}} expected dose {{profiles in}} the ECAL crystals at LHC. Simple front or side irradiations with photons give too steep or too flat dose profiles, respectively. Thus, if dose maxima are fitted to agree, front irradiation underestimate the average dose whereas side irradiations tend to overestimate. Different profiles are difficult to compare reliably, but {{it seems likely that}} in both cases the discrepancy is about a factor of 2 - 3 but in different directions. For most purposes this is likely to be good enough, but should be taken into account in the interpretation of the test results. It is shown that using a <b>customized</b> lead <b>mask</b> between the source and the crystal can significantly improve the agreement between 60 Co side irradiations and the LHC predictions. A 400 MeV/c pion beam incident on a crystal matrix can also reproduce rather well the profiles expected in the barrel ECAL...|$|R

At {{the core of our}} fabrication route, termed "Soft Nanoparticle Templating", is the conversion of gradually compressed self-assembled monolayers of soft nanoparticles (microgels) at a water-oil interface into <b>customized</b> lithographical <b>masks</b> to create VA-SiNW arrays by means of metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE). This combination of bottom-up and top-down techniques affords excellent control of nanowire etching site locations, enabling independent control of nanowire spacing, diameter and height in a single fabrication route. We demonstrate the fabrication of centimeter-scale two-dimensional gradient photonic crystals exhibiting continuously varying structural colors across the entire visible spectrum on a single silicon substrate, and the formation of tunable optical cavities supported by the VA-SiNWs, as unambiguously demonstrated through numerical simulations. Finally, Soft Nanoparticle Templating is combined with optical lithography to create hierarchical and programmable VA-SiNW patterns...|$|R

40|$|Since 1985 {{when the}} first robot PUMA 560 was {{employed}} to place a needle during a brain CT biopsy, surgical robots have become ubiquitous in clinical surgeries. Despite its advantages and success in surgeries, the interactions between the robot and the surgeons remain deficient, especially for the pressure sensing which plays an important role. Inspired by our previous work on bacterial sensing, in the current work I have designed, fabricated, analyzed, and evaluated an innovative prototype pressure sensor based on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) and Shear Horizontal (SH) -SAW. This AlN-based device has unique superiority over other SAW devices, including relatively lower cost, higher sensitivity, intrinsically higher reliability, more compact size, and faster response. In this novel design a sandwich-like structure is adopted and the AlN thin film on the top is used as the insulated layer to make the device applicable in aqueous environment. The delta function analysis and structural mechanics analysis have been performed to validate the proposed design scheme qualitatively. So as to make a quantitative and comprehensive analysis, the numerical computational analysis using finite element method (FEM) {{has been carried out}} using the software package COMSOL Multiphysics®. The 2 D plane-strain simulation and 3 D simplified model simulation have been executed to analyze the device performance with or without insulator. A good agreement has been achieved between the simulation and the experimental measurements, which validates the design scheme and establishes the effectiveness of the device. This SAW/SH-SAW device has been fabricated in the WSU SSIM clean room. The crystalline AlN thin film is deposited on A-plane sapphire with 2 µm thickness using the PSMBE system. The aluminum interdigital transducer (IDT) is evaporated on the AlN thin film with predefined delay-line pattern using the BJD- 1800 vacuum deposition system. Another layer of AlN thin film with 1 µm thickness is deposited {{on the top of the}} IDT area with some <b>customized</b> <b>masks</b> to make the device insulated. Furthermore, the differential frequency measurement system has been set up using electronic components to evaluate the system. Several signal processing algorithms are developed and compared to acquire system output. The thermal stability of the differential system is also studied and temperature compensation is developed to improve system robustness. The portable electrical circuit involving the frequency measurement system is finally designed and evaluated. Such a sensor could serve as a key component in artificial skin or be equipped on the end of a surgical robotic arm in the future...|$|R

40|$|Medical Imaging 2011, Lake Buena Vista (Orlando), Florida, U. S. A., February 2011 Neuroimaging {{provides}} important insights {{for understanding}} neurobiology and {{is essential for}} accurate neurological and neurosurgical diagnosis and patient care. The volume {{and complexity of the}} neuroimaging datasets have greatly increased due to advances in scanning instrumentation. These large datasets now pose challenges for images retrieval / management and more effective approaches are needed. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) takes advantage of the rich visual/physiological information in the images and can provide the opportunity for more efficient and reliable image retrieval. Although a number of investigators have used CBIR systems in neuroimaging, few of these approaches have explored all the potential features in these images. We suggest that such image retrieval could be optimized by using pathological and domain-specific visual features rather than texture features alone. We used the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc) as the physiological parameter from static brain [18 F] 2 -fluorodeoxy-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) images and a <b>customized</b> disorder-oriented <b>mask</b> (DOM) specific for a particular neurodegenerative disorder, with the regions of interest (ROIs) specific for each disease sub-type. We designed 8 Gabor filter banks with different parameter settings and identified the optimum Gabor function parameter setting for the visual feature extraction. Our experimental data indicate that optimization of the Gabor filter parameters, targeted to disease specific regions enhances retrieval precision.

50|$|On May 21, 2011, while batting {{during the}} 2nd inning {{of a game}} against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, Byrd was hit near his left eye by a pitch from Red Sox pitcher Alfredo Aceves. The pitch was, {{according}} to Aceves, unintentional. After the pitch hit him, Byrd dropped to the ground, covered the area by his left eye and rolled in pain; he was helped off the field by Cubs medical personnel and taken to the trainer's room in the clubhouse. Byrd did not return to the game. He was taken to Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he stayed overnight to be examined. The incident marked the fifth time that Byrd had been hit by a pitch in a ten-day period. Byrd was placed on the 15-day disabled list the following day. Justin Berg was called up to take his place.

30|$|In a preparatory stage, we {{realized}} sub-millimetric circuits providing probe paths and pads for electrical measurement. We fabricated electrical circuits on a silicon substrate with a 500 -nm-thick layer of silicon dioxide as insulation layer. A resist layer, spun on the substrate, was patterned using photolithography with a <b>customized</b> optical <b>mask.</b> Subsequently, {{we performed a}} sputter deposition of 200 -nm-thick film of niobium, obtaining the probe circuit after lift-off in acetone. We transferred SiNWs from the original substrate to a square area delimited by the ends of Nb paths of the probe circuit by using a thin copper wire (diameter[*]=[*] 0.1 [*]mm) as scratch tool. The wires were randomly distributed in tangles on the new substrate; thus, we accurately selected few isolated SiNWs {{by means of a}} dual beam Quanta 3 D Microscope (FEI) and stuck them on the substrate by depositing platinum spots with a gas injection system (GIS). The excess of SiNWs was then removed with an ultrasonic bath in ethanol. At this step, two different methods of wiring were adopted in order to connect single nanowires to the Nb paths. In the first one, we used a customized electron beam ithography (EBL) process; firstly, we spun a PMMA layer on the substrate and then we exposed the resist to the e-beam of Quanta 3 D Microscope, thus patterning sub-micrometric paths to match the probe circuit and the nanowires. Finally, electrical contacts were realized with a sputter deposition of Au 32 -Pd 68 alloy preceded by a sputter-etching process with Ar+. In the second method, the wiring was achieved directly in the Quanta 3 D Microscope chamber. In fact, we used the focused ion beam in conjunction with GIS and a patterning software tool, which allows a spatial-controlled deposition of platinum; {{we realized}} Pt paths connecting SiNWs to the probe circuit in a single-step process.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{computed}} tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) for delineation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in pharyngolaryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and to validate results with the macroscopic surgical specimen when available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with stages II-IV squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation therapy or chemotherapy and radiation therapy (n = 20) or with total laryngectomy (n = 9) were enrolled. Ten patients had oropharyngeal, 13 had laryngeal, and six had hypopharyngeal tumors. CT, MR imaging, and PET were performed with patients immobilized in a <b>customized</b> thermoplastic <b>mask,</b> and images were coregistered. GTVs obtained with the three modalities were compared quantitatively and qualitatively. If patients underwent total laryngectomy, images were validated with the surgical specimen after three-dimensional coregistration. The effect of each modality was estimated with linear mixed-effects models. Adjustments for multiple comparisons were made with the Bonferonni or Sidak method. RESULTS: For oropharyngeal tumors and for laryngeal or hypopharyngeal tumors, no significant difference (P >. 99) was observed between average GTVs delineated at CT (32. 0 and 21. 4 cm(3), respectively) or MR imaging (27. 9 and 21. 4 cm(3), respectively), whereas average GTVs at PET were smaller (20. 3 [P </=. 10] and 16. 4 cm(3) [P </=. 01], respectively). GTVs from surgical specimens were significantly smaller (12. 6 cm(3), P </=. 06). In nine patients for whom a surgical specimen was available, no modality adequately depicted superficial tumor extension; {{this was due to}} limitations in spatial resolution. In addition, false-positive results were seen for cartilage, extralaryngeal, and preepiglottic extensions. CONCLUSION: Compared with GTVs at CT and MR imaging, GTVs at FDG PET were smaller. In nine patients for whom a surgical specimen was available, PET was found to be the most accurate modality. However, no modality managed to depict superficial tumor extension...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{experimentally}} validate and characterize the first phase-shifted polymer optical fiber Bragg gratings (PS-POFBGs) produced using a single pulse from a 248 nm krypton fluoride laser. A single-mode poly (methyl methacrylate) optical fiber with a core doped with benzyl dimethyl ketal for photosensitivity improvement was used. A uniform phase <b>mask</b> <b>customized</b> for 850 nm grating inscription {{was used to}} inscribe these Bragg structures. The phase shift defect was created directly during the grating inscription process by placing a narrow blocking aperture {{in the center of}} the UV beam. The produced high-quality Bragg grating structures, presenting a double dips, reject 16. 3 dB (97. 6 % reflectivity) and 13. 2 dB (95. 2 % reflectivity) of the transmitted power, being therefore appropriate for sensing or other photonic applications. Its transmission spectrum possesses two sharp transmission notches, allowing a significant increase in measurement resolution compared to direct interrogation of a single grating. The reflection and transmission spectra when multiple phase shifts are introduced in the FBG structure are also shown. The PS-POFBG's strain, temperature, pressure, and humidity characteristics have been experimentally analyzed in detail to assess their potential usage as sensors...|$|R
40|$|Brent C Bell, E Brian Butler Department of Radiation Oncology, Houston Methodist Hospital, The Texas Medical Center, Houston, TX, USA Background: Studies {{report the}} need for {{improved}} pain management in the radiation oncology setting. Many patients with well controlled background pain experience breakthrough pain in cancer (BTPc) that can interrupt their treatment schedule with a potentially negative impact on outcomes. BTPc can be unpredictable and predictable; both types of pain can be managed with fast-acting analgesics, but predictable pain lends itself to anticipatory management. Methods: Five consecutive cases are described in which fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) was used to manage BTPc, {{with an emphasis on}} the anticipatory management of predictable pain in cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Results: Patients (four men, one woman), age range 32 – 84 years, were diagnosed with various cancers. All patients were receiving opioid treatment for chronic pain, and experienced predictable pain with radiotherapy which included pain associated with lying on a treatment table for a sustained time during an average of 29 radiotherapy treatments; pain associated with radiation simulation and radiotherapy; pain associated with odynophagia related to increasing mucositis during treatment, resulting in decreased nutritional intake; pain associated with the <b>customized</b> immobilization <b>mask</b> for head and neck cancer patients; and pain associated with defecation. Some patients also reported pain awakening them randomly at night (eg, sleep interruption). All patients attained lower pain intensity scores (2 / 10 to 3 / 10), reduced from approximately 7 / 10, when they were treated with FPNS 20 minutes before a predictable pain event. No patient experienced any pain-related interruptions to their course of radiotherapy. The average number of radiotherapy sessions was 29 per patient, excluding one short-course treatment for one patient. Conclusion: FPNS offers a good solution to the management of BTPc because its fast onset of action makes it very suitable for the anticipatory treatment of predictable pain, which is likely to minimize interruptions to the radiotherapy schedule.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report our initial experience treating pediatric patients with central nervous system tumors using a frameless, optically guided linear accelerator. Pediatric patients were selected for treatment after evaluation by a multidisciplinary neuro-oncology team including neurosurgery, neurology, pathology, oncology, and radiation oncology. Prior to treatment, all patients underwent treatment planning using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and treatment simulation on a standard computed tomography scanner (CT). For CT simulation, patients were fitted with a <b>customized</b> plastic face <b>mask</b> with a bite block attached to an optical array with four reflective markers. After ensuring adequate reproducibility, these markers were tracked during treatment by an infra-red camera. All treatments were delivered on a Varian Trilogy linear accelerator. The follow-up period ranges from 1 – 18  months, with a median follow-up of 6  months. Nine patients, ages ranging from 12 to 19  years old (median age 15  years old), with a variety of tumors have been treated. Patients were treated for juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA; n[*]=[*] 2), pontine low-grade astrocytoma (n[*]=[*] 1), pituitary adenoma (n[*]=[*] 3), metastatic medulloblastoma (n[*]=[*] 1), acoustic neuroma (n[*]=[*] 1), and pineocytoma (n[*]=[*] 1).

40|$|Computational {{imaging and}} sensing leverages the joint-design of optics, {{detectors}} and processing {{to overcome the}} performance bottlenecks inherent to the traditional imaging paradigm. This novel imaging and sensing design paradigm essentially allows new trade-offs between the optics, detector and processing components of an imaging system and enables broader operational regimes {{beyond the reach of}} conventional imaging architectures, which are constrained by well-known Rayleigh, Strehl and Nyquist rules amongst others. In this dissertation, we focus on scalability aspects of these novel computational imaging architectures, their design and implementation, which have far-reaching impacts on the potential and feasibility of realizing task-specific performance gains relative to traditional imager designs. For the extended depth of field (EDoF) computational imager design, which employs a <b>customized</b> phase <b>mask</b> to achieve defocus immunity, we propose a joint-optimization framework to simultaneously optimize the parameters of the optical phase mask and the processing algorithm, with the system design goal of minimizing the noise and artifacts in the final processed image. Using an experimental prototype, we demonstrate that our optimized system design achieves higher fidelity output compared to other static designs from the literature, such as the Cubic and Trefoil phase masks. While traditional imagers rely on an isomorphic mapping between the scene and the optical measurements to form images, they do not exploit the inherent compressibility of natural images and thus are subject to Nyquist sampling. Compressive sensing exploits the inherent redundancy of natural images, basis of image compression algorithms like JPEG/JPEG 2000, to make linear projection measurements with far fewer samples than Nyquist for the image forming task. Here, we present a block wise compressive imaging architecture which is scalable to high space-bandwidth products (i. e. large FOV and high resolution applications) and employs a parallelizable and non-iterative piecewise linear reconstruction algorithm capable of operating in real-time. Our compressive imager based on this scalable architecture design {{is not limited to the}} imaging task and can also be used for automatic target recognition (ATR) without an intermediate image reconstruction. To maximize the detection and classification performance of this compressive ATR sensor, we have developed a scalable statistical model of natural scenes, which enables the optimization of the compressive sensor projections with the Cauchy-Schwarz mutual information metric. We demonstrate the superior performance of this compressive ATR system using simulation and experiment. Finally, we investigate the fundamental resolution limit of imaging via the canonical incoherent quasi-monochromatic two point-sources separation problem. We extend recent results in the literature demonstrating, with Fisher information and estimator mean square error analysis, that a passive optical mode-sorting architecture with only two measurements can outperform traditional intensity-based imagers employing an ideal focal plane array in the sub-Rayleigh range, thus overcoming the Rayleigh resolution limit...|$|R
