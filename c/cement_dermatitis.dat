40|$|Allergic {{dermatitis}} {{to chromate}} in cement {{is the most}} common occupational dermatitis among construction workers in Singapore. Hexavalent chromate in cement can be removed by iron sulphate. This study determined the minimum concentration of iron sulphate required to remove the hexavalent chromate kom nine brands of Asian cement. The hexavalent chromate concentrations in cements were determined by colorimetric spectrophotometry. The minimum amount of iron sulphate required to remove completely hexavalent chromate in. all the cements was 035 % w/w. Iron sulphate should be used in the construction industry to prevent <b>cement</b> <b>dermatitis</b> in construction workers...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Cement {{has long}} been known as a cause of both {{irritant}} and allergic contact dermatitis. However, there are little data relating to occupational skin diseases (OSD) in the Iranian construction industry. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the epidemiology of <b>cement</b> <b>dermatitis</b> among terrazzo and cement manufactory workers. Methods: This is cross-sectional descriptive study. In this study 50 cement manufact-ory workers in Shahroud and 150 terrazzo workers in Lordegan were interviewed through questionnaire. Questionnaire includes demographic characteristics and questions about present dermatitis, background eczema, daily work hours, exposed chemical agents, using of gloves. Patients examined and patch tested by dermatologist. Data analyzed with SPSS software and c 2, Mann Whitney and logistic regression statistical test. Results: The findings of the study showed that 8 workers (16 %) in cement factories and 52 workers (34. 7 %) in Lordegan terrazzo enterprises had reported dermatitis at the time of review. Of which 15. 5 % in terrazzo workers had allergic contact dermatitis. In this study the prevalence of <b>cement</b> <b>dermatitis</b> increased with increasing age and there was significantly differences between dermatitis and background of dermatitis in terrazzo workers (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Cement should be treated as hazardous materials, wearing of suitable gloves, early diagnosis and treatment of contact dermatitis and health education to workers is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Occupational <b>dermatitis</b> among <b>cement</b> {{workers is}} a major {{occupational}} health concern. The two most important occupational hazards for cement workers are irritant and allergic <b>cement</b> contact <b>dermatitis.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the severity of occupational <b>cement</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> and the common allergens among cement workers in Taiwan. Methods: A total of 97 cement workers from the Cement Workers’ Association of Tainan City and County participated in this study. A structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic data and work-related activities of these cement workers. A complete skin examination was conducted, and skin manifestations were assessed by a dermatologist. Allergens from European Standard Tray (Chemotechnique Diagnostic AB, Sweden) with a total of 25 substances were used for patch testing. Results: Our results showed that 65 out of 97 cement workers were suffering from occupational <b>cement</b> hand contact <b>dermatitis.</b> The most affected skin area was the hand. Thickening of the dorsal surface of the hand, especially around the metacarpophalangeal joint area, and hyperkeratosis of the palm were the major skin manifestations. The results of the patch test showed that 24 out of 97 were allergic to potassium dichromate, nine were allergic to thiuram mix, nine were allergic to fragrance mix and seven were allergic to cobalt chloride. The final diagnosis, based on the results of the skin examination and the patch test, showed that 43 of 97 cement workers had irritant <b>cement</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> and 22 had allergic <b>cement</b> contact <b>dermatitis.</b> Conclusion: We conclude that occupational <b>cement</b> hand <b>dermatitis</b> among <b>cement</b> workers is an important and severe issue in Taiwan, and the most common allergens among cement workers are potassium dichromate, thiuram mix, fragrance mix and cobalt chloride. The high positive rate of chromium hypersensitivity among cement workers reflects the urgency to regulate the addition of ferrous sulfate to cement in Taiwan...|$|R

An Act of August 1936 extended to workers in general supplementary allowances that had previously been confined to workers injured in accidents prior to the 9th of January 1927. An order dealing with rescue equipment in mines was issued on 19 August 1936, followed by two orders concerning packing and caving on 25 February 1937. In relation to maritime transport, a Decree of 3 March 1937 issued instructions concerning safety. A decree of the 18th of June 1937 promulgated the Convention “concerning the marking of the weight on heavy packages transported by vessels which was adopted by the International Labour Conference at Geneva in 1929.” ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Due {{to recent}} {{industrialization}} and inadequately protected workers {{or in other}} words poor supervision on constructive workers habits in our large city of Isfahan <b>cement</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> is relatively high especially among cement factory workers and constructive personnel. PURPOSES: To investigate the prevalence rate of <b>cement</b> contact <b>dermatitis</b> in <b>cement</b> factory workers in Isfahan. METHODS: A case-control clinical study {{was carried out by}} randomly selecing 150 factory workders and 150 official clerks in a cement factory in Isfahan in 2001. After a complete physical examination, data was recorded in observational checklists. FINDINGS: The percentages of contact dermatitis prevalences in the first and the second groups were 22 &#x 0025; and 5. 3 &#x 0025; respectively. About 60 &#x 0025; of cement workers with contact dermatitis were between 30 - 40 years of age. There was a direct relationship with age in both groups of the workers. In the high-exposure group, the hand eczema along was 70 &#x 0025; but in the other group the percentage of involvement was the same in exposed and unexposed anatomical areas. CONCLUSIONS: There was a direct relationship between occurrence and the severity of involvement and duration of contact in the first group. Cent percent of cement workers had contact dermatitis after 10 or less years, but the percentage among the other group was 35 &#x 0025;. LIMITATION: Irritant contact <b>dermatitis</b> to <b>cement</b> has not been detected...|$|R
40|$|EN] One of the {{problems}} that some industries, and more specifically cement industries, still have to deal with is the requirement to determine and control the content of some chromium, nickel and cobalt compounds due to their allergenic effects on human health (mainly <b>cement</b> <b>dermatitis).</b> This paper focuses on the quantification of total and soluble chromium, nickel and cobalt content in different materials used normally in the manufacturing of Spanish commercial cements (limestone, clay minerals, raws and clinkers). These materials belong to three different cement factories, which could be representative of Spanish Portland cements. This study is a follow-up of a previous research carried out by the same authors, which provides a valuable contribution to establish possible limitations of these allergenic compounds in future national as well as international standards.

40|$|Abstract: Chromium {{is widely}} used in various {{industries}} including construction sector. Skin contact with cement {{has been associated with}} allergic or irritant contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis {{is one of the most}} frequently reported health problems among construction workers. Irritant contact <b>dermatitis</b> from <b>cement</b> ranges from cement burns to cumulative irritant contact <b>dermatitis.</b> <b>Cement</b> burns are rarely reported and are considered a severe form of acute irritant contact dermatitis. They are associated with amateur user working in a short ready-mix timeframe with poor protective measures. They usually result in significant morbidity and initially are associated with minimal discomfort. We report a typical case. Key words: Caustic ulcers, Cement aqua, Occupational injury Cement is the leading cause of occupational skin disease in the construction industry 1), mostly due to contact allergy.
