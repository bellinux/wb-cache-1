5000|$|Inset door face-frame cabinetry. A special, and unconventional, {{category}} of framed cabinets {{is represented by}} those with inset doors. An inset-mounted cabinet door is fitted to the frame {{in the same way}} as a typical room door is fitted to the doorway; such doors fit into a frame when closed. (Full-size doors do not simply cover the opening between rooms or at an entrance to a building.) Inset doors require more precise alignment of each door to the <b>containing</b> <b>frame.</b> Further, this alignment must be maintained with use. Upon opening or closing, inset doors are gently braked by the air cushion trapped between the door and frame. This desirable feature is one hallmark of high-quality inset door construction. Frameless or full-overlay face-frame construction can superficially resemble inset construction when doors are designed to fit closely within a cavity formed by surrounding doors, drawers, and/or an adjacent countertop.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{frame and}} symbol synchronization, and digital {{automatic gain control}} (AGC) for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based wireless LAN (WLAN) defined in IEEE 802. 11 a had been proposed. The architecture <b>contains</b> <b>frame</b> detection, symbol timing estimation and signal power estimation. The estimated signal power {{can be used in}} AGC. The proposed method enables a rapid and accurate synchronization even under very low SNR and multi-path fading channel by using ten short training symbols at the start of every frame. 1...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is proposed for efficiently splicing two MPEG coded video streams. The algorithm only processes the portion of each video stream that <b>contains</b> <b>frames</b> affected by the splice and it operates directly on the DCT coefficients and motion vectors of those frames. The algorithm achieves good visual performance with very low computational complexity, and incorporates rate control to prevent buffer underflow and overflow. If additional processing power is available, {{it can be used}} to further improve the quality of the spliced stream...|$|R
