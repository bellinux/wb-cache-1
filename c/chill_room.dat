40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{occurrence}} of thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella in a sheep slaughterhouse in Brandenburg, Germany. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate, how these zoonotic agents are distributed within the slaughterhouse and the processing line. Simultaneously, an interrelation between slaughterhouse and the relevant sheep farms was to investigate. Investigations were carried out from July 2008 to August 2009. A total of 423 samples was obtained from 14 excursions. 320 samples using excision method at four process positions of the line, five points of the carcass (before depelting, after depelting, after evisceration and at chilling) and 103 environmental swab samples (floor of the lairage stable floor, fleece depelting machine, deposition board of carcasses after removing the fleece, doorknobs as well as wall of the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> and knifes) were collected. The excision samples were analysed for Aerobic Plate Count (APC) and Enterobacteriaceae Count (EC) and all samples qualitative for Campylobacter, Listeria, E. coli, Salmonella and Yersinia. Campylobacter and E. coli isolates were characterized by PFGE (Kpn I enzyme) and PCR respectively. Results: Hygiene For excision samples the mean APC (log 10 CFU/cm 2) was 3. 79, the mean EC (log 10 CFU/cm 2) was 1. 58. An increase in the number of bacteria during the process untill chilling was observed (process position 4). The microbiological carriage of the carcasses for APC and EB was significantly different depending upon the process position. Zoonotic agents Thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria spp. and E. coli were identified with an average of 20. 1 %, 11. 1 % and 60. 1 % of all samples respectively. Yersinia enterocolitica and Salmonella were not found in any sample here. Campylobacter was detected in 20. 1 % (85 of 423) by conventional technique, the highest detection rate was obtained in samples from lairage stable floor samples (68. 2 %). Campylobacter was not detected in sterilisation bassins, at doorknobs or on the walls in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room.</b> The highest findings on the carcasses was in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (27. 5 %) (process position 4). The Campylobacter isolates were differentiated using conventional and PCR technique: C. jejuni (71. 3 % / 55. 7 %), C. coli (23. 8 % / 11. 4 %) and C. lari (5. 0 % / 14. 8 %) were detected. Listeria was detected in 11. 1 % (47 of 423) of samples, mostly in samples from lairage stable floor samples (27. 3 %). Listeria was not detected in sterilisation bassins, on doorknobs, at the wall in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> or on the deposition board of carcasses after depelting. The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found before depelting (12. 5 %) and in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (12. 5 %). Listeria isolates were L. ivanovii (57. 4 %; 27 of 47), L. denitrificans (27. 7 %; 13 of 47), L. monocytogenes (8. 5; 4 out of 47 %) and L. innocua (2. 1 %; 1 of 47) were found. E. coli was detected in 60. 1 % (254 of 423) of all samples, most of them were from the samples of the lairage stable floor and fleece depelting machine (100. 0 % each). The highest prevalence on the carcasses was found in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> (72. 5 %). For Campylobacter isolates using PFGE, a relationship between some sample qualities was observed: Within particular excursions and also for different ones, the patterns of PFGE indicate the same genetic sequences of Campylobacter. Hence, transfer of Campylobacter from farm in to the slaughterhouse and the meat production process can not be excluded. In conclusion, thermophilic Campylobacter, Listeria and E. coli were identified on carcasses and in environmental samples especially in the lairage stable floor samples. A transfer of these pathogens from the farms to the slaughterhouse can be assumed...|$|R

40|$|Temperature {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors that affect quality and shelf life aspects of meat products. Hence meat industries start controlling temperature of the meat soon after slaughter. A common way of controlling meat temperature for commercial purpose is by chilling the meat at the carcasses stage in a <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> in which cold air circulates. After slaughter, in muscle cells biochemical reactions continue to produce energy substrates like adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the postmortem muscle activities. The hydrolysis of ATP in turn produces heat, which can raise muscle temperature a couple of degrees above the initial body temperature of the animal, and hydrogen ions, which reduce the pH of the muscles. Thus in practice, the heat load during beef carcass chilling consists of the original body heat of the carcass and the heat that is produced due to biochemical reactions. To achieve the desired meat quality and shelf life, the rate of heat removal from a carcass during chilling needs to be controlled in such a way that the pH fall has a desired rate, while inhibiting the growth of microorganisms on the surface. At low cooling rates the glycolysis rate remains high for a longer time. The associated production of hydrogen ions favors a faster pH decline than at high cooling rates. The combination of low pH and high temperature has negative consequences on specific meat quality traits such as color. In large beef carcasses, such as is the case for the double-muscled Belgian Blue breed, it has been observed that important temperature gradients can develop during cooling which results in spatial differences in final meat quality of muscles from a single carcass. Due to the complexity of the heat and mass transfer and muscle reaction kinetics during cooling, understanding of the cooling process is limited and it has been difficult to determine experimentally more optimal cooling procedures. The main objective of this thesis was, therefore, to develop a mathematical model that calculates the temperature and pH distribution inside a beef carcass during cooling in a <b>chiller</b> <b>room.</b> The model includes the different relevant heat and mass transfer mechanisms coupled to a simple kinetics model that predicts postmortem glycogen conversion, heat production and pH fall. The model was validated for chilling of Belgian Blue beef carcasses as affected by temperature, relative humidity and air velocity in the <b>chiller</b> <b>room.</b> The coupled model was then used for exploring different cooling scenarios. The kinetics model was developed for the muscle energy metabolism in postmortem conditions. A single equation model described the glycogen conversion using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The model parameters were identified using pH and temperature measurements conducted on inner and outer positions of M. biceps femoris of large Belgian Blue carcasses at different commercial slaughterhouses and for two distinct cooling rates. The developed kinetics model was then integrated with a computational fluid dynamics model (CFD) to predict changes in temperature, pH and heat generation rate during the chilling of beef carcasses. The chilling model accounted for the slaughter floor environment and <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> conditions and was solved on the 3 D geometry of a beef carcass obtained by digital scanning. A three-step approach was followed for the <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> simulation. In the first step, a steady state simulation of the airflow and thermal field around the carcass was done. From this simulation, local convective transfer coefficients (CTCs) on the carcass surface were determined in a second step. In the third step, these CTCs were used to perform a transient heat conduction simulation within the carcass itself, including also glucose conversion, pH evolution and internal heat production. The <b>chiller</b> <b>room</b> conditions (velocity, temperature and relative humidity) were measured and used as inputs for the CFD model. The measured carcass temperature at various depths and sections was used for model validation. The temperature predictions agreed with the measured temperature profiles at different positions inside the carcass, with better prediction in deeper positions as compared to near surface positions. The simulations unveiled large differences in cooling rates and pH evolution between different parts of the carcass. The commercial slaughterhouse considered for the above simulations was the conventional chilling system where the carcasses are directly railed from slaughter floor to the <b>chiller</b> <b>room.</b> However, modern slaughterhouses operate by including a pre-chilling stage, for the purpose of extracting the initial heat load and quickly reducing surface temperature. Model based optimization was performed to identify optimum operating conditions for different chilling practices in slaughterhouses with both pre-chilling and chilling stages. The chilling practices were categorized based on the weight given to the output variables (energy consumption, weight loss, cooling time and heat shortening duration) during the chilling operation. The values of these output variables depend on the input variables air temperature, air velocity and pre-chilling time at pre-chilling stage. The study indicated that optimum operation conditions in slaughterhouse depend on the nature of the cost variable that the operator wants to minimize and are a trade-off between adverse effects on energy use and quality. status: publishe...|$|R

These included plants processing raw meat and salads, Chinese ready meals, dairy products, slicing and packing of cooked meats and catering establishments. An initial survey of total numbers of microbes at a total of 891 sites on evaporators, drip trays and <b>chilled</b> <b>room</b> walls was followed up with a more detailed examination of 336 sites with high counts, selecting for Listeria spp., coliforms, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Temperatures (particularly air on and air off, maximum and near defrost heaters) relative humidity, airflow, layout and cleaning regimes were surveyed. In general, no correlation could be found between any of the physical measurements and the numbers and types of bacteria detected. Maximum mean temperatures in the <b>chilled</b> <b>rooms</b> varied from - 1 to + 16. 9 °C and few chilled units were regularly cleaned. Twenty five percent of sites examined had more than 105 colony-forming units per cm 2, although, very few pathogens or faecal indicator bacteria were detected. Listeria spp. were not found and coliforms were found only once, in low numbers. Low numbers of S. aureus or B. cereus were present in 9 of the 15 plants, B. cereus was found on evaporators and associated drip trays in two catering plants and two plants processing cooked meat. Enterococci and S. aureus were found most frequently in a raw red meat slaughterhouse (always in low numbers). In general, microbial contamination was lower in rooms where wrapped rather than unwrapped products were stored. The type of product also affected the degree of contamination, with raw red meat and poultry or dry ingredients giving highest counts, and raw vegetables and cooked products lowest. The work demonstrated that bacteria were present on evaporator cooling coils in all factory cold rooms visited. Although evaporator-cleaning procedures were carried out in some factories as part of routine maintenance these were not shown to be effective at maintaining low levels of bacteria on evaporators. To maintain evaporator hygiene {{it is suggested that}} more regular cleaning procedures, possibly by means of automated cleansing systems, should be considered. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The salt contents of ham from YBD were higher than those from YLD (p< 0. 05). YBD ham samples showed a higher L* and b* values than those from YLD, while YBD ham showed lower a* value (p< 0. 05). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) values of YLD hams were lower than those of YBD samples (p< 0. 05). Hardness, gumminess, chewiness, and shear force values of YBD ham were higher than those of YLD sample (p< 0. 05). Saltiness was significantly higher in YBD ham than in YLD samples (p< 0. 05). YLD ham displayed a superior quality than YBD. Considering the meat quality parameters of two-way crossbred ham, YLD hams could be more suitable for the production of dry-cured products...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to study {{chilling}} of beef carcasses in on-farm slaughterhouses in Sweden. Two approaches to evaluate the chilling process were used. Firstly, continuous measurements of surface temperatures on individual carcasses and, secondly, a recent Australian method in which temperature readings were combined with a predictive microbiology growth model. In the Australian method the potential growth of Escherichia coli during chilling is calculated based on the growth rate estimated by the growth model at the measured temperatures. The potential growth during the chilling process is the expressed as a refrigeration index, RI, which is the log 10 of the potential increase of the number of E. coli bacteria during chilling. In addition, a simple tool, i. e. an Excel spreadsheet, was developed and evaluated. The tool enables an estimation of the cooling capacity needed for chilling beef, lamb, or swine. The primary purpose of the tool is to indicate the required cooling capacity in planned slaughterhouses based on drawings and slaughter volumes. The present study only considered aspects of chilling related to food safety. Eleven slaughterhouses participated in the survey, and chilling of a total of 169 carcasses, ranging from 4 to 10 per occasion, were measured. The total number of carcasses in the <b>chilling</b> <b>room</b> ranged from 4 to 26 per occasion. The results indicate that in general chilling of beef carcasses in the slaughterhouses is satisfactory...|$|R
