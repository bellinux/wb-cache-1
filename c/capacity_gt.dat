40|$|With the {{significant}} decrease in natural gas prices {{in many parts of}} the world, the employment of gas turbine (GT) units has increased steadily in recent years. The ever-increasing deployment of GT units is strengthening the interconnections between electric power and natural gas systems, which could provide a higher level of operational flexibility and reliability. As a result, the planning and operation issues in the interconnected electric power and natural gas systems have aroused concern. In these circumstances, the impacts of increasing deployment of GT units in power system operation are studied and evaluated through well-being analysis (WBA). The fast responsive characteristics of GT units are analyzed first, and the definition and adaption of WBA in a power system with increasing deployment of GT units are addressed. Then the equivalent reserve <b>capacity</b> of <b>GT</b> units is estimated, taking demand fluctuations, commitment plans, and operational risks of GT units into account. The WBA of a power system with increasing deployment of GT units is conducted considering the uncertainties of system operation states and renewable energy sources. Finally, the proposed methods are validated through an integrated version of the IEEE 118 -bus power system and a 10 -bus natural gas system, and the impacts of GT units on power system security under various penetration levels are examined. Simulation results demonstrate that the role of a GT unit as a low-cost electricity producer may conflict with its role as a reserve provider, but through maintaining a proper proportion of idle <b>GT</b> <b>capacities</b> for reserve, the well-being performance of the power system concerned can be significantly improved...|$|R

The study included 56 patients with FD (M[*]:[*]F ratio[*]=[*] 0. 65) and 185 healthy individuals. Complete standard laboratory and clinical work-up was performed on all subjects, together with the determination of total peroxyl radical-scavenging <b>capacity.</b> The (<b>GT)</b> n and (TA) n dinucleotide variations in the HMOX 1 and UGT 1 A 1 gene promoters, respectively, were determined by DNA fragment analysis. Compared to controls, patients with FD had substantially lower serum bilirubin levels (12. 0 versus 8. 85 [*]μmol/L, p= 0. 003) and also total antioxidant capacity (p< 0. 05), which showed a close positive relationship with serum bilirubin levels (p= 0. 067) and the use of enzyme replacement therapy (p= 0. 036). There was no association between HMOX 1 gene promoter polymorphism and manifestation of FD. However, the presence of the TA 7 allele UGT 1 A 1 gene promoter, responsible for higher systemic bilirubin levels, was associated with a twofold lower risk of manifestation of FD (OR[*]=[*] 0. 51, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 27 – 0. 97, p= 0. 038).

40|$|Protein folding in {{the cell}} {{involves}} the action of different molecular chaperones and folding-facilitating enzymes. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the folding status of glycoproteins is stringently controlled by a glucosyltranferase enzyme (GT) that creates monoglucosylated structures recognized by ER resident lectins (calnexin/calreticulin, CNX/CRT). GT serves as a folding sensor because it only glucosylates misfolded or partly folded glycoproteins. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism behind this recognition process remains largely unknown. In this paper we explore the structural determinants for GT recognition by using a single domain model protein. For this purpose we used a family of chemically glycosylated proteins derived from chymotrypsin inhibitor- 2 as GT substrates. Structural characterization of species showing higher glucose acceptor <b>capacity</b> suggests that <b>GT</b> recognizes solvent accessible hydrophobic patches in molten globule-like conformers mimicking intermediate folding stages of nascent glycoproteins. It was further confirmed that BiP (binding protein, a chaperone of the heat shock protein 70 family) preferentially recognized neoglycoproteins displaying extended conformations, thus providing a molecular rationale for the sequential BiP-CNX/CRT interaction with folding glycoproteins observed in vivo...|$|R
50|$|Most CCS {{projects}} include adding capture to {{an existing}} power plant, usually coal or another fossil fuel. With complete capture, these processes would be carbon neutral. Decatur, Illinois in the United States has many corn plants run by Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), where corn is processed into syrups and ethanol. The plant emits high amounts {{of carbon dioxide}} as a byproduct of the process. With the CCS fitting, the plant ideally becomes carbon negative, since corn absorbs carbon dioxide when it grows, and all the carbon dioxide produced during processing is being captured and sequestered in the Mount Simon sandstone. The project cannot be completely carbon negative, as carbon dioxide is produced during the combustion of the ethanol that is being produced. The project {{is one of the}} only CCS projects in use to not be coupled with EOR.

A new Nordic expertise centre for CCS named NORDICCS will {{in the coming years}} attempt to improve the mapping of CO 2 storage sites and storage capacity estimations within the Nordic region. Preliminary results indicate that large sedimentary basins in the Baltic Sea, the Skagerrak area, the North Sea and the area offshore mid-Norway will be able to store large amounts of CO 2 in deep saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields. In addition early research results from Iceland indicate a large potential for in-situ mineralisation of CO 2 in porous basalts, and a minor potential for mineral trapping in ultramafic rocks in Finland.

40|$|The {{principal}} goal of Group Testing (GT) is {{to identify}} a small subset of "defective" items from a large population, by grouping items into as few test pools as possible. The test outcome of a pool is positive if it contains at least one defective item, and is negative otherwise. GT algorithms are utilized in numerous applications, and in many of them maintaining {{the privacy of the}} tested items, namely, keeping secret whether they are defective or not, is critical. In this paper, we consider a scenario where there is an eavesdropper (Eve) who is able to observe a subset of the GT outcomes (pools). We propose a new non-adaptive Secure Group Testing (SGT) algorithm based on information-theoretic principles, which keeps the eavesdropper ignorant regarding the items' status. Specifically, when the fraction of tests observed by Eve is 0 ≤δ < 1, we prove that the number of tests required for both correct reconstruction at the legitimate user (with high probability) and negligible information leakage to Eve is 1 / 1 -δ times the number of tests required with no secrecy constraint for fixed K regime. By a matching converse, we completely characterize the Secure <b>GT</b> <b>capacity.</b> Moreover, we consider a computationally efficient decoding algorithm, and prove that for δ < 1 / 2 the number of tests required, without any constraint on K, is at most 1 / 1 / 2 -δ times the number of tests required with no secrecy constraint...|$|R
40|$|The storage {{potential}} of selected sites within the Bohai Basin was assessed for the COACH project. The Gangdong oilfield {{is considered to}} have a small potential storage capacity (23 Mt) and to be possibly suitable for an enhanced oil recovery or small-scale storage pilot rather than large-scale storage. The Shengli oilfield province is considered {{to have a great}} potential storage capacity (472 Mt in eight selected fields), however, these fields, like those of the Gangdong oilfield province, are compartmentalised by faulting and stratigraphy and likely to be quite challenging for injection. Unmineable coal seams in the Kailuan mining area were also considered for storage, the estimated <b>capacity</b> is 504 <b>Gt</b> adsorbed onto the coal and 38, 100 Mt void storage capacity. However, the coals have low porosity and permeability, so they would be expected to have poor injectivity. This is also an active mining area and so any storage site would have to be chosen carefully to avoid affecting future energy resources. The Huimin sub-basin within the Jiyang Depression was identified for consideration as an aquifer storage site; the Guantao Formation has good porosity and permeability in this region, and the regional-level storage capacity of these areas was estimated to be 0. 7 Gt. The aquifers in the Huimin sub-basin appear promising for storage, however, less data are available than for the oilfields and the sealing formations are not directly proven to trap buoyant fluids, though in adjacent oilfield in the Shengli oilfield province, the Minghuazhen Formation forms a regional seal for the Guantao Formation. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 3 -year binational effort {{between the}} United States and Canada was {{initiated}} {{to characterize the}} lowermost saline system in the northern Great Plains–Prairie region of North America and determine its CO 2 storage capacity. This saline system covers an area of 1. 34 million km 2 from northern South Dakota in the United States to central Alberta and Saskatchewan in Canada. This basal system, overlain mostly by shales and comprising Middle Cambrian to Ordovician sandstones and carbonates that overlie the crystalline Precambrian basement, crops out in recharge areas in South Dakota and Montana and in discharge areas in Manitoba. Pressures in the system follow a gradient of 10. 8 kPa/m. Temperatures vary from greater than 150 °C in the deepest {{part of the system}} to less than 10 °C in outcrop areas. Water salinity ranges from greater than 300, 000 mg/L in central Alberta and in North Dakota to less than 10, 000 mg/L in recharge and discharge areas. Porosity varies from less than 1 % in very deep regions to more than 25 % in shallower regions. The area of the basal saline system suitable for CO 2 storage was determined using the following criteria: a) CO 2 should be stored at a distance greater than 20 km from the 10, 000 mg/L water salinity isoline, to protect groundwater resources; b) porosity should be greater than 4 %, to ensure storage capacity and injectivity; and c) CO 2 should be always in dense phase. The storage capacity {{in the area of the}} saline system thus determined as suitable for CO 2 storage was estimated using thickness, porosity, and CO 2 density calculated at in situ conditions, and a storage efficiency coefficient of 2. 4 %, resulting in a storage <b>capacity</b> of 113 <b>Gt</b> CO 2 with P 50 confidence...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} for a fisheries research vessel to reduce the underwater-radiated noise. In 1995, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) firstly recommended the maximum noise level for research vessels to ensure the acoustic research works and to prevent the fish reaction against the noise 1). Since then, {{it has been the}} world standard for the design of fisheries research vessels. For a small size vessel, however, {{it is very difficult to}} achieve the recommendations because of not enough space or capacity to make sound insulations. Moreover, the Froude number (Fn) of such small vessels tends to be higher than that of the larger vessels. Since the higher Froude number of the operating condition causes the large wave-making resistance, both propeller thrust and occurrence of cavitation increase, which tends to result in the higher level of underwater-radiated noise. Meanwhile, the fisheries research-cost can be reduced by using a small vessel, because not only the construction and operation cost, but also maintenance cost become lower than those of a large vessel. It would be desirable and efficient if a small vessel could satisfy the ICES's recommendation in place of a large research vessel. In this paper, the authors propose a design method for a small research vessel to reduce the underwater-radiated noise level. Utilizing this method, a small fisheries research vessel whose <b>capacity</b> is 290 <b>GT</b> and length is 33. 5 m has been designed. From the sea trials after the construction, it has been proved successfully that the underwaterradiated noise level is the world lowest class at 10 knots (Fn= 0. 28) of researching speed and still satisfies the ICES's recommendation even in 11. 6 knots (Fn= 0. 33) of the high-speed region...|$|R
40|$|Guayusa tea, {{an extract}} of the Ilex guayusa plant, is ritualistically {{consumed}} by the Runa tribes of Ecuador. It {{is known for its}} healing abilities and for giving lucid dreams as well as being used by the Amaguajes Indians of South America to treat diabetes and has been shown to retard the development of steptozocin-induced diabetes in mice. Guayusa tea is now commercially available as Runa tea and in select areas of the USA as tea bags or iced tea. Guayusa tea has not been scientifically evaluated, or compared with more popular commercialised tea brands such as Camellia sinensis black tea (BT), green tea (GT) and Aspalathus linearis rooibos tea (RT), regarding possible health benefits. The aim {{of this study is to}} address this limitation in knowledge regarding the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of this tea. Chemical evaluation was performed according to the International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) approved methods. Methanol extracts of commercially available guyasa tea and crushed factory leaves of fermented and unfermented guaysua tea was compared to nine brands of black and green Camellia sinensis tea brands. Antioxidant reducing capacity was observed with the use of an ISO-approved Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) method. To elaborate on findings antioxidant activity were further evaluated using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhyrazyl (DPPH) and oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC) assays. The methods that involve an electron transfer mode of action such as the F-C, TEAC and DPPH showed antioxidant activity of all samples of guayusa tea to be significantly lower than all Camellia sinensis brands evaluated. In contrast the results obtained from the ORAC assay, which involves a hydrogen atom transfer mode of action showed that guayusa tea had statistically similar antioxidant <b>capacity</b> to <b>GT</b> and BT Camellia sinensis brands. To assess the possible health benefits associated with guayusa tea, water extracts of commercial and crushed black and green factory guaysa tea leaves were analysed and compared to BT, GT (Camellia sinensis) and RT (Aspalathus linearis) of the same brand with the F-C and ORAC assays. The health benefits were further evaluated in cellular models. The dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay was used to evaluate cellular antioxidant activity in the SC- 1 and Caco- 2 cell lines. LPS-stimulated RAW 267. 9 cells were used to evaluate the nitric oxide (NO) scavenging properties of the tea extracts in a cellular environment. Cell viability was determined with the 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. With the F-C reducing and the ORAC assay, the antioxidant activity of all guayusa tea samples were significantly lower than BT and GT, but similar to RT. Similar results were obtained for he NO scavenging activity. With regards to the cell culture-based assays, in both SC- 1 and Caco- 2 cell lines the DCFH-DA assay showed that guayusa had similar cellular protective effects to BT and GT, and higher than RT. For the NO suppressing assay in the RAW 264. 7 cell line, guayusa tea showed similar results to BT, GT and RT. In this study, Ilex guaysa extracts were shown to have antioxidant, cellular protective and anti-inflammatory properties. In some instances, such as with the ORAC assay conducted on alcohol extracts, guyausa tea showed antioxidant activity similar to that of BT and GT. Water extracts had antioxidant activity (F-C and ORAC assay) less than GT and BT but greater than RT. In contrast in cell model systems the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of guayusa tea related to NO scavenging was similar to GT and BT. Overall, in a non-cellular setting, guayusa tea provides little antioxidant activity, especially when compared with Camellia sinensis tea, widely known for its antioxidant and health benefits. However, when exposed to a cellular environment, guayusa tea performs similarly to Camellia sinensis tea in terms of antioxidant acitivity which suggests that it may have health benefits in a biological system which can be more profoundly assessed and elaborated in future studies.

40|$|AbstractThe BASTOR project {{identifies}} and {{characterizes the}} potential CO 2 storage {{sites in the}} southern Baltic Sea. A regional theoretical storage <b>capacity</b> of 16 <b>Gt</b> of CO 2 in the Middle Cambrian sandstone beneath 900 meters of cap rock was estimated. 1. 9 Gt of this storage potential is estimated in the Dalders Monocline with some 743 Mt CO 2 in individual hydrocarbon and saline aquifer structures located mainly offshore Latvia and 128 Mt in the Dalders Structure. Although the study has established a relatively large theoretical storage capacity no effective capacity proven within these totals. Dynamic modelling undertaken in the Southern Swedish sector suggests that the relatively poor permeability and porosity characteristics would limit the injection rate to 0. 5 Mt per well per annum and restrict the reservoir pressure increase to 50 % above the hydrostatic pressure for an injection period of 50 years. The dynamic modelling for this area suggests that an injection strategy for this sector {{would be limited to}} 5 injection wells giving a total injection capacity of 2. 5 Mt per annum. Based on these results, the potential of the Southern Swedish offshore sector to sustain injection rates of CO 2 required for regional industrial capture, even when using horizontal wells, brine extraction and hydraulic fracturing, would appear to be very low. Areas to the north east of the Monocline, such as offshore Latvia have been identified as having better reservoir quality despite limited data being available. These areas could sustain higher rates of injection and prove suitable areas for commercial storage. Furthermore, the regional storage capacity assessment demonstrated that there are sweet spots in the Cambrian reservoir such as onshore Latvia, where there is commercial gas storage, and both onshore and offshore Kaliningrad, where there is ongoing hydrocarbon production. The potential for seal failure was investigated as part of the BASTOR study and three possible modes of seal failure were identified. These include top seal failure, migration up the bounding fault planes and leakage across fault planes. The risk associated with all of these is considered low, based on currently available data. A test injection methodology aimed at assessing the commercial viability of CO 2 injection in the Baltic Sea region has been designed. This includes the characterization of reservoir, caprock and hydraulic properties, pump testing as well as CO 2 migration and trapping using a phased approach methodology. An outline MMV program has been developed {{based on the results of}} the dynamic modelling and the development phases of a CO 2 injection site. Since the potential to store significant quantities of CO 2 in the Swedish part of the Dalders Monocline appears to be limited, exploration efforts and the acquisition of new, site specific data through geophysical surveys, drilling and injection testing as well as detailed sampling and laboratory analyses, should be focused on areas of better reservoir qualities than the current study area. New data covering the north eastern portion of the Dalders Monocline, in particular offshore Latvia and onshore as well as offshore Kaliningrad, would allow a detailed characterization of individual potential sites for CO 2 storage. This would also define site-specific seal integrity as well as characterize small-scale fault structures that would ultimately dictate the potential injection and storage conditions...|$|R
