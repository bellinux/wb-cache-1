25|$|The {{conformal}} latitude {{defines a}} transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius {{such that the}} angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid {{is the same as}} the corresponding angle on the sphere (so that the shape of small elements is well preserved). A further <b>conformal</b> <b>transformation</b> from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane. This is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection. For example, the 'exact' version of the Transverse Mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection. (It does, however, involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex plane).|$|E

2500|$|In the {{two-dimensional}} realm, {{a number}} of Panel Codes {{have been developed for}} airfoil analysis and design. [...] The codes typically have a boundary layer analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled. [...] Professor Richard Eppler of the University of Stuttgart developed the PROFILE code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s. [...] This was soon followed by MIT Professor Mark Drela's XFOIL code. Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work.

40|$|In this paper, three {{methods for}} {{describing}} the <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> of the S-matrix in {{quantum field theory}} are proposed. They are illustrated by applying the algebraic renormalization procedure to the quantum scalar field theory, defined by the LSZ reduction mechanism in the BPHZ renormalization scheme. Central results are shown to be independent of scheme choices and derived to all orders in loop expansions. Firstly, the local Callan-Symanzik equation is constructed, in which the insertion of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor {{is related to the}} beta function and the anomalous dimension. With this result, the Ward identities for the <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> of the Green functions are derived. Then the <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> of the S-matrix defined by the LSZ reduction procedure are calculated. Secondly, the <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> of the S-matrix in the functional formalism are related to charge constructions. The commutators between the charges and the S-matrix operator are in a compact way to represent the <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> of the S-matrix. Lastly, the massive scalar field theory with local coupling is introduced in order to control breaking of the conformal invariance further. The <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> of the S-matrix with local coupling are calculated...|$|R

40|$|<b>Conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> play a {{widespread}} role in gravity theories {{in regard to}} their cosmological and other implications. In the pure metric theory of gravity, <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> change the frame to a new one wherein one obtains a conformal-invariant scalar-tensor theory such that the scalar field, deriving from the conformal factor, is a ghost. In this work, <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> and ghosts will be analyzed {{in the framework of}} the metric-affine theory of gravity. Within this framework, metric and connection are independent variables, and hence, transform independently under <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations.</b> It will be shown that, if affine connection is invariant under <b>conformal</b> <b>transformations</b> then the scalar field under concern is a non-ghost, non-dynamical field. It is an auxiliary field at the classical level, and might develop a kinetic term at the quantum level. Alternatively, if connection transforms additively with a structure similar to yet more general than that of the Levi-Civita connection, the resulting action describes the gravitational dynamics correctly, and more importantly, the scalar field becomes a dynamical non-ghost field. The equations of motion, for generic geometrical and matter-sector variables, do not reduce connection to the Levi-Civita connection, and hence, independence of connection from metric is maintained. Therefore, metric-affine gravity provides an arena in which ghosts arising from conformal factor are avoided thanks to the independence of connection from the metric. Comment: 12 p...|$|R
