Using Structural Funds data for each <b>cohesion</b> <b>objective</b> over 1989 - 99, we examine which variables, economic and political, determine the actual funds allocation. We test our hypotheses with a Tobit model that accounts for the two-stage allocation process and our limited dependent variables.

40|$|Policy {{decisions}} on transport infrastructure investments often require knowledge of welfare effects generated from using these infrastructures on a detailed regional level. This is in particular true for the EU initiative promoting {{the development of}} the trans-European transport (TEN-T) networks. As projects within this initiative affect regions in different countries, incentive compatible financing schemes cannot be designed without knowing where the benefits accrue. Furthermore, this initiative is also intended to contribute to the <b>cohesion</b> <b>objective</b> on a community scale, and only with regional impact studies one can assess to which extent these objectives are attained. As standard cost-benefit analysis is unable to assign benefits to eventual beneficiaries in the economy, we develop and apply a spatial computable general equilibrium (SCGE) model as a suitable alternative. The model has a household sector and a production sector with two industries, one producing local goods, the other producing tradables. Regions interact through costly trade, with trade costs depending, among others, {{on the state of the}} infrastructure. New links reduce trade costs, which changes trade flows, production, goods prices and factor prices and thus eventually the welfare of households in different regions. We present the formal structure of the model, the calibration procedure and the data sources for calibrating the model and estimating the trade cost reductions stemming from new transport links. As the model is only able to quantify effects related to trade in goods we also suggest a simplified approach to add effects stemming from passenger transport. We apply the methods to a policy experiment related to the TEN-T priority list of projects. We quantify project by project the social return, check whether significant benefit spillovers to countries not involved in financing might prevent realization of projects in spite of their respective profitability from European wide point of view, and finally we evaluate the contribution of each project to the spatial <b>cohesion</b> <b>objective.</b> Our results confirm sceptical views on EU involvement in infrastructure policy that have been expressed in the literature.

40|$|The {{conflict}} of efficiency vs. <b>cohesion</b> <b>objectives</b> {{is of particular}} interest in the transport planning field. If the only objective was the maximization of economic growth, the 'most efficient' policy would attempt to concentrate the economic activity in several strong regional centres and interconnect them with a high quality transport network, such as High-Speed Rail (HSR). However, this policy would {{have a negative impact on}} terriotiral cohesion, as it would lead to more polarized spatial development patterns. Aware of these polarisation risks of HSR, transport policy documents at different administrative levels - from the local to the European scale- are increasingly demanding the inclusion of cohesion impacts in HSR assessment methodologies. However, there is no consensus on how these impacts should be measured. In addition, it is important to define the planning level at which cohesion effects are measured, as it may occur that simultaneously e. g. both a positive effect at the regional level and a negative effects at the national level would take place. Recent publications on this topic have highlighted the methodological advantages of spatial analysis to address these cohesion issues. In particular, accessibility analysis has special strengths to define how transport and development impacts are distributed across geographical areas or population groups, therefore including compatibility with <b>cohesion</b> <b>objectives.</b> In this context, this research work presents a methodology in which impacts on territorial cohesion of HSR investments are assessed using an accessibility approach. Cohesion impacts are assessed at different planning levels: local, regional, corridor and national levels, from the combination of graphical and statistical analyses, supported by a Geographical Information System (GIS).

40|$|Why analyse {{the spatial}} {{impacts of the}} CAP? The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the single largest policy of the EU in {{expenditure}} terms, accounting for 44 per cent of the budget in 19982. Its basic remit is for increased agricultural productivity, a fair standard of living for those engaged in agriculture, stable markets, assured supplies and reasonable prices (Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome). The redistribution of wealth from prosperous to poorer countries and regions is not overtly a CAP objective. The nearest the CAP comes to such a focus is in the LFA Directive, {{where one of the}} objectives is to “maintain a viable agricultural commu-nity and thus help develop the social fabric of rural areas by ensuring a fair standard of living for farmers and by offsetting the effects of natural handicaps in less-favoured areas;… ” (EU Regulation 950 / 97). However, whether intentional or not, all sectoral policies have significant (sometimes substantial) spa-tial impacts, which either reduce or exacerbate regional disparities in prosperity and income.

European regional support has grown in parallel with European integration. The funds targeted at achieving greater economic and social cohesion and reducing disparities within the European Union (EU) {{have more than doubled}} in relative terms {{since the end of the}} 1980 s, making development policies the second most important policy area in the EU. The majority of the development funds have been earmarked for Objective 1 regions, i. e. regions where GDP per capita is below the 75 % threshold of the EU average. However, the European development policies have come under increasing criticism based on two facts: the lack of upward mobility of assisted regions; and the absence of regional convergence. This paper assesses, using cross-sectional and panel data analyses, the failure so far of European development policies to fulfil their objective of delivering greater economic and social cohesion by examining how European Structural Fund support is allocated among different development axes in Objective 1 regions. We find that, despite the concentration of development funds on infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, on business support, the returns to commitments on these axes are not significant. Support to agriculture has short-term positive effects on growth, but these wane quickly, and only investment in education and human capital - which only represents about one-eight of the total commitments - has medium-term positive and significant returns.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a European public sphere (EPS) and of a European identity (EI) are the fundamental interconnected processes which decide {{the shape of the}} nowadays European polity. EU member states' citizens should have a European identity, be it a secondary one, to actively participate in private and public debates concerning EU affairs, policies and common future. A fresh perspective in the field considers that the nature of the compatibility between national and European identities (which do not exclude each other) is revealed by the process of identity emergence: while national identities are largely "cultural", European identities are primarily "instrumental". The paper argues that instrumental European identity, as the identity based on self-interest calculation, is a reality. EU has been experimenting new ways to contribute to the {{emergence of}} a EI, trying to promote to its citizens symbols as identity markers once used by nations with the same aim (such as a flag, an anthem, a currency). In the EU context, funding opportunities are also being used to fosterEI acquisition. In this theoretical context, a content analysis was conducted on two online news portals in Romania – www. hotnews. roand www. ziare. com – for the March-June 2012 time frame in order to answer questions such as: Which are the markers and frames of an instrumental European identity promoted through articles about EU funds, posted on the two news portals?; how visible are EU identity markers and frames reflected through news on the management of EU funds and the implementation of EU-funded programmes and projects?; which is the predominance of such news?; how do Romanian citizens comment on these news in terms of identity acquisition? Moreover,this research will be compared with a similar one conducted for the March-June 2011 time frame.

Compared to the EU average, the United States per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is 35 % higher and the Japanese per capita GDP is approximately 15 % higher. However, there are substantial economical disparities within the EU. On the high end, Inner London has a per capita GDP equal to EUR 83, 200 (334 % of the EU 27 average), while the poorest region Severozapaden, in Bulgaria, has a per capita GDP of only EUR 6, 400 (26 % of the EU 27 average). Regional policy {{has been at the}} heart of EU policies since the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The Treaty’s preamble refers to the need “to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing among the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions”. To this goal {{there are a number of}} Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds supporting development of poor regions. Nowadays with the current financial crisis, EU is also facing a new range of challenges owing to the enlargement of the Union which is actually strengthening European economic stability and welfare. In this thesis we will try to answer to the following questions: Which are the determinants of productivity dynamics of EU regions? Which policy was adopted by the EU in the last thirty years to achieve its goals of convergence and competitiveness of European regions? Has this policy been effective? In particular, the thesis is organized in three chapters. Chapter 1 traces the history of the EU regional policy explaining how it has evolved from 1957 to 2006. We discuss how the use as unit of observation of the so called NUTS 2 regions (see [URL] can be not appropriate for the type of issues under scrutiny. Then we show how we built our database on Structural and Cohesion Funds for the first three programming periods (i. e. 1975 - 1988, 1989 - 1993 and 1994 - 1999), for which no databases are directly available by the European Commission. In this we paid particular attention to the reallocation across regions when information was available only at multiregional or country level, in the light of the constant changes that the EU regional policy underwent from 1975 to 1999. We find that Structural and Cohesion Funds mainly flowed to regions with lower per capita income and, within the Objective 2 regions, with higher unemployment rate and employment share in the industrial sector. However, recipients were not always regions with the least favourable economic conditions and there exists a significantly share of funds allocated independently of the eligibility criteria. Moreover, we find that over time there is an increasing discrepancy between the funds committed and those actually spent by the regions. Finally, taking the ratio of payments on commitments as a measure of the administrative capacity for using EU funds, we find that countries greatly differ in their efficiency in managing the funds. Chapter 2 analyzes the impact of the European Union regional policy on the productivity growth of European regions over the period 1980 - 2002. In particular, we separately consider three programming periods (1975 - 1988, 1989 - 1993 and 1994 - 1999), and study the effects of various types of funds on labour productivity (i. e. Structural, <b>Cohesion,</b> <b>Objective</b> 1, etc.). In order to capture the main features of the funds, i. e. their size and composition, we also propose a simple growth model, which is subsequently utilized as a guide to the empirical analysis. In all the three programming periods we find that, on average, funding had a positive and concave effect on productivity growth. In particular, a share of funds on GVA of 10 % is estimated to raise the regional growth rate of about 0. 9 % per year. However, by separately considering the three programming periods and the composition of the funds according to different “objectives”, we find that: i) only the funds allocated in the second and third programming periods, when their amount remarkably increased, had a significant impact; and ii) only Objective 1 and Cohesion funds had a positive and significant impact, while the impact of funds devoted to Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 appears negative or non significant. The results are robust to funds’ endogeneity and spatial dependence. Chapter 3 analyzes the determinants of the distribution dynamics of labour productivity of European regions over a shorter period, i. e. 1992 - 2002. We propose a novel methodology which combines the growth regression approach `a la Barro and Sala-i-Martin, in a semiparametric framework, with the stochastic kernel approach `a la Quah. In particular, the distributional impact of a given variable is evaluated by the comparison of actual and counterfactual distributions and the related actual and counterfactual stochastic kernels and ergodic distributions. Counterfactual distribution is calculated by the estimated growth regression, taking the variable to sample average for all regions. The methodology also allows for measuring the marginal effect of the variable on distribution and for testing for possible presence of distributional effects in the residuals of growth regression. We find that initial productivity accounts for a large decrease in the dispersion of productivity. Instead, country unexplained component (country dummies) has an ambiguous effect (benefiting regions around but below the average but hurting regions far below), while employment growth has not any distributional effect. Objective 1 and Cohesion Funds have a reducing-dispersion effect, but their very limited size produces a negligible effect on the overall distribution. This also holds for structural change, as measured by the change in the share of Agriculture sector on total GVA, and Wholesales and Retail; on the opposite Hotel and Other Market Services result enhancing-dispersion sectors. Finally, financial sector has an ambiguous effect, mostly benefiting regions with productivity around but below the average. No variable considered in the analysis appears to affect the polarization of productivity, but initial productivity...|$|E

While policy makers hail the success in meeting the povery reduction target of the MDGs, social unrests in the Middle East and North African regions and some parts of Asia and Europe question current economic growth models.

40|$|Services of General Interest (SGEI) are, in {{the wording}} of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), among the ‘shared values of the Union’ and play an {{important}} role in ‘promoting social and territorial cohesion’. These services cover a wide range of activities and utilities ranging from water supply and ambulance services to the setting up of telecommunication infrastructures. Their role in the development of certain regions or in the inclusion of certain social categories has been acknowledged in numerous Commission documents and courts’ rulings. The financing of SGEI is in principle allowed, if this is necessary in order to ensure the proper functioning of the markets for the benefit of the consumers. For Member States the financing of SGEI is a means of achieving the social and <b>cohesion</b> <b>objectives</b> set up in their constitutions. However, for the European Union (EU), this financing may constitute a distortion of the competition between Member States and is subject to close scrutiny. This terrain is therefore a field in which the clear definition of the services and national interests concerned and the delimitation between national and EU competences is of crucial importance. In several different contexts the Europe 2020 Commission strategy mentions social <b>cohesion</b> as an <b>objective</b> which needs to be reached by the EU in the next decade. However, in none of these contexts are the SGEI mentioned, although these services are instrumental in that respect. What does this silence mean? What are the implications of the 2020 strategy on the definition and financing of SGEI? Are there any consequences for the current and future regulatory framework of SGEI...|$|R
40|$|Cohesion {{was first}} {{developed}} to predict properties of implementations created from a given design. Unfortunately, cohesion, as originally defined, {{could not be}} objectively assessed, while more recently developed <b>objective</b> <b>cohesion</b> measures depend on code-level information. We show that association-based and slice-based approaches {{can be used to}} measure cohesion using only design-level information. Our design-level cohesion measures are formally defined, can be readily implemented, and can support software design, maintenance, and restructuring...|$|R

But are we witnessing a new kind ‘performance protest’? Charlie Beckett argues that these protests are now more focused on media reaction, such {{that they are more}} like performance art, often with little <b>cohesion,</b> programme, or <b>objectives...</b>|$|R

Its concrete focus is on the methods of strategic planning and programming. The main task is to evaluate cohesion policy, find mistakes relating to its implementation in the Czech Republic in the period 2004 [...] 2006 and explore whether the Czech Republic is to avoid these mistakes in the period 2007 [...] 2013...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 - 08 {{financial}} crisis, {{the consequent}} Great Recession (2008 - 09), the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis (2010 - 14) {{and the ensuing}} austerity measures have caused a deep impact – not always immediate, in some cases delayed but enduring – on the European labour markets. The most exposed segments of the labour market {{to the impact of}} the crisis are young people. Nonetheless, there are significant differences between countries and even between regions within countries. In this chapter, we focus on developments within the European Union (EU) and we consider the Nuts- 1 regional breakdown, especially focusing – in the econometric results - on the differences between male and female. Also in the case of investigations on labour markets, the regional level is particularly important not only from an empirical analysis perspective, but also from a policy standpoint; just recall the EU's <b>cohesion</b> <b>objectives.</b> However, regional (sub-national) investigations on the labour market impact of the recent crisis have been rare so far. This contribution tries to fill this gap. A second original contribution of this paper is that the analysis is based not only on the traditional indicators – youth unemployment rates (YUR) – but also on the more innovative NEET indicator. The econometric panel estimations are based on models (i) incorporating the dynamic feedbacks to capture the persistence in the dependent variables, (ii) accommodating latent heterogeneity at different levels of regional aggregation and, finally, (iii) allowing the crisis years to exert a separate impact on the dependent variable, both through the inclusion of time indicators and in interactions with the GDP growth rates. So, estimation is primarily based on GMM and bias-corrected fixed effect dynamic panel data estimator...|$|R
40|$|The {{priorities}} of regional development policies aim at reducing interregional and intraregional disparities by supporting {{the creation of}} some more integrated regional labour markets and by a better use of regional synergies {{in order to increase}} the investment attractiveness. Considering these aspects, {{the purpose of the study}} was to do an analysis in the developing regions of Romania which tried to identify the factors that influence earnings and earnings inequalities. We considered a panel analysis in which the determinant factors were the gross domestic product, foreign direct investment, the share of graduates from post-secondary and tertiary education of the total population of the region and inflation. These macroeconomic indicators play an important role in achieving the <b>cohesion</b> policy <b>objectives</b> to reduce disparities between the most developed regions and those with a lower level of development...|$|R

This paper points to the pressures which led to the manifestation of the crisis of the European social model and presents the new European social model having as basic principles the solidarity and social <b>cohesion</b> and as <b>objectives</b> the achievement of equal opportunities, social involvement and social integration/inclusion. the European social model, the crisis of the Eurpean model, social policy. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{unbridled}} globalization {{based on}} a simple premise about earnings and profit may be detrimental to the livelihood of many thousands of individuals. The greed and utter selfishness that result from the adherence {{to this sort of}} business practice are the two things that generate more unemployment, misery and degradation than most other characteristics of the human species. These considerations present the challenge for Western societies and call for the implementation of other principles, standards and procedures, such as cooperation, <b>cohesion,</b> development <b>objectives</b> and social responsibility. In {{the first part of the}} paper this approach is tested in the case of the EU-US foreign exchange relationships. The second part of the paper raises more general and fundamental issues. While adhering to the Schumpeter-type innovation environment, it aims to introduce the social dimension ahead of the immediate competitiveness and, therefore, argues for the fundamental reform of the catechism of the capitalist manager. The EU, due to its advanced integration, is relatively well-equipped to move towards the new economic system. ...|$|R
