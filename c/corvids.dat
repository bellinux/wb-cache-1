50|$|The word <b>corvid</b> {{is a name}} {{applied to}} the Corvidae, the family of birds that {{includes}} crows, ravens, jays, magpies and jackdaws. The name symbolizes the non-hierarchical and diversely social nature of <b>Corvid</b> College.|$|R
25|$|The {{scarecrow}} is an archetypal scare tactic in {{the agricultural}} business. However, due to corvids' quick wit, scarecrows are soon ignored and used as perches. Despite farmers' efforts to rid themselves of <b>corvid</b> pests, their attempts have only expanded <b>corvid</b> territories and strengthened their numbers.|$|R

5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the <b>Corvids</b> in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2. They {{have not been}} seen since, nor was there evidence of a shower when previous records were examined. Hoffmeister noted the trajectory of the shower {{was similar to that}} of the comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, though this was not confirmed by Zhukov and colleagues in 2011. The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta <b>Corvids,</b> assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} <b>corvid</b> fossils {{date to the}} mid-Miocene, about 17 {{million years}} ago; Miocorvus and Miopica may be ancestral to crows {{and some of the}} magpie lineage, respectively, or similar to the living forms due to convergent evolution. The known prehistoric <b>corvid</b> genera appear to be mainly of the New World and Old World jay and Holarctic magpie lineages: ...|$|R

25|$|New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) {{are perhaps}} the most studied <b>corvid</b> with respect to tool-use.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} vocalizations are used and, like other <b>corvids,</b> grey jays may mimic other bird species, {{especially}} predators. Calls include a whistled quee-oo, and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces {{a series of}} harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles to indicate a predator in the air.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>corvids,</b> ravens can mimic {{sounds from}} their environment, {{including}} human speech. Non-vocal sounds {{produced by the}} common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If {{a member of a}} pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.|$|E
5|$|The American crow is all black, with {{iridescent}} feathers. It {{looks much}} like other all-black <b>corvids.</b> They {{can be distinguished}} from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call.|$|E

50|$|It usually nests in small, loose colonies, {{building}} stick nests {{lined with}} mud (the only Australian species of <b>Corvid</b> to do this).|$|R
5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, <b>corvids,</b> grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs. Cowbirds rarely parasitize {{mourning}} dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.|$|E
5|$|Near human {{habitation}} {{the main}} predator {{of the common}} blackbird is the domestic cat, with newly fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises. However, there is little direct {{evidence to show that}} either predation of the adult blackbirds or loss of the eggs and chicks to <b>corvids,</b> such as the European magpie or Eurasian jay, decrease population numbers.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is hunted by {{birds of prey}} {{including}} the boreal owl, short-eared owl, tawny owl, Ural owl, Eurasian eagle-owl, golden eagle, kestrel, common buzzard, red kite, northern goshawk, peregrine falcon, and sparrowhawk. The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and <b>corvids,</b> although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5000|$|The thick-billed raven (Corvus crassirostris), a <b>corvid</b> {{from the}} Horn of Africa, shares {{with the common}} raven the {{distinction}} of being the largest bird in the <b>corvid</b> family, and indeed the largest of the most diverse bird order with well over 5,000 identified species, the passerines. The thick-billed raven average 64 cm in length, with a range of 60 to 70 cm and weighs approximately 1.15 kg in females and 1.5 kg in males on average.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corvid</b> College was co-founded in Boston in October 2009 by Dr. Eric Buck, Christian Greer, and Pasqualino Colombaro as an anarchic {{experiment}} in education. It has since established a second branch in San Francisco. It is non-hierarchically organized and decentralized {{as there are}} no offices, administrators, or preset course meeting spaces, and does not confer official credentials to its students. Teachers and students at <b>Corvid</b> are joined in voluntary association to explore and share in nontraditional ways of learning and subject material.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} species of <b>corvid</b> which {{occur in the}} region, three native and one {{introduced}} (the house crow, likely ship-assisted). The pied crow is widespread and common including in urban areas, with the white-necked raven, the largest <b>corvid</b> in the region, inhabiting mountainous areas and increasingly in urban areas. The Cape crow is mainly restricted to rural habitats. The house crow {{can be found in}} Cape Town and Durban, where control measures have been implemented with varying degrees of success.|$|R
5|$|The red-billed chough's loud, ringing chee-ow call {{is similar}} in {{character}} {{to that of other}} <b>corvids,</b> particularly the jackdaw, although it is clearer and louder than the call of that species. In contrast, the Alpine chough has rippling preep and whistled sweeeooo calls quite unlike the crows. Small subspecies of both choughs have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.|$|E
5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian <b>corvids</b> plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now {{thought to have been}} an unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the corn}} crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and <b>corvids.</b> At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E

There is a record of a corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{including}} frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most 40% of their food and on average stole only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, <b>corvids,</b> or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relative}} of the choughs as indicated by a study of molecular phylogeny is the ratchet-tailed treepie (Temnurus temnurus) and they form a clade that is sister to the remaining living members of the corvidae. The genus Pyrrhocorax species differ from Corvus in that they have brightly coloured bills and feet, smooth, not scaled tarsi and very short, dense nasal feathers. Choughs have uniformly black plumage, lacking any paler areas as seen in some of their relatives. The two Pyrrhocorax are the main hosts of two specialist chough fleas, Frontopsylla frontalis and F. laetus, not normally found on other <b>corvids.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} bird families, <b>corvid</b> fitness and reproduction, {{especially}} with many crows, has increased due to human development. The survival and reproductive success of certain crows and ravens is assisted by their {{close relationship with}} humans.|$|R
