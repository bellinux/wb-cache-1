5|$|The element has two {{crystalline}} forms under 1 {{standard atmosphere}} of pressure: a double-hexagonal close-packed form dubbed alpha (α) and a face-centered cubic form designated beta (β). The α form exists below 600–800°C with a density of 15.10 g/cm3 and the β form exists above 600–800°C with a density of 8.74 g/cm3. At 48GPa of pressure the β form changes into an orthorhombic <b>crystal</b> <b>system</b> due to delocalization of the atom's 5f electrons, which frees them to bond.|$|E
5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the orthorhombic <b>crystal</b> <b>system,</b> in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules. The Cl–Cl {{distance is}} 198pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332pm within a layer and 382pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180pm). This structure means that chlorine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, and indeed its conductivity is so low as to be practically unmeasurable.|$|E

Five of the <b>crystal</b> <b>systems</b> are {{essentially the same as}} five of the lattice systems, but the hexagonal and trigonal <b>crystal</b> <b>systems</b> differ from the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice <b>systems.</b> The six <b>crystal</b> families are formed by combining the hexagonal and trigonal <b>crystal</b> <b>systems</b> into one hexagonal family, in order to eliminate this confusion.|$|R

50|$|A crystal {{family is}} {{determined}} by lattices and point groups. It is formed by combining <b>crystal</b> <b>systems</b> which have space groups assigned to a common lattice system. In three dimensions, the <b>crystal</b> families and <b>systems</b> are identical, except the hexagonal and trigonal <b>crystal</b> <b>systems,</b> which are combined into one hexagonal crystal family.

5|$|Like solid {{chlorine}} and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the orthorhombic <b>crystal</b> <b>system,</b> in a layered lattice of Br2 molecules.

This structure means that bromine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 just below the melting point, although this {{is better than the}} essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion is {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral <b>crystal</b> <b>system</b> (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{are able to}} use liquid crystals {{in a variety of}} applications because external perturbation can cause significant changes in the macroscopic properties of the liquid <b>crystal</b> <b>system.</b> Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes.

5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal <b>crystal</b> <b>system</b> {{in the space}} group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However {{it does have a}} size effect in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E
5|$|The monopnictides of berkelium-249 {{are known}} for the {{elements}} nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony.

5|$|Diamonds {{crystallize}} in {{the diamond}} cubic <b>crystal</b> <b>system</b> (space group Fdm) and consist of tetrahedrally, covalently bonded carbon atoms. A second form called lonsdaleite, with hexagonal symmetry, {{has also been}} found, but it is extremely rare and forms only in meteorites or in laboratory synthesis. The local environment of each atom is identical in the two structures. From theoretical considerations, lonsdaleite {{is expected to be}} harder than diamond, but the size and quality of the available stones are insufficient to test this hypothesis. In terms of crystal habit, diamonds occur most often as euhedral (well-formed) or rounded octahedra and twinned, flattened octahedra with a triangular outline. Other forms include dodecahedra and (rarely) cubes. There is evidence that nitrogen impurities {{play an important role in}} the formation of well-shaped euhedral crystals. The largest diamonds found, such as the Cullinan Diamond, were shapeless. These diamonds are pure (i.e. type II) and therefore contain little if any nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|Tessellations are {{patterns}} {{formed by}} repeating tiles all over a flat surface. There are 17 wallpaper groups of tilings. While common {{in art and}} design, exactly repeating tilings are less easy to find in living things. The cells in the paper nests of social wasps, and the wax cells in honeycomb built by honey bees are well-known examples. Among animals, bony fish, reptiles or the pangolin, or fruits like the salak are protected by overlapping scales or osteoderms, these form more-or-less exactly repeating units, though often the scales in fact vary continuously in size. Among flowers, the snake's head fritillary, Fritillaria meleagris, have a tessellated chequerboard pattern on their petals. The structures of minerals provide good examples of regularly repeating three-dimensional arrays. Despite {{the hundreds of thousands}} of known minerals, there are rather few possible types of arrangement of atoms in a crystal, defined by crystal structure, <b>crystal</b> <b>system,</b> and point group; for example, there are exactly 14 Bravais lattices for the 7 lattice systems in three-dimensional space.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature of about 500 °C. This green solid has a melting point of 603 °C and crystallizes in the hexagonal <b>crystal</b> <b>system</b> isotypic with uranium(III) chloride (Pearson symbol hP8, space group P63/m, No. 176). Upon heating to just below its melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase. The hexahydrate BkCl3·6H2O (berkelium trichloride hexahydrate) has a monoclinic structure with the lattice constants a = 966 pm, b = 654 pm and c = 797 pm. Another berkelium(III) chloride, Cs2NaBkCl6 can be crystallized from a chilled aqueous solution containing berkelium(III) hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and caesium chloride. It has a face-centered cubic structure where Bk(III) ions are surrounded by chloride ions in an octahedral configuration.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetry}} of a crystal is {{constrained by the}} requirement that the unit cells stack perfectly with no gaps.

40|$|A coordinate-invariant {{generalization}} of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation is presented for polar vibrations in materials with monoclinic and triclinic <b>crystal</b> <b>systems.</b> The generalization {{is derived from}} an eigendielectric displacement vector summation approach, which {{is equivalent to the}} microscopic Born-Huang description of polar lattice vibrations in the harmonic approximation. An expression for a general oscillator strength is also described for materials with monoclinic and triclinic <b>crystal</b> <b>systems.</b> A generalized factorized form of the dielectric response characteristic for monoclinic and triclinic materials is proposed. The generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation is found valid for monoclinic beta-Ga 2 O 3, where accurate experimental data became available recently from a comprehensive generalized ellipsometry investigation [Phys. Rev. B 93, 125209 (2016) ].
