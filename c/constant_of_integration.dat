25|$|Because of its {{definition}} {{in terms of}} increments, {{the value of the}} internal energy of a system is not uniquely defined. It is defined only up to an arbitrary additive <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration,</b> which can be adjusted to give arbitrary reference zero levels. This non-uniqueness is in keeping with the abstract mathematical nature of the internal energy. The internal energy is customarily stated relative to a conventionally chosen standard reference state of the system.|$|E

[...] If parameters are adjusted so that the potential function V(f) has local maximum at f=0, there is a solution in which f(X) starts at this point at 'virtual time' ∞, eventually slides down to the local minimum, then back up the other side, reaching an equal height, then reverses direction, ending up at the local maximum again at time∞.

2500|$|The current I(t) {{through any}} {{component}} in an electric circuit {{is defined as}} the rate of flow of a charge Q(t) passing through it, but actual charges—electrons—cannot pass through the dielectric layer of a capacitor. Rather, one electron accumulates on the negative plate for each one that leaves the positive plate, resulting in an electron depletion and consequent positive charge on one electrode that is equal and opposite to the accumulated negative charge on the other. Thus the charge on the electrodes is equal to the integral of the current as well as proportional to the voltage, as discussed above. As with any antiderivative, a <b>constant</b> <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> is added to represent the initial voltage V(t0). This is the integral form of the capacitor equation: ...|$|E
