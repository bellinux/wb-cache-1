50|$|The fort {{continued}} in {{use as a}} gun battery until {{the second half of}} the 19th century, when the building of the Tynemouth piers effectively rendered it obsolete. It was vacated in 1881, but in 1888 the fort became the headquarters of the newly-established Tyne Division Royal Engineers (Volunteers) Submarine Miners The division was one of a number of units around the country responsible for laying and maintaining fixed electro-mechanical mines as port defences. The mines were fired remotely by way of submarine <b>cables,</b> <b>stored</b> in three large tanks alongside the eastern wall of the fort. Several new buildings were established on the site at this time and the old tower or 'keep' was demolished in 1893. At the turn of the century a pair of 6-pounder quick firing guns were installed on the site to defend the minefield.|$|R

50|$|Hearder was {{an early}} {{advocate}} of the practicality of laying intercontinental submarine telegraph cables. He was asked to consult on the Atlantic Cable circa 1850, and proposed an improved design which used gutta percha as an insulator, a design which he later patented and {{a modified version of}} which was ultimately used in that project. He was later consulted again when the <b>cable</b> was <b>stored</b> at Keyham Dock in Plymouth over the winter of 1857-58, after the failure of the first attempt to lay it August 1857 and before the (briefly) successful attempt in August 1858.|$|R

First Choice PPV was available on Rogers Cablesystems in the United States and Canada. After Paragon Cable acquired the Rogers Cablesystems franchise in San Antonio, Texas, First Choice continued to be carried until Time Warner Cable bought Paragon in 1996. In the United States, pay-per-view broadcasters transmit without advertisements, similar to conventional flat-rate pay television services.|$|R
40|$|Modeled carbon (C) storage {{capacity}} is largely {{determined by the}} C residence time and net primary productivity (NPP). Extensive {{research has been done}} on NPP dynamics but the residence time and their relationships with C storage are much less studied. In this study, we implemented a traceability analysis to understand the modeled C storage and residence time in three land surface models: CSIRO's Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) with 9 C pools, Community Land Model (version 3. 5) combined with Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CLM 3. 5 -CASA) with 12 C pools and Community Land Model (version 4) (CLM 4) with 26 C pools. The globally averaged C storage and residence time was computed at both individual pool and total ecosystem levels. The spatial distribution of total ecosystem C storage and residence time differ greatly among the three models. The CABLE model showed a closer agreement with measured C storage and residence time in plant and soil pools than CLM 3. 5 -CASA and CLM 4. However, CLM 3. 5 -CASA and CLM 4 were close to each other in modeled C storage but not with measured data. <b>CABLE</b> <b>stores</b> more C in root whereas CLM 3. 5 -CASA and CLM 4 store more C in woody pools, partly due to differential NPP allocation in respective pools. The C residence time in individual C pools is greatly different among models, largely because of different transfer coefficient values among pools. CABLE had higher bulk residence time for soil C pools than the other two models. Overall, the traceability analysis used in this study can help fully characterizes the behavior of complex land models...|$|R
5000|$|The Mk 6 {{mine was}} a 34 in {{diameter}} steel sphere containing a buoyancy chamber and 300 lb of TNT. [...] Each mine was constructed of two steel hemispheres welded together. A Toxyl bursting charge was cast {{into the lower}} hemisphere. Toxyl {{was a mixture of}} 60% trinitroxylene (TNX) with 40% TNT used because the United States Army controlled United States TNT production and would not release sufficient quantities for the naval mine barrage. [...] For transport, the mine rested atop a box-shaped steel anchor approximately 30 in square. The anchor box had wheels allowing the mine assembly to be moved along a system of rails aboard the minelayer. The mine was connected to its 800 lb anchor box by a wire rope mooring <b>cable</b> <b>stored</b> on a reel. [...] The depth of the mine below the water surface was controlled by allowing the steel mooring cable to unwind from its reel as the mine was dropped from the minelayer until a sensor suspended beneath the anchor reached the bottom. The sensor locked the cable reel so the falling anchor would pull the buoyant mine below the surface; and the float extended the antenna above the mine. [...] Each mine had two hydrostatic safety features intended to render the mine safe if it detached from its mooring cable and floated to the surface. The first was an open switch in the detonation circuit closed by hydrostatic pressure. The second was a spring pushing the detonator away from the explosive charge into the buoyancy chamber unless compressed by hydrostatic pressure. The mines were intended to be safe at depths less than 25 ft.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two different}} approaches to providing Smart Sensor capabilities in a measurement system. One approach incorporates digital memory chips into analog sensors or associated <b>cabling</b> to <b>store</b> information unique to the particular sensor. Stored information might include sensor model and serial number, manufacturer, sensor type, sensitivity, calibration date and calibration coefficients. Once read by the signal conditioner, the information {{can be used by}} the system to automatically identify all sensors, maintain configuration control, automatically set the system gain to normalize output data, and enhance calibration database management. The other approach, a Smart Sensor Network System, is very suitable for applications where connecting transducers in a multidrop configuration is advantageous. The networking capability can significantly reduce the number of interconnecting cables required. The NETWORK SENSOR provides for the consolidation of analog signal conditioning and digital signal processing functions at the sensor, which results in syste...|$|R

40|$|For the readout of the {{calorimeter}} of the WASA at COSY experiment a QDC board using sampling ADCs and FPGAs {{to perform}} the pulse integration was developed. In the initial version only a simple pulse finding algorithm was implemented {{in order to avoid}} delay <b>cables</b> by <b>storing</b> the digitized signals in a pipeline of a few microseconds. Recently a new version with 16 ADCs at a sample rate of 240 MHz and 12 Bit resolution was developed for tests of cylindrical drift chambers (straw tubes) in the Straw Tube Tracker of the PANDA experiment. The goal was to measure the energy loss by charge readout in addition to drift time measurement. Due to the irregular cluster structure of the straw signals complex algorithms for pulse finding, pulse feature extraction and triggering were implemented. The algorithm can detect pile up and find pulse groups. Integration is possible over single pulses and over complete groups. Different methods for the calculation of starting time, including constant fraction, are implemented. Internal trigger generation depends on various criteria, e. g. slew rate, amplitude or sum of consecutive samples...|$|R
40|$|This thesis report {{describes}} how a regular smartphone {{can be used}} to visualize underground electrical cables. The idea is that different types of ground workers and such could use the application to scan the ground with their telephones to see there are any cables below. Hitting a high-voltage electrical cable by mistake while digging can lead to great material damage, personal injuries and in worst case death. The geographical positions of the <b>cables</b> are <b>stored</b> in a GIS database and the GPS in the telephone is used to establish the location of the user. To be able to visualize the cables correctly on the screen, the orientation and tilt of the phone must also be established. These values are gathered from the compass and the gyroscope in the telephone. All cables within a certain area from the user’s location are downloaded from the database and then rendered in real time as an Augmented Reality layer on the screen.

40|$|Proof-of-concept model {{tests on}} a novel self-deploying {{on-shore}} tsunami barrier were executed. The tsunami barrier consists of a membrane, floater and <b>cables</b> that are <b>stored</b> underground. Due to buoyancy the barrier self-deploys when struck by a tsunami. The membrane and cables consist of the strong, flexible and light-weight material Dyneema that can resist a 20 m high water column. A novel tsunami generating method was applied to generate a high-velocity initial bore, followed by a long duration high water level, using a normal piston type wave maker in a wave flume. Numerical calculations using a numerical Volume-of-Fluid code were used to tune the tsunami generation. The tests showed that the tsunami barrier indeed automatically deployed and completely blocked a 19 m high (reflected) tsunami for bore velocities up to 7. 5 m/s. For higher bore velocities the barrier still deployed. For larger tsunamis (with a 33 m reflected water depth) the barrier remained erected, although overflow evidently occurred.
