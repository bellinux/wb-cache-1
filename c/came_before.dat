5|$|As the United States {{prepared}} for another war, the historic peace churches, represented by Friends who understood inner dealings of Washington D.C. politics, attempted to influence new draft bills {{to ensure their}} men could fulfill their duty in an alternative, non-military type of service.

5|$|A {{realignment}} in 1937–38 {{moved the}} M-17 designation in Allen Park. Changes made moved {{the highway to}} turn east on Southfield Road to US25 and follow US25 back to the former routing into Detroit. Another larger change <b>came</b> <b>before</b> 1945 with {{the completion of the}} Willow Run Expressway. M-17 was rerouted west of the Wayne–Washtenaw county line along the expressway that replaced Ecorse Road. M-17 was joined by Bypass US 112 (BYPUS112) along the Willow Run Expressway to a southern freeway bypass of Ypsilanti. M-17 continued past the end of BYPUS112 at US112/Michigan Avenue along a two-lane highway to US23. It then followed US23 back to Washtenaw Avenue in Pittsfield Township to rejoin the original alignment of M-17 west to Ann Arbor. The former M-17 through downtown Ypsilanti was redesignated Business M-17 (Bus. M-17).|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but Gilbert and Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that <b>came</b> <b>before.</b> Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E

His three seasons with the club included an appearance in the successful 2007 League Two play-off Final, which <b>came</b> <b>before</b> his release in 2008.

At that time, the case of Korematsu v. United States, challenging the U.S. government’s power to exclude citizens of Japanese ancestry from military zones, <b>came</b> <b>before</b> the United States Supreme Court. While the Department of Justice's Herbert Wechsler (an Assistant Attorney General) was in charge of defending the government's position before the Supreme Court, significant consultation with Fisher was required, as he was again with the legal affairs section of the War Department. During this period, Fisher was involved in critical drafting of the government's brief submitted to the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson {{nominated}} Combs to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, {{replacing the}} deceased Shackelford Miller, Jr., and the Senate confirmed the nomination on April 5, 1967. Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to liquidate his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential conflicts of interest with cases he might adjudicate on the Court of Appeals. He expressed frustration that the cases that <b>came</b> <b>before</b> the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E

5000|$|Nouns {{may have}} other {{modifiers}} besides adjectives. Some kinds of modifiers tend to precede the noun, while others {{tend to come}} after.

By contrast, prepositional phrases, adverbs of location, etc., as well as relative clauses, come after the nouns they modify: the elephant in the room; all the people here; the woman you spoke to.

Saladin granted the truce from 1October 1188 to 31May 1189. Bohemond managed to retain only his capital and the port of St Symeon. Saladin stipulated that Antioch was to be surrendered without resistance if no reinforcements <b>came</b> <b>before</b> the end of May 1189.

5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution <b>came</b> <b>before</b> the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
5|$|The book {{discusses}} related legal {{practices of}} countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Switzerland and Germany. Israel {{was the first}} country to publicly acknowledge the practice—in November 2000. The author connects this policy initiative with Israel's ongoing conflict with Palestinian militants. Melzer argues that this policy was controversial—the issue <b>came</b> <b>before</b> the Israeli Supreme Court, where the matter was not decided for almost five years. The court's judgment was issued on 14 December 2006, but neither forbade nor endorsed the practice. Melzer asserts that it left multiple important legal conundra unresolved. Its significance was that it dealt not with a single incident, but rather {{with the nature of}} the policy itself and set forth conditions for examining the legality of future episodes.|$|E
