50|$|Low smoke zero halogen or low smoke free of halogen (LSZH or LSOH or LS0H or LSFH or OHLS) is a {{material}} classification typically used for cable jacketing in the wire and cable industry. LSZH cable jacketing {{is composed of}} thermoplastic or thermoset compounds that emit limited smoke and no halogen when exposed to high sources of heat. The first commercial thermoplastic LSZH material for cable jacketing was invented by Richard Skipper in 1979 and patented by Raychem Corporation.2 This invention resolved the challenge of incorporating sufficient inorganic filler, aluminium trihydrate (ALTH), into an appropriate thermoplastic matrix to suppress the fire and allow a char to be formed, which reduced emission of poisonous carbon gasses and also smoke and carbon particles, whilst maintaining electrical insulation properties and physical properties required by the end application.The preferred inorganic filler to achieve flame retardation continues to be aluminium trihydrate (ALTH). In {{the event of a}} fire this material undergoes an endothermic chemical reaction that absorbs heat energy and releases steam when the compound reaches a certain temperature. It is critical that the decomposition of the polymer(s) used to carry the filler decompose at approximately the same temperature.2Al(OH)3 = AL203 + 3H2O (180°C) The steam disrupts combustion of the evolved gasses and helps form a <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the remaining material and traps particulates. The high level of filler required (≈ 60%) also replaces the base polymer reducing the total amount of fuel available for combustion.|$|E

This model considers the complex physicochemical {{process in the}} porous structure of a <b>char</b> <b>layer.</b> An ablation physics model based on a porous structure of a <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> and another model of heterogeneous volumetric ablation <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> physics are then built. In the model, porosity is {{used to describe the}} porous structure of a <b>char</b> <b>layer.</b> Gas diffusion and chemical reactions are introduced to the entire porous structure. Through detailed formation analysis, the causes of the compact or loose structure in the <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reaction between pyrolysis gas and <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> skeleton are introduced. The Arrhenius formula is adopted to determine the methods for calculating carbon deposition rate C which is the consumption rate caused by thermochemical reactions in the <b>char</b> <b>layer,</b> and porosity evolution. The critical porosity value is used as a criterion for <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> porous structure failure under gas flow and particle erosion. This critical porosity value is obtained by fitting experimental parameters and surface porosity of the <b>char</b> <b>layer.</b> Linear ablation and mass ablation rates are confirmed with the critical porosity value. Results of linear ablation and mass ablation rate calculations generally coincide with experimental results, suggesting that the ablation analysis proposed in this paper can accurately reflect practical situations and that the physics and mathematics models built are accurate and reasonable...|$|E
30|$|When timber {{is exposed}} to fire, the outer layer burns and turns to char. This occurs at a {{temperature}} of approximately 572  °F [300  °C] (Forintek, 2002). This creates a protective <b>charring</b> <b>layer</b> that acts as insulation and delays the onset of heating for the unheated, or cold, layer below (White 2004). This process of charring allows timber elements to achieve a level of inherent fire resistance (White 2002).|$|R

30|$|In summary, TNTs/GO nanocomposites were {{prepared}} through a facile solution method. The as-prepared TNTs/GO nano-filler can simultaneously improve the flame retardancy and photodegradability of PVC, {{which could be}} attributed to the synergistic effects between TNTs and GO. On the one hand, TNTs can suppress the re-stack of GO and promote the uniform dispersion of TNTs/GO in the PVC matrix; GO nanosheets can act as electron acceptors to reduce the charge resistance and charge recombination rate, and the GO skeleton can also act as a template for the carbonaceous char and promote the formation of multiple char under the help of TNTs. On the other hand, titanium dioxide transformed from TNTs during combustion can be anchored in the <b>char</b> <b>layers</b> to enhance the thermal stability of the <b>char</b> <b>layers</b> and accelerate the photodegradation of PVC matrix under UV irradiation. As a result, TNTs/GO-PVC composites exhibit enhanced flame retardancy and photodegradability than TNTs-PVC and GO-PVC counterparts. The present research, hopefully, would help to provide a promising strategy for constructing polymer-matrix composites with simultaneously improved flame retardancy and photodegradability, thereby shedding light on dealing with the white pollution of commonly used polymers. Further researches are to be conducted concerning the enhancement in the flame-retardant and photodegradation efficiencies of the TNTs/GO nano-filler.|$|R

The results show that, the heat release rate curves show a single peak while the char yield is 0 %. The heat release rate curves have three peaks when the char yield is larger than 0 %. The charring of polymer significantly influences the shape of heat release rate curves. The heat release rate decreased with the increasing of char yield of polymer.

30|$|Sampling error aside, the planar {{intercept}} method effectively {{accounts for the}} portion of WD completely consumed by fire because the reduced diameters should {{be reflected in the}} measurements. However, the technique does not account for material charred and remaining as a rind on WD (Figure 2).

40|$|In this paper, supermolecular {{structure}} of melamine phosphomolybdate (MAPMo) was tailored {{by changing the}} ratio of MA/PMo. Effects of MAPMo on flame retardant efficiency of polypropylene/intumescent flame retardant (PP/IFR) system were investigated by using limiting oxygen index (LOI), UL- 94 testing, microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) etc. The thermal degradation behaviors of PP composites were tested by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The {{results showed that the}} formation of supermolecular increases the thermal stability of MA and the ratio of MA/PMo has great effect on flame retardancy of PP/IFR. With the addition of 15. 5 wt% IFR and 0. 5 wt% MAPMo (MA/PMo <= 3), the PP composites can pass the UL- 94 V- 0 test without melt-dripping. In addition, more or less MAPMo are not suitable for improving flame retardancy of PP, the best content of MAPMo (3 : 1) is 0. 3 - 0. 8 wt%. The morphology of char residue reveals that the MAPMo promotes the reaction between APP and PER, accelerates the formation of perfect <b>charring</b> <b>layer.</b> Moreover, the MAPMo modifies the degradation of MA and tailors the surface morphology of the char residue. MAPMo doesn't modify the bonds of the char compared to neat PP/IFR but improve the quality of char. It is the good <b>char</b> <b>layers</b> that protects the inside matrix from the erosion of heat and gas, resulting in good flame retardant properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{multiscale}} {{approach is}} used to model and analyze the ablation of porous materials. Models are developed for the oxidation of a carbon preform and of the <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> of two Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablators (PICA) with the same chemical composition, but with different structures. Oxygen diffusion through the pores of the materials and in depth oxidation and mass loss are first modeled at microscopic scale.

Microscopic and macroscopic approaches are applied with progressive degrees of complexity to gain a comprehensive understanding of the ablation process.

40|$|Abstract Hemp {{was treated}} with {{guanidine}} nitrate to impart flame retardance. The thermal degradation of the samples were studied by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The flame retardance was determined by LOI. Morphology of the char structure was studied by SEM to obtain information concerning the thermal degradation mechanism. For hemp treated with guanidine nitrate, which has higher LOI and char yield values, the oxidative decomposition stages include a decomposition stage at lower temperatures (203 - 240 °C), leading to more carbonaceous residue and small amount of flammable products to get the good flame retardance.

50|$|In a fire, a {{solid wall}} of timber {{benefits}} from the protection of a <b>charred</b> <b>layer</b> and therefore does not combust {{in the same way}} as a single stud. In Stadthaus, five-layer cross-laminated timber panels are used to obtain a fire protection that allows the structure to retain its integrity for at least 90 minutes.

The 90 minutes at Stadthaus have been achieved with the plasterboard finish - two layers of plasterboard provide 60 minutes with the final 30 minutes achieved by the calculation of charring rate of the KLH solid timber panels. Calculations by the project engineers however show that in fact the KLH panels comfortably achieve a 60-minute fire resistance period with the panel thicknesses used for this project so the design team has been slightly modest.|$|R

The surface {{exposed to the}} flame {{is regarded as the}} external surface of the FGO-based coating residue, while the surface in contact with the PVA substrate is the internal surface. The SEM images of the coating residue shown in Fig.  8 e–j reveal that a more dense and continuous <b>char</b> <b>layer</b> with fewer cracks and holes is obtained with increasing number of bilayers from 10 to 30.

From the combined results of XPS analysis, it is revealed that the outer layer is mainly composed of C and O elements, with additional P element observed in the inner layer of the coating residue. Accordingly, it is concluded that two different char structures were generated by different processes: the outer layer is a physical char mainly consisting of graphene sheets, while HPTCP catalyzed the PVA matrix into a chemical char that encapsulated the physical char, thus constituting the inner layer.|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} found that the wood ash-based {{amorphous}} HAp suspension has flame retardant effect on the HAp-treated woods. The HAp produces characteristic alterations as phosphoric agents in the thermogravimetric properties of the HAp-treated woods; the exothermic and weight loss peaks due to their significant thermal decomposition were weakened and peak temperatures were shifted to the lower. The OI measurements indicate that with the increase in the amount of HAp injection, it was becoming difficult to keep the combustion of the HAp composites without raising the oxygen concentration. Also in cone calorimeter study, the HRRs and THRs of the HAp composites tend to be decreased and the second HRR peak risings due to their gradual burning after the initial <b>charred</b> <b>layers</b> tend to be delayed with increasing amounts of the HAp contents.
