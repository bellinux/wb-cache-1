40|$|We {{construct}} a complete invariant for non-wandering surface flows with finitely many singular points but without locally dense orbits. Precisely, {{we show that}} a flow v with finitely many singular points on a compact connected surface S is a non-wandering flow without locally dense orbits {{if and only if}} S/v_ex is a non-trivial embedded multi-graph, where the extended orbit space S/v_ex is the quotient space defined by x ∼ y if they belong to either a same orbit or a same multi-saddle connection. Moreover, collapsing edges of the non-trivial embedded multi-graph S/v_ex into singletons, the quotient space (S/v_ex) /∼_E is an abstract multi-graph with the Alexandroff topology with respect to the specialization order. Therefore the non-wandering flow v with finitely many singular points but without locally dense orbits can be reconstruct by finite combinatorial structures, which are the multi-saddle <b>connection</b> <b>diagram</b> and the abstract multi-graph (S/v_ex) /∼_E with labels.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} disassembly sequence generation for electronic equipment. This is particularly useful because adequate end-of-life disassembly becomes crucial as take-back obligations are imposed for environmental reasons. Besides this, the hierarchical structure, typical to electronic products, makes product remanufacturing to an important topic. Methods from disassembly of mechanical assemblies are successfully adapted to these specific challenges. First, a modeling method for assemblies is described, which is aimed at automatically determining the optimum disassembly sequence. It is argued that the information, which is condensed in the <b>connection</b> <b>diagram</b> and the set of precedence relations, is sufficient for the automatic generation of such a sequence. Appropriate use of the precedence relations reduces {{the size of the}} model, that can be represented as an AND/OR graph with a restricted number of subassemblies and actions. With disassembly costs and revenues included, the optimum disassembly sequence can be found with standard linear programming software, thus without the need of visiting the complete search space. As a matter of fact, the size of the problem is strongly reduced, as it increases only linear with the number of parts in the assembly. It has been demonstrated that the model nearly instantaneously generates the optimum disassembly sequence. Besides this, the model can generate near optimum sequences as well, which is beneficial if multiple criteria are considered...|$|E

30|$|Recently, the {{software}} project cim 2 modelica was published (Gómez et al. 2018).

The paper studies the structure, parameters and characteristics, the operation and maintenance characteristics of the AC electric point motors. Determination of the main types of possible faults in the process depending on the operating conditions. Presentation of the electric motor as an object of diagnosis. Findings. The time dependences of the current in the circuit of electric point motor for its various states was obtained. The connection between the technical condition of electric point motor and the performance of current curve in time and spectral domains was established.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the neighboring Roman Empire, no centralized sites {{in the sense of}} transregionally significant settlements are definitively verifiable outside of the Limes Germanicus in the research area at the middle Main River. However, some fortified hill forts do exist. Starting in late antiquity, these sites were temporarily occupied in times of internal and external conflict. Hill forts in the Babaricum were, without exception, sited on spurs at the Main or its tributaries. The course of the Main River constituted the primary transport route for the Romans into the Babaricum, although clear evidence of ship or harbor facilities has yet to be discovered for this period. The well-known hierarchical settlement and road system in the Roman Empire is not apparent in the Babaricum although numerous sunken roads in multiple path networks were discernible. Precise dating of these features to the Roman Iron Age or Migration Period has not been possible due to heavy soil erosion in the vicinity. Particular stretches of this network of paths were only seasonally in use depending on weather conditions and soil moisture, and so it is not realistic to discuss roadways as usable year-round in the Babaricum as they are in the Roman Empire.
