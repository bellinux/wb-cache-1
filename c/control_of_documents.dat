40|$|Abstract: A {{collaborative}} workflow is {{a business}} process {{with a set of}} linked tasks. It is important to share knowledge in document format of the workflow to achieve a business objective or policy goal. When an electronic document is shared in a collaborative workflow, appropriate access controls are needed. Access <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> involves the correlated setting of security at the document and data levels, corresponding to the sequence of workflow activities and organisational role hierarchy.

TAM combines the strong safety properties for propagation of access rights obtained in Sandhu's Schematic Protection Model, {{with the natural}} expressive power of Harrison, Ruzzo, and Ullman's model.

40|$|Document Management is {{the initial}} stage of most {{electronic}} publishing endeavours. Individuals need to organise documents {{in such a}} way that they can be retrieved and accessed on demand, shared selectively, integrated with the work of others and preserved forever. Publishing of documents is another very important aspect of document management. However, tools that exist for publishing documents are limited in that they only allow a user to send documents to local devices such as disk drives. No tools exist in the user workspace to publish documents in a wide area network. The report outlines the development of a document management tool that is aimed at addressing the issues of integrating document management and the publishing of documents in the user workspace. The components of the system are the metadata extractor, the publishing tool, the user interface and the email gateway. The system was tested and evaluated, yielding the following results that show that metadata can be extracted from research documents by defining simple heuristics that define properties of the document and using a statistical learning model.

More and more laboratories are substituting traditional control with electronic document control, which allows for more agility in the recovery of information.

40|$|Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is an {{area that}} has {{received}} an increased attention in today’s corporate environment, especially among businesses active on the global market. Companies’ social-, environmental- and ethical responsibility are important parts of a sustainable global society, which implies that CSR is an important area to raise awareness and understanding for. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a Swedish industry company’s supplier evaluation with a focus on CSR-aspects when purchasing on the Chinese market. The study also investigated which cultural aspects a company needs to consider while evaluating suppliers in China. Therefore this study adds to the understanding of what CSR-areas need to be prioritized on the Chinese market and gives a recommendation of how companies practically can implement CSR in supplier evaluation. A case study was conducted at LKAB Trading Shanghai Ltd, where the company’s purchase routine and supplier evaluation process in China was mapped. Then a benchmark was performed through qualitative interviews with seven western companies active on the Chinese market, where the companies’ CSR-work linked to supplier evaluation was investigated. The study’s orientation was explorative and aimed to create a foundation for understanding the subject. The approach was abductive, a combination of creating new theory within practical CSR work with suppliers in China and building on previous research when it comes to Chinese culture, CSR and supplier evaluation. Besides the benchmark, data was collected through unstructured interviews with people knowledgeable within CSR. The results of the study showed that work environment, working hours, health & safety and environment are important CSR-factors to focus on during supplier evaluation in China, as companies have experienced flaws within these areas. Also corruption in the supply chain should specifically be investigated and prevented. Cultural aspects to consider on the Chinese market are that relationships have a major impact on the business society, and laws and contracts have less value than in West. The gift culture and the high degree of hierarchy are other characteristics for Western companies to reflect on in China. When it comes to the integration of CSR-factors and cultural aspects in the supplier evaluation process the results of the study showed that it is important for Western companies to firstly insure that the internal CSR-work is of high standard. Hence, the company can be a good example and motivate suppliers to live up to the demands. In the evaluation process it is important to do a thorough investigation of the supplier through audit, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and certificates and verification of the results of these. Companies are also recommended to work with CSR in close contact to the supplier by continuous follow ups and control of compliance. One key success factor is to educate the supplier in CSR to raise awareness and the willingness to cooperate. A long-term collaboration will facilitate the improvement work and will increase the chance of a genuine responsibility taking in both parties.
