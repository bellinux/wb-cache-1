25|$|The UN {{buffer zone}} runs up against Dhekelia {{and picks up}} again from its east side off Ayios Nikolaos and is {{connected}} to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin <b>land</b> <b>corridor.</b> In that sense the buffer zone turns the Paralimni area on the southeast corner of the island into a de facto, though not de jure, exclave.|$|R
50|$|Operation Avak was {{a success}} and {{relieved}} the besieged Israeli forces in the Negev, allowing them to {{play an active role}} in Operation Yoav, when a permanent <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> with the rest of Israel was opened. It significantly raised their morale and fighting ability, as many of the troops had been stranded in the Negev for eight months.|$|R
5000|$|The Pink Map (Mapa cor-de-rosa), {{also known}} as the Rose-Coloured Map, was a {{document}} prepared in 1885 to represent Portugal's claim of sovereignty over a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> connecting their colonies of Angola and Mozambique during the [...] "Scramble for Africa".

50|$|One Axis with Two Wings, Outlined as Bow-and-ArrowOne Axis {{refers to}} {{recreational}} and creative experience; Two Wings {{refers to the}} Wu-Yue culture, tourism, amusement and resort. The program of One Axis with Two Wings is designed according to the spatial features of the site north-south which includes the original ruins, the creative cultural products, the recreational products and the vacationing products from the north to the south.In terms of “Bow and Arrow”, the corridor of the Taibo Canal, the Wangyu River and the Cao Lake is the bow, the corridor of Huanhong Road is the string and the recreational & creative experience is the arrow. The water <b>corridor</b> and the <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> in this program are of great importance, because the water corridor {{will be the best}} area for tourism and recreation in the future and the <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> will be the first impression area in this program.|$|R
50|$|Corridors {{can be made}} in two {{distinct}} areas—either water or <b>land.</b> Water <b>corridors</b> are called riparian ribbons and usually {{come in the form of}} rivers and streams. <b>Land</b> <b>corridors</b> come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as a line of shrubs along a sidewalk (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.|$|R
50|$|The Darling Downs and Surat Basin regions {{have been}} subject to {{significant}} growth between 2005 and 2013, primarily due to coal mining and coal seam gas exploration. This industrial expansion coupled with the development of a transport hub and industrial estate at Charlton (10 km west of Toowoomba) has provided the <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> immediately west of Toowoomba with government endorsed transport development opportunities.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{bottlenecks}} for {{the recent}} increase in air traffic density is near the airport, where wake vortices, bounded by the terrain, could easily rebound into the <b>landing</b> <b>corridor</b> and remain {{there for a long}} period of time while maintaining their strength. The threat of near-ground wake vortex could be mitigated by the plate-line technology, which places a series of thin plates across the <b>landing</b> <b>corridor</b> before the runway; the technology was shown to significantly reduce the time it takes for wake vortex dissipation. The current investigation aims to better understand factors such as plate dimension and lateral position influences on the generation of secondary vortex structure and ultimately the dissipation rate of a wake vortex pair. It is found that the wake dissipation could be sped up further by optimizing the lateral position of the plate relative to the obstacle–vortex contact location, while the height of the plate could be significantly reduced without noticeably affecting the performance of the obstacle set...|$|R
50|$|The UN {{buffer zone}} {{separating}} the territory {{controlled by the}} Turkish Cypriot administration {{from the rest of}} Cyprus runs up against Dhekelia and picks up again from its east side, off of Ayios Nikolaos (connected to the rest of Dhekelia by a thin <b>land</b> <b>corridor).</b> In that sense, the buffer zone turns the south-east corner of the island, the Paralimni area, into a de facto, though not de jure, exclave.|$|R
50|$|It was {{a desire}} for the riches of Bangweulu's {{fisheries}} and game-rich floodplain which motivated King Leopold II of Belgium to insist, in border negotiations between his Congo Free State and the British in Northern Rhodesia, on a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> reaching Bangweulu from Katanga. This resulted {{in the shape of}} the Congo Pedicle (34) which, as it turned out, does not penetrate the area enough to be of the desired value.|$|R
50|$|Monterrey is {{connected}} with the United States-Mexico border, the sea and inland Mexico through different roads, including the Carretera Nacional (also known as the Panamerican Highway) that runs from Nuevo Laredo to Mexico City and south, and the Carretera Interoceánica connecting Matamoros with the port of Mazatlán on the Pacific; it is also crossed by highways 40, 45, 57. The divided highway Monterrey-Saltillo-Matehuala-Mexico City is the main <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to interior Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Operation Spark — a {{full-scale}} offensive of {{troops of the}} Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts — started {{in the morning of}} 12 January 1943. After heavy and fierce battles, the Red Army units overcame the powerful German fortified zones to the south of Lake Ladoga, and on 18 January 1943 the two fronts met, opening a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the besieged city. Almost immediately, both truck and rail traffic began to bring supplies to Leningrad.|$|R
50|$|Unlike OBOR which entails {{development}} of a <b>land</b> <b>corridor,</b> AAGC will essentially be a sea corridor linking Africa with India and other countries of South-East Asia and Oceania by rediscovering ancient sea-routes and creating new sea corridors that will link ports in Jamnagar (Gujarat) with Djibouti in the Gulf of Eden and similarly the ports of Mombasa and Zanzibar will be connected to ports near Madurai; Kolkata will be linked to Sittwe port in Myanmar.|$|R
50|$|On 17 December, Peshmerga forces, {{backed by}} 50 U.S.-led {{coalition}} airstrikes on ISIL positions, launched an offensive to liberate Sinjar and {{to break that}} partial ISIL siege of the Sinjar Mountains. In less than two days, the Peshmerga seized the mountain range. After ISIL forces retreated, Kurdish fighters were initially faced with clearing out mines around the area, but quickly opened a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to those mountains, enabling Yazidis to be evacuated. The operation left 100 ISIL fighters dead.|$|R
50|$|It {{took part}} in the Battle of France. It was then {{deployed}} with Army Group North during Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It fought its way into northern Russia where in January 1942 part of it was encircled by the Soviets near Demyansk. Hitler forbade a withdrawal and the Army was re-supplied by air until a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> was opened in April 1942. It was subsequently involved in the siege of Leningrad. The Soviets relieved Leningrad in January 1944.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} {{location of}} {{the country on the}} Balkan Peninsula is decisive for the fact that 4 out of 10 <b>land</b> Pan-European <b>corridors</b> run through it.|$|R
5000|$|In other cases, {{a station}} may be {{elevated}} above a road, or {{at ground level}} depending {{on the level of}} the train tracks. The physical, visual and economic impact of the station and its operations will be greater. Planners will often take metro lines or parts of lines at or above ground where urban density decreases, extending the system further for less cost. Metros are most commonly used in urban cities, with great populations. [...] Alternatively, a preexisting railway <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> is re-purposed for rapid transit.|$|R
25|$|The lower Thames was {{of great}} {{strategic}} significance as {{the location of}} major military installations including the dockyard and arsenal at Woolwich, the powder magazine at Purfleet, and the victualling stores and shipyard at Deptford. In addition, it was essential to ensure that an enemy could not make a landing along the Thames, which offered a potential <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to London. The crossing between Gravesend and Tilbury was also of considerable importance, which had prompted the Tudors to build fortifications {{on both sides of}} the river at that point.|$|R
25|$|On Jan. 12, Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts {{launched}} Operation Iskra, {{which by}} the end of the month had finally opened a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> to the besieged city, but this also did not directly involve the 54th. However, the success of Iskra, as well as the encirclement and destruction of German Sixth Army at Stalingrad and the subsequent offensives in the south, led STAVKA to plan a larger operation near Leningrad, to be called Operation Polyarnaya Zvezda (Pole Star), with the objective of the complete destruction of Army Group North.|$|R
2500|$|The encirclement {{was broken}} {{in the wake}} of Operation Iskra (Spark), a {{full-scale}} offensive conducted by the Leningrad and Volkhov Fronts. This offensive started in the morning of 12 January 1943. After fierce battles the Red Army units overcame the powerful German fortifications to the south of Lake Ladoga, and on 18 January 1943, the Volkhov Front's 372nd Rifle Division met troops of the 123rd Rifle Brigade of the Leningrad Front, opening a [...] wide <b>land</b> <b>corridor,</b> which could provide some relief to the besieged population of Leningrad.|$|R

[...] This 300-km wide <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> between the two great rivers permitted movement of large groups of people {{without the need for}} water transport, hence the heavy concentration of forts and towers there, arranged in depth and in multiple layers along waterways, fords, roads, and hilltops.|$|R
2500|$|The Battle of Beersheba, codenamed Operation Moses ( [...] , Mivtza Moshe), was an Israeli {{offensive}} on Beersheba on October 21, 1948.

It was made possible following the opening of a <b>land</b> <b>corridor</b> from the Negev desert to the rest of Israel in the Battles of the Separation Corridor. The capture had both military and political significance. It helped sever the supply route of the Egyptian expeditionary force's eastern wing, and strengthened Israel's claim to the Negev desert.|$|R
