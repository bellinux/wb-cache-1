5|$|For {{large-scale}} use, helium {{is extracted}} by fractional distillation from natural gas, which can contain {{as much as}} 7% helium. Since helium has a lower boiling point than any other element, low temperature and high pressure are used to liquefy nearly all the other gases (mostly nitrogen and methane). The resulting crude helium gas is purified by successive exposures to lowering temperatures, in which {{almost all of the}} remaining nitrogen and other gases are precipitated out of the gaseous mixture. Activated charcoal is used as a final purification step, usually resulting in 99.995% pure Grade-A helium. The principal impurity in Grade-A helium is neon. In a final production step, most of the helium that is produced is liquefied via a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>process.</b> This is necessary for applications requiring liquid helium and also allows helium suppliers to reduce the cost of long distance transportation, as the largest liquid helium containers have more than five times the capacity of the largest gaseous helium tube trailers.|$|E

50|$|Cryogenic {{deburring}} is a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>process</b> used {{to remove}} burrs and flash from plastic and die cast workpieces. The process works by tumbling and/or abrasively blasting the workpieces at cryogenic temperature levels. The low temperatures (approximately -195 C) are achieved using liquid nitrogen, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry ice. This low temperature brings the material below its embrittlement temperature, which causes the flash or burrs {{to be easily}} removed via tumbling or media blasting. This process {{has been around since}} the 1960s to deflash plastic and rubber. Common materials that are typically cryogenically deburred with blast media include PEEK, nylon, Teflon, Delrin, polypropylene, polycarbonate, acetal, PTFE, PET, HDPE, PVC, ABS and many others.|$|E

40|$|In this Thesis, {{advanced}} {{methods and}} techniques of monitoring, fault diagnostics, and predictive maintenance for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>processes</b> and systems are described. In particular, in Chapter 1, mainstreams {{in research on}} measurement systems for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>processes</b> are reviewed {{with the aim of}} dening key current trends and possible future evolutions. Then, in Chapter 2, several innovative methods are proposed. A transducer based on a virtual ow meter is presented for monitoring helium distribution and consumption in cryogenic systems for particle accelerators [1]. Furthermore, a comprehensive metrological analysis of the proposed transducer for verifying the metrological performance and pointing out most critical uncertainty sources is described [2]. A model-based method for fault detection and early-stage isolation, able to work with few records of Frequency Response Function (FRF) on an unfaulty compressor, is then proposed [3]. To enrich the proposal, a distributed diagnostic procedure, based on a micro-genetic algorithm for transducer networks monitoring complex physics systems, is shown [4]. Finally, a GEO algorithm for predictive maintenance scheduling problems, already proposed in our Research Group [5] and compared to GA with encouraging but only preliminary results, is extended to complex plants such as large experimental cryogenic systems. In Chapter 3, the numerical characterization of the proposed methods is reported. Finally, in Chapter 4 the experimental validation for the presented techniques is illustrated...|$|R

30|$|As can be {{observed}} in Fig.  10, with the increasing holding time of the <b>cryogenic</b> <b>process</b> up to 48  h, strength coefficient decreases and shows a plateau (~ 5100  MPa). During deep <b>cryogenic</b> <b>process,</b> η-carbides precipitate with the mechanism of stress-assisted diffusion, so carbon content of martensite decreases and as a consequence its strength decreases (Totten and Howes 1997). So, with the increasing holding time up to 48  h, more η-carbide nucleus forms and more carbon atoms are absorbed from martensitic matrix, and this evidence leads to decrement in strength coefficient. In holding times more than the optimum (72  h), the driving force for subzero diffusion (transformation and thermal stresses) decreases, and this leads to the invariable state of strength coefficient (Amini et al. 2012).|$|E
