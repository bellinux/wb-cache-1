5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the <b>conductor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life he took some time before feeling ready to compose new works.

5|$|During the war, {{the musical}} life of Britain was {{drastically}} curtailed.

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Baltimore {{was home to}} several African American classically {{oriented}} music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented {{in large part by}} the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed <b>conductor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas {{had been one of the}} first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department at Morgan College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial Aeolian Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to black neighborhoods across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, then switch to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant for dancing. Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as <b>conductor</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore.|$|E
