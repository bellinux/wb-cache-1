The author has grounded the necessity and importance of the risk assessing of legalization of <b>criminal</b> <b>proceeds</b> by entities of initial financial monitoring as they can both directly carry out financial transactions for legalization of illegal proceeds, and also facilitate their implementation. The paper has proposed the method of the risk assessing of legalization of <b>criminal</b> <b>proceeds</b> by a commercial bank. The method is based on the point scale and is characterized by the following advantages in comparison with the existing ones: it gives enough accurate assessment, it combines the evaluation of quantitative and qualitative indicators, it is simple and convenient in use. The developed method of the risk assessing of legalization of <b>criminal</b> <b>proceed</b> based on the point scale, can be used by a commercial bank to determine the effectiveness of the system of risk management legalization of proceeds or for the purpose of determining the comprehensive risk of legalization of <b>criminal</b> <b>proceeds</b> of a particular financial transaction, and by the National Bank of Ukraine to determine the frequency of inspections of commercial banks on the issues of financial monitoring...|$|R

Whereas, there are more problem in criminal fine and money return executions, because convicts prefer serving on detention to paying money they had abused. In my opinion, Attorneys have to coordinate with Police department and other related side to detent corruption criminal immediately so that suspects cannot run away to foreign country while on police investigation and inquiry process, encoding for process and confiscation corruptors properties, so they cannot move it to third party or brought to other country. I also thought that this could develop the criminal detention, whether convicts choose not to pay fine and return corrupted money...|$|R
500|$|Problems arose during Tilley's {{administration}} {{because of}} conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a skipjack, a sacred fish which {{could only be}} eaten {{with the permission of}} a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, and he should be exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of house arrest in a <b>criminal</b> <b>proceeding,</b> on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of congratulations on the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, [...] "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, whom we have learned to love and respect".|$|E
