40|$|Abstract. Digital {{radiography}} {{offers the}} potential of improved image quality {{as well as providing}} opportunities for advances in medical image management, computer-aided diagnosis and teleradiology. Image quality is intimately linked to the precise and accurate acquisition of information from the x-ray beam transmitted by the patient, i. e. to the performance of the x-ray detector. Detectors for digital radiography must {{meet the needs of the}} specific radiological procedure where they will be used. Key parameters are spatial resolution, uniformity of response, contrast sensitivity, dynamic range, acquisition speed and frame rate. The underlying physical considerations defining the performance of x-ray detectors for radiography will be reviewed. Some of the more promising existing and experimental detector technologies which may be suitable for digital radiography will be considered. Devices that can be employed in full-area detectors and also those more appropriate for scanning x-ray systems will be discussed.

50|$|Cadmium {{telluride}} and <b>cadmium</b> <b>zinc</b> <b>telluride</b> detectors {{have been}} developed for use in X-ray spectroscopy and gamma spectroscopy. The high density of these materials mean they can effectively attenuate X-rays and gamma-rays with energies of greater than 20keV that traditional silicon-based sensors are unable to detect. The wide band gap of these materials also mean they have high resistivity and are able to operate at, or close to, room temperature (~295K) unlike germanium-based sensors. These detector materials can be used to produce sensors with different electrode structures for imaging and high resolution spectroscopy.|$|E
