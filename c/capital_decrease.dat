This paper argues that adding endogenous human capital accumulation to the standard model dampens these forces. We find that this adjustment channel is quantitatively important. The standard model with exogenous human capital predicts welfare losses up to 12. 5 % (5. 6 %) of lifetime consumption, when contribution (replacement) rates to the pension system are kept constant. These numbers reduce to approximately 8. 7 % (4. 4 %) when human capital can endogenously adjust. (Copyright: Elsevier) Population aging; Human capital; Rate of return; Distribution of welfare...|$|E
40|$|An {{aggregate}} business {{fixed investment}} error correction model (ECM) is estimated with Icelandic data. The user {{cost of capital}} increased considerably in the 1980 s as capital markets in Iceland were liberalised and interest rates were adjusting. From the 1990 s and onwards, however, the user cost has been decreasing steadily. And the relative price of business investment has been downward trending since the 1980 s. A high Q ratio over the period portrays an increased demand for capital. The first order condition of capital for profits which is derived for a constant elasticity of substitution production function has minor long-run role for the user cost. Investment and capital, and investment, value added and the user cost do, however, give expected estimates of cointegration coefficients. In the short-run dynamics of the ECM, gearing, Q and profit ratios move with investment. Official figures show an unprecedented <b>capital</b> <b>decrease</b> in the 1990 s in Iceland.

Our study spans over the period 1986 ¿ 2009. Our analyses indicate that the index membership enhances all aspects of liquidity, including trading continuity, trading cost and price impact. We also show that the liquidity premium and the cost of equity <b>capital</b> <b>decrease</b> significantly after additions, but do not exhibit any significant change following deletions. The finding that investment opportunities increases after additions, but do not decline following deletions suggests that the benefits of joining an index are likely to be permanent.

40|$|Neoclassical theory {{says that}} {{financial}} liberalization {{will make the}} cost of <b>capital</b> <b>decrease,</b> productivity increase and output grow. In reality this does not happen. A key to understanding {{why it is so}} is the link between financial liberalization and income distribution. After financial liberalizations both the real interest rate and the supply of credit to the non traded goods sector rise. If the monetary interest rate and the profit rate tend to be equal in the long run, a reshuffling of production favouring the non-traded goods sector will occur; for the mark-up may be higher in this sector than in the traded goods sector {{due to the lack of}} international competition. Households, no more credit constrained, will increase their demand for non traded goods; profits in this sector will increase too due to the higher capacity utilization. On the other hand the likely fall in the propensity to save of capitalists will cause a slower capital accumulation. Thus neither investment nor productivity will rise. This may not be due to the working of real forces alone, such as trade liberalization, but rather to the interplay of both monetary and real factors. A vicious circle of lower growth and rising inequality could be set in motion...|$|E

Company financial performance analysis forms thing that must be observed in investment risk. EVA analysis is financial performance analysis instrument for knowing the existence of Economic Value Added in a company. EVA is extremely relevant because EVA can measure management performance based on amount of value added that created during certain period. EVA detemined with calculate net profit that explained in percentage or ROI less with Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). WACC is cost of whole capital that cover by debt cost, preferent stock, and cost of capital after multiply with proportion each cost of capital component. There are certain criteria in determining the company has a good financial performance based on EVA, (1) EVA 0, there are Economic Value Added that show the company in good condition and be able to pay liabilities to creditor and investor, (3) EVA= 0, show equal position because all profit used to pay liabilities to investor and creditor.

40|$|Paper 1 : Returns to Capital and Informality. We {{study the}} pattern of returns to capital in the formal and {{informal}} manufacturing sectors in Ethiopia. We use a rich panel dataset of manufacturing firms in the formal sector for the period 1996 - 2006 and two rounds of repeated cross-sectional data of the urban informal sector firms. Both parametric and semi-parametric regression techniques are used to study the magnitude and pattern of returns to capital. Our {{results show that the}} median return to capital in the formal sector is 15 - 21 %, while in the informal sector it is 52 - 140 %. Higher returns in the informal sector potentially explain growing informality in Ethiopia. Investment in the informal sector is, however, limited since returns to capital decline as owner’s share of time spent in the enterprise decreases. This restricts both formal and informal firms from establishing new informal firms in order {{to take advantage of the}} higher returns in the sector. Unlike the prediction of the poverty trap hypothesis, we find that returns to <b>capital</b> <b>decrease</b> with capital stock, creating an opportunity for small firms to grow by re-investing their profit. Making firm locations closer to customers affordable, creating equitable linkages with the formal sector and providing assistance on marketing skills are therefore policy recommendations that can encourage growth and eventual graduation of informal sector firms. Paper 2 : The Performance of New Firms: Evidence from Ethiopia’s Manufacturing Sector. We investigate the relative importance of technological and demand constraints for firm performance using a panel dataset of Ethiopian manufacturing sector (1996 - 2006). Previous empirical research on firm performance use revenue based productivity which confounds true efficiency with price effects. Using information on price and physical quantity of firms’ products, we decompose revenue based productivity into physical productivity, price and idiosyncratic demand shocks. Comparison of various components of productivity across firms, using product and firm fixed effect estimation, reveals that entrants have lower demand and output prices than established firms. However, we do not find a robust difference in productivity between entrants and established firms. Thus, young and small firms are found to be most vulnerable to demand constraints. Analysis of firm survival using probit regression reveals that firms’ market access is a more important determinant of survival than productivity. Securing access to markets and providing assistance on marketing skills during most vulnerable stage of firm entry are intervention areas so that efficient firms with long term growth prospect are not driven out of business. Paper 3 : The Effects of Agglomeration and Competition on Prices and Productivity: Evidence for Ethiopia’s Manufacturing Sector. We use census panel data on Ethiopian manufacturing firms to analyze the effects of enterprise clustering on two key determinants of firm performance: physical productivity and output prices. We show that distinguishing between productivity and prices is important for understanding the effects of agglomeration and competition. We find a negative and statistically significant effect of agglomeration of firms on prices, suggesting that new entry leads to higher competitive pressure in the local economy. We also find a positive and statistically significant effect of agglomeration on physical productivity, consistent with the notion that clustering leads to positive externalities. The net effect of enterprise clustering on revenue-based measures of performance is small and not significantly different from zero. Our results thus highlight the importance of separating price from productivity effects in this type of analysis. Cluster formation through creating industrial zones; and enhancing networking, technological learning as well as firm competition are key policy recommendations to boost enterprise productivity and cluster-based industrial development. Paper 4 : Ethnic Cleansing or Resource Struggle in Darfur? An Empirical Analysis. The conflict in Darfur has been described both as an ethnic cleansing campaign, carried out by the Sudanese government and its allied militias, and as a local struggle over dwindling natural resources between African farmers and Arab herders. In this paper, we use a previously unexploited data set to analyze the determinants of Janjaweed attacks on 530 civilian villages in Southwestern Darfur during the campaign that started in 2003. Our results clearly indicate that attacks have been targeted at villages dominated by the major rebel tribes, resulting in a massive displacement of those populations. Resource variables, capturing access to water and land quality, also appear to have played an important role. These patterns suggest that attacks in the area were motivated by both ethnic cleansing and resource capture, although the ethnic variables consistently have a larger impact...|$|E

Second, the agency costs which make it harder and more expensive for firms to raise funds become less important.
