5|$|Charles Fisk, also {{a pianist}} and music scholar, has {{described}} another cyclic element in Schubert's last sonatas – a unifying tonal design, which follows a similar, basic dramatic scheme {{in each of}} the three works. According to Fisk, each sonata presents at its very beginning, the generative kernel of a musical conflict from which all the ensuing music will derive. The first movement, beginning and ending in the sonata's home key, confronts this key with a <b>contrasting</b> tonality or tonal stratum. This dichotomous tonal design is also manifested in both third and final movements, whose openings are variants of the first movement's opening. Moreover, the <b>contrasting</b> tonality becomes the main key of the second movement, thus increasing the harmonic tension in the middle of the sonata, while projecting the first movement's tonal design (home key – <b>contrasting</b> tonality – home key) on the sonata as a whole. In the first half of each sonata, the musical material in the <b>contrasting</b> tonality is presented in sharp conflict with the material in the home key – in each appearance boldly detached from its surroundings. However, in the third movements and especially in the finales, this <b>contrasting</b> tonal realm is gradually integrated into its environment, bringing a sense of unity and resolution to the tonal conflict which was presented at the beginning of the sonata. Fisk goes further to interpret the dramatic musical scheme manifested in the tonal design of the sonatas, as the basis of a unique psychological narrative (see below).|$|E

30|$|<b>Contrast</b> of {{an image}} is quantitatively hard to measure. Moreover, there are several more {{definitions}} proposed for <b>contrast</b> measurement as stated in (Rizzi et al. 2004). However, there is no reference to compare an image from another in terms of <b>contrast.</b> <b>Contrast</b> value is just a scale. Low value of <b>contrast</b> causes the image <b>contrast</b> to under-saturate whereas high value of <b>contrast</b> causes the image <b>contrast</b> to over-saturate. The optimal <b>contrast</b> should lie between low and high <b>contrast</b> values. However, there is no comparative <b>contrast</b> value to show that one image {{is better than the}} other image in terms of <b>contrast.</b> Therefore, in the proposed method, the evaluation of image <b>contrast</b> is done through the evaluation of human visual system (HVS). The observers will evaluate the resultants image based on their observation.|$|R

5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply <b>contrasting</b> black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and honey badger advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with <b>contrasting</b> patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E
40|$|Perceived <b>contrast</b> {{is reduced}} after {{prolonged}} {{exposure to a}} textured pattern (<b>contrast</b> adaptation). The size of this effect {{is dependent on the}} relationship between the adapting <b>contrast</b> and the test <b>contrast.</b> It is generally accepted that the greatest reductions occur when the adapting <b>contrast</b> is much higher than the test <b>contrast.</b> Here this relationship was examined {{for a wide range of}} spatial frequencies. The results show that the effect of the adapt/test ratio on perceived <b>contrast</b> following <b>contrast</b> adaptation is highly spatial frequency dependent. At high spatial frequencies > 1 cpd perceived <b>contrast</b> was reduced for all adapting <b>contrasts,</b> which is consistent with other studies. However, at low spatial frequencies (< 1 cpd) the perceived <b>contrast</b> was actually above veridical perception when the adapting <b>contrast</b> was lower than the test <b>contrast.</b> This finding has not been previously reported and has important implications for models of <b>contrast</b> perception.

40|$|Several visual {{diseases}} {{not only}} reduce visual acuity, they also may impair a client’s {{ability to detect}} lower <b>contrast</b> objects that are well above acuity threshold. A letter <b>contrast</b> threshold function describes the lowest <b>contrast</b> letters that a client can recognize, over a range of sizes. <b>Contrast</b> sensitivity is the reciprocal of <b>contrast</b> threshold; higher sensitivity is better. Poor overall <b>contrast</b> sensitivity would increase a client’s problems with glare, and decrease reading performance with low <b>contrast</b> materials like newspapers, or currency. Very poor overall <b>contrast</b> sensitivity would slow reading of even the highest <b>contrast</b> magnified print and indicate {{the need for a}} CCTV or non-visual devices. We have reviewed 4 experiments that related <b>contrast</b> sensitivity to reading performance in normally sighted and low vision observers. Our conclusions are that 1) letter <b>contrast</b> sensitivity charts are easier to administer and more predictive of reading performance than grating charts. Letter size may be varied by varying chart distance. 2) Letter <b>contrast</b> less than 10 times <b>contrast</b> threshold will reduce reading rate: Letter <b>contrast</b> less than 4 times <b>contrast</b> threshold will significantly impair reading rate and accuracy.

25|$|<b>Contrast</b> {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in brightness between two stimuli, divided by the sum of brightness of both stimuli. <b>Contrast</b> sensitivity is the inverse of the smallest <b>contrast</b> that can be detected, a <b>contrast</b> sensitivity of 100 means that the smallest <b>contrast</b> that can be detected is 1%. Birds have comparably low <b>contrast</b> sensitivity to mammals. Humans have been shown to detect <b>contrasts</b> as low as 0.5-1%, whereas most birds tested have require ca 10% <b>contrast</b> to show a behavioural response. A <b>contrast</b> sensitivity function describes an animal's ability to resolve detect the <b>contrast</b> of patterns of different spatial frequency (detail). For stationary viewing experiments the <b>contrast</b> sensitivity is highest for a medium spatial frequency and lower for higher and lower spatial frequencies.|$|R
40|$|The {{perception}} of suprathreshold luminance <b>contrast</b> was investigated by forced-choice psychophysical procedures {{that were designed}} to define <b>contrast</b> equivalence relations. Observers compared the perceived <b>contrast</b> of rectan-gular bars that were presented for 500 msec at 3. 9 deg {{on opposite sides of}} the fovea. The results show a nearly symmetrical relation between the {{perception of}} negative and positive <b>contrast</b> that is largely invariant over four decades of background luminance. Thus, for any fixed background luminance, equal absolute <b>contrasts</b> evoke ap-proximately equal perceived <b>contrasts.</b> Symmetry also held with variations in the width, the eccentricity, and the focus of the bars. Symmetry was investigated further by determining equivalent <b>contrast</b> relations for negative <b>contrasts</b> as a function of background luminance and by <b>contrast</b> scaling. These results show evidence for nearly perfect <b>contrast</b> constancy for targets of low to moderate <b>contrast</b> and departures from constancy for high-contrast targets.

40|$|The human {{visual system}} changes with aging {{and one of}} the most {{important}} changes is the decrease of spatial <b>contrast</b> sensitivity. We investigated this change both for luminance <b>contrast</b> and chromaticity <b>contrast,</b> and both for threshold <b>contrast</b> and preferred <b>contrast,</b> (preferred by users to carry out a visual recognition task), in a series of psycho-physical experiments with achromatic and chromatic sinusoid gratings of different values of spatial frequency, hue, and luminance level, and with two observer groups: young and elderly observers. We investigated the spatial frequency range of 0. 1 - 10 cycles per degrees. Our results indicate that, beyond the expected luminance <b>contrast</b> sensitivity decline of the elderly observers, the difference between the preferred luminance <b>contrast</b> of the elderly and the preferred luminance <b>contrast</b> of the young is even more significant than the threshold difference. The small preference differences between the age groups for chromaticity <b>contrast</b> compared to luminance <b>contrast</b> suggests that while with increasing age both the chromatic and the achromatic <b>contrast</b> sensitivity drops, preferred <b>contrast</b> stays more stable for chromaticity <b>contrast</b> than for luminance <b>contrast.</b> close...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Text can be {{depicted}} by luminance <b>contrast</b> (i. e., differences in luminance between characters and background) or by color <b>contrast</b> (i. e., differences in chromaticity). We used a psychophysical method {{to measure the}} reading speeds of eight normal and ten low-vision subjects for text displayed on a color monitor. Reading speed was measured {{as a function of}} luminance <b>contrast,</b> color <b>contrast</b> (derived from mixtures of red and green), and combinations of the two. When color <b>contrast</b> is high, normal subjects can read as rapidly as with high luminance <b>contrast</b> (> 300 words/min). Curves of reading speed versus <b>contrast</b> have the same shape for the two forms of <b>contrast</b> and are superimposed when <b>contrast</b> is measured in multiples of a threshold value. When both color and luminance <b>contrast</b> are present, {{there is no sign of}} additive interaction, and performance is determined by the form of <b>contrast</b> yielding the highest reading rate. Our findings suggest that color <b>contrast</b> and luminance <b>contrast</b> are coded in similar ways in the visual system but that the neural signals used in letter recognition are carried by different pathways for color and luminance.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} human <b>contrast</b> perception at various <b>contrast</b> levels ranging from detection threshold to suprathreshold levels by using psychophysical techniques. The work consists of two major parts. The first part deals with <b>contrast</b> matching, {{and the second part}} deals with <b>contrast</b> discrimination. <b>Contrast</b> matching technique was used to determine when the perceived <b>contrasts</b> of different stimuli were equal. The effects of spatial frequency, stimulus area, image complexity and chromatic <b>contrast</b> on <b>contrast</b> detection thresholds and matches were studied. These factors influenced detection thresholds and perceived <b>contrast</b> at low <b>contrast</b> levels. However, at suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> levels perceived <b>contrast</b> became directly proportional to the physical <b>contrast</b> of the stimulus and almost independent of factors affecting detection thresholds. <b>Contrast</b> discrimination was studied by measuring <b>contrast</b> increment thresholds which indicate the smallest detectable <b>contrast</b> difference. The effects of stimulus area, external spatial image noise and retinal illuminance were studied. The above factors affected <b>contrast</b> detection thresholds and increment thresholds measured at low <b>contrast</b> levels. At high <b>contrast</b> levels, <b>contrast</b> increment thresholds became very similar so that the effect of these factors decreased. Human <b>contrast</b> perception was modelled by regarding the visual system as a simple image processing system. A visual signal is first low-pass filtered by the ocular optics. This is followed by spatial high-pass filtering by the neural visual pathways, and addition of internal neural noise. Detection is mediated by a local matched filter which is a weighted replica of the stimulus whose sampling efficiency decreases with increasing stimulus area and complexity. According to the model, the signals to be compared in a <b>contrast</b> matching task are first transferred through the early image processing stages mentioned above. Then they are filtered by a restoring transfer function which compensates for the low-level filtering and limited spatial integration at high <b>contrast</b> levels. Perceived <b>contrasts</b> of the stimuli are equal when the restored responses to the stimuli are equal. According to the model, the signals to be discriminated in a <b>contrast</b> discrimination task first go through the early image processing stages, after which signal dependent noise is added to the matched filter responses. The decision made by the human brain is based on the comparison between the responses of the matched filters to the stimuli, and the accuracy of the decision is limited by pre- and post-filter noises. The model for human <b>contrast</b> perception could accurately describe the results of <b>contrast</b> matching and discrimination in various conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{perception}} of <b>contrast</b> {{was measured in}} patients with acute unilateral optic neuritis by a technique of subjective suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> matching, and was compared with <b>contrast</b> sensitivity as defined by threshold measurements. The suprathreshold apparent <b>contrast</b> and threshold <b>contrast</b> sensitivity was repeatedly assessed during the recovery phase. Generally, an attenuation of suprathreshold apparent <b>contrast</b> was found for high and intermediate spatial frequencies in the eye with optic neuritis. At a low spatial frequency, however, the suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> vision was spared. The threshold <b>contrast</b> sensitivity was not however, spared at low spatial frequencies. During recovery this frequency-specific loss in suprathreshold apparent <b>contrast</b> diminished and finally a "normal" suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> vision was observed in all affected eyes reaching a visual acuity of 1. 0 or better.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the spatial-frequency bandwidth of perceived suprathreshold <b>contrast.</b> It has been shown that for grating stimuli <b>contrast</b> detection thresholds depend on spatial frequency, grating area and the number of orientation components. However, suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> perception exhibits <b>contrast</b> constancy, i. e. suprathreshold <b>contrast</b> matches are independent of these stimulus parameters. To study whether <b>contrast</b> constancy applies to spatial-frequency bandwidth, <b>contrast</b> matching was performed and detection thresholds were measured for spatial noise stimuli at various bandwidths centred at 2 c/deg. At high <b>contrast</b> levels, <b>contrast</b> matches were nearly independent of stimulus spatial-frequency bandwidth up to about 6 octaves, even though detection thresholds increased with bandwidth. Thus, a broad band of spatial frequencies contributed to perceived suprathreshold <b>contrast.</b> The requisites for this are <b>contrast</b> constancy with respect to spatial frequency, and integration of <b>contrast</b> information across different spatial frequencies so that the effective bandwidth of the system is broad...|$|R
