40|$|This paper {{describes}} a theoretical model {{to capture the}} rate of erosion of a silty sand {{based on the principle}} of conservation of energy. Erosion is considered to begin when the interparticle bonds between grains are broken by hydrodynamic stresses exerted on the soil particles. These detached particles are then suspended and transported by the flow of eroding fluid. It is further assumed that once the particles are fully suspended and have reached the flow velocity, resettlement does not take place. Stabilization of soil particles because of lignosulfonate (LS) treatment is represented by the increased strain energy required to break the interparticle bonds. The equation proposed in this study is based on the shear stress-strain <b>characteristics,</b> <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> velocity, <b>mean</b> particle diameter, and the packing arrangement of particles. The result of the proposed study is presented in the form of erosion rate versus the hydraulic shear stress.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Surface {{transient}} storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) have functional {{significance in}} stream ecology and hydrology. Both provide refugia for aquatic communities and their longer mean residence times (compared {{to the main}} flow) increase the potential for biogeochemical reactions that can improve water quality. As STS and HTS have different storage and mass exchange mechanisms, hydrologists have proposed quantitatively separating STS from HTS to better predict solute fate and transport in streams. In addition, more accurate estimates of mass exchange parameters, such as mean residence times, are needed for STS and HTS. At present, effective solute transport parameters are estimated either from empirical relationships or by parameterizing effective transport metrics in solute transport models, resulting in empirical and nontransferrable parameters and an approximate equifinality in optimized numerical solutions. Through the development of relationships using field-measureable hydraulic and morphologic parameters, transient storage mass exchange parameters can be better constrained in solute transport models. To develop mass exchange relationships for transient storage, this dissertation focuses {{on the study of}} a prevalent and widelyrecognized type of STS termed lateral cavities. Lateral cavities have flow fields characterized by a recirculation region comprised of one or more gyres and a shear layer that spans the entire entrance. The goals of this dissertation are: (1) to develop a classification scheme that categorizes different types of STS in fluvial systems in order to quantitatively separate STS from HTS; and (2) to develop accurate estimates of mass exchange parameters (i. e., mean residence times) for lateral cavities in order to better understand and quantify solute transport and dispersion in fluvial systems. There are six major contributions of this work to the hydrology community. First, to quantitatively separate STS from HTS, a fluid-mechanics-based classification scheme is presented that identifies and categorizes different types of STS based on their <b>characteristic</b> <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> structure. The classification scheme will allow for the systematic study of different STS types and development of predictive mean residence time relationships. Second, the best estimate of lateral cavity mean residence time, which represents the mean residence time of the primary gyre, is the first characteristic time of exponential decay. Third, a cavity shape factor [...] ratio of the square root of cavity width and depth to the cavity length [...] represents the degree of cavity equidimensionality and best quantifies the effect of cavity shape on mean residence time. Fourth, two roughness factors have good correlations with normalized mean residence time when computed using the median grain diameter of sediments measured in the shear layer: ratio of median grain diameter to channel depth and ratio of shear velocity to mean channel velocity. Fifth, mean residence time relationships are derived for lateral cavities in open channel flows with hydraulically smooth beds and for lateral cavities in gravel-bed rivers and streams. The mean residence time relationships are applicable for lateral cavities over a range of geometry, shape, roughness, and flow conditions. Sixth, cavity configuration (e. g., series or parallel) has a greater influence on breakthrough curve shape and transport parameters than the number of lateral cavities present. Therefore, the configuration and interaction of transient storage zones must be considered to accurately quantify stream solute transport and is a missing component in current solute transport theory...|$|E

Three chosen turbulence models {{are associated with the}} Volume of Fluid (VOF) scheme to predict the <b>characteristics</b> of the <b>mean</b> <b>flow.</b> Many hydraulic structures in engineering practice involve highly curvilinear flows. Five typical hydraulic structures commonly used for flow regulation or flow measurement are considered in the present study; cut-throat flumes, lateral weirs, sharp-crested weirs, circular spillways, and siphon spillways. Velocity distributions, pressure distributions, water surface profiles, secondary flows, and discharge coefficients are the <b>mean</b> <b>characteristics</b> of <b>flows</b> that are studied. Presently, computing methods and high speed computers are strong tools for engineers. With the help of a properly validated numerical model, one can avoid the time consuming and expensive experimental tests based on the physical models to obtain the characteristics of highly curvilinear flows encountered in hydraulic practices. This is {{based on the fact that}} unlike physical models, it is far simpler to apply changing boundary conditions and flow parameters to a solved numerical model and obtain a flow characteristics for hydraulic structures associated with highly curvilinear flows. The flows in hydraulic structures are turbulent. Hence, one needs to solve numerically the continuity equation and momentum equations, including turbulent stresses, as the governing equations of turbulent flows. Because the above mentioned flows are generally complex and highly curvilinear, the transport equations are needed to model the turbulent stresses in the momentum equations. In the present study, three Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) schemes are used to simulate the turbulent flows. Specifically, the Reynolds stress model (RSM), the Standard k-[varepsilon] model, and the RNG k-[varepsilon] model were used in the present study.

In the present work, the periodical excitation {{of the flow}} field of a swirl burner {{and its impact on}} coherent flow structures and mixing properties is examined. The effect of axial mass flow excitation with the dominant frequency of the coherent structure is studied. The investigations are conducted with unsteady RANS (URANS) and Large Eddy simulations (LES) for isothermal conditions to examine their capability of capturing the impact of forcing on the mixing and <b>flow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> <b>Mean</b> and turbulent <b>flow</b> fields as well as the concentration fields at the burner outlet are studied.

The unforced flow field exhibits a helical structure, which changes its characteristics when forcing is applied. The simulations (both URANS and LES) are able to reproduce the main features.

The combination of an energy?enstrophy conserving (EEN) scheme for momentum advection with a partial step (PS) representation of the bottom topography yields significant improvements in the mean circulation.

The magnitude of the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> is adjusted via a real and continuous parameter that accounts for the fluid boundary conditions on the horizontal surfaces in a convecting layer. For weak values of the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> we find that the patterns exhibit a slow coarsening to a state dominated by large and very slowly moving target defects. For strong enough <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> we identify the existence of spatiotemporal chaos which is indicated by a positive leading order Lyapunov exponent. We compare the spatial features of the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> field with that of Rayleigh-Bénard convection and quantify their differences in the neighborhood of spiral defects...|$|R
40|$|An {{integral}} {{method is}} used to investigate {{the interaction between the}} stability of a single frequency finite amplitude disturbance with the non-parallel <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> in a laminar, incompressible wake behind a flat plate. The <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> is assumed to be characterized by a few shape parameters. The integrals involving the fluctuating components are determined as functions of those shape parameters by solving the inviscid Rayleigh equation of the linear stability theory using the local <b>mean</b> <b>flow.</b> The variations of the amplitude of the fluctuation and the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> in the streamwise direction are then determined from solving the set of ordinary differential equations. The effect of coupling between the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> and the fluctuation was found to be very important. The calculations show good agreement with the experimental data of Sato and Kuriki...|$|R
40|$|An {{integral}} {{method is}} used to investigate the interaction between a two-dimensional, single frequency finite amplitude disturbance in a laminar, incompressible wake behind a flat plate at zero incidence. The <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> {{is assumed to be}} a non-parallel flow characterized by a few shape parameters. Distribution of the fluctuation across the wake is obtained as functions of those <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> parameters by solving the inviscid Rayleigh equation using the local <b>mean</b> <b>flow.</b> The variations of the fluctuation amplitude and of the shape parameters for the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> are then obtained by solving a set of ordinary differential equations derived from the momentum and energy integral equations. The interaction between the <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> and the fluctuation through Reynolds stresses {{plays an important role in}} the present formulation, and the theoretical results show good agreement with the measurements of Sato & Kuriki (1961) ...|$|R
40|$|Lined ducts often form {{a part of}} {{practical}} flow duct acoustic systems. The prediction of attenuation in such a duct has been a topic of research for many years. As far as the author's knowledge goes, the analysis of lined ducts with sheared <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> has always been done numerically. In this paper, an analytical solution for the wave propagation in lined ducts with laminar <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> is presented. The effect of the laminar <b>mean</b> <b>flow</b> Mach number is investigated for both downstream and upstream wave propagation. Results are compared with those for the case of uniform <b>mean</b> <b>flow.</b> Analytical expressions are derived for the transfer matrice...|$|R
