Based on Huntington and transitional justice theories, Poland went through slow transition since new elites had to negotiate every piece of an agreement, which took many years for Poland to transform into democratic country with all basic aspects of liberal democracy. While in Czech republic, transition took merely two weeks which is considered to be "hectic" type of transition. Based on the thesis, hectic transition had an influence on quick legislative changes enacting administrative lustration, while Polish progressive transition (and therefore strong necessity to cooperate for longer period of time with communist leaders) caused delay of administrative lustration.

Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom.

These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three.

5|$|As {{the fall}} of Thessalonica {{appeared}} imminent, Pope Honorius excommunicated Theodore, ordered an embargo on horses, troops, and supplies from the Adriatic ports, and sent letters to Constantinople urging assistance to Demetrius. Demetrius himself went to Italy to seek aid, being received by the Pope in Rome in March 1222 and by Emperor Frederick II (r. 1220–50) soon after. A crusade was proclaimed against Theodore, and troops began to gather in Italy. In the meantime, the Latin Empire, now under Robert of Courtenay (r. 1221–28), was once more embroiled in warfare with Nicaea as it supported Laskaris' brothers in their challenge against the new Nicaean emperor, John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1222–54). The first detachments of the assembling crusade, under Count Oberto II of Biandrate, arrived at Thessalonica in summer 1222 and joined the de facto regent, Guy Pallavicini. Theodore now hastened his move against Thessalonica. After preliminary operations in late 1222, in early 1223 he laid siege to the city. Honorius excommunicated him again, and redoubled his effort to promote the crusade, which {{had come to a}} standstill in the meantime. At the Pope's urging, Venice and Emperor Frederick promised aid. Robert of Courtenay also pledged to assist, while Honorius called upon the Latin princes of southern Greece to join in the effort. The crusade finally assembled at Brindisi in March 1224. In his instructions to his legate, however, Honorius did not rule out the possibility of Theodore <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> the Crusaders. True to his word, in April 1224 Robert of Courtenay sent an army to besiege Serres. During the siege, the Latin generals learned of the disastrous defeat of the main Latin army at the hands of John III Doukas Vatatzes at the Battle of Poimanenon. They lifted the siege and hastened back to Constantinople, only to be intercepted by Theodore's men; most of the Latin army were killed or taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The regular cast is {{introduced}} in season one, with storylines involving a villain deriving power from kryptonite exposure. The one-episode villains were a plot device developed by Gough and Millar. Smallvilles first season primarily dealt with Clark Kent's <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> his alien origin and {{the revelation that}} his arrival on Earth {{was connected to the}} death of Lana Lang's parents. After the first season the series had fewer villain-of-the-week episodes, focusing instead on individual-character story arcs and exploring Clark's origins. Major storylines include Clark's discovery of his Kryptonian heritage and Lex Luthor's escalating conflict with his father, Lionel. The disembodied voice of Clark's father, Jor-El, {{is introduced}}; he communicates to Clark through his spaceship, setting the stage for plots involving his role in fulfilling Clark's earthly destiny. In a fourth-season arc Clark, instructed by Jor-El, searches for three Kryptonian stones which contain the knowledge of the universe and form his Fortress of Solitude. Clark battles Brainiac in his attempts to release the Kryptonian criminal General Zod, and must capture (or destroy) other escaped Phantom Zone criminals. His cousin Kara arrives, and Lex Luthor discovers Clark's secret. The eighth season introduces Davis Bloome (Smallvilles version of Doomsday), and Tess Mercer replaces the departing Lex Luthor. Justin Hartley becomes a series regular as Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) after being a recurring guest in season six. In the ninth season Major Zod (Callum Blue) and other members of Zod's military group are revived (without their Kryptonian powers) by Tess Mercer, and their efforts to regain their powers are the season's central conflict. The final season revolves around Clark's attempts to lose his doubts and fears and become the hero he is meant to be, while confronting his biggest challenges: the coming of Darkseid and the return of Lex Luthor.|$|E

Before he could begin to embark on the first stage, he needed relief from the most {{serious threat to the}} empire: the military pressure from the Ottomans. He did so by taking the humiliating step of <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> peace <b>terms</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans by making, for now, permanent their territorial gains in Iraq and the territories in the north, including Azerbaijan, Qarabagh, Ganja, eastern Georgia (comprising the Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti), Dagestan, and Kurdistan.

Although no one could have bristled more at the power grab of his [...] "mentor" [...] Murshid Quli Khan, he rounded up the leaders of a plot to assassinate the wakīl and had them executed. Then, having made the point that he would not encourage rivalries even purporting to favor his interests, he felt secure enough to have Murshid Quli Khan assassinated on his own orders in July 1589. It was clear that the style of leadership would be entirely different than Mohammad Khodabanda's leadership.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a perspective on}} the relationship between cladistic methods and the study of fossil plants. Paleobotany has been slow in evaluating the potential of these and other explicit methods compared to other branches of systematics. However, the unique or particularly difficult problems paleobotanists face make more interesting, rather than prohibit, their application. A model of a cladistic approach to phylogenetic analysis is introduced in order to evaluate what role fossils, including fossil plants, should play in phylogenetic analysis. Major elements of the model include sets of hypotheses about useful systematic comparison, phylogenetic relationship, evolutionary pattern and process, and age, linked by recursive directional arguments. Arguments at one level only, those linking characters with the cladogram, are viewed as being strictly deductive. Character hypotheses at the highest level are distinguished by the term "cladistic character". When cladistic characters are compatible, estimates of phylogeny suggested by each may be readily combined into a summary result. However, character conflict is common and re{{presents a}} major challenge to the ultimate success of cladistic methods. The main advantage of cladistic characters lies in the attempt to separate out portions of complex phylogenetic hypotheses for independent scrutiny and debate. Under the model of phylogenetic analysis presented here, it is argued that fossils provide morphological information, not obtainable by other means of inquiry, which may {{have a profound effect on}} our view of characters and relationship. Fossils also provide estimates of age useful in two distinct ways. The first involves using age estimates of states, combined with external criteria such as out-group analysis, in providing defensible proximity and polarity proposals for cladistic characters. The second involves using age estimates of entire taxa to judge historical plausibility of a set of phylogenetic hypotheses generated from a cladogram. Incompatible characters may also be analyzed in this way, allowing evaluation of the plausibility of alternative character formulations. The use of fossils in phylogenetic analysis tends to emphasize the necessity of <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>terms</b> explicitly <b>with</b> the ancestor-descendant relationship in cladistic methods. It is proposed that, when properly formulated, the relationship is similar in structure to other phylogenetic hypotheses and at least partly addressed by the hypothetico-deductive format...|$|R
