5|$|The first {{lifeboat}} launched was Lifeboat 7 on {{the starboard}} side with 28 people on board out of a capacity of 65. It was lowered at around 12:45am as believed by the British Inquiry. <b>Collapsible</b> Boat D was the last lifeboat to be launched, at 2:05. Two more lifeboats, <b>Collapsible</b> Boats A and B, {{were in the process}} of being removed from their location on the roof of the officer's house but could not be properly launched. <b>Collapsible</b> B floated away from the ship upside down, while <b>Collapsible</b> A became half-filled with water after the supports for its canvas sides were broken in the fall from the roof of the officers' quarters. There were arguments in some of the lifeboats about going back to pick up people in the water, but many survivors were afraid of being swamped by people trying to climb into the lifeboat or being pulled down by the suction from the sinking Titanic, though it turned out that there had been very little suction. At 2:20am, Titanic herself sank. A small number of passengers and crew were able to make their way to the two unlaunched <b>collapsible</b> boats, surviving for several hours (some still clinging to the overturned <b>Collapsible</b> B) until they were rescued by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe.|$|E
5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a <b>collapsible</b> umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this <b>collapsible</b> umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century <b>collapsible</b> umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese <b>collapsible</b> umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
5|$|From {{literary}} sources it {{is known}} that the <b>collapsible</b> umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed beforehand. This employed sliding levers and bendable joints that could be protracted and retracted.|$|E
5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a <b>collapsible</b> and {{inflatable}} boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|Titanics {{survivors}} {{were rescued}} around 04:00 on 15April by the RMS Carpathia, which had steamed {{through the night}} at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs en route. Carpathias lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on <b>collapsible</b> B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. <b>Collapsible</b> A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors– {{an unknown number of}} men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman– were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner Oceanic, with the bodies still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship's only junior {{officer to}} {{have died in the}} sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown {{following}} Mr. Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch <b>collapsible</b> A.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith {{that it will}} be {{difficult}} to see icebergs without breaking water. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of <b>Collapsible</b> B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Paraplegic Dom Vriess (Dominique Pinon) is the Betty chief engineer. When the Aliens escape their confinement, Vriess {{holds his}} own with a <b>collapsible</b> shotgun while {{separated}} from the group. After he rejoins the group, Christie carries him {{on his back and}} he helps defend the group from the Aliens until Christie sacrifices himself. The group escapes aboard the Betty, in which Vriess and Johner are co-pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} in Afghanistan is the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} <b>collapsible</b> buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro {{was briefly}} fitted with an {{aircraft}} flying-off platform on Turret No. 2 in 1922. She successfully launched Gloster Sparrowhawk and Sopwith Camel fighters from it, {{becoming the first}} Japanese ship to launch aircraft. When she was modernized in the 1930s, a catapult and a <b>collapsible</b> crane were fitted on the stern, and both ships were equipped to operate three floatplanes, although no hangar was provided. The initial Nakajima E4N2 biplanes were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938 and then by Mitsubishi F1M biplanes from 1942 on.|$|E
5|$|Mutsu had an {{additional}} boom {{added to the}} mainmast in 1926 to handle the Yokosuka E1Y floatplane recently assigned to the ship. In 1933 a catapult was fitted between the mainmast and Turret No. 3, and a <b>collapsible</b> crane was installed in a port-side sponson the following year; the ship was equipped to operate two or three seaplanes, although no hangar was provided. The ship was operating Nakajima E4N2 biplanes until they were replaced by Nakajima E8N2 biplanes in 1938. A more powerful catapult was installed in November 1938 to handle heavier aircraft like the single Kawanishi E7K, added in 1939–40. Mitsubishi F1M biplanes replaced the E8Ns on 11 February 1943.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{objective}} of the Japanese at Kranji was to capture Kranji village; this would let them repair the demolished Causeway {{in order to facilitate}} easy flow of reinforcements and supplies down the roads of Woodlands and Mandai, and {{to the rest of the}} island for their vanguard force. Once the leading wave of Japanese was safely ashore, the massed Japanese artillery switched their fire to the defensive positions at Kranji. Telegraph and telephone communications were destroyed in the bombardment and communications between the front line and command HQ were broken. At 8:30pm that night, the men of the Imperial Guards Division began the crossing from Johor in special armoured landing-crafts, <b>collapsible</b> boats and by swimming.|$|E
5|$|The second voyage was {{to reduce}} the {{garrison}} and replace HM Sloop Hound, John Burr Commander, with a smaller vessel, namely the 36-ton shallop Penguin, commander Samuel Clayton. She was a <b>collapsible</b> vessel and was no sooner built than taken apart, and the pieces were stowed in Endeavour. Endeavour sailed in November with Hugh Kirkland as the sailing master, and additionally the crew of Penguin, and four ship's carpenters whose job was to reassemble Penguin on arrival, which was 28 January 1773. On 17 April Endeavour and Hound sailed for England with their crew. One of Penguin's crew was Bernard Penrose who wrote an account. Samuel Clayton also wrote an account.|$|E
5|$|This is {{a variant}} of the special purpose weapon adopted by USSOCOM. The program, which led to both the Mk 46 and Mk 48, was headed by the US Naval Special Warfare Command (NAVSPECWAR). Like the SPW, the barrel {{changing}} handle, magazine insertion well, and vehicle mounting lugs have been removed to save weight. However, the Mk 46 retains the standard M249 plastic buttstock instead of the <b>collapsible</b> buttstock used on the SPW. The Picatinny rail forearm differs slightly from the SPW. The Mk 46 has the option of using the lighter SPW barrel or a thicker, fluted barrel of the same length.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ship}} sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack {{encourage}} her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a <b>collapsible</b> lifeboat by carrying a lost child.|$|E
5|$|The {{first signs}} of panic were seen {{when a group of}} {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. <b>Collapsible</b> boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E
5|$|The solar arrays {{themselves}} were launched and installed {{over a period}} of eleven years, more slowly than originally planned, with the station continually suffering from a shortage of power as a result. The first two arrays, each 38m2 (409ft2) in area, were launched on the core module, and together provided a total of 9kW of power. A third, dorsal panel was launched on Kvant-1 and mounted on the core module in 1987, providing a further 2kW from a 22m2 (237ft2) area. Kvant-2, launched in 1989, provided two 10m (32.8ft) long panels which supplied 3.5kW each, whilst Kristall was launched with two <b>collapsible,</b> 15m (49.2ft) long arrays (providing 4kW each) which were intended to be moved to Kvant-1 and installed on mounts which were attached during a spacewalk by the EO-8 crew in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses {{released}} a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs, making up 13 percent of the survey. 71 percent of M249 users (242 troops) {{reported that they were}} satisfied with the weapon. 40 percent of users preferred feeding the SAW with the soft 100-round pouch, while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200-round pouches each. 60 percent (205 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities, such as handguards, size, and weight - of those dissatisfied, just under half thought that it was too heavy. M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a <b>collapsible</b> stock.|$|E
5|$|Titanic had a {{total of}} 20 lifeboats, {{comprising}} 16wooden boats on davits, 8 {{on either side of}} the ship, and 4 <b>collapsible</b> boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178– barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. Titanic had been designed to accommodate up to 68lifeboats– enough for everyone on board– and the price of an extra 32lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on Titanic. In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.|$|E
25|$|Eighteen {{lifeboats}} were used, loading between 11:45–2:15a.m., though <b>Collapsible</b> Boat A floated off deck partially submerged, and <b>Collapsible</b> Boat B floated away {{upside down}} {{minutes before the}} ship upended and sank.|$|E
25|$|Hoops {{can be made}} <b>collapsible</b> {{for easy}} {{transport}} and versatility: each hoop breaks down into four or more pieces to later be reassembled. Other <b>collapsible</b> hoops are simply twisted down, and folded in half for easy storage.|$|E
25|$|The 40 <b>collapsible</b> {{lifeboats}} {{were transferred}} from troopships {{and put on}} Olympic, and many were rotten and would not open. The crewmen, instead, sent a request to the Southampton manager of the White Star Line that the <b>collapsible</b> boats be replaced by wooden lifeboats; the manager replied that this was impossible and that the <b>collapsible</b> boats had been passed as seaworthy by a Board of Trade inspector. The men were not satisfied and ceased work in protest.|$|E
25|$|By 1900, a paste made of {{hydrogen}} peroxide and baking soda was recommended {{for use with}} toothbrushes. Pre-mixed toothpastes were first marketed in the 19th century, but did not surpass the popularity of tooth-powder until World War I. In 1880, Doctor Washington Sheffield of New London, CT manufactured toothpaste into a <b>collapsible</b> tube, Dr. Sheffield's Creme Dentifrice. He had the idea after his son traveled to Paris and saw painters using paint from tubes. In York in 1896, Colgate & Company Dental Cream was packaged in <b>collapsible</b> tubes imitating Sheffield. The original <b>collapsible</b> toothpaste tubes were made of lead.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{products}} produced by this process are: <b>collapsible</b> tubes, fire extinguisher cases, shock absorber cylinders and gear blanks.|$|E
25|$|Olympic, like Titanic, did {{not carry}} enough {{lifeboats}} for everyone on board, {{and so was}} hurriedly equipped with additional, second-hand <b>collapsible</b> lifeboats following her return to Britain. Towards the end of April 1912, {{as she was about}} to sail from Southampton to New York, 284 of the ship's firemen went on strike, for fear that the ship's new <b>collapsible</b> lifeboats were not seaworthy. 100 non-union crew were hastily hired from Southampton as replacements, with more being hired from Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|George Clooney {{uses the}} Ruger Mini-14 as a sniper rifle with <b>collapsible</b> stock, side-mounted scope and large {{homemade}} silencer in the 2010 film The American.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 2013, <b>Collapsible</b> Lung was {{released}} as expected. The album charted well {{on many of}} Billboard's charts, most notably topping at number No.16 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
25|$|Titanics {{passengers}} {{endured a}} cold night before {{being picked up}} by RMS Carpathia {{on the morning of}} 15 April. Boat 2 was the first to be recovered, at 4:10a.m., with Boat 12 the last, at 8:15a.m. Boats 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 16 were brought aboard Carpathia, with the rest (including all four <b>collapsible</b> boats) set adrift. <b>Collapsible</b> Boat B was found again a few days later by the Canadian cable vessel Mackay-Bennett but an attempt to bring it on board failed and it was abandoned for good.|$|E
25|$|Combi Coupé: A 2-door, 4-seat {{car with}} {{hatchback}} door at rear and, <b>collapsible</b> rear seats, resembling a fastback. The {{idea is to}} maximize the carrying capacity without bargaining on the performance.|$|E
25|$|A {{few hours}} later Lowe rescued the {{survivors}} aboard <b>Collapsible</b> A, which was close to sinking, and brought them aboard lifeboat number 14. The boat rendezvoused with Carpathia at about 7:15a.m.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of LED hoops that hoopers use {{including}} ones with various color LEDs, ones that are programmable {{through the use of a}} microchip and ones that are <b>collapsible.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Collapsible</b> Boat A {{reached the}} deck {{the right way}} up and was being {{attached}} to the falls by Murdoch and Moody when it was washed off Titanic at 2:15a.m. In the chaos, the canvas sides were not pulled up and the boat drifted away from the ship partially submerged and dangerously overloaded. Many of the occupants climbed in from the water but many (at least seven or eight, including the first class passenger Thomson Beattie, the third class passengers Arthur Keefe, Edvard Lindell and Gerda Lindell, {{and a couple of}} firemen) died of hypothermia or fell back into the sea. By the time the survivors were transferred into <b>Collapsible</b> Boat D, only about 12 or 13 people were left alive, Rhoda Abbott, who had lost her two young sons in the water, being the only female. Three bodies, including that of Mr. Beattie, were left in <b>Collapsible</b> A, which was allowed to drift off; they were not recovered until a month later, by , another White Star Line ship.|$|E
25|$|The Dornier Do 32E was a simple, <b>collapsible</b> one-man helicopter, {{designed}} for military use in Germany in the 1960s. Despite initial hopes of large orders and some proposed civilian roles, only three flew.|$|E
25|$|New {{this year}} was a dual master-cylinder braking system and {{optional}} front disc brakes along with Rally II wheels. Also new for 1967 was an energy-absorbing <b>collapsible</b> steering column. Plus, Pontiac added an 8-track Stereo tape player.|$|E
25|$|The {{track was}} the first to race a steeplechase in 1934 which {{featured}} a hurdle, a water jump, a <b>collapsible</b> dummy brick wall and a brushwood hedge. The steeplechase failed to become a permanent fixture in the industry.|$|E
25|$|In the end, about 25 {{people were}} on board when {{it left the}} deck {{under the command of}} Quartermaster Arthur Bright. Two first class passengers, Hugh Woolner and Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson, jumped from A-Deck (which had started to flood) into the boat as it was being lowered, with Björnström-Stefansson landing upside down in the boat's bow and Woolner landing half-out, before being pulled aboard by the occupants. Another first class passenger, Frederick Maxfield Hoyt, who had {{previously}} put his wife in the boat, jumped in the water immediately after, and was hauled aboard by Woolner and Björnström-Steffansson. The number of people on board later increased when about 10–12 survivors were transferred to <b>collapsible</b> D from another boat. Carpathia picked up those aboard <b>collapsible</b> D at 7:15a.m.|$|E
