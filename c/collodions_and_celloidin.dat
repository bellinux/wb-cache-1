5000|$|Alfred Bernhard Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over {{an alleged}} patent infringement. His patent {{specified}} that the nitrocellulose should be [...] "of the well-known soluble kind". After losing the case, {{it went to}} the Court of Appeal. This dispute eventually reached the House of Lords, in 1895, but it was finally lost because the words [...] "of the well-known soluble kind" [...] in his patent were taken to mean the soluble <b>collodion,</b> <b>and</b> hence specifically excluded the insoluble guncotton. The ambiguous phrase was [...] "soluble nitro-cellulose": soluble nitro-cellulose was known as <b>Collodion</b> <b>and</b> was soluble in alcohol. It was employed mainly for medical and photographic use. In contrast, insoluble in alcohol, nitrocellulose was known as gun cotton and was used as an explosive. Nobel's patent refers to the production of Celluloid using camphor and soluble nitrocellulose; and this was taken to imply that Nobel was specifically distinguishing between the use of soluble and insoluble nitrocellulose.

5000|$|After {{unsuccessful}} negotiations, in 1893 Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over patent infringement {{and lost}} the case. It {{then went to}} the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in 1895 but he also lost the two appeals and the Nobel's Explosives Company had to pay the costs. The claim was lost because the words [...] "of the well-known soluble kind" [...] in his patent were taken to mean soluble <b>collodion,</b> <b>and</b> to specifically exclude the water-insoluble guncotton.|$|R
5000|$|The basic opalotype technique, {{involving}} wet <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> silver gelatin, was patented in 1857 by Glover and Bold of Liverpool. Opalotypes exploited {{two basic}} techniques, using either {{the transfer of}} a carbon print onto glass, or the exposure of light-sensitive emulsion on the glass surface to the negative. Opalotype photography, never common, was practiced in various forms until it waned and disappeared in the 1930s. [...] "Milk glass positive" [...] is another alternative term for an opalotype.|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{penetration}} and the solubility of H, O, N, NH 3, H 2 O, HCl gas, CO 2, formic, acetic, chloracetic, dichloracetic acid, glycerol, phenol {{and mercury}} bichloride in dry collodion membranes have been measured. The rate of penetration of H and CO 2 {{is the same}} whether the membrane and gas are dry or whether the membrane is immersed in water. The solubility of CO 2, acetic acid, phenol <b>and</b> water in <b>collodion</b> is completely reversible and {{is proportional to the}} concentration (or vapor pressure) in low concentrations and independent of the surface of the collodion. The size of the pores has been calculated from the vapor pressure of water in the <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> from the rate of flow of water through the membrane. The results do not agree and are not consistent with the observed rates of penetration. The relative rates of penetration of the gases bear no relation to the density of the gas. When the results are corrected for the solubility of the substances in the <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> expressed as the diffusion coefficient in collodion they show that the diffusion coefficient increases rapidly as the molecular weight decreases...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{membranes}} were fabricated from <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> impregnated with papain, inhomogeneously {{through the}} thickness of the membrane. These membranes were placed between reservoirs containing N-alpha-benzoyl arginineamide, a substrate for the enzyme papain. The progress of the reaction was monitored by sampling the reservoirs on each side for ammonia, a reaction product. From these data the diffusion coefficient, enzyme activity, and distribution of enzyme activity of the membrane were estimated. The limitations of this approach are discussed {{in the context of the}} analysis of biological transport systems...|$|R
5000|$|The first plastic {{explosive}} was gelignite, invented by Alfred Nobel in 1875. Prior to World War I, the British explosives chemist Oswald Silberrad obtained British and U.S. patents {{for a series}} of {{plastic explosive}}s called [...] "Nitrols", composed of nitrated aromatics, <b>collodion,</b> <b>and</b> oxidising inorganic salts. The language of the patents indicate that at this time, Silberrad saw no need to explain to [...] "those versed in the art" [...] either what he meant by plasticity nor why it may be advantageous, as he only explains why his plastic explosive is superior to others of that type.|$|R

The bags were surrounded with {{a thick layer of}} fibrous tissue and infiltrated with leukocytes. The exudate was free from bacterial cells.

40|$|Historically, {{photography}} {{has been}} used as a tool to understand the world, shaping cultural perception of all that it captures. It is landscape photography that frames and constructs our view - or our projection - of nature. Human positionality is often about separation and the primacy of human culture, despite the fact that humans are part of nature. Our perception of non-human nature is filtered through photographic representations that reinforce this primacy of human agency. Could a new vision of "landscape" emerge from photography if it is thought of as a material - as matter - rather than a representational medium and a discipline? This paper proposes to use analogue photography as an analogy for earth processes in order to conceptually collapse the space between photo-media and nature. I use the term "analogue" to refer to non-digital, chemically-based photographic processes that use compounds such as: silver iodide (calotype), silver halide (silver-gelatine, chromogenic prints), silver nitrate and mercury (daguerreotype, wet-plate <b>collodion),</b> <b>and</b> ammonium iron citrate and potassium ferricyanide (cyanotype).

50|$|Pierce had a {{reputation}} for being bad-tempered, or at least extremely stern, but his relationship with Karloff was a good one. They both cooperated on the design of the now iconic make-up, with Karloff removing a dental plate to create an indentation {{on one side of the}} Monster's face. He also endured four hours of make-up under Pierce's hand each day, during which time his head was built up with cotton, <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> gum, and green greasepaint (designed to look pale on black-and-white film) was applied to his face and hands. The finished product was universally acclaimed, and has since become the commonly accepted visual representation of Mary Shelley's creation. The Mummy, produced the following year, combines the plot of Dracula with the make-up tricks of Frankenstein, to turn Karloff into an incredibly aged and wrinkled Egyptian prince. Again, Pierce and Karloff's collaboration was critically acclaimed and impressed audiences. Interestingly, that same year, Pierce designed the Satanic make-up for Lugosi in White Zombie, although this was an independent film, rather than a Universal production.|$|R
5000|$|As both {{a chemist}} and a photographer, Maxwell-Lyte made many {{improvements}} to the technique of photographic processing, working with <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> wax paper, and introducing a process of his own invention which he called métagélatine; this process was adopted by several photographers and is described, as the [...] "Metagelatine Dry Process", in Wilson's Cyclopedic Photography. In 1854 he wrote up {{the results of his}} investigations into {{what became known as the}} [...] "honey" [...] process. This was [...] "a method of improving the wet-collodion process by extending the longevity of the sensitized plate" [...] As its name suggests, in this process honey was used both as the preservative solution and in the dusting-in (the 17 June 1854 issue of Notes and Queries contains his description and analysis of his experiments with the process). Maxwell-Lyte's letter appeared a fortnight after George Shadbolt, former editor of the British Photographic Journal, had independently contacted the Photographic Society (now the Royal Photographic Society), giving his description of an identical experiment with honey.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the domain}} of plant chemistry, Braconnot contributed to the {{isolation}} and the description of several compounds, {{most of which were}} shown later to be mixtures of simpler products. Among others, Braconnot discovered gallic and ellagic acids (1818) and pyrogallic acid (pyrogallol) which later enabled the development of photography. He discovered also in 1811 chitin in mushrooms, the earliest known polysaccharide. In 1819, he published a memoir describing {{for the first time the}} conversion of wood, straw or cotton into a sugar by a sulfuric acid treatment. The name glucose was proposed 24 years later by Dumas for a sugar similarly obtained from starch, cellulose, or honey.By the same acid process, Braconnot obtained a [...] "gelatin sugar" [...] (named later glycocolle, now glycine) from gelatin and leucine from muscle fibers. Furthermore, reacting concentrated nitric acid on wood or cotton, Braconnot obtained an inflammable product, xyloïdine (a precursor of <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> nitrocellulose), which could be transformed into a vitreous varnish. This substance may be considered as the first polymer or plastic material created by a chemist.|$|R

40|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia is a {{familial}} cerebellar degenera-tion {{of childhood}} associated with telangiectases and frequent infections {{of the lungs}} and air sinuses. It was first described by Louis-Bar in 1941, but it has only become more widely known since Boder and Sedg-wick {{drew attention to the}} condition with its peculiar and stereotyped symptoms in several papers (Boder and Sedgwick, 1958, 1963, and 1964). The clinical features of some 100 cases have now been recorded but only about a dozen necropsies have been reported. This paper presents the findings in three more necropsies, including some pathological features which have not been described before. MATERIAL AND METHODS The brain, spinal cord, spinal ganglia, samples from peri-pheral nerves and muscles, and from other organs were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde in 10 % saline. Numerous blocks were taken and embedded in paraffin wax. In addition representative portions of the central nervous system from cases 2 and 3 were embedded in celloidin. Frozen sections from nervous tissue were stained for lipids with oil-red-O or Sudan black. Frozen sections of muscle were stained for nerve fibres by the Schofield method (1960). Paraffin <b>and</b> <b>celloidin</b> sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, haematoxylin and van Gieson's mixture, cresyl violet, luxol-fast-blue (with cresyl violet) or Heidenhein's method for myelin, Holzer's method and Mallory's phosphotungstic acid method for glial fibres; nerve fibres were stained by the Palmgren method (1948) in paraffin sections and by the Gros-Bielschowsky method in celloidin sections. Sections from selected blocks were stained with the periodic acid-Schiff technique...|$|R
40|$|Cultures of rat {{cerebellum}} {{grown on}} glass coverslips coated first with <b>collodion</b> <b>and</b> then collagen are fixed in glutaraldehyde to which ruthenium red has been added. After fixation, the collodion {{comes off the}} glass coverslips and the 3 layers: collodion-collagen-culture are handled as one piece. Following immersion in glycerol, selected areas are cut from the piece; the excised areas are a little smaller {{than those of the}} specimen carriers used in a Balzers apparatus. The ruthenium red, which stains all cells and processes, is a good indicator of specimen thickness. The explant which consists of several cell layers is redder than the peri-pheral monolayer of outgrowth. The square areas cut from either the explant or the outgrowth can be matched in thickness according to their shade of red. In frozen specimens, the red colour distinguishes the culture layer from the collodion-collagen support under it and from the white frost on top. During fracturing, the appearance of pink flakes {{on the edge of the}} knife indicates that the culture layer has been cleaved. The growth of cells on collodion-collagen and the fracture of the cultures with a knife, eliminate the restrictions inherent in the use of frozen 'metallic sandwiches'...|$|R
5000|$|... 1851: Wet <b>collodion</b> process <b>and</b> AmbrotypeFrederick Scott Archer {{developed}} the wet collodion processes, which used a thick glass plate unevenly hand-coated with a collodion-based, light-sensitive emulsion. Collodion, which means ‘glue’ in Greek, is nitrocellulose dissolved in ether and ethanol. The Amrotype, {{an adaptation of}} the wet collodion process, was developed by Archer and Peter W. Fry. It involved placing a dark background behind the glass so that the negative image would look positive, and was popular in America until around 1870.|$|R
40|$|Electrophoretic {{studies were}} made on vaccine virus, <b>collodion</b> {{particles}}, <b>and</b> glass particles suspended in 0. 01 molar buffer solutions at pH 7. 9, in which the moving boundary method was used. In some experiments, uncoated particles were used; in others, particles were coated with proteins and then resuspended in the buffer solution after a washing; in still others, an excess of protein which {{had been used to}} coat the particles was included in the buffer medium. Streaming boundaries were obtained with all dilute suspensions of particles in solutions containing no soluble protein instead of the flat ones usually observed with the Tiselius moving boundary technique. This boundary artifact was suppressed by maintaining a density gradient of sufficient magnitude in association with the moving boundary to counteract the tendency of endosmotic flow. This was done partially by increasing the concentration of the particles in the suspensions, and almost completely by retaining an excess of soluble-coating substance in the solutions containing the particles. The mobility of elementary bodies of vaccinia corresponds to that found for the heat-stable (S) antigen. This value was not altered by drying, heating, ether extraction, or simple washing, but was materially increased by treatment with the surface active detergent (duponol) which presumably altered the nature of the surface of the virus particles. Collodion particles coated with the heat-stable antigen of vaccinia had the same mobility as elementary bodies under comparable conditions. Glass particles coated with normal rabbit serum moved at the rate of albumin, the fastest serum component in the buffer solutions used. However, both <b>collodion</b> particles <b>and</b> vaccine virus moved at a somewhat slower rate when they were similarly coated and measured in the presence of an excess of serum in the solutions. This was probably due to adsorption of a small amount of one of the slower components (globulin) of rabbit serum {{on the surface of the}} particles. Simple washing after treatment seemed to remove the coating of serum proteins, at least in part, from both <b>collodion</b> particles <b>and</b> elementary bodies of vaccinia...|$|R
50|$|The {{exhibition}} {{wanted to}} focus on the artistic aspect of photography, not the commercial side, and excluded daguerreotypes. Technology was still fast developing at the time, and the exhibition came at the moment that the older calotype process, with paper negatives, was being replaced by the new collodion process, first described in 1850 and 1851 and already getting very popular. Some 460 exhibited photographs were made with the calotype process, against some 300 for the other processes, mainly the <b>collodion</b> process <b>and</b> albumen prints.|$|R
