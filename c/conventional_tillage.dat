40|$|ABSTRACT Soil {{preparation}} {{along with}} its chemical adjustment {{is the most important}} step in sugarcane plantation, especially because it provides proper conditions for plant development. The objective of the present research was to evaluate sugarcane response to the application of different phosphorus doses and their location, associated with both minimum soil <b>tillage</b> and <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage.</b> The experiment was conducted in a split-split-plot randomized block design, where the main plots were subjected to soil managements (minimum soil <b>tillage</b> or <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage),</b> the subplots to phosphorus doses in total area, and the sub-sub-plots to phosphorus doses in the crop rows. The evaluated variables were soil chemical parameters, sugarcane production and sugar production.

40|$|Combination tillage is {{the name}} that {{has been given to}} a new {{technique}} for killing old sugarcane crops before replanting.

The cane roots are severed and the stool lifted but not inverted, thus leaving the stool in its original position in the row. The results obtained from detailed observations indicate that, a) sugarcane can be killed earlier in the season and at a younger age than with <b>conventional</b> minimum <b>tillage,</b> thereby allowing earlier planting so that the crop can benefit from the more favourable summer growing conditions; b) acceptable kill of the old cane stools can be achieved, even at rates of chemicals 50 per cent lower than those now recommended for <b>conventional</b> minimum <b>tillage.</b> Further experiments are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R

The experiment {{was carried out}} under Mediterranean conditions on a Luvisol, during two growing seasons (1996 / 1997 and 1999 / 2000). Two factors (different soil tillage systems and post-emergence weed control) were studied, with two levels each: Two soil tillage systems and two levels of post-emergence weed control. The <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage</b> system, performed for seedbed preparation after {{the emergence of a}} high percentage of weeds, increases the appearance of monocotyledons, especially Lolium rigidum Gaud. in wheat crops, when compared to their establishment in no-till system. As a consequence of the higher number of monocotyledons there is an increase in weed-crop competition. Without post-emergence herbicide treatment, the wheat crop yield is lower in the treatments with the <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage</b> system and yield reduction is less under no-till system compared to the respective treatments with post-emergence herbicide application...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to monitor the yield {{elements}} and economics at indulgence of the winter barley and economics of the winter rape with usage of conservative technologies (shallow soil loosening, deeper soil loosening without reversion of the soil { [...] } only by the rape) {{in comparison with the}} <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage</b> (tillage).

The number of growths was demonstrably higher at <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage</b> in spring and in autumn. The grain yield and the costs of herbicidal protection were observed.

50|$|Strip tillage {{has some}} {{similarities}} with no-till systems because {{the surface is}} protected with residue. However, strip-till also has a similar effect on soil properties as <b>conventional</b> <b>tillage</b> systems because the farmer still breaks the soil’s crust which allows aerobic conditions to speed the decay of organic matter. A two-year study found that strip-till {{did not affect the}} amount of soil organic carbon or its extractable phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|Strip-till is a {{conservation}} system {{that uses a}} minimum tillage. It combines the soil drying and warming benefits of <b>conventional</b> <b>tillage</b> with the soil-protecting advantages of no-till by disturbing only {{the portion of the}} soil that is to contain the seed row. This type of tillage is performed with special equipment and can require the farmer to make multiple trips, depending on the strip-till implement used, and field conditions. Each row that has been strip-tilled is usually about eight to ten inches wide.|$|E
50|$|With no-till farming, residue {{from the}} {{previous}} years crops lie {{on the surface of}} the field, cooling it and increasing the moisture. This can cause increased or decreased or variations of diseases that occur, but not necessarily at a higher or lower rate than <b>conventional</b> <b>tillage.</b> In order to help eliminate weed, pest and disease problems, crop rotations are used. By rotating the crops on a multi-year cycle, pests and diseases will decrease since the pests will no longer have a food supply to support their numbers.|$|E

40|$|An annual root crop. The tubers {{are either}} sold fresh after harvesting, stored or {{sold in the}} form of mashed potato flakes, fries or chips. Cropping System Early {{potatoes}} (summer potatoes) are planted in March and harvested in July or August. Late potatoes (winter potatoes) are planted in April or May and harvested between September and November (usually September 15 - October 12). A technique called hilling is employed when planting potatoes: mounds of soil are formed around the plants to avoid exposing tubers to light and to make harvesting easier. Hilling also helps control some diseases as well as annual broadleaf and grass weeds. The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. Optimal soil and ambient temperatures for planting are 50 F and 70 F, respectively. A common row width is 34 ", and 15, 000 seed potatoes are planted per acre.

50|$|Another {{problem that}} growers face {{is that in}} the spring the soil will take longer to warm and dry, which may delay {{planting}} to a less ideal future date.

This study was carried out on an Inceptisol, representative of the Santa Catarina highlands, southern Brazil, between November 1999 and October 2001, under natural rainfall. The soil tillage treatments (no replications) were: no-tillage (NT), minimum soil tillage with chiseling + disking (MT), and <b>conventional</b> soil <b>tillage</b> with plowing + two diskings (CT). The crop cycles sequence was soybean (Glycine max), oats (Avena sativa), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and vetch (Vicia sativa). <b>Conventional</b> soil <b>tillage</b> treatment with plowing + two disking {{in the absence of}} crops (BS) was also studied. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were determined in both water and sediments of the surface runoff, while organic carbon was measured only in sediments. Calcium and magnesium concentrations were greater in sediments than in surface runoff, while total losses of these elements were greater in surface runoff than in sediments.
