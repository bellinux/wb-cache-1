A year later CAMRA announced that 'Micropubs leading the way for better beer as new research shows 70% of pubs now serve real ale'.

5000|$|A {{consumer}} organisation, the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) was founded, in 1971, {{to protect}} unpressurised beer. The group devised the term real ale {{to differentiate between}} beer served from the cask and beer served under pressure and to differentiate both from lager. [...] "Ale" [...] now meant a top-fermented beer, not an unhopped beer. <b>Camra</b> was <b>to</b> be come an influential force, with a membership of over 170,000.|$|R

A gray level chest x-ray image is preprocessed using Euler number algorithm <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> lung region. Defined Euler number algorithm is a statistical extraction of data obtained from Euler numbers for binary image. Suitable threshold value is computed based on minimum and maximum of the correlated gray scale value. After lung region was extracted, we applied our defined Opaque Object Filter <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> nodules image window. We use defined filter to perform heuristic search through the chest x-ray image. Defined Opaque Object Filter utilized radius and spatial axis vector analysis <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> nodules image window. Noise filter is defined to eliminate the border of lung area effects. A flow chart for the search is introduced. Initial result shows the filter is able <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> nodules image window within chest x-ray image...|$|R

We shall discuss methods <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> market expectations of future interest rates, exchange rates and inflation rates. Traditionally, {{interest rates and}} forward exchange rates have been used <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> expected means of future interest rates, exchange rates and inflation. More recently, these methods have been refined to rely on implied forward exchange rates, so as <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> expected future time-paths of interest rates, exchange rates and inflatione rates. Very recently, methods have been designed <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> not only means but the whole (risk neutral) probability distribution of future interest rates and exchange rates from a set of option prices. More developed and deeper financial markets, increased international financial integration, and new financial instruments are preconditions for these methods. The survey also reports on available instruments and their suitability for different purposes and methods. Market expectations; interest rates; exchange rates; inflation rates; asset prices...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{describe}} an approach and {{introduce a new}} tool, called JDeTEx, <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> decision tables from Java programs {{in order to give}} the maintenance engineer {{a better understanding of the}} control flow of the program. Decision tables are a compact, yet precise way to model the control flow of computer programs. In order <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the decision tables the explicit and implicit control flow of Java programs needs to be analyzed by the tool. Firstly, the tool uses static byte code analysis <b>to</b> automatically <b>extract</b> information about polymorphic method calls that represent implicit control flow in Java programs. Secondly, the tool uses source code analysis <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> information about explicit control flow in the Java program. The main contribution of this thesis is an approach to instrument Java programs in order <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> decision tables from programs. We use the information extracted during byte code and source code analysis to guide the instrumentation process and show that the instrumentation does not change the execution behavior of the original program. The instrumented program is executed in order <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> the program path which can then b...|$|R
