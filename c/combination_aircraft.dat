On 12 April 1945, nine [...] "Bettys" [...] attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. The destroyer [...] was hit, broke in two, and sank, witnessed by LSMR-189 CO James M. Stewart. [...] destroyed an Ohka with AA fire 45 m (50 yd) from the ship, but the resulting explosion was still powerful enough to cause extensive damage, forcing Jeffers to withdraw. The destroyer [...] was attacked by two Ohkas. One struck above the waterline just behind the ship's bow, its charge passing completely through the hull and splashing into the sea, where it detonated underwater, causing little damage to the ship. The other Ohka narrowly missed (its pilot probably killed by anti-aircraft fire) and crashed into the sea, knocking off the Stanlys ensign in the process. One Betty returned. On 14 April 1945, seven [...] "Bettys" [...] attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. None returned. None of the Ohkas {{appeared to have been}} launched. Two days later, six [...] "Bettys" [...] attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa. Two returned, but no Ohkas had hit their targets. Later, on 28 April 1945, four [...] "Bettys" [...] attacked the U.S. fleet off Okinawa at night. One returned. No hits were recorded.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{application}} of the turbine bypass engine (TBE) concept to high-performance V/STOL aircraft is in progress. The study is designed to identify the most promising TBE cycles for combination with a remote augmentor lift system (RALS), and to compare them with conventional turbofan RALS and lift-plus-lift/cruise concepts. Three cycles chosen for study are 15 - and 30 -percent-bypass-bleed TBE with simple RALS and 15 -percent-bypass-bleed TBE with a turbo-compressor-RALS <b>combination.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> configurations were developed for the 15 -percent-bleed TBE with simple and turbocompressor RALS and sized to a naval, supersonic, deck-launched, intercept mission. Early sizing results indicate that these two concepts give comparable airplane performance, although the simple RALS configuration has some potential design drawbacks that are avoided in the turbo-compressor RALS design...|$|E

40|$|A new cost {{function}} representing {{air traffic controller}} workload is implemented in the Geosect airspace partitioning tool. Geosect currently uses a <b>combination</b> of <b>aircraft</b> count and dwell time to select optimal airspace partitions that balance controller workload. This {{is referred to as}} the aircraft count/dwell time hybrid {{cost function}}. The new cost function is based on Simplified Dynamic Density, a measure of different aspects of air traffic controller workload. Three sectorizations are compared. These are the current sectorization, Geosect’s sectorization based on the aircraft count/dwell time hybrid cost function, and Geosect’s sectorization based on the Simplified Dynamic Density cost function. Each sectorization is evaluated for maximum and average workload along with workload balance using the Simplified Dynamic Density as the workload measure. In addition, the Airspace Concept Evaluation System, a nationwide air traffic simulator, is used to determine the capacity and delay incurred by each sectorization. The sectorization resulting from the Simplified Dynamic Density cost function had a lower maximum workload measure than the other sectorizations, and the sectorization based on the <b>combination</b> of <b>aircraft</b> count and dwell time did a better job of balancing workload and balancing capacity.

50|$|Aircraft {{that need}} control at extreme angles of attack are {{sometimes}} {{fitted with a}} canard configuration, in which pitching movement is created using a forward foreplane (roughly level with the cockpit). Such a system produces an immediate increase in pitch authority, and therefore a better response to pitch controls. This system is common in delta-wing aircraft (deltaplane), which use a stabilator-type canard foreplane. A disadvantage to a canard configuration compared to an aft tail is that the wing cannot use as much extension of flaps to increase wing lift at slow speeds due to stall performance. A <b>combination</b> tri-surface <b>aircraft</b> uses both a canard and an aft tail (in addition to the main wing) to achieve advantages of both configurations.|$|R

An empirical relationship is established between the fin root bending moment, as determined from a multi-strain gauge installation, and a combination of parameters. The parameters from which the combination is selected include translational and rotational accelerations, rates of rotation, rudder angle and angle of sideslip.
