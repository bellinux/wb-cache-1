40|$|Desktop <b>computers</b> <b>based</b> virtual <b>training</b> {{systems are}} {{attracting}} paramount attention from manufacturing industries {{due to their}} potential advantages over the conventional training practices. Significant cost savings can be realized due to the shorter training-scenarios development times and reuse of existing engineering models. In addition, by using <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> virtual reality (VR) training systems, the time span from the product design to commercial production can be shortened due to non-reliance on hardware parts. Within the aforementioned conceptual framework, a haptically enabled interactive and immersive virtual reality (HIIVR) system is presented. Unlike existing VR systems, the presented idea tries to imitate real physical training scenarios by providing comprehensive user interaction, constrained within the physical limitations {{of the real world}} imposed by the haptics devices within the virtual environment. As a result, in contrast to the existing VR systems, capable of providing knowledge generally about assembly sequences only, the proposed system helps in procedural learning and procedural skill development as well, due to its high physically interactive nature. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of ground-based flight training devices in teaching flying skills {{is measured by}} transfer of training, quantifiable by a transfer effective ratio (TER). The incremental transfer effectiveness ratio (ITER) determines the transfer {{effectiveness of}} successive increments of training in the ground trainer. Previous research on a personal <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> aviation <b>training</b> device (PCATD) has shown that this device is effective for teaching instrument tasks (Taylor et al., 1996; 1999). In a later study as predicted by the incremental transfer of training theory of Roscoe (1971)., the greatest transfer of training effect was found for the group that received five hours compared to 10 and 15 hours of prior PCATD training in an airplane (Taylor et al., 2002 b). In some cases the results indicate a complex pattern supporting the notion that more training in a PCATD is not necessarily better. The research reported here sought to replicate the previous findings by Taylor et al. (1996, 1999, 2002 b) using both PCATDs and flight training devices (FTDs). Participants in this experiment were assigned to four flight training device (FTD) groups, one PCATD group, and a control (airplane) group.

The Texas Education Agency, through their Technology Integration in Education (TIE) grant, awarded a grant to the Austin Independent School District (AISD) to fund the development of ATSTAR. Also collaborating on the initiative was Austin Community College, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin Harvard School, Sylvan Learning Center, Far South Community Schools, and Region XIII Education Service Center. Knowbility managed the accessibility of the multi-media interface. The project produced a replicable CD and web-based assistive technology training model designed to prepare instructional staff at the campus level to conduct assessments, collect data, and integrate assistive technology into the instructional setting. As the project was completed, Knowbility assumed management of the program and ATSTAR is now being used by the Georgia Project for Assistive Technology and many other educators and teachers in training.

40|$|Providing a {{consistent}} curriculum {{to educate and}} train more than 2, 000 members of a nursing department and over 1000 nursing students in a tertiary care hospital on a complex clinical documentation system {{can be a challenge}} to the educator. Training new employees on an ongoing basis and an entire department when periodic system upgrades occur requires that the curriculum and methodology be consistent and made available at any time – day or night. In order to maintain consistency of the curriculum and provide the learner with ample opportunity to “play and learn” we use <b>computer</b> – <b>based</b> <b>training</b> video tutorials that we have created in which an instructor’s voice guides the learner through the clinical documentation functionality. In this format, the learner, plays and views a series of video tutorials accessible from the hospital intranet and then uses the online training pathway to practice documentation exercises. This self – paced teaching format allows us to provide a standardized curriculum to a variety of learners including orientees during Nursing Central Orientation, nursing students throughout the year, and large numbers of incumbent staff 24 / 7 whenever system upgrades are implemented. The benefit to using this methodology of education and training includes: · Ease of access for self- paced and active learning at any time · Flexibility to use in either a classroom or as independent learning · Implementation of a standardized curriculum · More time for individual support by instructor during classroom session...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Evaluation of two {{different}} training schedules of a <b>computer</b> <b>based</b> working memory <b>training</b> (BrainStim) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Method: Forty-five MS outpatients were allocated to {{two different}} training groups and a control group without training. Patients with treatment received 16 training sessions scheduled either as a high intensity training (4 times per week for 4 weeks) or as a distributed training (2 times per week for 8 weeks). A neuropsychological test battery including self-report measures was applied at baseline and at retest. The baseline assessment was performed twice at an interval of two weeks to control for possible learning effects. Results: In the outcome measures training for both intervention groups led to significantly improved fatigue symptoms as well as working memory -, and mental speed performances. Log files recorded during training showed a similar increase in levels of difficulty for both intervention groups as training progressed. No effects were found on short term memory, quality of life or depression.

40|$|Abstract—With {{high speed}} vessels getting ever more sophisticated, {{travelling}} at {{higher and higher}} speeds and operating in areas of high maritime traffic density, training becomes of the highest priority to ensure that safety levels are maintained, and risks are adequately mitigated. Training onboard the actual craft on the actual route still remains {{the most effective way}} for crews to gain experience. However, operational experience and incidents during the last 10 years demonstrate the need for supplementary training whether in the area of simulation or man to man, man / machine interaction. Training and familiarisation of the crew is the most important aspect in preventing incidents. The use of simulator, <b>computer</b> and web <b>based</b> <b>training</b> systems in conjunction with onboard training focusing on critical situations will improve the man machine interaction and thereby reduce the risk of accidents. Today, both ship simulator and bridge teamwork courses are now becoming the norm in order to improve further emergency response and crisis management skills. One of the main causes of accidents is the human factor. An efficient way to reduce human errors is to provide high-quality training to the personnel and to select the navigators carefully...|$|R
