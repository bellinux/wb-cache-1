40|$|How {{should the}} issue of {{domestic}} labor standards be handled in the GATT/ WTO? This question {{is part of a}} broader debate over the appropriate scope of international economic institutions such as the GATT, where member-countries are considering proposals for a new round of n 3 negotiations that would move beyond GATT's focus on trade barriers and cover domestic' issues such as labor and environmental standards and regulatory reform which have traditionally been treated with benign neglect' within GATT. Such proposals encroach on traditional limits of national sovereignty, and they raise fundamental challenges to the existing structure of international economics relations among sovereign states. In this paper we consider several approaches to the treatment of domestic labor standards within a trade agreement. We use simple economic arguments to show that, while the benign neglect of labor standards within a trade agreement will result in inefficient choices for both trade barriers and labor standards, direct negotiations over labor standards are not required to reach efficient outcomes. Specifically, we describe two tafiff negotiating structures that deliver efficient outcomes while preserving varying degrees of national sovereignty over policy choices. A first approach <b>combines</b> <b>tariff</b> negotiations with subsequent Kemp-Wan adjustments, under which each government is free to alter unilaterally its policy mix so long as trade volumes are not affected. A second approach adds to the first, under which afte tariff negotiations each governement can alter unilaterally its tariff, but its trading partner is then free to issue a tariff response to stabilize export prices. We show that both approaches deliver govts. to the efficiency frontier but that the second approach provides govts. with greater sovereignty over policy choices and bears a strong resemblance to the negotiating procedures in G...|$|R

In an ex ante investigation of the welfare impact of this price increase on households in Montenegro, we show that the anticipated price increase will result in a very significant increase in households' energy expenditures. A simulation of alternative policy measures analyzes the impact of different tariff levels and structures, focusing on the poor and vulnerable households. Higher electricity prices could also significantly increase the proportion of households using fuelwood for space heating.

40|$|Abstract: The Russian tariff {{structure}} contains over 11, 000 tariff lines, of which about 1, 700 use {{the so called}} “combined ” tariff rate system. For the <b>combined</b> system <b>tariff</b> lines, the actual tariff applied by Russian customs is the maximum of the ad valorem or specific tariff. The lack of available data and the difficulty in calculating the ad valorem equivalence of the specific tariffs have resulted in some previous efforts that have simply ignored the specific tariffs. This is the first paper to accurately assess the tariff rates. The authors show that ignoring the specific tariffs results in an underestimate of the actual tariff rates by about one to three percentage points, depending on the year. The average tariff in Russia has increased between 2001 and 2003 from about 11. 5 to between 13 and 14. 5 percent, but it has held steady in 2004 and 2005. This places Russia’s tariffs at a level slightly higher than other middle-income countries and considerably higher than the OECD countries. The trade weighted standard deviation of the tariff approximately doubled from 9. 5 percent in 2001 to 18 percent in 2003, but then fell to 15. 2 percent by 2005 The food sector and light industry are the aggregate sectors with the highest tariff rates—their tariff rates in 2005 were 23. 1 and 19. 5 percent on a trade-weighted basis, but the increase in their tariffs has not led {{to an increase in}} their output.

DERs {{are different from}} other participants because of their distinctive characteristics: they are located on the demand side and they have some flexibility. DERs bring many streams of benefits for different system participants. Various methods have been proposed to capture and quantify the benefits DERs bring and distribute them to DERs. In general, these methods can be put into two categories: avoided-cost based methods and tariff based methods. Both categories have disadvantages: the avoided-cost methods calculate the benefits indirectly which makes it complicated for DERs to be rewarded. The tariff based methods fail to represent some benefits while mispresent some other benefits. The goal of this work is {{to bridge the gap}} for valuing distributed energy resources. We first evaluate on the tariff based methods: we study the financial impacts of DERs owned by commercial customers on their load serving entity. The study shows the tariff should be modified in order to fairly represent the true values of DERs. Then we design value of DERs tariffs and conduct many case studies to show these tariffs provide DERs with higher savings at the same time reduce the amount of losses the load serving entity experiences. Secondly, we study the avoided-cost based methods. We propose a battery scheduling algorithm that simultaneously maximize multiple streams benefits calculated by avoided-cost methods. Next, we develop a battery aggregator model that <b>combines</b> the <b>tariff</b> based methods with the avoided-cost based methods.

40|$|What {{has driven}} trade booms and trade busts {{in the past}} century and a half? Was it changes in global output or in the costs of {{international}} trade? To address this question, we derive a micro-founded measure of aggregate bilateral trade costs based on a standard model of trade in differentiated goods. These trade costs gauge the difference between observed bilateral trade and frictionless trade in terms of an implied markup on retail prices of foreign goods. Thus, we are able to estimate the <b>combined</b> magnitude of <b>tariffs,</b> transportation costs, and all other macroeconomic frictions that impede international trade but that are inherently difficult to observe. We use this measure to examine the growth of global trade between 1870 and 1913, its retreat from 1921 to 1939, and its subsequent rise from 1950 to 2000. We find that trade cost declines explain roughly 55 percent of the pre– World War I trade boom and 33 percent of the post–World War II trade boom, while a precipitous rise in trade costs explains the entire interwar trade bust. I. Trade Costs International trade costs are the costs of transaction and transport associated with the exchange of goods across national borders and, thus, impede international economic integration. They may also drive many findings in the contemporary open-economy macroeconomics literature, such as home bias in trade and equity (Maurice Obstfeld and Kenneth S. Rogoff 2001). At the same time, economists know little about the magnitude, evolution, and determinants o...|$|R
40|$|We use Mixed-Complementarity-Problem {{programming}} to implement tariff rate quotas (TRQ) {{in the global}} CGE LINKAGE model. We apply the approach to tariff rate quotas in sugar markets in OECD countries. We calibrate the model on 2000 policy levels for OECD countries to reflect the full implementation of their World Trade Organization commitments. We look at reforms of TRQ and TRQ-like schemes in the EU, the United States, and Japan, as well as multilateral trade liberalization. We derive the impact of reforms on welfare, bilateral trade flows, and terms of trade. A 33 -percent multilateral decrease of ad-valorem <b>tariffs,</b> <b>combined</b> with a 33 -percent increase in imports under TRQ-like schemes in the EU, the United States, and Japan, induces a global welfare gain of about 889 million dollars. These three countries' trade policies create substantial trade diversion, which excludes many low-cost producers from trading opportunities. An expansion of their import quotas alone, without multilateral trade liberalization, induces welfare gains but preserves most of the trade diversion patterns. The latter diversion benefits some Least Developed Countries' producers because of granted bilateral TRQ allocations. In the context of greater market access, reductions in tariffs in the EU and the United States, and in border "surcharges" in Japan {{will have to be}} dramatic before they can significantly affect trade flows as compared to TRQ expansion. Full multilateral trade liberalization induces global welfare gains of about $ 3 billion. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
