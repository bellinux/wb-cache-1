50|$|In 1993, <b>Chicago's</b> 24th <b>Police</b> District, which {{includes}} Rogers Park and the adjacent Chicago neighborhood of West Ridge, {{was selected as}} one of five police districts to pilot a new concept for Chicago law enforcement called <b>Chicago</b> Alternative <b>Policing</b> Strategy ("CAPS"). A merger of police and community efforts was implemented, {{which resulted in a}} noticeable effect on crime statistics. Weekly beat meetings (planning and strategy sessions) were held across the 24th Police District. All of <b>Chicago's</b> <b>police</b> districts put the strategy into practice by 1996. Index crimes in the 24th police district fell by about half between 1996 and 2009. According to an e-mail from 49th Ward Alderman Joe Moore, between January 1, 2013 and February 26, 2013, the 24th Police District was the only <b>police</b> district in <b>Chicago</b> in which no one was shot. In that same eight week period, the 24th District reported fewer crimes than all but one of <b>Chicago's</b> 22 <b>police</b> districts.|$|R

5|$|In 2007, Preckwinkle pursued {{disclosure}} of <b>Chicago</b> <b>Police</b> Department officers who used excessive force. The United States District Court had {{ruled that the}} records be unsealed and {{made available to the}} public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order. When the city argued in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to against disclosure, it made the point that aldermen would have access to the information. Preckwinkle's August 23, 2007, request for disclosure was denied.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{prosecutors}} began {{claiming the}} building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar racketeering operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and <b>Chicago</b> <b>police</b> Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{regularly}} tackled {{police misconduct}} issues, {{starting with the}} 1932 case Powell v. Alabama (right to an attorney), and including 1942's Betts v. Brady (right to an attorney), and 1951's Rochin v. California (involuntary stomach pumping). In the late 1940s, several ACLU local affiliates established permanent committees to address policing issues. During the 1950s and 1960s, the ACLU was responsible for substantially advancing the legal protections against police misconduct. The Philadelphia affiliate was responsible for causing the City of Philadelphia, in 1958, to create the nation's first civilian police review board. In 1959, the Illinois affiliate published the first report in the nation, Secret Detention by the <b>Chicago</b> <b>Police,</b> which documented unlawful detention by police.|$|E

5|$|The Cycle Center {{includes}} parking {{for up to}} 300bikes, lockers, an Internet station, a cafe, bike rentals, bike {{repair and}} private stall showers. During business hours, the facility has 100spaces set aside for first-come, first-served usage, but after hours the facility is limited to dues-paying members. In addition to the riders, the <b>Chicago</b> <b>Police</b> Lakefront Bicycle Patrol Unit is stationed at the Cycle Center. As the city's high-profile bicycle parking facility, it {{has served as a}} demonstration location for efforts to lobby for further bicycle accommodations for the Active Transportation Alliance, League of Illinois Bicyclists, and Illinois Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn.|$|E
5|$|When Ruffles Reedy, {{a trumpet}} player, falls dead from rat poisoning, {{a series of}} events ensue. Director Walt Jr. is hanged (the mysterious killer makes it look like a suicide), and his father, the General, has the <b>Chicago</b> <b>Police</b> Department (CPD) get {{involved}} to solve the murder mysteries as the nightly radio performance continues. Herman Katzenback is then killed after attempting to fix the main stage when the machinery malfunctions. Penny is appointed both stage manager and director due to Walt Jr. and Katzenback's deaths. Writer Roger Henderson tries to solve the killings, much to the annoyance of the police, led by Lieutenant Cross.|$|E
5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, <b>Chicago</b> <b>police</b> squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
50|$|The {{dozens of}} small gas pumps {{that were once}} {{scattered}} throughout <b>Chicago’s</b> <b>police</b> stations, fire houses and maintenance facilities {{have been replaced by}} 11 consolidated fueling sites, which dispense diesel fuel (blended with biodiesel), unleaded gasoline, compressed natural gas (CNG), and ethanol. In addition to eliminating environmental issues associated with aging storage tanks, the sites incorporate streamlined fuel delivery and tracking. All fueling transactions are now captured real time, and stored in a database. The data is then analyzed to identify vehicle performance issues or fraudulent fueling activity.|$|R
5000|$|On September 14, 2004, Daley {{and union}} leaders—including the {{president}} of <b>Chicago's</b> <b>police</b> union—unveiled a monument by Chicago artist Mary Brogger, a fifteen-foot speakers' wagon sculpture echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood in Haymarket Square to champion the eight-hour day. The bronze sculpture, intended to be {{the centerpiece of a}} proposed [...] "Labor Park", is meant to symbolize both the rally at Haymarket and free speech. The planned site was to include an international commemoration wall, sidewalk plaques, a cultural pylon, a seating area, and banners, but construction has not yet begun.|$|R
50|$|From 1949 until 1952, Bane was {{a partner}} with {{the law firm of}} Mitchell, Conway and Bane in Chicago. In the early 1950s, Bane also worked as the lawyer {{representing}} the Chicago City Council's Crime Investigating Committee, which focused on organized crime. He quickly concluded that the crime syndicate had corrupted <b>Chicago's</b> <b>Police</b> Department. He later resigned from his post when the Chicago City Council refused to force police officers to disclose sources of income. As a result of his crime -fighting career, he was asked by prominent Chicago Republicans to run for mayor. He declined.|$|R
5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that <b>Chicago</b> <b>police</b> had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or suits against Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 {{the state}} {{passed a law}} authorizing the Illinois Torture Inquiry Relief Commission, to {{investigate}} cases related to convictions of people claiming to have been tortured by Burge and his officers and given coerced confessions, {{to see if there}} was evidence for judicial review and relief. It started to receive cases in 2011. Seventeen cases have been referred to the circuit court and three men freed by April 2016. Another 130 similar cases of torture by <b>Chicago</b> <b>police</b> have been claimed, beyond the scope of Burge and his cohort. The sponsors are trying to have the bill amended to accommodate these victims. In 2015 the City of Chicago announced that it has established a $5.5 million fund for reparations to victims of torture by Burge, and to aid their families. By that time, the city had paid more than $57 million to victims of Burge and his cohort, and another $50 million for defense of the officers.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, Roman Catholic {{priest and}} activist Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina parish in Chicago's Auburn Gresham neighborhood, {{wrote a letter}} to <b>Chicago</b> <b>Police</b> Superintendent Terry Hilliard {{complaining}} of the glorification of violence on The Jerry Springer Show, a popular television show which was produced in Chicago. Burke showed about ten minutes of clips from the show at the April 28, 1999 meeting of the City Council's Police and Fire Committee and convinced aldermen to invite, under threat of subpoena, show host Jerry Springer to testify under oath as to whether the violence on the show was genuine or scripted. If scripted, Burke proposed to force the show to obtain a city entertainment license, and, if genuine, Burke proposed that the off-duty Chicago policemen providing security at the show arrest fighting guests on the set.|$|E
50|$|The term 'co-production' was {{originally}} coined {{in the late}} 1970s by Elinor Ostrom and colleagues at Indiana University to explain why neighbourhood crime rates went up in Chicago when the city's police officers retreated from the street into cars. Similarly to Jane Jacobs' assessment {{of the importance of}} long-time residents to the safety and vitality of New Yorks old neighbourhoods, Ostrom noted that by becoming detached from people and their everyday lives on the streets, <b>Chicago's</b> <b>police</b> force lost an essential source of insider information, making it harder for them to do their work as effectively.|$|R
5000|$|On September 14, 2004, Daley {{and union}} leaders—including the {{president}} of <b>Chicago's</b> <b>police</b> union—unveiled a monument by Chicago artist Mary Brogger, a fifteen-foot (4.5 m) speakers' wagon sculpture echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood in Haymarket Square to champion the eight-hour day. The bronze sculpture, intended to be {{the centerpiece of a}} proposed [...] "Labor Park", is meant to symbolize both the rally at Haymarket and free speech.

5|$|Protests erupted {{soon after}} the release of the video, and on Black Friday protesters shut down part of the city's Magnificent Mile. Public calls for {{resignation}} grew steadily over this period, including a well-circulated op-ed published in The New York Times. By early December, Emanuel's approval rating had sunk to 18%, with 67% of Chicagoans disapproving of his job performance and slightly more than half of those polled calling for his resignation. During the week of December 10, protestors blocked streets and continued to call for Emanuel to resign. Additional protests against Emanuel and <b>Chicago's</b> <b>Police</b> Department were held on the city's busy Michigan Avenue shopping area on December 24, 2015.|$|R
