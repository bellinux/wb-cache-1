40|$|Abstract – The {{design and}} {{application}} of a fuzzy logic based controller to a leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> was presented in this paper. A novel approach based on fuzzy logic to form the tripping action of leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> was investigated. In addition to the theoretical aspect of fuzzy logic, detection of a leakage current, measurement of the leakage current, determination of its duration, trip opening of faulty cases and detailed system architecture were also introduced. The inspected fuzzy logic technique to control the tripping action of the leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> was intended to improve the performance of conventional leakage <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> control for human safety and system reliability.

In this method, first RBFNN determines the fault distance from each fault source and second RBFNN identifies the exact faulty line.

30|$|Injections of DER {{jeopardize}} the existing protection coordination schemes for the distribution system. Impact depends upon number, size, type {{and location of}} DER in the distribution system. Moreover, as the location of DER in distribution system varies, the configuration of distribution systems also changes. Generally, the distribution systems are radial in nature and over current based protection schemes are set for unidirectional flow of fault currents. Penetration of DER usually causes meshed configuration of distribution systems and on majority of distribution feeders, fault current flows in both the directions [4]. The protection schemes which are designed for unidirectional flow of fault currents fails to provide the adequate protection coordination when DER power is injected in the distribution systems. Moreover, there is a requirement of additional number of direction over <b>current</b> <b>relays.</b> The new settings of over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> depend upon the location of new incoming DER in the distribution systems. In addition to these requirements, the impact may also reach to upstream transmission lines connected with downstream DER connected distribution systems. Under such operational conditions, the distance relays installed on the transmission line may result in underreact operation [8].|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} in {{non linear}} loads and the worldwide trend to establish smart grids, harmonic {{level in the}} electricity grids is significantly increased. In addition to their impact on power quality, harmonic current can have a devastating effect on the operation of over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> as {{they are designed to}} operate efficiently at the fundamental frequency. The distorted waveform will affect the operation of the over current rely and may cause the relay to trip under normal operating conditions. To solve this problem, power passive and active filters are employed to eliminate the harmonics and purify the relay operational signal. Passive filters are not cost effective choice to solve this issue. On the other hand, active filters are more complex and need proper and complicated controller. This paper introduces a new and simple approach for adaptive filter design. This approach is economic, compact and very effective in eliminating harmonics in the grid. It can be easily attached with any protective relay to improve its performance.

40|$|Abstract—Directional over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> (DOCR) are {{commonly}} used in power system protection as a primary protection in distribution and sub-transmission electrical systems and as a secondary protection in transmission systems. Coordination of protective relays is necessary to obtain selective tripping. In this paper, an approach for efficiency reduction of DOCRs nonlinear optimum coordination (OC) is proposed. This was achieved by modifying the objective function and relaxing several constraints depending on the four constraints classification, non-valid, redundant, pre-obtained and valid constraints. According to this classification, the far end fault effect on the objective function and constraints, and in consequently on relay operating time, was studied. The study was carried out, firstly by {{taking into account the}} near-end and far-end faults in DOCRs coordination problem formulation; and then faults very close to the primary relays (nearend faults). The optimal coordination (OC) was achieved by simultaneously optimizing all variables (TDS and Ip) in nonlinear environment by using of Genetic algorithm nonlinear programming techniques. The results application of the above two approaches on 6 -bus and 26 -bus system verify that the far-end faults consideration on OC problem formulation don’t lose the optimality.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 37). The project aims at the design {{and the construction of}} a laboratory replica for a commercial numerical over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> using microcontroller and micro CT. It will acquire, sample and covert into digital form the analog current signals from a power system in real time. Then it simulates the working principles of a conventional electromechanical over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> in through a numerical (mathematical) model. Appropriate equations and algorithm have been used. When a current in a part of a power system exceeds a pre-set value either due to a fault or a large overload the relay will isolate the part through sending trip signal to a circuit breaker. In the developed laboratory model, the system is assembled by a lamp board and the circuit breaker is simulated by a hardware solid state (MOSFET) switch. The constructed relay has been tested extensively for various values of load current and two different tripping characteristics (Inverse Definite Minimum Time: IDMT and Definite Time Lag: DTL) have been verified. The project is expected to help students acquire skills in digital logic circuits design and implementation, and applying it in a power system for isolating the faulty part. As commercial numerical relay is expensive, so we have developed for lab demonstration a prototype using cheap and off-the-shelf components to show the working procedures of a numerical over <b>current</b> <b>relay</b> in a power system. The project will also help students develop hands-on skill on numerical relay and enrich their knowledge on the working principle of a relay-breaker combination circuit. Md Rayhanul Amin RumiS. M.

30|$|In the GCM, {{the fault}} current (FC) is contributed by the DER and the utility, where {{as in the}} IM, the FC is contributed mostly by the DER and partly by the ESD. Thus the FC during IM is {{subsequently}} small in magnitude {{as compared to the}} GCM. The distribution line protection mechanism must enable the safe and reliable operation of the microgrid subjected to faults, both in the GCM and IM, respectively [5]. Over <b>current</b> <b>relays</b> [6 – 8], are attractive for GCM of the microgrids, but due to the intermittent nature of the power generation by the DER’s, the bandwidth of the FC becomes very wide, which makes them unreliable. In this regard, some communication based protection strategies [9, 10], and adaptive relay setting based protection strategies [11, 12] have been proposed for microgrids. These strategies are much effective in GCM of operation of the microgrid, but the response for the IM of operation of the microgrid has not been investigated. Some of the other techniques such as sequence component based methods [13] are very much complex, as the synchronization of the relay depends on manifold settings on the plagiaristic sequence components. In this regard, over current differential protection scheme [14] has been proposed for the microgrid which are effective in the GCM but are unreliable in IM due to limited over current magnitudes in the post fault region. Besides the intermittent power generations of the DER in IM require adaptive setting of the over <b>current</b> <b>relays.</b> A <b>current</b> differential <b>relay</b> based microgrid protection scheme [15] has been investigated, but it requires proper CT settings to distinguish between internal and external faults.|$|R
