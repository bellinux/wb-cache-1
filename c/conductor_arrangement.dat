50|$|High-voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) {{transmission}} lines are either monopolar or bipolar systems. With bipolar systems a <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> with one conductor {{on each side}} of the tower is used. On some schemes, the ground conductor is used as electrode line or ground return. In this case it had to be installed with insulators equipped with surge arrestors on the pylons in order to prevent electrochemical corrosion of the pylons. For single-pole HVDC transmission with ground return, towers with only one conductor can be used. In many cases, however, the towers are designed for later conversion to a two-pole system. In these cases, often conductors on both sides of the tower are installed for mechanical reasons. Until the second pole is needed, it is either used as electrode line or joined in parallel with the pole in use. In the latter case the line from the converter station to the earthing (grounding) electrode is built as underground cable, as overhead line on a separate right of way or by using the ground conductors.|$|E

40|$|Many {{wind turbine}} blade {{manufacturers}} have installed lightning protection systems (particularly the down conductor) internally. Having the down conductor internally within the blades would indeed preserve their aerodynamic performance. However, the blades are, as a consequence, vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. Owing to this, the authors believe that {{by having the}} down conductor on the external surface of the blade, the incidence of blade damage would be reduced. The authors have not found any literature {{in the public domain}} that quantifies the effect of having an external down conductor on the aerodynamic performance. Hence, in this paper, a study of the effects of an externally mounted lightning conductor has been undertaken. Simulation studies were carried out using the computational fluid dynamics numerical method available in the COMSOL Multiphysics software package. The results of studies on single <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> have shown that the degradation on aerodynamic performance is least at the trailing edges of the blade. However, it may not be adequate for lightning protection. Therefore, using a similar numerical modelling methodology, simulations were extended and investigated on multiple conductor arrangements where conductors’ locations were varied on an aerofoil surfaces. The results of the aerodynamic modelling suggested that a four <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> may be the best option as it gives more coverage for lightning protection of the wind turbine blades while still having the least reduction (of around 25 %) on lift to drag ratio...|$|E
40|$|Integration {{of passive}} {{magnetic}} devices {{is essential in}} the design of highly efficient power converters. This is due to the necessity to conserve as much space as possible for modern devices such as thin LED TVs and small bright LED illumination. This paper focuses on this multiphysics issue and presents a novel integrated magnetic system (IMS), investigated by the finite element method (FEM). Two different FEM approaches are applied to prove the accuracy of the analyzed data. Both magnetic systems have been developed with a novel capacitor layer design.

40|$|Abstract: During ground faults on {{transmission}} lines, {{a number}} of towers near the fault are likely to acquire high potentials to ground. These tower voltages, if excessive, may present a hazard to humans and animals. This paper presents analytical methods {{in order to determine}} the transmission towers potentials during ground faults, for long and short lines. The author developed a global systematic approach to calculate these voltages, which are dependent of {{a number of}} factors. Some of the most important factors are: magnitudes of fault currents, fault location with respect to the line terminals, <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> on the tower and the location of the faulted phase, the ground resistance of the faulted tower, soil resistivity, number, material and size of ground wires. The effects of these factors on the faulted tower voltages have been also examined for different types of power lines...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} study the power {{frequency}} electric field of UHV AC transmission lines, this paper which models and calculates using boundary element method simulates various factors influencing {{the distribution of the}} power frequency electric field, such as the <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the over-ground height, the split spacing and the sub conductor radius. Different influence of various factors on the electric field distribution will be presented. In a single loop, using VVV triangular arrangement is the most secure way; in a dual loop, the electric field intensity using reverse phase sequence is weaker than that using positive phase sequence. Elevating the over-ground height and reducing the conductor split spacing will both weaken the electric field intensity, while the change of sub conductor radius can hardly cause any difference. These conclusions are important for electric power company to detect circuit. Keywords—boundary element method; electric field distribution; power frequency electric field; UHV I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, manufacturing and test results of HTS coils for single-phase resistive current limiters using two different Bi- 2223 /Ag tapes. Two coils were separately wound on cylindrical G- 10 tubes with helical path. One of the coil was wound in a bifilar <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> aiming at reducing the self-inductance. The maximum flux density is 40 mT on the HTS tape for both coils and the calculated inductance is 5. 76 µ H for the noninductively wound coil and 28. 3 µ H for the conventional one. The two coils were individually tested under DC and AC currents. The DC power loss was {{calculated from the}} measured voltage-current values product and the AC power loss {{was determined by the}} liquid nitrogen mass boil-off measurement.

40|$|In general, {{there are}} three {{components}} making up a lightning protection system for wind turbines. These are the receptors, the down conductor and the grounding grid. Receptors and down conductors are usually found in the more recent wind turbine blades and where the down conductors are normally installed on the internal side of the blade. Consequently, the blades are vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. The authors believe that a system with an external down conductor is likely {{to reduce the risk}} of damage when compared to the system having an internal down conductor. One could envisage an external down conductor would look similar to the one installed on a building or an aircraft. However, external down conductors may compromise the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. This paper reports the effect of external down conductors on the pressure coefficient distribution around the turbine blade. The blade profile (aerofoil) used is according to NACA 4418. Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), were conducted on an aerofoil without and with external down conductors of 1 mm thickness. The k-ɛ turbulence model that is incorporated in COMSOL Multiphysics (CFD Module) was used for the simulation and the wind speed and angle of attack used was 5 m/s and 5 ˚ respectively. The preliminary results show that the degradation on aerodynamic properties may not be too significant and these indicate that external down <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> could be considered...|$|E

40|$|In Permanent Magnet (PM) machines, a turn-turn Short-Circuit (SC) {{fault is}} the most {{critical}} fault to eradicate. The fault introduces high SC current in the shorted turn which may consequently lead to secondary faults unless the fault is appropriately controlled. This paper proposes feasible conductors’ placement in a slot of PM machine to minimize such turn-turn fault current. In order to minimize the fault current, the <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> in a slot is optimized using multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) incorporating with both analytical and Finite Element (FE) numerical tool. The possible combinations of conductors’ placement are set as variables and optimized for a given machine which is designed for safety critical applications. It is shown that the fault current associated to a single turn fault can be significant for the random winding placement even though the remedial strategies are put in place. It is also shown that the fault current can be limited significantly by rearranging the winding placement {{in a way to}} share slot-leakage fluxes. This is confirmed via experiment on E-core. Influences of the winding arrangement on both frequency dependent resistances and windings capacitances are experimented. It is demonstrated that adopting the winding arrangement that shares the slot-leakage flux effectively benefits to minimize the AC losses in addition to improved fault tolerance. But it increases the turn-turn capacitances whose effect however can be neglected as the resonance frequency occurs beyond the operational frequency range of the machines of interes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effects of}} harmonic distortion of load current & voltages on distribution transformers, the standard ways of calculating the harmonic effects & design & development of K Factor transformer, which can operate under a specific harmonic environment. The usage of non-linear loads on power systems has increased the awareness of the potential reduction of a transformer's life due to increased heat losses. The performance analysis of transformers in a harmonic environment requires knowledge of the load mix, details of the load current harmonic content & total THD. The additional heating experienced by a transformer depends on the harmonic content of the load current & the design principals of the transformer. // Both No load & Load losses are effected {{by the presence of}} harmonics in load currents. But the variation in load losses contributes more to excessive heat generation in distribution transformer. Increment in no load losses in a distribution transformer due to harmonics is less compared to the load loss but it has a significant contribution to the capitalization cost when operating in longer term. The load loss components get affected by the harmonic current loading are the I 2 R loss, winding eddy current loss & the other stray losses. The methods of predicting extra losses are described in this thesis and standard ways of de-rating transformers are also discussed. // The K-FACTOR method is an approximation of the total stray loss heating effect, including the fundamental and harmonic contributions & finally new design techniques for K-F ACTOR transformers are discussed. In designing of K-F ACTOR transformers different design techniques like parallel <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement</b> for windings, lower flux density & introduction of static shields are discussed & the estimated results are compared with actual implemented results...|$|E
40|$|D. Ing. Changes in the {{preferred}} technologies used in modem switched mode power supplies {{are driven by}} {{the need for a}} decrease in cost of manufacturing while maintaining the highest possible power density. Modem materials allow smaller components to be manufactured without affecting their electromagnetic properties but thermal problems still impair efforts to further reduce their size. Increased switching frequencies cause increased conductor and core losses in magnetic components such as inductors and transformers. Amongst other advantages the increased surface area of low-profile planar structures allow better removal of the heat generated in the component and this work reevaluates conductor optimization for specific planar inductor windings. Conductor optimization has been a topic thoroughly investigated over the last few decades and these techniques have been adopted for planar winding design. It will be shown that the process involved in the manufacturing of helical planar windings allows further exploitation of the basic optimization process. A per-layer optimization technique, earlier proposed by other researchers and deemed impractical at the time, is revised and it is shown here that it can be successfully implemented in the chosen winding type. The per-layer optimization is also extended to accommodate non-sinusoidal current waveforms in this work. Other facets of loss reduction are also addressed. Windings are shaped in the region of air gaps in magnetic circuits to reduce the losses caused by the fringing flux intersecting the conductors but since the shaping influences both the ac-resistance and dc-resistance of the winding an optimization process is required to find the optimal <b>conductor</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Contributions are made with regard to speeding up the process of finding the optimal layout of conductors around the air gap by devising a simple model for the flux distribution of the fringing flux. The effect of combining the per-layer optimization technique with these shaping techniques is exploited to its full potential in this work and contributes largely to loss reduction in helical inductor windings carrying currents containing ac- and dc components. The optimization time is reduced by allowing winding shaping while maintaining the dc-resistance of each layer. The optimal winding shape then becomes a function of the window constraints for a chosen core rather than finding it through conventional methods. Case studies, complete with FEM-simulations and experimental measurements, are offered in support of the proposed solutions. Manufacturing issues are dealt with and loss measurement techniques developed as part of this work...|$|E
