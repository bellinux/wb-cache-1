40|$|AbstractThe self-frequency-doubling (SFD) crystal is a {{representative}} of multifunctional crystals. In recent years, SFD <b>crystals</b> <b>and</b> lasers have gained renewed attention based on the progress on SFD <b>crystals</b> <b>and</b> lasers and Nd:RECa 4 O(BO 3) 3 (RE = Y or Gd) crystals, with SFD lasers becoming commercial products. Here, we review the advances of SFD <b>crystals</b> <b>and</b> lasers, including the basic selection rules, theoretical analysis and recent progress of some potential SFD <b>crystals</b> <b>and</b> lasers. The Nd:RECa 4 O(BO 3) 3 <b>crystals</b> <b>and</b> lasers are highlighted, and their applications are also proposed and discussed, which may provide some inspiration for the further development of the SFD field and multifunctional materials...|$|R

5|$|The {{first use}} of SiC was as an abrasive. This was {{followed}} by electronic applications. In {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, silicon carbide was used as a detector in the first radios. In 1907 Henry Joseph Round produced the first LED by applying a voltage to a SiC <b>crystal</b> <b>and</b> observing yellow, green and orange emission at the cathode. Those experiments were later repeated by O. V. Losev in the Soviet Union in 1923.|$|E

5|$|As these larger water {{droplets}} descend, coalescence continues, so that drops become heavy enough to overcome air resistance and fall as rain. Coalescence generally happens {{most often in}} clouds above freezing, and {{is also known as}} the warm rain process. In clouds below freezing, when ice crystals gain enough mass they begin to fall. This generally requires more mass than coalescence when occurring between the <b>crystal</b> <b>and</b> neighboring {{water droplets}}. This process is temperature dependent, as supercooled water droplets only exist in a cloud that is below freezing. In addition, because of the great temperature difference between cloud and ground level, these ice crystals may melt as they fall and become rain.|$|E
5|$|Charizard {{made its}} video game debut in 1996 with the Japanese release of Pokémon Red and Blue. It is {{available}} only through Pokémon evolution from the starter Pokémon Charmander. In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and <b>Crystal,</b> <b>and</b> their remakes, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, Charizard is used by Red, who acts as the games' final boss. Charizard {{is one of several}} Pokémon in Pokémon X and Y that is able to use the new Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming either Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y. It was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pokémon X and Y. Charmander (along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle) was added to the game in a significant role in order to allow players to experience Charizard's Mega Evolution.|$|E
5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that <b>Crystal</b> <b>and</b> Reiner did every night.|$|E

5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with <b>crystal</b> <b>and</b> candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the <b>crystal</b> <b>and</b> typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E

Tellah casts Meteor to stop Golbez, sacrificing his own life in the process. However, the spell only weakens Golbez, ending his mind control of Kain.

5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} wares in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, <b>crystal,</b> <b>and</b> many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal means of access.|$|E

When Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, {{afterwards}} questions the king's motives, he is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain, his friend and Captain of the Dragoons, to deliver a ring to the Village of Mist. There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters burst forth from inside the ring and lay waste to the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons a monster named Titan in anger. This monster causes an earthquake, separating Cecil and Kain. Cecil awakens afterward and takes the wounded Rydia to a nearby inn. Baron soldiers come for Rydia but Cecil defends her, and she joins him on his journey.|$|E
5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, it is not as well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a <b>crystal</b> <b>and</b> therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E
