40|$|Amylose readily reassociates to form {{films and}} {{crystalline}} structures that {{are resistant to}} digestion by amylolytic enzymes and known as resistant starch type III (RS 3). This study investigated the RS 3 formation and cereal coating properties from enzyme-modified <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> with varying amylose contents, including Hylon VII (70 % amylose), Hylon V (50 % amylose), and common corn (25 % amylose). For RS 3 formation, <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> were first gelatinized and then hydrolyzed using β-amylase to varying degrees. The resultant hydrolyzed starch was debranched with isoamylase and then exposed to 3 times of temperature cycling at 135 / 133 / 133 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 24 hr to promote RS 3 formation. For cereal coating applications, <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> were gelatinized and debranched, and then sprayed onto ready-to-eat breakfast cereal flakes. The proportions of amylose and amylopectin long and short chains were affected by the β-amylase treatment and varied with starch type. All three <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> had increased RS contents after moderate β-amylolysis with Hylon V having the highest RS content at 70. 7 % after 4 hr of β-amylolysis. The RS content {{was positively correlated with}} amylose and amylopectin long chains, but negatively correlated with amylopectin short chains. A starch film of 50 - 130 μm was observed with scanning electron microscopy {{on the surface of the}} cereals coated with Hylon VII. After soaking in milk for 3 min, the peak force of the cereals coated with <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> were higher than those of the controls. The cereals coated with Hylon VII were found to have an increase in dietary fiber content. The results suggest that RS 3 formation is affected by starch composition as well as starch structure and can be increased by moderate β-amylolysis.

HHP has been known to affect high molecular weight polymers causing phase change. Starch has been gelatinized on the order of 600 - 700 MPa, at 25 C. Gelatinized starch recrystallizes during storage affecting the texture and shelf life of food products. HHP was applied to <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>starch</b> to study the effects of storage temperature and time on recrystallization of starch in HHP induced starch gels and on the stability of aqueous suspensions of starch. The effect of storage temperature on re-crystallization kinetics of gelatinized <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>starch</b> were evaluated using a differential scanning calorimeter. The textural properties of gelatinized <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>starches</b> during storage were monitored as a function of time using a rheometer. The rate of retrogradation depended on the storage temperatures (23 C and 4 C) and the botanical origin of <b>starch.</b> The <b>corn</b> and wheat <b>starch</b> stored at 23 C exhibited characteristics of strong gels {{for a longer period of}} time than that of the starches stored at 4 C.

Starches are often treated by alkali or thermal gelatinization to enhance their dissolution before being used in iron ore flotation.

In this paper, four <b>corn</b> <b>starches</b> (waxy, normal, G 50 and G 80) differing in the mass ratio of amylopectin to amylose were used to investigate the starch solubility as a function of solution preparation temperature and pH. It was found that the starch solubility increased with increasing the solution preparation temperature, pH, or the mass ratio of amylopectin to amylose. Three stages of starch dissolution (swelling – rupturing – releasing starch molecules/ghost) were observed, and the tendency for the rupturing followed the order of waxy starch > normal starch > G 50 > G 80, indicating that a starch with higher amylopectin content could be more readily dissolved. Micro-flotation tests were carried out for pure hematite and quartz and their mixture with these four starches dissolved at different temperatures and pHs. The results suggest that there is a strong correlation between starch solubility and the depressing ability.

The solid JATO fuel invented by Parsons consisted of amide, <b>corn</b> <b>starch,</b> and ammonium nitrate bound together in the JATO unit with glue and blotting paper. It was codenamed GALCIT-27, implying the previous invention of 26 new fuels. The first JATO tests using an ERCO Ercoupe plane took place in late July 1941; though they aided propulsion, the units frequently exploded and damaged the aircraft. Parsons theorized that this was because the ammonium nitrate became dangerously combustible following overnight storage, during which temperature and consistency changes had resulted in a chemical imbalance. Parsons and Malina accordingly devised a method in which they would fill the JATOs with the fuel in the early mornings shortly before the tests, enduring sleep deprivation to do so. On August 21, 1941, Navy Captain Homer J. Boushey, Jr.—watched by Clark Millikan and William F. Durand—piloted the JATO-equipped Ercoupe at the March Air Force Base in Moreno Valley, California.
