5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in <b>combination</b> with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent <b>combination</b> with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent <b>combination</b> with doxorubicin, only in sequential <b>combination.</b> Though concurrent <b>combination</b> of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the <b>combination</b> resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- A �-way {{combinatorial}} test set {{is designed to}} detect failures that are triggered by <b>combinations</b> involving no more than � parameters.

Identifying such <b>combinations</b> can facilitate the debugging effort, e. g., by reducing {{the scope of the}} code that needs to be inspected. In this paper, we present an approach to identifying failureinducing <b>combinations,</b> i. e., <b>combinations</b> that have caused some tests to fail. Given a �-way test set, our approach first identifies and ranks a set of suspicious <b>combinations,</b> which are candidates that are likely to be failure-inducing <b>combinations.</b> Next, it generates a set of new tests, which can be executed to refine the ranking of suspicious <b>combinations</b> in the next iteration. This process can be repeated until a stopping condition is satisfied. We conducted an experiment in which our approach was applied to several benchmark programs. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively and efficiently identify failure-inducing <b>combinations</b> in these programs...|$|R

40|$|Background]In higher {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, complex protein domain <b>combinations</b> {{contribute to}} various cellular {{functions such as}} regulation of intercellular or intracellular signaling and interactions. To elucidate the characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie such domain <b>combinations,</b> {{it is essential to}} examine the different types of domains and their <b>combinations</b> among different groups of eukaryotes. [Results]We observed a large number of group-specific domain <b>combinations</b> in animals, especially in vertebrates. Examples include animal-specific <b>combinations</b> in tyrosine phosphorylation systems and vertebrate-specific <b>combinations</b> in complement and coagulation cascades. These systems apparently underwent extensive evolution in the ancestors of these groups. In extant animals, especially in vertebrates, animal-specific domains have greater connectivity than do other domains on average, and contribute to the varying number of <b>combinations</b> in each animal subgroup. In other groups, the connectivities of older domains were greater on average. To observe the global behavior of domain <b>combinations</b> during evolution, we traced the changes in domain <b>combinations</b> among animals and fungi in a network analysis. Our results indicate that there is a correlation between the differences in domain <b>combinations</b> among different phylogenetic groups and different global behaviors. [Conclusion]Rapid emergence of animal-specific domains was observed in animals, contributing to specific domain <b>combinations</b> and functional diversification, but no such trends were observed in other clades of eukaryotes. We therefore suggest that the strategy for achieving complex multicellular systems in animals differs from that of other eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{argues that}} {{particle}} verb <b>combinations</b> do not display a uniform structure but are represented {{either as a}} small clause structure or a complex V’-structure. The central claim is that particle verb <b>combinations</b> fall into two classes semantically—transparent vs. idiomatic particle verb combinations—and that this interpretive difference {{is reflected in the}} syntactic structure of particle verb <b>combinations.</b> It is argued that transparent particle verb <b>combinations</b> involve a small clause structure whereas idiomatic particle verb <b>combinations</b> involve a complex V’-structure. The arguments for different structures come from a number of syntactic and semantic properties (in particular, thematic properties of the two kinds of particle verb <b>combinations,</b> predication contexts, topicalization, verb second, and verb (projection) raising contexts) that consistently differentiate between transparent and idiomatic particle verb <b>combinations.</b> The analysis proposed does not only bear on the structure of particle verb <b>combinations</b> but also has consequences for the theoretical status of PF-movement. 1...|$|R
