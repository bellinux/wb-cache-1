5|$|In {{terms of}} spill prevention, the {{pipeline}} was designed with one-way valves (so oil moving ahead could not leak {{out of a}} hole behind a certain point), <b>computer-aided</b> leak detection, and other features. The pipeline {{was designed to be}} pressurized, so any leak would be instantly detected by a loss of pressure at one of the pump stations, which could sound an alarm and halt the flow of oil quickly.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used <b>computer-aided</b> design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
5|$|Mansoor Ijaz {{began his}} career on Wall Street in 1986, joining Van Eck Associates Corporation as a {{technology}} analyst. In 1990, Ijaz left Van Eck to start Crescent Investment Management LLC, where he developed a trading system, <b>Computer-Aided</b> Regression Analysis Techniques, to manage his first hedge fund. His mentor at Van Eck, Klaus Buescher, joined Crescent as president in 1991, and they together managed the company until Buescher's death in June 1997. Since that time, Ijaz has remained active as Crescent's owner, operating it as a quantitative investment adviser and venture investing firm.|$|E
5|$|Pitt has a {{sustained}} interest in architecture, even taking {{time away from}} film to study <b>computer-aided</b> design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{auditing}} {{is often}} confused with <b>computer-aided</b> auditing. The {{purpose and scope}} of the two techniques, however, are quite different. <b>Computer-aided</b> auditing employs end user technology including spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel, to allow traditional auditors to run audit-specific analyses as they conduct the periodic audit. Continuous auditing, on the other hand, involves advanced analytical tools that automate a majority of the auditing plan. Where auditors manually extract data and run their own analyses in <b>computer-aided</b> auditing during the course of their traditional audit, high-powered servers automatically extract and analyze data at specified intervals as a part of continuous auditing.|$|E

25|$|<b>Computer-aided</b> {{detection}} (CADe) {{systems are}} usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections. <b>Computer-aided</b> diagnosis (CADx) systems evaluate the conspicuous structures. For example, in mammography CAD highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense {{structures in the}} soft tissue. This allows the radiologist to draw conclusions {{about the condition of}} the pathology. Another application is CADq, which quantifies, e.g., the size of a tumor or the tumor's behavior in contrast medium uptake. <b>Computer-aided</b> simple triage (CAST) is another type of CAD, which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories (e.g. negative and positive). CAST is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging, where a prompt diagnosis of critical, life-threatening condition is required.|$|E
25|$|Early {{detection}} of pathology {{can be the}} difference between life and death. CADe can be done by auscultation with a digital stethoscope and specialized software, also known as <b>Computer-aided</b> auscultation. Murmurs, irregular heart sounds, caused by blood flowing through a defective heart, can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity. <b>Computer-aided</b> auscultation is sensitive to external noise and bodily sounds and requires an almost silent environment to function accurately.|$|E
25|$|Many {{mechanical}} engineering companies, {{especially those in}} industrialized nations, have begun to incorporate <b>computer-aided</b> engineering (CAE) programs into their existing design and analysis processes, including 2D and 3D solid modeling <b>computer-aided</b> design (CAD).

25|$|<b>Computer-aided</b> {{detection}} (CADe), {{also called}} <b>computer-aided</b> diagnosis (CADx), are systems that assist {{doctors in the}} interpretation of medical images.

CAD systems process digital images for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections, such as possible diseases, in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professional.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1980, the rumours {{surrounding}} CATIA {{reached the}} very top of the company and Marcel Dassault, then aged 88, asked for a demonstration of the software capabilities. The company management understood the engineers' vision and started to discuss how to leverage their innovation. They quickly realised they could not afford to keep and develop this invention internally and decided to create a new company - led by Francis Bernard - to explore the <b>Computer-aided</b> Design and <b>Computer-aided</b> Manufacturing market (CAD/CAM).|$|E
25|$|ND {{started working}} {{to find new}} market {{segments}} it could create tailor-made systems for on top of its existing product lines. The first such market was <b>computer-aided</b> design and <b>computer-aided</b> manufacturing, but this was largely rejected by the international sales divisions. Of fear of the company failing completely the side, projects were abandoned as was the Ndix project. 1988 became the first year since 1967 that Norsk Data {{did not make a}} profit. That year also saw the company's share equity halve.|$|E
