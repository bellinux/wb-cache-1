40|$|Beyond the diluted {{community}} concept: {{a symbolic}} interactionist perspective on online social relations 1 JAN FERNBACK Temple University, USA The study of <b>cybercommunity</b> is inevitably {{linked to the}} development of the internet amid other cultural phenomena, and <b>cybercommunity</b> as a cultural practice has clearly reached a point of critical mass. The concept of online community has become increasingly diluted as it evolves into a pastiche of elements that ostensibly ‘signify ’ community. This study grapples with the concept of community in cyberspace and suggests alternative way...|$|E
40|$|The {{communication}} {{education and}} training programs is highly competitive relative to other social science programs in the ASEAN region. This is the impression I gathered when I visited some universities in the ASEAN in 1992. However, the rapid changes in the region suggest that we should strive to make our communication curricula more responsive to the realities in the area. The rapid socioeconomic, geopolitical and techno-cultural changes that we have increasingly experienced in the ASEAN community suggest the urgent need to re-tool our communication programs {{in line with the}} emerging <b>cybercommunity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Advanced cyber{{communities}} are {{communities in}} which perfect surveillance is possible – software tools allow everything to be observed, recorded, archived, pored over {{at a later date}} and acted upon. Hence, one expects that these surveillance technologies ought to be heavily used and effective in controlling deviance in these cybercommunities. Drawing on our research in the <b>cybercommunity</b> Second Life, we observe that surveillance technologies are not heavily used to deal with deviance; instead, it is the power of relationships that form the fabric of social control and the regulation of deviance. This discovery questions the effectiveness of technology as a regulator, both in Second Life and in the real world, as well as evidences the importance of social bond as a mediator of deviance...|$|E
40|$|This book {{considers}} {{the diversity of}} gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered identities in countries including Korea, Thailand, China, Malaysia, India, Singapore, and the Philippines. Although many Asian cultures borrow {{the language of the}} West when discussing queerness, the attitudes, relationships, and roles described are quite different. Some of the topics included in this volume are globalization theory {{in the context of the}} Western gay identity movement, Foucauldian discourse on sexuality and distinct erotic cultures, the formation of gay <b>cybercommunities</b> in Asia, the effects of film and video images, class distinctions on Jakarta lesbians, and political and cultural analyses of gay and lesbian comradeship and filial relationships in Chinese societies...|$|R
40|$|Ireland is {{considered}} by international adepts of new religious movements and Celtic Christians alike as a liminal space where the sacred is more easily accessible than elsewhere in the world. Many of those who claim Irish roots seek to redefine their religious identity {{in such a way}} that they may reconnect with their ancestors' homeland. Some travel to Ireland to take part in Celtic pilgrimages or other such activities, whose purpose is precisely to experience liminality and be reborn to a new identity. Others choose to reinvent Ireland as a liminal space on the internet. The proposed paper will explore the different approaches to this re–invented Ireland (<b>cybercommunities,</b> international internet "religions" based in Ireland etc.) and comment on the internet as a medium through which new religious or semi-religious communities may be created. It will argue that the nature of the medium leads to the necessary redefinition of conceptions of the other world, which can be accessed beyond the screen...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} range of {{literacy}} events that occur in one <b>cybercommunity</b> whose members are participants in the ongoing role play, "Cybersphere. " A sample text produced by users within the community serves as the focus for critical analysis and offers a rich example {{of the ways in}} which language is being used within cyberculture. Some of these ways replicate offline communication, while others are unique to cyberculture and deserve close inspection if people are to understand the complexities of the literacy being adopted by students. The paper concludes that virtual environments flourish across the Web, and educators have much to gain by accessing the technology and involving their students. Contains 12 references.

40|$|With {{the trend}} of globalization, more and more Chinese migrate into other {{countries}} for business or family reasons, andbecame {{a part of the}} society in which they set up their new lives. In the fast developing digital environment, overseas Chinese’s lives have been impacted by the digital media to a large degree. For instance, the use of Internet gives chance to overseas Chinese to revitalize the Chinese-ness once aboard,and gives forms to their identities. The digital forum is an important example of how new media function in respect to identity construction. This thesis expands a research of the biggest digital forum for Chinese in Netherlands to investigate how the overseas Chinese identity constructs in the <b>cybercommunity.</b> It shows that the overseas Chinese identity (in my case, in the Netherlands) is vitalizedthrough cybercommunities, especially when their so–called “Chineseness” is under attack...|$|E
40|$|This study applies Quan and Wang (2004) {{structural}} {{model of the}} tourist experience to a netnographic analysis of the food experience offered in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. The food experience {{in this context is}} conceptualised both as a peak experience, as well as simply an extension of daily life. Netnography makes use of tourists 2 ̆ 7 “word-of-mouse”, taking advantage of an evergrowing <b>cybercommunity</b> which specifically relates to food tourism. Two hundred and eighty-five online reviews of five Victoria Falls restaurants were analysed. Thematic findings illustrate the nuanced nature of food experiences, including tourists 2 ̆ 7 interest in authenticity, as well as food neophilia and food neophobia. The study also demonstrates the potential of Internet-based, qualitative research methods to illuminate current understanding of tourist experience, while assessing Quan and Wang 2 ̆ 7 s model in terms of its potential and usefulness in modelling the touristic food experience...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} culture of the Hotline Cyber Community of Practice, and to investigate how new users ("newbies") acquire the necessary linguistic and social skills to acculturate to this community. The study of the culture of the Hotline Cyber Community of Practice (CyberCoP) considers the values, norms, and traditions of the community, and focuses on the aspects of belonging and the distinction between groups: newbies and advanced users. It analyses the Hotline CyberCoP by taking the reader through the acculturation process as experienced by newbies. Newbies are initially ignorant of every aspect of the culture of the Hotline CyberCoP, whereas advanced users have knowledge of the program, language, behaviour, and even secret codes. This study takes what is principally an ethnomethodological approach, as it analyses the characteristics and interconnectedness of categories in the data set. Data were collected over an eleven-month period in order to verify categories in the data set. Informants were also used to help decode the higher-level aspects of the in-group 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge base. It was found that newbies go through a process of change, both linguistically and in terms of acquiring group membership through Legitimate Peripheral Participation. They have to undertake a number of tasks in order to become functioning members of the Hotline <b>Cybercommunity</b> of Practice. These include creating a social identity, playing roles, learning group mores, and group language practices. Even advanced members are not exempt from the acculturation process, which in important respects is continuous and incremental as the culture of the <b>Cybercommunity</b> evolves. The study contributes to an understanding of interpersonal communication, language, culture, naming, personal identity, customs, and the processes of acculturation in an online CyberCoP. It also contributes to a wider understanding of acculturation, and of online interactive communication, communities, and discourse. The significance of the research is that it is the first study of the Hotline Cyber Community of Practice to be undertaken. Because Hotline was established in the 1990 s the program contained many more features and members had more control over the entire CyberCoP than newer technologies such as Skype and Facebook. An understanding of the processes and dynamics of group formation, and maintenance provides a rare opportunity to examine the creation and management of a group ethos, and gives greater understanding {{the way in which the}} Hotline Cyber Community of Practice deals with newbies. The study provides valuable insights to sociologists, linguists, and educators, who wish to understand the way in which Cyber Communities of Practice work, or who are planning to utilise these for online learning...|$|E
40|$|Hollywood {{is synonymous}} with the {{tradition}} of images {{that are used to}} create emotion, to strengthen attachment, and to encourage imitation. In a certain sense these values are also encouraged by the church as institution. Scholars who study the connection between cinematography and theology acknowledge that the cinema has become the ‘principal new church’ for post-secularised believers. Films are regarded among the ‘big books’ of ‘postmodern culture’. In this article it is argued that film hermeneutics should be regarded as an epistemological movement which has departed from a typographical culture, including logocentrism, phonocentrism, and text-focused cognition. The movement is towards a visual culture, including audiovisual and virtual realities, and is contextualised in a <b>cybercommunity.</b> Tendencies in films with biblical and religious dimensions and themes, including {{the way in which the}} Christ figure is portrayed, are discussed. In this article the value of film hermeneutics – that is, the ‘textuality of the screen’ – as public theology, is also identified. This article is based on the research of Anet Dreyer- Kruger’s PhD dissertation, entitled ‘Filmhermeneutiek: Die huwelik, intimiteit, seksualiteit en die Christusnarratief’ ([URL] The research was done under the supervision of Prof. Dr Andries G. van Aarde, Department of New Testament Studies, Faculty of Theology, University of Pretoria (2014).

40|$|In 1996 John Perry Barlow {{made his}} now infamous Declaration of Independence for Cyberspace. In this the cyberlibertarian ethos was laid out: We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, {{even as we}} {{continue}} to consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts. Since that date much has changed. The work of a number of US cyberpaternalist philosophers such as Jonathan Zittrain, Jack Goldsmith, Joel Reidenberg, Yochai Benkler and most famously Lawrence Lessig has illustrated the fundamental weaknesses in Barlow s (and therefore cyberlibertarianism s) basic premises. This does not mean though that because one can be controlled in cyberspace, one ought to be controlled or even one will be controlled. The distinction is between the ability to control and the effectiveness and legitimacy of control mechanisms. It is this distinction which {{is at the heart of}} network communitarianism and which is likely to come more to the fore as the network is replaced with the cloud, always on data, augmented reality and mobile data communications. The key issue for regulators now is the strength of the network and the ability of regulators to control within the network. Building upon previous regulatory designs of the author and taking account of nodal governance theory as developed by Clifford Shearing and Julia Black, this paper aims to demonstrate that the key to building effective and legitimate regulation in the virtual space is to recognise and harness key nodal connections and key nodes themselves. It will demonstrate how the <b>cybercommunity</b> functions as both a community and a group of individual nodes and will seek to develop a theory of regulatory gravity in which the relative communicative power of various nodes may be modelled to take account of the effectiveness and legitimacy of a regulatory intervention...|$|E
