50|$|Employers that sponsor self-funded {{insurance}} plans often {{contract with a}} third-party administrator (TPA), which is an entity that provides ministerial services {{on behalf of the}} health plan and the plan sponsor. Traditionally, TPAs do not make discretionary claims determinations; if a determination requires interpretation of the governing plan document, most TPAs do not make it but instead require the plan administrator to provide its own determination. This is because a fiduciary duty is incurred by any entity that exercises discretion over plan assets or in connection with making a binding determination under a health plan. According to ERISA, no matter which entity is identified as a fiduciary within the health plan, any entity will be considered a fiduciary if that entity acts as a fiduciary in a given <b>case.</b> <b>Plan</b> sponsors contract with their chosen TPA by means of an agreement known as an Administrative Services Agreement, which outlines the TPA’s duties, generally including administering payment for claims, issuing benefit determinations, and distributing documentation. This agreement generally contains provisions that provide for the TPA’s access to the employer’s claims funding bank account, and TPAs generally charge on a per-employee-per-month fee.|$|E
