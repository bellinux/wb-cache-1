Moreover, a stretched structure of SPLFR is designed for wind resistance. Finally, the thermal performance of the SPLFR collecting system with fixed and movable receiver located in Guangzhou is tested. The maximum thermal efficiency obtained by this collecting system with movable receiver is 66 % which avoid the end losses effectively, and the solar collector thermal loss coefficient is 1. 32 W/m(2) degrees C. The results show that the SPLFR collecting system has excellent thermal performance and a promising application future.

Hourly discretized data for solar radiation and for ambient temperature have been used. The adoption of a sliding-velocity control strategy, has allowed to operate without any storage system with a solar multiple (S. M.) of 1, reducing the amplitude of the solar field and simplifying the control system. Different collectors tilt angles and concentration factors, as well as thermodynamic parameters of the cycle have been tested, to evaluate the optimal working conditions for each locality. Results highlighted that specific production increased with the concentration ratio, and with the decrease of latitude. The comparison with the steady-state analysis showed that this type of control strategy is suited for those configurations having a smaller number of collectors, since the thermal inertia of the solar field is not recovered at all during the plant shut-down phase...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar Photocatalysis is an {{advanced}} oxidation {{process that is}} involved on water detoxification as a very promising technology. This process {{has been used for}} polishing industrial and municipal wastewaters, mainly with titanium dioxide (TiO 2) as a catalyst. Most of the reactors use TiO 2 as a powder and need a pump in order to have the water moving through the system. A novel photocatalytic reactor, based on <b>Compound</b> <b>Parabolic</b> <b>Collectors</b> (CPC), was developed. The reactor has TiO 2 fixed as a thick film in the CPC tubes and water flows inside by density differences exclusively. This reactor is designed to avoid catalyst separation and water pumping, steps that are energy – demanding and expensive. The films were prepared by conventional sol – gel method on 13 mm diameter Pyrex tubes. The films were firmly bounded to tubes and used for several test with good efficiencies. Films had a mix of anatase and rutile crystalline phases and its particles are nanoscopic. A CPC reactor with 20 tubes connected to the tank by its upper side only was developed and used. Resorcinol was effectively removed from water, either with or without persulfate as electron acceptor, at laboratory bench (one CPC tube experiments) and at pilot scale (20 tubes in the reactor). Main reaction sub-products (tri – hydroxy benzenes) were also oxidized in reasonable solar irradiation times...|$|R

The thermal efficiency is obtained by using FORTRAN 90 program. The thermal efficiency is between (60 - 67) % at mass flow rate between (0. 02 - 0. 03) kg/s at concentration ratio of (3. 8) without need to tracking system. The total and diffused radiation is calculated for Tikrit city by using theoretical equations. Good agreement between present work and the previous work...|$|R
