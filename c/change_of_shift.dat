2500|$|Priming {{effects can}} be found {{with many of the}} tests of {{implicit}} memory. Tests such as the word-stem completion task, and the word fragment completion task measure perceptual priming. In the word-stem completion task, participants are given a list of study words, and then asked to complete word [...] "stems" [...] consisting of 3 letters with the first word that comes to mind. A priming effect is observed when participants complete stems with words on the study list more often than with novel words. The word fragment completion task is similar, but instead of being given the stem of a word, participants are given a word with some letters missing. The lexical decision task can be used to demonstrate conceptual priming. In this task, participants are asked to determine if a given string is a word or a nonword. Priming is demonstrated when participants are quicker to respond to words that have been primed with semantically-related words, e.g., faster to confirm [...] "nurse" [...] as a word when it is preceded by [...] "doctor" [...] than when it is preceded by [...] "butter". Other evidence has been found through brain imaging and studies from brain injured patients. Another example of priming in healthcare research was studying if safety behaviors of nurses could be primed by structuring <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> report. A pilot simulation study found that there is early evidence to show that safety behaviors can be primed by including safety language into report.|$|E

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that performing <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> report at the bedside is key to patient safety. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine stated that [...] "it is in inadequate handoff that safety often fails first." [...] This is because at every <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift,</b> there is a chance for miscommunication about vital patient information. A specific type of change-of-shift report is Nursing Bedside Shift Report in which the off going nurse provides change-of-shift report to the on coming nurse at the patient's bedside. Since 2013, giving report at the patient bedside has been recommend by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to improve patient safety. However, it wasn't until recently that it was known how Nursing Bedside Shift Report works to keep patients safe. A qualitative study by the nurse researchers Groves, Manges, and Scott-Cawiezell developed a grounded theory on how bedside nurses can use nursing bedside shift report (NBSR) to keep patients safe. According to Groves et al. (2016) NBSR is used by nurses to keep patients safe by [...] "reducing risk of harm through conveying the patient story from shift to shift." [...] Additionally, NBSR is key to reducing risk of harm because it supports the nurses ability to identify and address risks.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{importance}} {{and complexity of}} handovers is well-established. Progress for intervening in the emergency department <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> handovers may be hampered by lack of a conceptual framework. The objectives were {{to gain a better}} understanding of strategies used for <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> handovers in an emergency care setting and to further expand current understanding and conceptualizations. Methods Observations, open-ended questions and interviews about handover strategies were collected at a Veteran's Health Administration Medical Center in the United States. All relevant staff in the emergency department was observed; 31 completed open-ended surveys; 10 completed in-depth interviews. The main variables of interest were strategies used for handovers at <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> and obstacles to smooth handovers. Results Of 21 previously identified strategies, 8 were used consistently, 4 were never used, and 9 were used occasionally. Our data support ten additional strategies. Four agent types and 6 phases of the process were identified via grounded theory analysis. Six general themes or clusters emerged covering factors that intersect to define the degree of handover smoothness. Conclusion Including phases and agents in conceptualizations of handovers can help target interventions to improve patient safety. The conceptual model also clarifies unique handover considerations for the emergency department setting. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM OF THE STUDY To {{investigate}} {{the effect that}} manipulating the style {{and content of the}} nurse <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> report had on an individual's ability to plan patient care. BACKGROUND The nurse <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> report occurs on most hospital wards at least two if not three times a day. However, little research exists examining how changing the style and information content of the shift report may affect an individual's ability to process the information they hear. It is suggested that how individuals structure their knowledge, in the form of schema, is an important consideration when examining how they process information. DESIGN This was an experimental study where two independent variables, report style (retrospective vs. prospective) and schema information (schema consistent vs. schema inconsistent) were compared in a factorial design. A convenience sample of 48 registered nurses from acute medical and acute surgical wards were randomly allocated to one of the four experimental conditions. Outcome measures included the amount of information that subjects accurately recorded and recalled from the shift report, together with their ability to plan patient care. RESULTS Results indicated that the type of report had a significant effect on an individual's ability to plan patient care, and type of information content on their ability to accurately record and recall the information they heard. CONCLUSIONS The implications of the results, both for schema theory as an explanation of nursing knowledge, and for the type of report which should be used in acute medical and acute surgical wards are discussed, together with the implications of the study for further research. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} potential nursing rituals using an ethnographic approach. The definition of ritual by DeCraemer, Vansina and Fox (1976) was used: ritual is patterned symbolic action {{that refers to}} the goals and values of a social group. Post-mortem care, admission and discharge of patients {{to and from the}} hospital, medication administration, medical aseptic practices and <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> report were investigated. ^ Participant observation and intensive, semi-structured interviews were the major data collection methods of the study. Nursing staff, patients and other hospital personnel were the informants. The setting of the study was 7 H, an adult medical unit located in a large urban hospital. Data collection extended over a 12 month period. Results included an ethnographic description and analysis of 7 H, the nursing staff and five potential ritual categories. ^ It was determined that post-mortem care is a therapeutic nursing ritual. It was surrounded by the problems associated with the 2 ̆ 2 resuscitate 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 do not resuscitate dilemma. 2 ̆ 2 Post-mortem care represented, on a symbolic level, nurses 2 ̆ 7 continuation and gradual relinquishing of responsibility after death. ^ The routines and procedures of 7 H 2 ̆ 7 s nursing staff did not reveal that admission or discharge procedures are nursing rituals. However, admission and discharge procedures had characteristics of patient rituals. ^ Administration of medications is a therapeutic nursing ritual. The importance of medications and the ritual aspects of medication administration were evident as nurses made medication errors. ^ Events examined for rituals associated with medical aseptic practices included the bath, the handling of excreta and caring for patients with infectious diseases. Of these, the bath is clearly a therapeutic nursing ritual. ^ <b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> report represented a transfer of responsibility from nurses going off one shift to nurses coming on the next shift and served as an arena for role socialization of nurses. Shift report is an occupational nursing ritual. The value held by 7 H nurses, to do good and avoid harm, was evident as these nursing rituals were analyzed. ^ Nurses passed on subcultural knowledge by demonstration, and by an oral tradition of information exchange. ...|$|E
