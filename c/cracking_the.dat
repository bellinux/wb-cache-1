5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, {{and that there were}} many new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up the simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from <b>cracking</b> <b>the</b> game until two months after release.|$|E

30|$|To repair {{transverse}} and longitudinal cracks, minor wide cracks need to {{be repaired}} to prevent moisture. On bigger <b>cracks,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cracked</b> pavement layer must be removed and replaced.

5|$|Oberon's {{accretion}} probably {{lasted for}} several thousand years. The impacts that accompanied accretion caused heating of the moon's outer layer. The maximum temperature of around 230K was reached at {{the depth of}} about 60km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Oberon heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust leading to <b>cracking.</b> <b>The</b> present-day system of canyons may {{be a result of}} this process, which lasted for about 200million years, implying that any endogenous activity from this cause ceased billions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{cockatoo}} feeds {{primarily on}} seeds of proteaceous {{plants such as}} Banksia, Hakea and Grevillea, and secondarily on seeds from myrtaceous plants such as Eucalyptus and Corymbia. Over fifty native plant species are commonly used for food, either as seed or flowers, and this includes western sheoak (Allocasuarina fraseriana), orange wattle (Acacia saligna), and balga (Xanthorrhoea preissii). Typically, Carnaby's black cockatoos sit in the crowns of trees <b>cracking</b> <b>the</b> seed pods or cones. First, a bird chews through the stem holding the item before holding it with its foot and tearing bits off and extracting the seed. Birds may move along the branches breaking stems at random as well. Occasionally they forage for fallen seed and fruit on the ground. This cockatoo acts as an agent in biological control, eating the larvae of invertebrates such as wood-boring insects and moths from rare plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{crucifix}} {{was installed}} in the church of Santa Croce {{at the end of}} the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the Crucifix lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, <b>cracking</b> <b>the</b> paint-work.|$|E

5|$|Sweet Kisses, {{which was}} aimed at an older audience, did not perform well commercially, and so Simpson re-evaluated her career. At the {{suggestion}} of her label executives, Simpson modified her image and sound in Irresistible, deciding to delve more into the teen pop and R genres, as she felt that restyling herself to match {{the image of her}} contemporaries—Spears and Christina Aguilera—would help rejuvenate her career. After its release, Irresistible received mostly negative reviews from critics, most of whom were disappointed by the music; some of them also felt it was too generic and over-produced. Initially, the album enjoyed commercial success, debuting at number six on the US Billboard 200. It was an improvement from her previous endeavor and the album went on to sell about 850,000copies in the United States, and over two million worldwide. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 500,000copies. Elsewhere, the album was not as successful, reaching number thirteen in Canada and <b>cracking</b> <b>the</b> top forty in Sweden, Japan and Germany.|$|E

40|$|The plastic {{deformation}} processes around a crack tip at an atomic scale level under cyclic loading are examined using a molecular dynamics simulation. In this study, {{we deal with}} not only a specimen including both a crack and grain boundaries but also a specimen including only a <b>crack.</b> For <b>the</b> specimen including both <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> and <b>the</b> grain boundaries, we can observe the emission of edge dislocations in order to relax stress concentration around <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip during loading. The dislocations emitted from <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip return to <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip because of interaction between dislocations during unloading. <b>The</b> <b>crack</b> propagates due to coalescence of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip and <b>the</b> vacancies caused by the repeat of the dislocation emission and absorption at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip.

40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} for an elliptical cylinder cavity or a crack inside an infinite piezoelectric medium under combined mechanical-electrical loadings are formulated via the Stroh formalism and well confirmed by finite element analysis. The {{results show that}} the stress and electric fields in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip are, in general, determined by a complex vector of intensity factors. The complex vector of intensity factors may reduce to be real under certain circumstances. For a vacuum <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> electric field inside <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> in <b>the</b> direction perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> magnifies <b>the</b> corresponding applied electric field by more than 1000 times. In this case, the electric field strength in the material has a finite value at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip, but <b>the</b> electric displacement approaches infinity at <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> tip due to the piezoelectricity. The self-consistent analysis is developed to determine <b>the</b> deformed <b>crack</b> profile. <b>The</b> energy release rate for the cavity propagation is formulated under the condition that the ratio of the minor semi-axis to the major semi-axis of the ellipse remains unchanged. For an insulating <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> applied electric field contributes nothing to the energy release rate when <b>the</b> undeformed <b>crack</b> profile is used, while the electric field resists <b>crack</b> propagation when <b>the</b> deformed <b>crack</b> profile is used. For a conducting slit <b>crack,</b> <b>the</b> energy release rate is independent of the applied electric field perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>crack,</b> and is enhanced by the applied electric field parallel to <b>the</b> <b>crack.</b> (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R

25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased tensile stresses {{at a time when it}} has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage <b>cracking.</b> <b>The</b> early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and <b>cracking.</b> <b>The</b> strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.|$|E
