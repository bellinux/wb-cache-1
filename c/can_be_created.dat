5|$|Bohrium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107. It {{is named after}} Danish physicist Niels Bohr. It is {{a synthetic}} element (an element that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> in a laboratory but is not found in nature) and radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 270Bh, has a half-life of approximately 61seconds, though the unconfirmed 278Bh may have a longer half-life of about 690seconds.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege {{has both}} a single-player and {{multiplayer}} mode. The single-player mode {{consists of a}} single story and world; players can either create a new character when starting the story or use one created in a prior playthrough. The cooperative multiplayer mode allows for up to eight players to play through either the single-player storyline or in the multiplayer map, which features a central town hub with increasingly difficult enemies as players move away from it. Multiplayer games can be set to different difficulty levels, allowing accommodation of higher-leveled characters. Additional maps <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> by players that can allow for competitive multiplayer instead. Multiplayer matches <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> and joined via local area networks, direct IP addresses, and, prior to its closure in 2006, through the Microsoft Zone matchmaking service.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Sg and atomic number 106. It {{is named after}} the American nuclear chemist Glenn T. Seaborg.

5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number of}} the many distinct sounds that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but might have a different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>created</b> by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E

A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote to revert to town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E
