50|$|<b>Carbo{{chemistry}}</b> is {{the branch}} of chemistry that studies the transformation of coals (bituminous coal, anthracite, lignite, graphite, and charcoal) into useful products and raw materials. The processes {{that are used in}} <b>carbochemistry</b> include degasification processes such as carbonization and coking, gasification processes and processes for the liquefaction of coal.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of <b>carbochemistry</b> {{goes back to}} the 16th Century. At that time large quantities of charcoal were needed for the smelting of iron ores. Since the production required large amounts of slowly renewable wood, the use of coal was studied. The use of pure coal was difficult because of the amount of liquid and solid by-products that were generated. In order to improve the handling the coal was initially treated as wood in kilns to produce coke.|$|E
40|$|The History of Chemical Synthesis from mid- 19 th until mid- 20 th Century is an {{adequate}} object {{for the study}} of the interactions between society and progress in science. Economy, political structures, internal and international conflicts have left their marks on the development of Chemistry not only as a science, but also as an art, a craft and an industry. Inversely the scientific discoveries and inventions have also shaped society. Chemical industries were shaped by War and Peace, where ‘War ’ includes economic sanctions and the consequent policies of economic autarchy, so common between the 1 st and 2 nd World Wars. ‘Peace ’ supposes the existence of a global network of friendly trade partnerships. ‘War ’ in this broader sense favoured research and development of heavy chemical industries, based on domestic coal, for agricultural and military self-sufficiency of Germany from 1914 to 1945, eventually used to prepare the 2 nd World War. Times before and after this age of conflict were more favourable to basic science and the production of high added value chemicals, such as dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals and innovative materials, which also allowed, to replace after 1945 highly polluting and energy wasting <b>carbochemistry</b> by petrochemistry based on oil and natural gas imports...|$|E
