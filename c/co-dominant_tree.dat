50|$|Determining what a site tree {{should look}} like in a stand varies with what kind of stand one is {{standing}} in. The simplest stand to find a site tree in is an even aged stand of a single species, much like a forest plantation. In this stand almost any dominant or <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> can be used. Finding a site tree is more difficult in uneven-aged, mixed species, stands.|$|E
50|$|Site tree {{refers to}} a type of tree used in forestry, {{which is used to}} {{classify}} the quality of growing conditions trees at a particular forest location. A site tree, is a single tree in a stand (group of growing trees) that gives a good representation of the average dominant or <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> in the stand. Site trees are used to calculate the site index of the site in reference to a particular tree species. A site tree should belong to the dominant or co-dominant overstory class. The total height of the tree and age measured at Diameter at breast height of a sample of site trees will be used to determine a site index, which will show how tall trees of different species can grow on that site in a set amount of time. Sometimes several years are added to the breast-height age to account for time grown below 4.5 ft.|$|E
30|$|Our study {{involved}} monitoring cambial growth patterns of three pine species: longleaf pine, slash pine, and South Florida slash pine. These pines are the dominant canopy {{trees in the}} pyrogenic savannas and woodlands of the North American Coastal Plain. Historically, longleaf pine, a tree whose needles become flammable once cast (Fonda 2001, Platt et al. 2016), was the dominant or <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> on about 85 % of the uplands of the region (approximately 51 million hectares, Frost 2006). Longleaf pine ranged from Virginia south to Florida and west to eastern Texas (Weakley 2015). South Florida slash pine is often the dominant tree in southern Florida, and can occur intermixed with longleaf pine in south-central peninsular Florida. Slash pine typically occurred in wetter sites within the longleaf pine matrix and occurred from eastern South Carolina to northern peninsular Florida and west to eastern Louisiana (Weakley 2015); however, it has been widely planted outside this range.|$|E

40|$|Thinning has an {{important}} role in silviculture practice for quality and thick stem production. But, epicormic branches decrease the value of the trunk or timber as a result of thinning, especially in broadleaved species. In this study, the effect of thinning intensity and crown class on epicormic branching were investigated in narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) plantation, Adapazarı-Turkey. The plantation was 36 years old established at 3 x 2 m initial spacing (1666 trees/ha). Prior the thinning mean stand diameter, top height, basal area and stem number were 31 cm, 34 m and 32 m 2 /ha and 416 stem/ha, respectively. Thinning intensities were removal of basal area 0 % (control), 22 % (moderate) and 38 % (heavy). Results showed that; thinning intensity, crown class (dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees)</b> and thinning intensity x crown class interaction had no significant effect on epicormic branching after four years of growth. Very few (< 1 number per stem) new epicormic branch were formed on stems of dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> represent final crop. Consequently, narrow leaved ash has very low epicormic branching risk in reaction to thinning and this can be an advantage for species in producing thick and valuable stems...|$|R

40|$|Eucalyptus tetrodonta, a <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> {{species of}} tropical, {{northern}} Australian savannas, does not invade adjacent monsoon rain forest unless {{the forest is}} burnt intensely. Such facilitation by fire of seedling establishment {{is known as the}} "ashbed effect. " Because the ashbed effect might involve disruption of common mycorrhizal networks, we hypothesized that in the absence of fire, intact rain forest arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks inhibit E. tetrodonta seedlings. Although arbuscular mycorrhizas predominate in the rain forest, common tree species of the northern Australian savannas (including adult E. tetrodonta) host ectomycorrhizas. To test our hypothesis, we grew E. tetrodonta and Ceiba pentandra (an AM-responsive species used to confirm treatments) separately in microcosms of ambient or methyl-bromide fumigated rain forest soil with or without severing potential mycorrhizal fungus connections to an AM nurse plant, Litsea glutinosa. As expected, C. pentandra formed mycorrhizas in all treatments but had the most root colonization and grew fastest in ambient soil. E. tetrodonta seedlings also formed AM in all treatments, but severing hyphae in fumigated soil produced the least colonization and the best growth. Three of ten E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with intact network hyphae died. Because foliar chlorosis was symptomatic of iron deficiency, after 130 days we began to fertilize half the E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with an iron solution. Iron fertilization completely remedied chlorosis and stimulated leaf growth. Our microcosm results suggest that in intact rain forest, common AM networks mediate belowground competition and AM fungi may exacerbate iron deficiency, thereby enhancing resistance to E. tetrodonta invasion. Common AM networks-previously unrecognized as contributors to the ashbed effect-probably help to maintain the rain forest-savanna boundary...|$|E

30|$|Site Index is {{the most}} common measure of forest site {{productivity}} used worldwide. This variable, which expresses the height of dominant and/or <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> at a given age (Skovsgaard and Vanclay 2008), is a useful measurement as it is relatively unaffected by management intervention. Despite the prevalent use of Site Index by forest managers and researchers, a site quality metric based on volume, rather than height, may more accurately reflect site quality as volume directly links to stand productivity and integrates both height and diameter growth. This contention is reinforced by previous analysis of stand density trials covering a wide range in Site Index. These analyses showed that, at a common age and stand density, Site Index is only weakly related to basal area, demonstrating that Site Index provides only a partial measure of site productivity for Pinus radiata D.Don (P. radiata) (Kimberley et al. 2005).|$|R

The database consisted of 142 trees of interest for logging in a forest under management for timber in Brazil's state of Acre. The trees chosen for studywere selected through proportional sampling by diameter class (ranging from 45 to 165 cm DBH) in order to properly represent the dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> populationswith diameters appropriate for harvest. Subsequent to LIDAR profiling of these trees, they were felled, subjected to a battery of dimensional measurements and sampled for wood-density determination. A set ofmodels was generated, followed by model selection and identity testing in order to compare groups of basicwood density (low, medium and high). The morphometric variables of the crown had high explanatory power for bole biomass independent of whether the allometric equations included DBH. When calculating bole biomass with equations that include basic wood density, the best estimate is obtained using variables for both DBH and crown morphology. To obtain an allometric equation that encompasses species in all three classes of basic density, one should either use only independent variables representing crown dimensions or complement these with variables for basic density (BD) and total height (Ht). The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ground-based measurements to calibrate biomass models that include only LIDAR-based variables, allowing much larger areas to be surveyed with reasonable accuracy.

That year spring was dry without significant rain in April and May and the driest month was August. Due to the extreme weather conditions the volumetric soil water content (SWC) of upper 30 cm was low on experimental days in May (0. 13 – 0. 14 cm 3 cm– 3) but it reached the lowest value in August (0. 08 cm 3 cm– 3). Sap flow was measured in a dominant and a <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> by heat dissipation method from 26 March till 30 October. In the present paper several three-day long periods of the continuous seasonal recordings were chosen to represent the effects of typical weather conditions and different stages of canopy development on sap flow dynamics. The daily maximum sap flow density values of dominant and co-dominant trees were similar (0. 30 – 0. 32 cm 3 cm– 2 min– 1) in moist period (July). Rains and transient increase of SWC after proceeding drought resulted in change of diurnal course of sap flow in experimental days of July.

We investigated the nesting success of 'Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis), in a 17 ha study grid located in the Mauna Loa Strip section of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park during 1993 and 1994 breeding seasons. 'Elepaio nests were most typically found in 'a'ali'i (Dodonaea viscosa) trees in our study area even though this species was less abundant then the other <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species koa (Acacia koa). Nest success was 26 of 44 (59 %, n= 27 pairs) in 1993 and 20 of 72 (28 %, n= 31 pairs) in 1994. Predation by black/roof rats and feral cats was the most prevalent reason for nest failure, accounting for 34 % of failures in 1993, and 57 % of failures in 1994. We found 'Elepaio renested after either a nesting failure or successful attempt. In 1993, 'Elepaio renesting attempts peaked at four. However, in 1994 we found 4 pairs that renested six, six, seven and eight times respectively without being successful. Because of their ability to renest after a nest failure, 74 % of the 'Elepaio pairs in 1993 were successful in fledging at least one chick from one successful nest during the season. Pair success was 65 % during the 1994 nesting season. The ability of 'Elepaio to renest repeatedly suggests double clutching and subsequent reintroduction of captive reared chicks may be a very useful technique to augment declining populations of this species in other areas in Hawai'i.

Increased drought is also predicted for future climate, which could drive respiration higher if the carbon (C) cost to maintain tissues (Rm) or grow increases, or lower if substrate or other factors become limiting. We examined the effects of temperature and drought on R as well as photosynthesis, growth, and carbohydrate storage of mature individuals of two <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species. Three mature, in-situ piñon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) trees were assigned to each of the following treatments: + 4. 8 °C; 45 % reduced precipitation; a combination of both (heat + drought); along with ambient control and treatment controls. Rm measured prior to foliar and twig growth was far more sensitive to drought in piñon, and heat in juniper. Total respiration (Rt, R not partitioned) acclimated to temperature in piñon such that elevated temperature had minimal impacts on Rt; however, juniper exhibited higher Rt with elevated temperature, thus juniper did not display any thermal acclimation. Rt in both species was weakly associated with temperature, but strongly correlated with pre-dawn water potential, photosynthetic assimilation (A) rates, and in piñon, foliar carbohydrates. For both species, heat caused far more days where A-R was negative than did drought. The consequences of drought alone and heat alone in piñon included higher Rt per unit growth, indicating that each abiotic stress forces a greater allocation of Rt to maintenance costs, and both drought + heat in combination results in far fewer days that foliar carbohydrates could sustain R in both species. Notably, the much higher A and R of juniper than piñon is consistent with predicted superior carbon budget regulation of juniper than piñon during drought; however, juniper’s lack of temperature acclimation in contrast to piñon suggests climate warming may have a greater deleterious impact on juniper carbon balance than piñon.

However, very {{little is known about the}} effects of masting on stern growth and total net primary productivity (NPP) at the stand scale. This study was conducted in an old-growth, mixed deciduous forest dominated by Fagus sylvatica (L.) and covers the period from 2003 to 2007, which comprised wet, dry and regular years as well as two masts of Fagus and one mast of the <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species Fraxinus excelsior (L.) and Acer pseudoplatanus (L.). We combined analyses of weather conditions and stem growth at the tree level (inter- and intra-annual) with fruit, stem and leaf production, and estimates of total NPP at the stand level. Finally, we compared the annual demand of carbon for biomass production with net canopy assimilation (NCA), derived from eddy covariance flux measurements, chamber measurements and modelling. Annual stem growth of Fagus was most favoured by warm periods in spring and that of Fraxinus by high precipitation in June. For stem growth of Acer and for fruit production, no significant relationships with mean weather conditions were found. Intra-annual stem growth of all species was strongly reduced when the relative plant-available water in soil dropped below a threshold of about 60 % between May and July. The inter-annual variations of NCA, total NPP and leaf NPP at the stand level were low (mean values 1313, 662 and 168 g C m(- 2) year(- 1), respectively), while wood and fruit production varied more and contrarily (wood: 169 - 241 g C m(- 2) year(- 1); fruits: 21 - 142 g C m(- 2) year(- 1)). In all years, an annual surplus of newly assimilated carbon was calculated (on average 100 g C m(- 2) year(- 1)). The results suggest that stem growth is generally not limited by insufficient carbon resources; only in mast years a short-term carbon shortage may occur in spring.

40|$|The savanna {{ecosystem}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dominant and complex terrestrial biomes, deriving from a distinct vegetative surface comprised of <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> and grass populations. While these two vegetation types co-exist functionally, demographically they are not static but are dynamically changing in response to environmental forces such as annual fire events and rainfall variability. Modelling savanna environments with the current generation of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) has presented many problems, particularly describing fire frequency and intensity, phenology, leaf biochemistry of C 3 and C 4 photosynthesis vegetation, and root-water uptake. In order to better understand why TBMs perform so poorly in savannas, we conducted a model inter-comparison of six TBMs and assessed their performance at simulating latent energy (LE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) for five savanna sites along a rainfall gradient in northern Australia. Performance in predicting LE and GPP was measured using an empirical benchmarking system, which ranks models by their ability to utilise meteorological driving information to predict the fluxes. On average, the TBMs performed as well as a multi-linear regression of the fluxes against solar radiation, temperature and vapour pressure deficit but were outperformed by a more complicated nonlinear response model that also included the leaf area index (LAI). This identified that the TBMs are not fully utilising their input information effectively in determining savanna LE and GPP and highlights that savanna dynamics cannot be calibrated into models and that there are problems in underlying model processes. We identified key weaknesses in a model's ability to simulate savanna fluxes and their seasonal variation, related to the representation of vegetation by the models and root-water uptake. We underline these weaknesses in terms of three critical areas for development. First, prescribed tree-rooting depths must be deep enough, enabling the extraction of deep soil-water stores to maintain photosynthesis and transpiration during the dry season. Second, models must treat grasses as a co-dominant interface for water and carbon exchange rather than a secondary one to trees. Third, models need a dynamic representation of LAI that encompasses the dynamic phenology of savanna vegetation and its response to rainfall interannual variability. We believe that this study is the first to assess how well TBMs simulate savanna ecosystems and that these results will be used to improve the representation of savannas ecosystems in future global climate model studies. 21 page(s...|$|E

To categorize the main response modes of vegetation to climatic change and disturbance in the Alps we use three classes of ecological behaviour: "resilience", "adjustment", and "vulnerability", We assume a resilient (or elastic) behaviour if vegetation is able to recover to its former state, regaining important ecosystem characteristics, such as floristic composition, biodiversity, species abundances, and biomass (e. g. Küttel 1990; Aber and Melillo 199 1). Conversely, vegetation displacements may occur in response to climatic change and/or disturbance. In some cases, this may culminate in irreversible large-scale processes such as species and/or community extinctions. Such drastic developments indicate high ecosystem vulnerability (or inelasticity or instability, for detailed definitions see Küttel 1990; Aber and Melillo 199 1) to climatic change and/or disturbance. In this sense, the "vulnerability" (or instability) of an ecosystem is expressed by the degree of failure to recover to the original state before disturbance and/or climatic change. Between these two extremes (resilience vs. vulnerability), ecosystem adjustments to climatic change and/or disturbance may occur, including the appearance of new and/or the disappearance of old species. The term "adjustment" is hence used to indicate the response of vegetational communities, which adapted to new environmental conditions without losing their main character. For forest ecosystems, we assume vegetational adjustments (rather than vulnerability) if the dominant (or <b>co-dominant)</b> <b>tree</b> species are not outnumbered or replaced by formerly unimportant plant species or new invaders. Adaptation as a genetic process is not discussed here and will require additional pbylogeographical studies (that incorporate the analysis of ancient DNA) in order to fully understand the distributions of ecotypes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-parametric approach for segmenting trees from airborne LiDAR data in deciduous forests. Based on the LiDAR point cloud, the approach collects crown {{information such as}} steepness and height on-the-fly to delineate crown boundaries, and most importantly, {{does not require a}} priori assumptions of crown shape and size. The approach segments trees iteratively starting from the tallest within a given area to the smallest until all trees have been segmented. To evaluate its performance, the approach was applied to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, a deciduous closed-canopy forest with complex terrain and vegetation conditions. The approach identified 94 % of dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> with a false detection rate of 13 %. About 62 % of intermediate, overtopped, and dead trees were also detected with a false detection rate of 15 %. The overall segmentation accuracy was 77 %. Correlations of the segmentation scores of the proposed approach with local terrain and stand metrics was not significant, which is likely an indication of the robustness of the approach as results are not sensitive to the differences in terrain and stand structures...|$|R
50|$|In {{its native}} range, Monterey pine is {{associated}} with a characteristic flora and fauna. It is the <b>co-dominant</b> canopy <b>tree</b> together with Cupressus macrocarpa which naturally occurs only in coastal Monterey County. Furthermore, one of the pine forests in Monterey, California, was the discovery site for Hickman's potentilla, an endangered species. Piperia yadonii, a rare species of orchid is endemic to the same pine forest adjacent to Pebble Beach. In its native range, Monterey pine is a principal host for the dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium littorum.|$|R
40|$|The {{cold and}} dry boreal {{forests of the}} Southwest Yukon are {{dominated}} by white spruce (Picea glauca), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), and the variability in structure and composition of stands depends on the favourability of disturbance, climate and site conditions for stimulating regeneration. In this study, we investigated relationships between stand structure and ecological, climatic and disturbance factors in the southwest Yukon. We found that white spruce dominates mature forests across the landscape, but it is regenerating proportionately less than trembling aspen. Nevertheless, regeneration of all the three species was abundant following any type or severity of disturbance. Height and diameter of both species varied with several environmental variables, particularly site physiography. Mixed stands of aspen and white spruce were more productive than pure stands of aspen or spruce. However, overall productivity in mixed stand decreased when density of aspen was more than 1000 stems/ ha. These results suggested that mixed stands of deciduous and coniferous species where appropriate should be promoted maintaining aspen density below 1000 stems/ha as the productivity declined beyond this threshold. Similarly, we suggest carrying out selection harvesting of <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> and regular thinning of intermediate trees to promote the height and diameter growth of the remaining trees...|$|R
40|$|Black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), {{within the}} family Juglandaceae, is a premier {{hardwood}} timber species in the United States. Its native range encompasses most of the eastern U. S., roughly extending from eastern South Dakota and eastern Texas on its western edge to Massachusetts and western Florida in the east (Figure 1). The occurrence and productivity of black walnut on {{the western edge of}} its native range, including eastern Nebraska, is largely a function of available water during the growing season. However, black walnut has been extensively planted west and north of its native range. Studies have shown black walnut can withstand moving 200 miles northward from its native range without likelihood of cold injury (Bey, 1980). Black walnut is sensitive to soil conditions. It grows best on deep, well-drained, nearly neutral soils that are generally moist and fertile (Williams, 1990). Black walnut grows in many mixed mesophytic forests, but it is seldom abundant (Schlesinger 2 ̆ 6 Funk, 1977). Usually it is found scattered among other tree species. Pure stands are rare, relatively small, and usually located on the edge of its native range (Williams, 1990). Although there is no universal vegetative indicator, the presence of Kentucky coffeetree (Gymnocladus dioicus) seems to indicate a good walnut growing site (Brinkman, 1965). In general, where white ash, red oak, sugar maple, slippery elm, or yellowpoplar grow well, black walnut also thrives. The majority of black walnut trees occur in natural stands. Walnut plantations (ca. 13, 800 ac) account for only about 1 percent of the black walnut timber volume harvested in the U. S. each year (Shifley, 2004), even though black walnut has been cultivated since 1686 (Michler, Woeste 2 ̆ 6 Pijut, 2007). Eight states currently have the greatest volume of black walnut growing stock on timberland: Missouri, Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Michigan (Shifley, 2004). Black walnut is classified as a “shade intolerant” tree. It tends to develop a straight, limb-free trunk when growing as a dominant and/ or <b>co-dominant</b> <b>tree</b> under competition with other forest trees. It typically forms a taproot and wide-spreading lateral roots. The growing season of black walnut ranges from 140 days in the north to 280 days in western Florida. Annual precipitation in its native range varies from less than 25 inches in northern Nebraska to more than 70 inches in the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina (Williams, 1990). Black walnut is prized for its chocolate- brown, straight-grained wood which is used to make fine furniture, expensive gunstocks, and high-quality veneer products. The nuts of the black walnut are relished as food by humans and animals. Black walnut nutmeats are often used in baked goods (cookies, cakes, etc.) and ice cream products. The healthful nutmeats are low in sugar and saturated fats, high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, a good source of protein and fiber, and contain no cholesterol (USDA-ARS, 2004). Even the nut shells are made into useful products. During World War II, engine pistons were cleaned with a “nut shell” blaster. Later, the automobile industry used ground black walnut shell to de-burr precision gears (Williams, 1990). Today, ground black walnut shell is used in a variety of products—a soft abrasive to clean jet engines, electronic circuit boards, ship and automobile gear systems, a filler in dynamite, a filter agent for smokestack scrubbers, and in oil drilling...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the annual}} post-thinning response and thinning bias {{of a young}} Scots pine stand {{as a function of}} tree size, competition faced by the tree, and competition that is removed around the tree in the thinning treatment. The thinning response of a tree was defi ned as the change of tree growth due to a thinning treatment. The thinning bias was defi ned as the difference between the true growth and model prediction. A distance-dependent (spatial) and a distance-independent (non-spatial) growth model were used in the calculations. The empirical data were measured from a thinning experiment consisting of ten plots, each 40 × 30 m in size, which were thinned to different stand densities. The ten-year post-thinning growth of every remaining tree was measured. The results indicated that the highest thinning response is among medium-sized and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees.</b> The thinning response is quite small, and even negative for some trees, for two years after thinning but it becomes clearly positive from the third year onwards. The spatial model underestimated the growth of small trees (which usually face high competition) while the non-spatial model overestimated the growth of trees that are small or face much competition. The spatial model used in this study overemphasize...|$|R
5000|$|The subalpine (cold) {{temperate}} rainforests {{are dominated}} by tsuga and fir. [...] Veitch’s fir (Abies veitchii), Maries’ fir (Abies mariesii) and northern Japanese hemlock are commonly seen. Also, Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis), Thujopsis (also called hiba) can be found there. Other than those trees, broad-leaf trees such as Japanese beech (Fagus crenata) and oak are <b>co-dominant</b> canopy <b>trees</b> in this area.

30|$|Decisions {{made during}} model {{development}} {{will affect the}} model’s ‘domain of applicability’. Three such decisions are: (1) which trees to sample; (2) which branches to model; and (3) what section of the tree crown or stem to consider. Tree selection criteria have included selection of trees across the DBH distribution (Maguire et al. 1994); selection of dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> (Hein et al. 2008 a; Newton et al. 2012); and avoidance of trees with visible damage (Roeh and Maguire 1997; Hein et al. 2008 a; Newton et al. 2012). In terms of branches modelled, nodal branches have been identified and modelled (Maguire et al. 1994, 1999; Roeh and Maguire 1997; Weiskittel et al. 2007 a; Hein et al. 2008 a, b), whilst Ishii et al. (2000) selected a set of maximum branches from all live and dead branches. The definition of ‘crown’ varies. For example, Ishii et al. (2000) defined crown depth as tree height minus lowest branch height. Weiskittel et al. (2007 a) defined crown base as the tree height to the lowest live branch; whereas Maguire et al. (1999) did not give a precise definition for crown base. Regardless of sampling decisions, most of the models predict that branch diameter increases {{from the tip of}} the tree to a maximum value and then decreases again.|$|R
40|$|Timber {{quality in}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in Sweden has {{deteriorated}} during the 20 th century. A possible {{cause of this}} is the increasing proportion of timber that originates in planted stands. Two naturally regenerated and two planted pine stands, of the same genetic origin, were compared. The planted stands were established as spacing experiments (1. 25 x 1. 25 - 2. 5 x 2. 5 m) at Tönnersjöheden Experimental Forest (lat. 56 " 42 'N, long. l 3 " 06 'E, alt. 60 m). Volume growth and timber quality, i. e. taper, crookedness, number of branches, branch thickness, branch angle, crown size, occurrence of spike knots and damage were compared. The quality of dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> was higher in the naturally regenerated stands than in the planted stands. Of the planted trees, only 25 % were straight, compared with 86 % of naturally regenerated trees. In the planted stands, the mean diameter of the thickest branch below 2 m was 23 mm, compared to 15 mm in the naturally regenerated stands. Timber quality and planting density were also positively correlated, quality being very poor at the widest spacings. Volume growth at initial spacings of 1. 75 x 1. 75 m and denser was estimated to be 5 - 10 % higher than that in the naturally regenerated stands...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{growth has}} been {{reported}} to increase in response to recent global climate change in controlled and semi-controlled experiments, but few studies have reported response of tree growth to increased temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration in natural environments. This study addresses how recent global climate change has affected height growth of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx) and black spruce (Picea mariana Mill B. S.) in their natural environments. We sampled 145 stands dominated by aspen and 82 dominated by spruce over the entire range of their distributions in British Columbia, Canada. These stands were established naturally after fire between the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Height growth was quantified as total heights of sampled dominant and <b>co-dominant</b> <b>trees</b> at breast-height age of 50 years. We assessed the relationships between 50 -year height growth and environmental factors at both spatial and temporal scales. We also tested whether the tree growth associated with global climate change differed with spatial environment (latitude, longitude and elevation). As expected, height growth of both species was positively related to temperature variables at the regional scale and with soil moisture and nutrient availability at the local scale. While height growth of trembling aspen was not significantly related to any of the temporal variables we examined, that of black spruce increased significantly with stand establishment date, the anomaly of the average maximum summer temperature between May-August, and atmospheric CO 2 concentration, but not with the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Furthermore, th...|$|R
