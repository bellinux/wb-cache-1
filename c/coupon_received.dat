Urine samples inoculated with Bacillus insolitus and a filamentous mold, organisms previously recovered from the vapor compression distillation subsystem of NASA Space Station Freedom water recovery test were tested in glass corrosion cells containing base or weld metal coupons. Microbial levels, changes in pH, color, turbidity, and odor of the fluid were monitored {{over the course of the}} 21 -day test. Specimen surfaces were examined by scanning electron microscopy at completion of the test for microbial attachment. Ozonated urine samples were less turbid and had lower microbial levels than controls or samples receiving other pretreatments.

40|$|How to {{effectively}} distribute coupons digitally to consumers who may exercise them remains an enduring, yet important, issue to address. In this study, {{we seek to}} answer two questions. First, would the dissemination of product discount coupons through mobile technology, such as the mobile phone network via the short-message-service (SMS), yield different effects on consumers, compared to a more traditional communication technology such as e-mail? Second, does the source, that is, the merchant or referral from peers, matter to a consumer? We build on the theoretical lens of cognitive effort (technology) and social capital (source) to theorize and empirically validate the conjectures through a real-world field experiment spanning four weeks. In terms of technology, the results indicate {{no significant difference in}} terms of the usage rate of coupons between the two technological means through which the coupons were disseminated. However, in terms of the source, we observed a higher propensity of using <b>coupons</b> <b>received</b> from a peer as compared to <b>coupons</b> <b>received</b> from a merchant. Furthermore, the forwarding rate of the discount coupons was significantly higher via e-mail as compared to SMS. Implications for research and practice are discusse...|$|R

5000|$|Some prizes were {{advertised as}} [...] "free." [...] For example, a {{customer}} may redeem points for a [...] "free 20 oz. sparkling product". What the customer received was a manufacturer's coupon. These coupons are not accepted at all retailers who sell Coca-Cola products, which was frustrating to customers. Also, when a customer finds a retailer who does accept the coupons, {{he or she}} is responsible for sales tax on the retail price of the product plus any state container deposits. In California, for example, redeeming a [...] "free" [...] coupon for a 20 oz. beverage will cost the consumer $0.20. Another aggravation of consumers was the [...] "maximum values" [...] of these manufacturer coupons. For example, at the closure of the MyCokeRewards program, the <b>coupons</b> <b>received</b> for redeeming a [...] "free 12-pack Coca-Cola product" [...] had a maximum redemption value of $4.99 at retailers. This left the consumer responsible for paying the difference between the maximum value of the coupons and the retail prices of their corresponding products, meaning that the products received by using the coupons weren't truly [...] "free".|$|R

By the mid-1980s rationing of over seventy items had been eliminated; production of consumer goods had increased, and most items were in good supply.

50|$|These are {{short-term}} coupon bearing notes, {{which are}} designed to provide an enhanced yield while maintaining certain equity-like risks. Their investment value {{is derived from the}} underlying equity exposure, paid in the form of fixed <b>coupons.</b> Owners <b>receive</b> full principal back at maturity if the Knock-in Level is not breached (which is typically 70-80% of the initial reference price). If the underlying stock falls in value, the investor will receive shares of stock which will be worth less than his original investment.

If for example {{at the end of the}} transaction the losses in the portfolio remain below $50,000,000 (5% of $1,000,000,000) the investor will receive $10,000,000 back. If however, the losses in the portfolio amount to $52,000,000, which corresponds to 5.2% of pool notional, the investor will lose 20% ($2,000,000) of his capital, i.e. he will receive only $8,000,000 back.

For example, a $100mm sequential (SEQ) tranche off 6% collateral with a 6% coupon ('6 off 6') can be cut into an $92.307692mm SEQ tranche with a 6.5% coupon (and hence a higher dollar price) called a '6.5 off 6', and a SEQ PO tranche with a principal of $7.692308mm and paying a no coupon.

We find that while male-headed households are more likely to <b>receive</b> <b>coupons</b> than female-headed households, there seems to be less bias in intra-household use of subsidized fertilizers (or fertilizers in households receiving subsidy) between plots controlled by female and male members. This is despite the fact that, more generally, household incomes from various sources tend to be controlled and allocated by men. It also contrasts with evidence that plots controlled by female members were less likely to be applied with fertilizers when we consider all fertilizers in subsidized and unsubsidized households...|$|R
