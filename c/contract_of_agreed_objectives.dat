The Strategy recognises the importance of the pursuit of quality and lays emphasis on constantly measuring and evaluating quality through clinical audit and consumer surveys.

25|$|Chiume later drew {{attention}} to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating {{their opposition to the}} post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots {{had been going on for}} some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack <b>of</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>objectives</b> and the unplanned nature of their response. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.|$|R
40|$|Is Europe going far enough? Reflections on the EU’s Economic Governance Europe’s {{economic}} governance {{is not only}} highly complex, but also increasingly inefficient and therefore unsustainable in the long run. This conclusion is reached from the theory of collective action and the difficulties in democratic legitimacy. The solution would be {{the creation of a}} European government accountable to European citizens. The {{economic governance}} of the European Union, and especially of the Eurozone, has seen a rapid development since the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992 and European Monetary Union (EMU) started in 1999. Governance means the specific ways of deciding and implementing policies through informal rules and formal institutions and a set <b>of</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>objectives.</b> Different institutional arrangements and policy-orientations define different regimes of governance. In this paper I will look at whether the EU’s economic arrangements are consistent with its objectives. I will argue that some of them are, others are not and for their efficient governance a central government is required. The Treaty set the institutional framework for policy coordinatio...|$|R

Increasingly Institutions in Higher Education are being required to justify themselves. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>objectives,</b> this is difficult. The Author proceeds by representing the objectives of an institution by the mix of activities it chooses to involve itself in. Each activity is examined in turn and the problems of measurement of inputs and outputs for that activity are identified. The point is made that measures of performance implicitly relate to some concept of the process that turns inputs into outputs. The Author, therefore, discusses the various suggestions that have been made. There are few acceptable measures of overall performance and so the Author suggests {{the use of a}} profile of performance or an input-output list instead. The thesis draws on the research carried out by the Author (with others) in the area and discusses in detail two approaches; variance analysis and the efficiency frontier, which it is suggested are fruitful areas for further research...|$|R

30|$|Lower {{agreement}} for pain management {{may have also}} been due to lack <b>of</b> an <b>agreed,</b> standardised, <b>objective</b> pain assessment, particularly for non-communicative ICU patients, [36] leading to differences in responses (auditors indicated {{a higher rate of}} omissions). For audit data, one-fifth of compliant cases were not documented correctly or completely during the intervention, despite pain assessments taking place, an issue previously reported for Australian and New Zealand ICUs [4] and in emergency departments in the USA [37]. It may have been difficult for auditors to assess whether appropriate care was delivered. Similarly, minor discrepancies in concordance for sedation may have also been due to lack of documentation by clinical staff [38 – 40]. Concordance with blood glucose management may have been impacted by difficulties in maintaining levels within defined limits [41].|$|R

The present paper examines the proposal in The World Health Report 2000 that the concept of stewardship offers the appropriate basis for reconfiguration. We trace the development of stewardship from its initial religious formulation to more recent ecological and sociological permutations. Consideration is given to the potential of stewardship for encouraging state decision-making that is both normatively based and economically efficient. Various dilemmas that could impede or preclude such a shift in state behaviour are examined. We conclude that the concept of stewardship holds substantial promise if adequately developed and effectively implemented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Natural {{interaction}} between humanoid robots and humans {{is one of}} the major goals of the HRI field. Two major requirements for advancing this direction of research are the availability of human–human and base human–robot interaction datasets for training and evaluation purposes and the availability <b>of</b> general <b>agreed</b> upon <b>objective</b> metrics for judging the performance of proposed robots and algorithms. In this paper we report details of the H 3 R Explanation Corpus dataset of human–human and base human–robot interactions in assembly/disassembly explanation scenarios that combines five kinds of data: video, audio, motion tracking, subjective, and physiological data. 44 subjects and 66 sessions were conducted during this experiment. The corpus contains 22 natural Human–Human interactions, 22 un-natural Human–Human interactions, and 22 baseline Human-Robot interactions. To our best knowledge this is the first database that combines these five data types and three types of interactions. The paper also reports the first usage of this explanation corpus to compare subjective and physiological evaluations of various dimensions of listener’s behavior. I...|$|R

The traditional route for ergonomics intervention has been a Project route, with a set <b>of</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>agreed</b> between the human factors engineer and people within the company.

Case studies in a variety of industries are used to conrrast the project approach with a more strategic approach. It is concluded that the project may represent sub-optimization in that a successful outcome of the project may have no impact upon company survival without a careful examination of the strategic plans of the company.

40|$|The lack <b>of</b> <b>agreed</b> and <b>objective</b> {{measures}} for cycle service quality and capacity {{is an increasing}} barrier {{to the development of}} high-quality infrastructure. High cycle mode share jurisdictions face issues relating to increased cycle congestion whilst simultaneously, low cycle mode share jurisdictions face increasing calls for investment in cycle infrastructure, yet the ability to economically evaluate proposals is lacking. In both circumstances, a lack of robust quantitative measures is an issue. The limited existing {{measures for}} cycle service quality are developed based on the “isolated cyclist” or on a general assumption of non-impedance. By contrast, the fundamental principles of highway traffic flow (and of pedestrian flow) are entirely predicated on the concept of the constituent interactions, with speed-flow/density-flow curves being a well-established and empirically verified result of this. Consequently, to assess the importance of interactions between cyclists in service quality and capacity measures for bicycles, an agent-based 2 D microsimulation and social-force model was developed to test the validity of the non-impedance assumptions for unidirectional flow. The ability of the bicycles to interact and change speed resulted in both qualitative and quantitatively different outcomes to non-interaction. The speed-changing interactions led to outcomes more in keeping with empirical data and experience; and with service quality degrading rapidly as capacity is approached in comparison to non-speed-changing behaviour where service quality changes relatively slowly. The results from the simulation model therefore bring into question the validity of analysis that relies on isolated cyclists or non-interaction for use in quantitative measures. In particular, the non-linear increasing sensitivity of the quality of service as flow rates increase demonstrates the need to properly consider the interaction of the constituent bicycles in any realistic quantitative measure...|$|R
