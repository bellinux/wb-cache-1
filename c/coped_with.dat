To make matters worse, Tennessee's two starting quarterbacks suffered season-ending injuries during that four-game span. In the Volunteers' season-opener against UCLA, Jerry Colquitt suffered a knee injury. Backup quarterback Todd Helton was hurt in the fourth game of the season, a loss to Mississippi State.

5|$|In {{the first}} Test, Jardine scored 35 and 65 not out. His first innings began with England in an {{uncertain}} position, having lost three wickets for 108 {{on a very}} good batting wicket. His innings led England to a stronger position. He played very cautiously, being troubled by Clarrie Grimmett and Bert Ironmonger, the Australian spinners. Jardine believed that Ironmonger threw the ball, and this bowler gave him considerable trouble throughout his career. Thanks to the bowling of Harold Larwood, England took a huge first innings lead. In his second innings, although he played well in his 65, Jardine was not under much pressure. He scored {{a large number of}} singles, giving his partners most of the bowling and building up the lead to the point where England achieved a massive victory by 675 runs. This victory surprised and troubled the Australian cricketing public. Jardine played a similar role in the second Test, batting with Wally Hammond to retrieve a poor start for England in his only innings as they won by eight wickets. Jardine scored 62 in the third Test, supporting Hammond who made a double century. However, when Australia batted a second time, they built up a big lead and left England needing 332 to win on an exceptionally bad wicket which had been damaged by rain. Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe, in one of their most famous partnerships, put on 105. Hobbs sent a message to the team that Jardine should be the next batsmen to come in, even though he usually batted later on, as he was the batsman most likely to survive in the conditions. When Hobbs was dismissed, Jardine came in to bat. He survived, although finding batting exceptionally difficult, until the day's play ended. Percy Fender believed that Jardine was the only batsman in the side who could have <b>coped</b> <b>with</b> the difficult conditions. He went on to make 33 next day, and England won by three wickets.|$|E

40|$|I {{examined}} {{the different ways}} in which individuals <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> anxiety and stress levels. One hundred thirteen participants, 64 females and 41 males ranging from age 18 to 55, received a 9 -question survey related to their level of stress and anxiety and how often they <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> their stress in various ways; for example coping by exercising more often than coping by overeating depending on age and gender. All of {{the participants in this study}} were from general psychology classes at Boise State University.

Contrary to other studies, my results indicate no significant differences between males and females and the level of their stress. However, there is a significant difference between males and females and overeating to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress. Females tend to overeat to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress more often than males. This finding suggests that more females tend not to engage in physical activities to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> stress but instead eat to cope.

40|$|Background: To be {{diagnosed}} with cancer affects the whole person, both mentally and physically. The treatment may also affect the patient. Chemotherapy often has powerful side effects like fatigue, nausea and vomiting. It {{is important for the}} nurse to have knowledge about what might help the patients to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> these side effects. Aim: To learn more about cancer and <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> side effects of chemotherapy. To learn what the patient can do to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the side effects, and what the nurses can do to promote coping of these side effects for the cancer patients. Method: Literature study, with a systematic review of relevant research and literature. Search for literature was done in CINAHL, SveMed+ and PubMed. Five articles were included in this thesis. Results: There are both problem focused and emotion focused strategies for <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the side effects fatigue, loss of hair, nausea and vomiting. Information is important for <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> side effects. For <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> nausea and vomiting, acupressure and counseling evidently have positive effect. Use of prescription drugs, nutrition counseling and other measures have also proven to be effective against nausea and vomiting. For <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> fatigue working out has a positive effect, but also measures like distraction and relaxation can help reduce fatigue and thereby contribute to coping. For loss of hair a lot of the nursing interventions involve helping the patient accept the hair loss which makes it easier to <b>cope</b> <b>with.</b> Some of the measures also involve helping the patient to find items that can cover up the changes caused by hair loss...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} about Henrik Ibsen?s The Lady from the Sea. In this study, {{the writer is}} going to discuss Ellida Wangel?s <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the land life.

Through this study, the writer is challenged to analyze Ellida?s <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the land life {{to find out why}} Ellida is unable to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> her life on the land as well as how finally she succeeds in <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the land life. By applying literary theories on characterization, conflict, and setting, the writer discovers that Ellida is unable to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> her life on the land because she is intensely attached to the sea. Besides that, her inharmonious relationships with her husband and stepdaughters as well as the people in the town also take part in creating her inability to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the land life. Furthermore, the writer also learns that in order to survive on the land, Ellida attempts to escape from her reality through her fantasy. By studying Ellida?s <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the land life, the writer concludes {{that it is hard to}} acclimatize oneself to a new environment, and yet feeling of being needed and loved may assist one to acclimatize oneself to the new environment...|$|R

25|$|The National Hockey Association (NHA), officially the National Hockey Association of Canada Limited, was a {{professional}} ice hockey organization with teams in Ontario and Quebec, Canada.

During its lifetime, the league <b>coped</b> <b>with</b> competition for players with the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the enlistment of players for World War I and disagreements between owners. The disagreements between owners {{came to a head}} in 1917, when the NHA suspended operations in order to get rid of an unwanted owner (Eddie Livingstone).

40|$|Background: Patients with {{sickle cell}} disease <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> their disease in various ways, such as psycho-logical counseling, hypnosis, medication, and prayer. Spirituality is a coping {{mechanism}} {{in a variety of}} diseases. This study evaluates the role of spirituality in patients <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the pain of sickle cell dis-ease. Methods: Seventy-one patients from the Georgia Sickle Cell Clinic completed a questionnaire ad-dressing their ability to <b>cope</b> <b>with</b> the pain of {{sickle cell disease}} and their degree of spirituality. A de-scriptive cross-sectional design was used. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were calculated for the relation between <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> the pain of sickle cell disease and spirituality. Results: The questionnaire provided several scales with high internal consistency for measuring spiritual well-being and its two components, existential well-being and religious well-being, that show a correlation between high levels of spirituality and life control. The study population exhibited high lev-els of spirituality and religiosity, but the influence of these feelings on <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> sickle cell disease was variable.
