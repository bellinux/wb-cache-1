25|$|Grizzly {{bears are}} {{especially}} dangerous {{because of the}} force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 megapascals (1160 psi). It {{has been estimated that}} a bite from a grizzly could even <b>crush</b> a <b>bowling</b> ball.|$|R
25|$|Single {{cylinder}} hydraulic cone crusher is mainly composed of main frame, transmission device, eccentric shaft, bowl-shaped bearing, <b>crushing</b> cone, mantle, <b>bowl</b> liner, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, dust-proof ring, feed plate, etc.|$|R
50|$|Mămăligă {{is often}} served {{with sour cream}} and cheese on the side (mămăligă cu brânză şi smântână) or <b>crushed</b> in a <b>bowl</b> of hot milk (mămăligă cu lapte). Sometimes slices of mămăligă are pan-fried in oil or in lard, the result being a sort of corn pone.|$|R
5000|$|Oregon <b>crushed</b> the Rose <b>Bowl</b> {{dreams of}} Oregon State {{last year in}} its 65-38 drubbing of the Beavers in Reser Stadium. This year the [...] "Civil War" [...] game will {{determine}} the Pac-10 representative to the 2010 Rose Bowl. Oregon State won the last meeting in Autzen, 38-31 in overtime. This {{is the first time}} in the series' 112-year history that the winner gets an automatic bid to the Rose Bowl. Oregon is the heavy favorite to win the game.|$|R
25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, <b>crushing</b> cone, mantle, <b>bowl</b> liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift supporting sleeve and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|R
2500|$|In {{their home}} series against India in 1982–83, Pakistan played six Tests and {{defeated}} them by 3–0; Pakistan's [...] victories at Karachi, Hyderabad and Faisalabad were gained by large margins. Miandad's consistency of scoring runs, along with Zaheer, Mudassar and Mohsin Khan, <b>crushed</b> the Indian <b>bowling</b> line. Miandad {{was the third}} highest run-scorer, with 594 runs – after Mudassar's 761 and Zaheer's 650 runs – at the average of 118.80; they made {{the record for the}} three top batsmen in any Test series. Miandad and Mudassar's partnership of 451 runs in the Hyderabad Test constituted a new world record for the third wicket, and equalled the all-time record for any Test wicket, made by Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford in 1938. They became the first two Pakistani batsmen to score double-centuries in an inning. Miandad scored his career best 280 not out, before the captain Imran Khan, decided to declare the innings, thus stopping him from [...] "possibly breaking the individual Test world record of Sir Garfield Sobers". Cricket critics call this [...] "one of the worst decisions by Imran as captain of Pakistan" [...] as he [...] "didn't even give him a particular time or the number of overs he could bat on for." [...] Miandad, however never expressed displeasure on the decision. Pakistan won the match by an innings and 119 runs. Pakistan visited India in 1983–84 under the captaincy of Zaheer, and played a leveled three-Test match series. Miandad scored 225 runs in the series at the average of 75.00, including 99 runs at Bangalore. Miandad scored 131 runs against Australia at the Adelaide Oval, the third Test of the series between the teams. He could not perform consistently and finished the series with 302 runs at average of over 33, with Pakistan lost the five-match series 2–0.|$|R
60|$|The day, {{the long}} summer day, passed slowly. There {{was a hard}} brilliancy in the sky that {{reminded}} the Frenchman of those Egyptian heavens when the earth seemed <b>crushed</b> beneath a <b>bowl</b> of molten fire. Arthur was too restless to remain indoors and left the others to their own devices. He walked without aim, {{as fast as he}} could go; he felt no weariness. The burning sun beat down upon him, but he did not know it. The hours passed with lagging feet. Susie lay on her bed and tried to read. Her nerves were so taut that, when there was a sound in the courtyard of a pail falling on the cobbles, she cried out in terror. The sun rose, and presently her window was flooded with quivering rays of gold. It was midday. The day passed, and it was afternoon. The evening came, but it brought no freshness. Meanwhile Dr Porhoët sat in the little parlour, with his head between his hands, trying by a great mental effort to bring back to his memory all that he had read. His heart began to beat more quickly. Then the night fell, and one by one the stars shone out. There was no wind. The air was heavy. Susie came downstairs and began to talk with Dr Porhoët. But they spoke in a low tone, as if they were afraid that someone would overhear. They were faint now with want of food. The hours went one by one, and the striking of a clock filled them each time with a mysterious apprehension. The lights in the village were put out little by little, and everybody slept. Susie had lighted the lamp, and they watched beside it. A cold shiver passed through her.|$|R
