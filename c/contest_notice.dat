40|$|The Solar Award in Taiwan is {{an annual}} contest that {{encourages}} professionals {{and students to}} submit innovative design projects that utilize solar photovoltaic material. Entries range from architectural and construction projects {{to the design of}} products such as toys and racing cars. In this study, we collected the direct feedback from the contestants as part of a program evaluation project. A questionnaire was designed to capture the perceived benefits of the contestants' experience in the Solar Award. Further, Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) was used to estimate the economic value of those benefits. The web-based survey was completed by 135 previous contestants. Out analysis indicated that they expressed a mean willingness to pay of NTD 2511 (USD 85) as a registration fee. An aggregated value of NTD 3. 3 million (US 110, 000) was estimated to represent the use value of this event. We concluded that the Solar Award brought significant knowledge improvement and commercial opportunities to the contestants as well as positive effects on their perception of renewable energy. In addition, we found that there was {{an increase in the number}} of contestants that became practical users of solar PV following the <b>contest.</b> We also <b>noticed</b> that different occupational groups perceived and valued the contest experiences differently...|$|R
5000|$|Born in Rio Tercero (Ctalamochita, its Indian name), {{between the}} Pampas and the {{mountains}} of the province of Cordoba, Argentina, a village, river and reservoir that had been researched by Charles Darwin 100 years ago, Luis Alberto Ambroggio {{is the son of}} Dr. Ernesto Pedro Ambroggio, dentist, founder of one of the first institutes of Orthodontics in Cordoba and Perla Lutereau de Ambroggio, philosophy professor at the National and Catholic Universities of Cordoba, a [...] "recognized and feared teacher, anti-dictatorship, who was expelled from the campus by mounted police, a woman of deep faith {{and at the same time}} admirer of Nietzsche, she certainly has had a decisive influence on the personality and calling of her son.” He attended primary school in Cordoba and high school in Rosario. From an early age he felt a great attraction to books such as those written by Salgari and Verne which he would later leave for the study of classical Greek philosophers and his great revelation, Erasmus. Before the age of fifteen he had written poems and won poetry <b>contests.</b> His mother, <b>noticing</b> this ability, gave him an anthology of César Vallejo; this would mark the beginning of his important history in the world of poetry.|$|R
40|$|Motor {{vehicles}} are a core technology of our modern life and economy. But motor vehicles, motor fuels, {{and the road}} system unfortunately pollute our air, soil and water, depend on limited oil supplies and are implicated in warming the earth’s climate. In response, some car companies have introduced the biggest change in automotive technology since early in the last century. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) reduce emissions and fuel use through increased fuel economy. So far, full-HEV technology {{has been used to}} reduce automotive fuel use by up to 40 % and reduce emissions to meet California’s (and thus, the nation’s) most stringent air quality standards. The following study measures such benefits. Americans are currently buying over 20, 000 HEVs per month; one model, the Toyota Prius has reached sales volumes of over 100, 000 units per year. However, total HEV sales are still small compared to annual sales of all vehicles and the total number of vehicles on the road. HEVs account for about 1. 6 % of the annual US market of 17 million new light-duty vehicles, and only 0. 2 % of the total US fleet of 230 million light-duty vehicles. The numbers of makes and models offered as HEVs are small, and sales are just getting started. To spread hybrid technologies across the entire market, and replace most vehicles on the road will take decades. Still, HEVs are making an impact beyond their incipient number, primarily by being the first “green” cars on the market and setting a standard of achievement for high fuel economy and low emissions. HEV sales and their halo effect on Toyota and Honda have spurred a contest between automobile makers to supply the latest high-tech, clean, and green technologies. In the California market, hybrids account for 3 % of total new light duty vehicles sales, and hybrid sales growth outpaces that of conventional models (Automotive News Data). If this <b>contest</b> is <b>noticed</b> by more car and truck buyers, it may well transform the automotive market, accelerating the introduction of alternative fuels and other electric drive technologies such as plug-in HEVs and full electric vehicles to market. In the following sections, we review the problems motor vehicles cause, then describe the varieties of hybrid technologies. Then we analyze what difference HEVs are making right now and can make in the future for our air, water, security, and climate...|$|R
5000|$|As a {{favorite}} pastime of the Chakarian age, the Rind nobles gathered for an archery competition. During the <b>contest,</b> the nobles <b>noticed</b> the curiosity and interest of Murid, {{the leader of}} beggars. At first the Rind nobles treated him {{with a certain amount}} of disdain on account of his shabby appearance, laughing at him and asking how a mendicant clad in tattered clothes could bend a bow and hit a target. They gave him a bow and arrow. He bent the bow but it could not bear the power of his arms and broke into pieces. They gave him another one, which he also broke. After he broke the third bow the Rind nobles grow a bit suspicious that he might be Sheh Murid. They sent someone to fetch Murid Khan's bow, which was made out of steel and was called jug (yoke) because of its form and weight. The epic tells us that this famous weapon had been tossed in a pen for sheep and goats after the [...] "master of the iron bow" [...] had departed and it had no owner to care for it. Because of its weight and toughness, it was useless in the hands of anyone else. When it was turned over to him, Sheh Murid caressed and kissed it, gently touching the strings as if they belonged to a sacred instrument; he scrutinized every inch. Then, as a master archer, he rolled up his beggar's mantle, bent the bow with great skill, and shot three arrows from it, passing one through the hole left by the previous one. The Rind's suspicion that this beggar was in fact Sheh Murid was confirmed after the trial of the bow. The Rind nobles stopped Murid and a servant was sent to ask Hani for Murid's distinguishing signs and marks, which she would know because they had played together as children. Hani told of a sign on the upper left thigh, which her bracelet had made, and another one behind the eyebrow. When the Rinds checked the signs, they at last recognized Sheh Murid.|$|R
