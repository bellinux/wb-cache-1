40|$|<b>Continuous</b> <b>tone</b> printing, either {{collotype}} or screenless lithography, are {{processes that}} are in limited use. The halftone method of reproduction {{is still the most}} economical way to reproduce a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> original. This study dealt with the mechanism of screenless lithography, more specifically on how to make the use of negative working plates a feasible alternative to positive working plates. It is known that the positive working plate can print a longer range of tones than a negative working plate. So the main point of the experiment dealt with how to extend the range of a negative working plate. A negative plate is of high contrast, and so multiple negative working plates were used to print one image. Each plate in itself can print three to four steps of a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> step wedge. In this experiment, three plates were used in the hopes of printing twelve steps in a continuous gradation. A <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> step wedge along with a black and white photograph were divided among the three plates. Twelve steps on the step wedge were identified, and so each film had four of the possible thirty steps which existed on the step wedge. These films were exposed to plates, and mounted on the press. Each image was run in registration with one another, and the solid ink density was varied to produce the <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> effect. From the press sheets examined, in which there are examples in this report, a high contrast image was produced. One of the main problems in the experiment was differences in emulsion coating on each individual plate. Which resulted in inconsistent exposure times from one plate to another. From repeated plate testing using a. 15 density increment <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> step wedge as a control guide, it was found that for the same exposure a hardening of the plate coating (and consequently of ink receptivity) corresponding to two steps equaling. 30 density difference was to be expected. This made it virtually impossible {{to get a handle on}} the correct exposure time needed for the plate. Results from this experiment show, that it is not possible to effectively print a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> image with a negative working plate and or multiple negative plates. This is due to the high contrast of the negative working plate, thus making it suitable for mainly halftone lithographic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Vector {{representation}} of graphics has an {{advantage of being}} displayed at any size. When resolution of a bitmap image is changed, lack of a line segment arises. In addition, moire occurs when resolution of an image with halftone dots is resized. In this paper, we propose a new technique to convert the binary image with halftone dots into the vector representation. Resolution conversion of binary image can easily be performed without moire by <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> approximation of halftone dots. First, we separate the area of halftone dots and line drawings in the image. Next, a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> approximation {{is applied to the}} area of halftone dots. Then, the conventional vectorization is applied to both <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> areas and line drawings. Finally these components are mixed and reconstructed. Our approach provides an efficient way of displaying cartoon like images at any size with limited amount of data. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{contemporary}} method of <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> colour printing {{based upon the}} Nineteenth Century printing process of Woodburytype as developed by Walter Bentley Woodbury in 1865. Woodburytype was the only truly <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> printing process yet invented, and died out {{in the late nineteenth}} century as more expedient and cost effective methods of printing prevailed, thus laying the path for current CMYK print technologies. Digital print itself, since its development as a range of colour printing technologies, has followed a route based on the half-tone dot and four colour separation predicated around CMYK. In recent years stochastic algorithms and dithering have allowed the lay down of multiple passes and colour sets to create a near <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> image. The downside of this approach is that in order to create a full colour subtractive image, the resultant prints have very little surface topography and a mechanical uniformity that demonstrates none of the surface characteristics, tactile qualities and rich tonal warmth of the 19 th century photo-mechanical processes. Current research at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, is exploring the potential of CNC milled imagery, where the tonal range of each colour is assigned a physical height to produce a <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> topographic relief printing matrix, from which the colour image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled one on top of another resulting in a true four colour separation <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour...|$|R
50|$|Where <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> imagery {{contains}} an infinite {{range of colors}} or greys, the halftone process reduces visual reproductions to an image that is printed with only one color of ink, in dots of differing size (amplitude modulation) or spacing (frequency modulation). This reproduction relies on a basic optical illusion: the tiny halftone dots are blended into smooth tones by the human eye. At a microscopic level, developed black-and-white photographic film also consists of only two colors, and not an infinite range of <b>continuous</b> <b>tones.</b> For details, see film grain.|$|R

We {{have found that the}} DCT provides the greatest energy compactness properties for <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> images(such as photographs). For images demonstrating rapid gradient variations the Haar Transform performs significantly better {{than any of the other}} transform we have analysed, although its performance on <b>continuous</b> <b>tone</b> images is substantially worse than either the DCT or DTT.

50|$|When pixel art is {{displayed}} {{at a higher}} resolution than the source image, it is often scaled using the nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm. This avoids blurring caused by other algorithms, such as bilinear and bicubic interpolation—which interpolate between adjacent pixels and work best on <b>continuous</b> <b>tones,</b> but not sharp edges or lines. Nearest-neighbor interpolation preserves these sharp edges, but it makes diagonal lines and curves look blocky, an effect called pixelation. Thus, hybrid algorithms have been devised to interpolate between <b>continuous</b> <b>tones</b> while preserving the sharpness of lines in the piece; such attempts include the 2xSaI, Super Eagle, and the high-quality hqx algorithms.|$|R

Halftoned image is a binary version of the <b>continuous</b> <b>toned</b> image.

The need for inverse halftoning arises from the need to manipulate the images, rotation or zooming etc In this thesis we deal with inverse halftoning of images halftoned by error diffusion algorithms. ^ Analysing the spectrum the low frequencies of the halftoned and original image are similar, but the halftoned image contains quantization noise in the higher frequencies. So {{the first step in}} our inverse halftoning method is the removal of high frequency quantization noise by Gaussian lowpass filtering. The second stage of our inverse halftoning algorithm is the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCS) algorithm which alternatively projects the image onto the two convex sets, repeats and converges in the intersection of the two convex sets.
