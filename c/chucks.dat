5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill <b>chucks</b> (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E
25|$|Although Morse tapers are {{intended}} to hold tools or tool holders (<b>chucks</b> & arbors), collets are also available. These {{can be used to}} hold tools with better accuracy (less run-out) than a chuck.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the above}} traits, scroll <b>chucks</b> offer always № 1 and № 2; usually № 3; to varying extents № 4 (depending on the situation); but not {{reliably}} № 5. Independent-jaw <b>chucks</b> offer always № 3; usually № 4; reliably № 5 (but {{at the expense}} of paying a skilled user to spend time achieving it); never № 2; and generally not № 1. Meanwhile, a collet chuck can deliver all reliably, and with no need for a skilled user (№s 3 to 5 do depend on the object being clamped closely matching {{the size and shape of}} the collet's clamping surface. This constraint is usually not a problem when the object is good-quality bar stock; the shank of a well maintained drill bit, reamer, end mill, etc.; or a previously machined part that is being rechucked for additional cutting operations).|$|E
2500|$|Usually in shop-floor terminology, {{the terms}} collet and <b>chuck</b> {{are used in}} contradistinction; users speak of holding a {{workpiece}} or tool with either a collet or a <b>chuck.</b> In this context [...] "chuck" [...] means any type of <b>chuck</b> other than a collet <b>chuck</b> (scroll <b>chuck,</b> independent-jaw <b>chuck,</b> etc.).|$|R

40|$|<b>ChucK,</b> a {{powerful}} audio synthesis programming language, currently supporting only a simple command line interface. Accompanying the ongoing {{development of the}} <b>ChucK</b> language is the production of two new interfaces for <b>ChucK,</b> the <b>ChucK</b> shell and the miniAudicle. The <b>ChucK</b> shell provides a lightweight method of access to <b>ChucK</b> in a shell-like console environment. The miniAudicle offers {{a powerful}} integrated solution to the <b>ChucK</b> development process and a framework for further enhancements to the <b>ChucK</b> programming environment. The miniAudicle also provides a set of generic user interface elements with which programmers can quickly construct graphical interfaces in <b>ChucK</b> programs. The miniAudicle streamlines and simplifies <b>ChucK</b> development, allowing <b>ChucK</b> programmers to focus on design and artistic issues while also exposing <b>ChucK</b> to computer musicians who are unfamiliar with or averse to the command line.

500|$|In an {{interview}} in the US {{towards the end of}} 1896 Churchill explained that for the financial year ending 1 September 1896 sales were £110,000, and the order book value was £30,000. He attributed much of the exceptional growth of that year to the boom in bicycling and the consequent demand for automatic screw machines and similar machinery, and commented that he had placed orders for between 15million and 18million steel balls and that gas furnaces were selling well. He explained that there was little competition for the imported machinery – not even a manufacturer of <b>chucks,</b> {{as far as he was}} aware – because [...] "English" [...] firms seemed reluctant to even copy US designs, partly because of [...] "the Englishman's desire to have and to embody his own ideas" [...] and to what they perceived to be the high capital costs of setting up production given the price at which US machinery was sold there. A few years later he did just that.|$|E
500|$|Matangi {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come Walk With Me, Exodus) that boil and steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track <b>chucks</b> handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't help but be glad it exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the abrasiveness of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section". He {{then goes on to}} admit that [...] "in a way, that's the highest compliment you can pay her: a decade into her career, MIA still doesn't sound like anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Autolock" [...] collet <b>chucks</b> (Osbourn [...] "Pozi-Lock" [...] is {{a similar}} system) were {{designed}} to provide secure clamping of milling cutters with only hand tightening. They were developed in the 1940s by a now defunct UK company, Clarkson (Engineers) Limited, and {{are commonly known as}} Clarkson <b>chucks.</b> Autolock collets require cutters with threaded shank ends to screw into the collet itself. Any rotation of the cutter forces the collet against the collet cap taper which tightly clamps the cutter, the screw fitting also prevents any tendency of the cutter to pull out. Collets are only available in fixed sizes, imperial or metric, and the cutter shank must be an exact match.|$|E

In bar work the bar protrudes from the <b>chuck,</b> is worked upon, then cut off by a lathe tool (parted off) rather than being sawn off. Automatic lathes that specialize in <b>chucking</b> work are often called chuckers.|$|R
40|$|Particle and defect {{issues related}} to {{electrostatic}} <b>chucking</b> with an ultra-planar, pin-structured mask <b>chuck</b> for EUVL application were addressed. By mapping particles/defects on the backside of 8 inch Si-wafers before and after <b>chucking,</b> particle transport from the <b>chuck</b> to the wafer was studied at application relevant electrostatic forces. Particles were detected by analysis of stray light intensities on the wafer side. Investigations were performed under ambient conditions at high <b>chucking</b> voltages on a bipolar <b>chuck.</b> Particle transport from the <b>chuck</b> surface to the wafer surface was mapped and found to concentrate at the pin sites. Successively lower particle counts with increasing number of <b>chucked</b> wafers were observed, indicating a "cleaning effect" on the <b>chuck's</b> surface induced by the electrostatic <b>chucking</b> procedure. No influence of electric field direction (polarity) on particle count was discernable...|$|R

2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill <b>chucks.</b> Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|E
