25|$|According to the USGS, {{there is}} a broad {{consensus}} {{that the possibility of}} major earthquakes in the New Madrid Seismic Zone remains a concern, and that the GPS data do not provide a <b>compelling</b> <b>case</b> for lessening perceived earthquake hazards in the region.

The USGS issued a fact sheet in 2009 stating the estimate of a 7–10% chance of a New Madrid earthquake of magnitude comparable to one of the 1811–1812 quakes within the next 50 years, and a 25–40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 earthquake in the same time frame.|$|E

40|$|There {{is today}} {{consensus}} {{on the fact that}} optical interconnects can relieve bandwidth density concerns at integrated circuit boundaries.

Hence, the performance and energy implications when augmenting these devices with optical interconnect technology are derived by means of an accurate benchmarking framework against an aggressively optimized electrical counterpart...|$|R

Afraid, perhaps, to toy with viewers the way that Lost did, Fringe keeps the action moving, rapidly unspooling its mysteries, and that decision proves to be a wise one.

30|$|Initial {{results from}} these {{analyses}} illustrate potentially <b>compelling</b> <b>cases</b> for P 2 H applications. In {{order to better}} study the integration of P 2 H in the power system, an energy hub (EH) [29, 30] equipped with a P 2 H facility (electrolyzer) and a gas-to-power (G 2 P) facility (hydrogen gas turbine) is proposed in this paper to accommodate the volatility introduced by a large wind power penetration. The proposed EH stores surplus wind power as hydrogen via P 2 H. When needed, the G 2 P facility feeds the energy back to the power grid. Unlike other MW-size energy storage facilities, the EH can not only feed energy back to the power grid, but also directly supply hydrogen products to other industry sectors. This could allow additional wind generation capacity to be installed inside the EH and enhance its economic viability.|$|R

2500|$|Beowulf {{was written}} in England, but is set in Scandinavia; its dating has {{attracted}} considerable scholarly attention. The poem has been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries, with some recent scholarship offering {{what has been called}} [...] "a cohesive and <b>compelling</b> <b>case</b> for Beowulf's early composition." [...] However, opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is nearly contemporary with its transcription, whether it was first written in the 8th century, or if a proto-version of the poem was perhaps composed at an even earlier time (possibly as one of the Bear's Son Tales) and orally transmitted for many years, then transcribed in its present form at a later date. Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting. J. R. R. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of Anglo-Saxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianisation of England around AD 700, and Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by Tom Shippey, Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J.

[...] The album charted at #5 on the Specialist Classical Chart for the week ending 6 February 2010 [...] Andrew Lamb wrote in The Gramophone {{that the success of}} the recording is due to Lloyd-Jones's [...] "dramatic pacing", that the three key roles of Ivanhoe, Rebecca and Sir Brian are well cast.

2500|$|Sacco's pistol is {{also claimed}} to have passed {{in and out of}} police custody, and to have been {{dismantled}} several times, both in 1924 prior to the gun barrel switch, and again between 1927 and 1961. The main problem with these charges is that the match to Sacco's gun was based not only the [...]32 pistol, but also to the same-caliber bullet that killed Berardelli, as well as to spent casings found at the scene. In addition to tampering with the pistol, the gun switcher/dismantler would also have had to access police evidence lockers and exchange the bullet from Berardelli's body and all spent casings retrieved by police, or else locate the actual murder weapon, then switch barrel, firing pin, ejector, and extractor, all before Goddard's examination in 1927 when the first match was made to Sacco's gun. However, skeptics of Sacco's guilt have repeatedly pointed to a single anomaly — that several witnesses to the crime insisted the gunman, alleged to be Sacco, fired four bullets into Berardelli. [...] "He shot at Berardelli probably four or five times," [...] one witness said. [...] "He stood guard over him.” If this was true, many ask, how could only one of the fatal bullets be linked to Sacco's gun? In 1927, the defense raised the suggestion that the fatal bullet had been planted, calling attention to the awkward scratches on the base of the bullet that differed from those on other bullets. The Lowell Commission dismissed this claim as desperate but in 1985, historians William Kaiser and David Young made a <b>compelling</b> <b>case</b> for a switch in their book [...] "Post-Mortem: New Evidence in the Case of Sacco and Vanzetti." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Two crises {{dominate}} the health sectors of sub-Saharan African countries: those {{of human resources}} and of HIV. Nevertheless, there is considerable variation in {{the extent to which}} these two phenomena affect sub-Saharan countries, with a few facing extreme levels of both: Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, the Central African Republic and Malawi. This paper reviews the continent-wide situation with respect to this double burden before considering the case of Malawi in more detail. In Malawi, there has been significant concurrent investment in both an Emergency Human Resource Programme and an antiretroviral therapy programme which was treating 60, 000 people by the end of 2006. Both areas of synergy and conflict have arisen, as the two programmes have been implemented.
