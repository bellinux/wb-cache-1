5000|$|In {{parts of}} Belgium, wanted posters {{depicting}} Niko Bellic and Little Jacob appeared. The posters list specific details of each character, {{such as the}} characters' height, weight, and age. Niko is wanted for questioning in an investigation of a grand theft auto incident and Little Jacob for robbery and firearms possession. Other information revealed within the posters were the names of two streets in the game, Lorimar Street and Wordite Street; a possible way of <b>car-jacking</b> within the game via assaulting the driver {{with a baseball bat}} and a possible, unofficially released character within the game, [...] "Detective Moeller". Rockstar Games has indicated that these promotion posters were accidentally released and therefore unofficial.

The posters are now available on the official GTA IV website as a printable download.|$|E
50|$|Compressive {{asphyxia}} (also called chest compression) is mechanically limiting {{expansion of}} the lungs by compressing the torso, hence interfering with breathing. Compressive asphyxia occurs when the chest or abdomen is compressed posteriorly. In accidents, the term traumatic asphyxia or crush asphyxia usually refers to compressive asphyxia resulting from being crushed or pinned under a large weight or force. An example of traumatic asphyxia includes cases where an individual has been using a <b>car-jack</b> to repair a car from below, and is crushed {{under the weight of}} the vehicle. Pythons, anacondas, and other constrictor snakes kill through compressive asphyxia. In cases of co-sleeping ("overlay"), the weight of an adult or large child may compress an infant's chest, preventing proper {{expansion of the}} chest. Risk factors include large or obese adults, parental fatigue or impairment (sedation by drugs or alcohol) of the co-sleeping adult and a small shared sleeping space (for example, both adult and infant sharing a couch).|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{representation}} of Christopher Center's integration of traditional library services with current {{technology is the}} Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS). This combination of robotics and computer system {{has the capacity to}} store 300,000 files. Two stories high, the system features bins stacked along two aisles. Materials that are used infrequently by students or faculty are maintained in this location.When one of the 60,000 items is requested, the robotic system locates and retrieves the publication in about 15 seconds. Using a bar code logged into it, the management computer system runs the robot and simultaneously registers the volume's current location in the one of its 1,872 bins. Designed like a combination <b>car-jack</b> and fork lift, the computer-controlled cranes move along the aisles and up or down the stacks of bins to retrieve the requested material and place it on a tray desk in the main circulation area. Provided by a gift from alumnus Herbert F. Stride, this automated storage and retrieval system {{is one of the first}} five installed for use in libraries in the nation.|$|R
2500|$|Commentators {{from both}} inside and outside the hip hop {{community}} have criticized the cost of many of the accoutrements of hip hop fashion. Chuck D of Public Enemy summarized the mentality of Hip hop fashion and some low-income youths as [...] "Man, I work at McDonald's, but in order for me to feel good about myself I got to get a gold chain or I got to get a fly car in order to impress a sister or whatever. [...] " [...] In his 1992 song [...] "Us", Ice Cube rapped that [...] "Us niggaz will always sing the blues / 'cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes". Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip hop brands in hip hop magazines. In one letter to the editor in Source magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should [...] "try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don't have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness. [...] " [...] In fact, there were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s.

The video begins with Dre, in his home watching the $20 Sack Pyramid (a track skit from the album shown as a game show in the video), taking a phone call and being invited to a Parliament concert. He then heads out in his lowrider and the song begins. Many helicopter-view camshots of the super-highways of Compton follow, some cuts of Snoop, a <b>car-jacking</b> scene, and various footage of Dre picking up girls, all of which leads to a street party outside the concert venue. Ice Cube makes a cameo appearance, walking out from a women's bathroom saying [...] "Damn right, it was a good day", referring to his 1992 solo single, and also officially squashing the beef between Dre and Ice Cube which had existed since Ice Cube left N.W.A.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} {{examine the effect of}} misinformation imparted through co-witness discussions on memory reports and line-up decisions obtained after varied retention intervals. Two-hundred and eighty-nine participants viewed a simulated <b>car-jacking</b> and then heard co-witnesses describe their memory for the event. Confederate accounts included three plausible and three implausible pieces of misinformation. Memory for the event was assessed after five-minutes, 50 -minutes, two-days, or one-week. In addition to examining free-recall memory, we also looked at how misinformation about the perpetrator’s appearance affected recognition memory by obtaining identifications from culprit-present and absent lineups. One of the confederates falsely described the perpetrator having a tattoo on his neck, and one lineup filler had this feature. Results revealed that mistaken identifications of the tattooed filler increased significantly at the longer retention intervals, while recall for the misinformation decreased at the longer intervals. Also, as expected, plausible misinformation was recalled more often than implausible...|$|E
5000|$|After {{her boyfriend}} Mike {{unexpectedly}} cancels their anniversary date, Chris Parker invites her friend, Brenda, {{over to her}} Oak Park, Illinois house to cheer her up, but is eventually convinced by her mother to babysit the Andersons' daughter, 8-year-old Sara, while they attend {{a party at the}} Crain Communications Building in downtown Chicago. Fifteen-year-old Brad Anderson is originally supposed to go to his friend Daryl Coopersmith's house to spend the night, but he changes his mind when he finds that Chris is the sitter. After receiving a frantic phone call from Brenda, who ran away to the bus station downtown, using all of her money for the cab ride, Chris plans to go alone to pick her up, but is coerced by Brad, Sara and Daryl to take them with her. On the freeway, the Buick Electra station wagon suffers a flat tire and they are picked up by a kind tow truck driver, [...] "Handsome" [...] John Pruitt, who offers to pay for the tire when Chris realizes she left her purse at the Andersons'.

50|$|Around {{the same}} time, Skye {{disappeared}} and Adam, who {{was back in}} a romance with Sharon Newman, was accused of her murder. With little money left, Sharon offered {{to pay for his}} legal fees and brought in Vance and his new legal partner, Leslie Michaelson. When Adam testified for Victor against his siblings wishes, Leslie was shocked to see Adam, but he learned that apart of this deal, Victor pledged to come forward to the DA regarding his involvement in Sharon's case and would win a trust of his own. After some detective work by Sharon, Adam's charges were dropped, but {{as a result of her}} work, she was now accused of murder. In Hawaii, Sharon found Skye, but after an argument, Skye fell to her death in a volcano. It was soon discovered by Adam, Jack, and Phyllis Summers that Victor set Skye up in Hawaii and he was in Hawaii when Sharon was there to make sure no one learned the truth. In Sharon's trial, despite the testimony of Victor, and Vance's sharp legal tactics, Sharon was found guilty. Adam feared that this would happen, so he secretly arranged for her to escape afterward. Upon escaping, she was <b>car-jacked</b> and presumed to be dead after the carjackers got into a serious accident. Vance was not involved in any legal cases after Sharon's murder trial. When Sharon was found alive in New Mexico and brought back to Genoa City for sentencing, Victor hired a new lawyer, Avery Bailey Clark, to help get Sharon out of prison.|$|R
50|$|Still {{determined}} {{to solve the}} case, Jonathan and Joey return to Green Lanterns and follow Hugo to the Judas Tree in the grounds, where they are surprised to find Harriet alive. It transpires that she and Hugo faked her death, framing Emily {{as a means of}} revenge. On the same day Emily encountered the man in the field in 1988, she and Kim <b>car-jacked</b> Hugo's mentally impaired older brother Danny (Gregor Henderson-Begg). When he tried to defend himself, Kim bludgeoned him to death with a stone and hid his body. He survived long enough to draw a picture of his attackers. The jury at their trial ruled in their favour, and years later Harriet persuaded Hugo to exact vigilante justice. Harriet kidnapped Kim, who is shown being drugged next to Harriet's car, then bound and gagged in the house, dressed them both in identical clothes, and threw Kim from the window to her death. She then switched places with her for long enough to implicate Emily in the attack, taking advantage of the fact that Harriet spent so little time in the village that nobody who knew her was likely to see her body after her 'death'. Although their crime is uncovered, Harriet reminds Jonathan that he has already failed to convince a jury once, and is likely to again. Emily remains in prison, while she and Hugo are free (Although Jonathan admits later that Emily's lack of remorse about the death of Hugo's brother - which he is certain she remembers despite Joey suggesting that she repressed the trauma of it - leaves him with little real sympathy for her).|$|R
