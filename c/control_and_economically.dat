50|$|C. formosanus has its {{greatest}} impact in North America. It is currently {{one of the}} most destructive pests in the United States, estimated to cost consumers over $1 billion annually for preventive and remedial treatment and to repair damage caused by this insect. In New Orleans, 30-50% of the city's 4,000 historic live oak trees are believed to be infected, with total damage costing the city $300 million a year. In North America, C. formosanus creates significantly bigger colonies, and therefore more damage, than native US termites, which reside underground and enter buildings only to forage. C. formosanus is the most destructive, difficult to <b>control,</b> <b>and</b> <b>economically</b> important species of termite in the southern United States.|$|E

Constrained by the large ramping, a generator alone is not capable of conducting load frequency <b>controls</b> effectively <b>and</b> <b>economically.</b> In this paper, an energy storage system (ESS) is introduced to coordinate with generators in automatic generation control (AGC), where ESS and the generator respectively deal with high-frequency load fluctuation and low-portion. We develop a system configuration framework for such a hybrid system, including the operation strategy and capacity optimization. Due to the complexity of the hybrid system, the operation process is captured by a simulation model which considers practical constraints as well as remaining energy management of ESS. Taking advantage of the gradient-based approximation algorithm, we are then able to optimize the capacity of a hybrid system. According to the numerical experiments with real historical AGC data, the hybrid system is shown to perform well in cost reduction and to achieve the regulation tasks...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{valuable}} candidates as tuberculosis vaccine have been reported, {{some of which}} have already entered clinical trials. The new vaccines, especially subunit vaccines, need multiple administrations in order to maintain adequate life-long immune memory: this demands for high production levels and degree of purity. Results: In this study, TB 10. 4, Ag 85 B and a TB 10. 4 -Ag 85 B chimeric protein (here-after referred as full) - immunodominant antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis - were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The rational design of expression constructs and optimization of fermentation and purification conditions allowed a marked increase in solubility and yield of the recombinant antigens. Indeed, scaling up of the process guaranteed mass production of all these three antigens (2. 5 - 25 mg of pure protein/L cultivation broth). Quality of produced soluble proteins was evaluated both by mass spectrometry to assess the purity of final preparations, and by circular dichroism spectroscopy to ascertain the protein conformation. Immunological tests of the different protein products demonstrated that when TB 10. 4 was fused to Ag 85 B, the chimeric protein was more immunoreactive than either of the immunogenic protein alone. Conclusions: We reached the goal of purifying large quantities of soluble antigens effective in generating immunological response against M. tuberculosis by a robust, <b>controlled,</b> scalable <b>and</b> <b>economically</b> feasible production process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background New {{sequencing}} {{technologies have}} tremendously {{increased the number}} of known molecular markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) in a variety of species. Concurrently, improvements to genotyping technology have now made it possible to efficiently genotype large numbers of genome-wide distributed SNPs enabling genome wide association studies (GWAS). However, genotyping significant numbers of individuals with large number of SNPs remains prohibitively expensive for many research groups. A possible solution to this problem is to determine allele frequencies from pooled DNA samples, such ‘allelotyping’ has been presented as a cost-effective alternative to individual genotyping and has become popular in human GWAS. In this article we have tested the effectiveness of DNA pooling to obtain accurate allele frequency estimates for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) populations using an Illumina SNP-chip. Results In total, 56 Atlantic salmon DNA pools from 14 populations were analyzed on an Atlantic salmon SNP-chip containing probes for 5568 SNP markers, 3928 of which were bi-allelic. We developed an efficient quality control filter which enables exclusion of loci showing high error rate and minor allele frequency (MAF) close to zero. After applying multiple quality control filters we obtained allele frequency estimates for 3631 bi-allelic loci. We observed high concordance (r > 0. 99) between allele frequency estimates derived from individual genotyping and DNA pools. Our results also indicate that even relatively small DNA pools (35 individuals) can provide accurate allele frequency estimates for a given sample. Conclusions Despite of higher level of variation associated with array replicates compared to pool construction, we suggest that both sources of variation should be taken into account. This study demonstrates that DNA pooling allows fast and high-throughput determination of allele frequencies in Atlantic salmon enabling cost-efficient identification of informative markers for discrimination of populations at various geographical scales, as well as identification of loci <b>controlling</b> ecologically <b>and</b> <b>economically</b> important traits. </p...|$|R
