5|$|The site is {{only able}} to <b>communicate</b> with LEO {{satellites}} in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can <b>communicate</b> in all orbits.

This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to <b>communicate</b> with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to <b>communicate</b> using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly <b>communicate</b> over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

As an example, any pair of <b>communicating</b> Boolean branching programs that computes matrix-vector products over GF(2) requires communication-space product Ω(n 2), provided the space used is o(n / log n).

40|$|An {{intelligent}} <b>communicating</b> agent {{has both}} {{the properties of}} intelligent agents and <b>communicating</b> agents, which are autonomy, reactivity, proactiveness and sociability. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to designing and implementing intelligent <b>communicating</b> agents for multi-agent systems (MAS). As background knowledge for our approach, we first briefly introduce the agent-oriented G-net model, {{which is based on}} the G-net formalism. This formal agent model serves as both a specification and a high-level design for the tool kit called ADK (Agent Development Kit) that supports developing intelligent <b>communicating</b> agents for multi-agent systems. Then the architectural design and detailed design of intelligent <b>communicating</b> agents, which closely follow the agent formal model, are described. As a potential solution for automated software development, we summarize the procedure to generate a model-based design of intelligent <b>communicating</b> agents. Finally, to illustrate an application built on ADK, we present an air-ticket trading example.
