40|$|The {{link between}} films and {{destination}} promotion {{has been well}} established. Less well examined {{is the role of}} ‘film language’ in the subsequent reconstruction of tourist destinations. This paper suggests that the way a film ‘speaks’ to its audience helps both shape tourists’ imaginaries of place, and the ways a place is reconstructed to meet tourist perceptions. For film tourism, ‘film language’ acts as a guidebook describing first the spaces where the film plots happened, second, shaping images of the places in an audience’s mind, and third, serving as a blueprint for the physical reconstruction of spaces to replicate the place representation shown in the film. This both meets and reinforces the perceptions held by audiences. Therefore, this paper suggests interpretation of ‘film language’ is a key to the promotion of destination image and transformation of a place. Based on the case study of the <b>Chinese</b> film <b>Hibiscus</b> Town (Xie Jin, 1986), some key parts of its ‘film language’ are interpreted with reference to the visual, and a relationship between film language and place reconstruction is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, known colloquially as <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus,</b> China rose, Hawaiian hibiscus, and shoeblackplant, is {{a species}} of {{tropical}} hibiscus, a flowering plant in the Hibisceae tribe of the family Malvaceae, native to East Asia.|$|E
50|$|The mandrinette looks rather {{similar to}} the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus</b> (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) and the {{introduction}} of that to Mauritius as a garden plant {{is one of the main}} reasons for the dramatic decline of the mandrinette. Only 46 mature individuals exist in the wild but they are not able to reproduce due to competition from and hybridisation with this invasive Hibiscus species.|$|E
5000|$|In {{temperate}} zones, {{probably the}} most commonly grown ornamental species is Hibiscus syriacus, the common garden hibiscus, also known in some areas as the [...] "rose of Althea" [...] or [...] "rose of Sharon" [...] (but {{not to be confused}} with the unrelated Hypericum calycinum, also called [...] "rose of Sharon"). In tropical and subtropical areas, the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus</b> (H. rosa-sinensis), with its many showy hybrids, is the most popular hibiscus.|$|E
50|$|Hawaiian {{hibiscus}} {{are seven}} species of hibiscus regarded as native to Hawaii. The yellow hibiscus is Hawaii's state flower. Although tourists regularly associate the hibiscus flower within experiences visiting the US state of Hawaii, {{and the plant}} family Malvaceae includes a relatively large number of species that are native to the Hawaiian Islands, those flowers regularly observed by tourists are generally not the native hibiscus flowers. Most commonly grown as ornamental plants in the Islands are the <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus</b> (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) and its numerous hybrids.|$|E
50|$|The park {{features}} the lakeside walkways which was completed and opened to public in 2007 {{with a total}} distance of 1.4 km. There is also a nine-turn bridge. It houses various flora as well, such as willows, bald cypresses, cajeput trees, golden showers, royal poincianas, <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus,</b> azaleas and Ixora westii. The park management center houses a 45-seating capacity reading room, tennis courts, swimming pool and other recreational facilities. Visitors can also fish and hike in its six mountain trails to choose from with rest pavilions along the way.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese {{legend has}} it that the money tree (搖錢樹) is a kind of holy tree, which can bring money and fortune to the people, and that it is a symbol of affluence, nobility and auspiciousness. It {{can be traced back to}} {{primitive}} societies when the adoration of a holy tree was prevalent. Whilst Money trees may be derived from the Sun tree myth associated with paradise, the coins link paradise with a material bounty in this world. There also exists a holy tree named <b>Chinese</b> <b>Hibiscus</b> in Chinese mythology. According to the existing historical narratives, the concept of the [...] "money tree" [...] is derived at the latest from the Han Dynasty. Cast-bronze money trees are a conspicuous feature of Han tombs in Sichuan.|$|E
30|$|Interestingly, the spherical {{structure}} of fullerenes {{seems to be}} not only restricted to carbon nanomaterials. Recently, fullerene-like structures have been described in pollen grains of <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus</b> (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), with putative functions for mechanical stability and adaptive properties important for the pollination process [37].|$|E
40|$|Stenting is a {{vegetative}} propagation method, based on cutting and grafting in one action. The question {{addressed in this}} study is whether indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) concentration is able to impress success of <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus</b> propagation when grafted onto two kinds of rootstocks. The used IBA concentrations include: 0, 1000, 3000 and 5000 ppm and two cultivars of Hibiscus syriacus (“Blue Stain ” and “Jeanne d’Arc”), which have been used as rootstock. Results indicated that, all the cultivars were superior for most of the measured parameters when IBA treatments were used compared to control plants except for average of the longest root size. The highest healing percentage resulted in stentlings (plant which has been propagated by stenting method) with 5000 ppm of IBA treatment. All IBA treatments significantly increased rooting percentage compared with the control plants. Stentlings that were treated with 3000 and 5000 ppm of IBA, produced the greatest leave number. In Chinese hibiscus/“Jeanne d’Arc ” combination, higher root number and dry weight of roots were observed. Interactions of kinds of rootstock and IBA concentration showed that the highest healing percentage was obtained in “Blue Stain ” in concentration of 5000 ppm and the highest root number were seen in stentlings with “Jeanne d’Arc ” in 3000 ppm an...|$|E

The native ant, Tapinoma melanocephalum, {{improves}} {{the survival of}} an invasive mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis, by defending it from parasitoids. Scientific Reports, 5, 8. doi: 10. 1038 /srep 15691 Mutualistic ants can protect their partners from natural enemies in nature. Aenasius bambawalei is an important parasitoid of the the invasive mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis. We hypothesized that mutualism between native ants and mealybugs would favor survival of mealybugs. To test this, we examined effects of tending by the native mutualistic ant Tapinoma melanocephalum on growth of P. solenopsis colonies on <b>Chinese</b> <b>hibiscus,</b> Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, in a field setting. Ant workers with access to honeydew of mealybugs lived much longer than those provisioned only with water in the laboratory, and number of ant workers foraging increased significantly with growth of mealybug colonies in the field. In later observations, {{there were significant differences}} in densities of mealybugs between ant-tended and -excluded treatments. Survival rate of mealybugs experiencing parasitoid attack was significantly higher on ant-tended plants than on ant-excluded plants. When the parasitoid was excluded, {{there was no difference in}} survival rate of mealybugs between ant-tended and -excluded plants. In most cases, ants directly attacked the parasitoid, causing the parasitoid to take evasive action. We conclude that native ants such as T. melanocephalum have the potential to facilitate invasion and spread of P. solenopsis in China by providing them with protection from parasitoids...|$|E
