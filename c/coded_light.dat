40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the different 3 D surface digitization technologies commercially available in the European market. The solutions for 3 D surface measurement offered by major European companies can be divided into different groups depending on various characteristics, such as, technology (e. g. laser scanning, white light projection), system construction (e. g. fix, on CMM/robot/arm) or measurement type (e. g. surface scanning, profile scanning). Crossing between the categories is possible, however, the majority of commercial products can be divided into the following groups: (a) laser profilers mounted on CMM, (b) portable <b>coded</b> <b>light</b> projection systems, (c) desktop solutions with laser profiler or <b>coded</b> <b>light</b> projection system and multi-axes platform, (d) laser point measurement systems where both sensor and object move, (e) hand operated laser profilers, hand held laser profiler or point measurement systems, (f) dedicated systems.
