40|$|Mandevilla is an {{ornamental}} crop with {{a bright}} future worldwide because of its high commercial acceptance and added value. However, as with most ornamental species, there are few molecular tools to support cultivar breeding and innovation. In this work, we report the development and analysis of 20 new Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers in Mandevilla. Microsatellites were isolated from two enriched small-insert genomic libraries of Mandevilla × amabilis. The diversity parameters estimated after their amplification {{in a group of}} 11 commercial genotypes illustrate the effect of two opposite drifts: the high relatedness of cultivars belonging to the same commercial group and the high divergence of other cultivars, especially M. × amabilis. Based on their different band patterns, six genotypes were uniquely distinguished, and two groups of sport mutations remained undistinguishable. The amplification of the SSRs in three wild species suggested the existence of unexploited diversity available to be introgressed into the <b>commercial</b> <b>pool.</b> This is the first report of available microsatellites in Mandevilla. The development process has provided some clues concerning the genome structure of the species, and the SSRs obtained will help to create new products and to protect existing and upcoming plant innovations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The human {{gastroduodenal}} pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, {{is characterized}} by an unusual extent of genetic heterogeneity. This dictates differences in the antigenic pattern of strains resulting in heterogeneous human humoral immune responses. Here, we examined the antigenic variability {{among a group of}} 10 strains isolated from Portuguese patients differing in age, gender, and H. pylori-associated gastric diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS:  Immunoassays were performed on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels obtained for the proteome of each strain, using a <b>commercial</b> <b>pool</b> of antibodies produced in rabbit, against the whole cell lysate of an Australian H. pylori strain. Relevant proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Immunoproteomes of the Portuguese strains showed no correlation between the number of antigenic proteins or the antigenic profile, and the disease to which each strain was associated. The Heat shock protein B was the unique immunoreactive protein common to all of them. Additionally, seven proteins were found to be antigenic in at least 80 % of strains: enoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (NADH); Catalase; Flagellin A; 2 isoforms of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; succinyl-CoA transferase subunit B; and an unidentified protein. These proteins were present in the proteome of all tested strains, suggesting that differences in their antigenicity are related to antigenic variance. CONCLUSIONS:  This study showed evidence of the variability of antigenic pattern among H. pylori strains. We believe that this fact contributes to the failure of anti-H. pylori vaccines and the low accuracy of serological tests based on a low number of proteins or antigens of only one strain...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{swimming}} pools, particularly aquatic centres {{are increasingly}} common features of large {{towns and cities}} in Australia as people are encouraged to increase their levels of physical activity. Swimming {{is regarded as a}} low impact form of exercise and use of indoor facilities allows this to continue all-year round. Aquatic centres are large users of energy for water and space heating with an energy intensity which can be up to seven times that of a commercial office building in Australia. Much of the energy is used to heat water to relatively low temperatures and therefore solar energy technology is capable of providing this energy. In the residential sector, solar thermal systems for heating water and swimming pools is wellestablished. This is not the case for commercial swimming pools i. e. aquatic centres. In Victoria, a program to encourage <b>commercial</b> <b>pool</b> operators to install solar systems was funded in the early 1980 s. This paper describes an investigation into the current use of and attitudes to solar systems in commercial pools through a survey of municipal pool operators in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. The survey found that there has been very little increase in the use of solar energy and that barriers {{to the use of the}} technology remain the same as they were nearly 30 years ago. Lack of roof area, poor payback periods and an inability of solar to meet pool heating needs are the most common misconceptions. To improve the uptake of solar heating in commercial pools, further research, particularly looking at the feasibility of integrating traditional heat sources with solar collectors using smart control, is required. An incentive programme and the education of the new generation of consultants and aquatic centre operators, unfamiliar with the potential benefits of solar systems, would also help to increase their uptake...|$|E

40|$|Autoantibodies are {{increasingly}} used as biomarkers in {{the detection of}} autoimmune disorders and cancer. Disease specific antibodies are generally detected by their binding to specific antigens. As an alternative approach, we propose to identify specific complementarity determining regions (CDR) of IgG that relate to an autoimmune disorder or cancer instead of the specific antigen(s). In this manuscript, we tested the technical feasibility to detect and identify CDRs of specific antibodies by mass spectrometry. We used a <b>commercial</b> <b>pooled</b> IgG preparation as well as purified serum IgG fractions that were spiked with different amounts of a fully human monoclonal antibody (adalimumab). These samples were enzymatically digested and analyzed by nanoLC Orbitrap mass spectrometry. In these samples, {{we were able to}} identify peptides derived from the CDRs of adalimumab. These peptides could be detected at an amount of 110 attomole, 5 orders of magnitude lower than the total IgG concentration in these samples. Using higher energy collision induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation and subsequent de novo sequencing, we could successfully identify 50 % of the detectable CDR peptides of adalimumab. In addition, we demonstrated that an affinity purification with anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) monoclonal antibody enhanced anti-DNP derived CDR detection in a serum IgG background. In conclusion, specific CDR peptides could be detected and sequenced at relatively low levels (attomole-femtomole range) which should allow the detection of clinically relevant CDR peptides in patient samples...|$|R
