500|$|Blake Snow of GamePro {{listed the}} Nomad as fifth {{on his list}} of the [...] "10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time," [...] criticizing its poor timing into the market, {{inadequate}} advertising, and poor battery life. [...] Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame placed more than simply timing into reasons for the Nomad's lack of sales, stating, [...] "The reason for the Nomad's failure may have very well been a combination of poor timing, company mistrust and the relatively high cost of the machine (without a pack-in). Genesis owners were too skittish to invest in another 16-bit system." [...] The staff of Retro Gamer, however, praised the Nomad, saying in a retrospective that Nomad was [...] "the first true 16-bit handheld" [...] and declared it the best variant of the Genesis. [...] In the same article, Retro Gamer notes the <b>collectability</b> of the Nomad, due to its low production, and states, [...] "Had Sega cottoned on {{to the concept of}} the Nomad before the Mega Drive 2, and rolled it out as a true successor to the Mega Drive ... then perhaps Sega may have succeeded in its original goal to prolong the life of the Mega Drive in the U.S." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{recent years}} the <b>collectability</b> of the 878 {{has been on the}} rise. Due to low {{production}} numbers as well as the continued success of the 870 design on which is based, the 878 remains a solid field performer.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of shows: live shows and photo shows. In a live show, the model is judged from all sides. In a photo show, images of a model are sent/emailed in, and {{therefore}} can only be judged be judged from one side. In a live show, there are three types of classes: <b>collectability,</b> halter, and performance. In a <b>collectability</b> class, an entrant's goal is to have the rarest model. In a halter class, the model must have a name and a breed, and this class is judged after how the model matches the breed it is given. The goal in performance class is to create a realistic and accurate depiction of an equine sport.|$|E
50|$|Early {{productions}} by 12k {{were limited}} to between 500 and 1,000 units, partially because of limited storage space, and also because the small edition size increased the <b>collectability</b> of the albums. Since around 2001, editions became less limited but still started at between 1,000 and 2,000 copies.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, at {{the annual}} Annalee Doll Society Auction, a 10 inch tall Halloween girl doll created in the 1950s was {{auctioned}} off for a record $6,000. Due to the high price and <b>collectability</b> of Annalee dolls, there have been instances of people creating counterfeit dolls.|$|E

Many of his prints were sold to retailers [...] "on allocation" [...] - only providing a percentage of their requirements. This no doubt added to his <b>collectability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reflections: Greatest Hits is {{the first}} {{greatest}} hits compilation released by country music artist Lorrie Morgan. It was released on Morgan's birthday in 1995 as a special, limited production; deluxe edition. It featured three previously unreleased tracks, an enclosed biography of Lorrie Morgan, ornate packaging and the allure of <b>collectability.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of the band's main {{marketing}} campaigns was done through old school concert posters, and {{were a very}} big part of their notoriety. These posters, illustrated by JayJay Jackson (Marvel Comics, Valiant Comics, Broadway Comics), still {{can be seen on}} online auction sites like eBay, due to their limited number and <b>collectability.</b>|$|E
50|$|The extreme {{rarity of}} this album has pushed up its <b>collectability</b> rating to where, in 2007, a shabby {{scratched}} copy was sold on eBay for £1,200 {{and since then}} (in 2009 & 2010) two other copies have sold in excess of £2000. It is regarded by collectors {{as one of the}} most valuable pop/psych albums of all time.|$|E

The first 100,000 pressings of the single also came with a free flexidisc, containing a fifth exclusive track, [...] "Stand Proud". This <b>collectability</b> helped the single reach Number 14 in the UK Singles Charts.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the game's <b>collectability</b> and legendary status, it {{has long}} been {{considered}} a candidate for possible reissue. Recently, Decision Games expressed a desire to do so, promising [...] "the unplayable monster made playable", which suggests that the game would be considerably revamped instead of simply reprinted. The December 2007 flyer allows a prospective purchaser to commit to buying the game if and when it is published.|$|E
5000|$|... 1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{releases}} from Rhino Records' limited-edition imprint Rhino Handmade. It was released in a one-time pressing of 3000 copies, sold out within a year of its release, and helped fully establish Rhino Handmade's reputation for collector's-interest releases. The set was re-released in November 2010 by Rhino Handmade and is not individually numbered to maintain the <b>collectability</b> of the original release.|$|E
50|$|The Continuum was {{an online}} {{strategy}} game that combines turn-based war gaming with role-playing game-like character {{development and the}} <b>collectability</b> of a tabletop miniatures game. It {{takes place in the}} Crossworld, a new reality formed from the collapse of several formerly separate worlds that became unhinged in the space/time continuum. The game was developed by Seven Lights and launched on June 25, 2008. It has been discontinued as of 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Blood Wars was {{notable for}} the {{aggressive}} stance TSR, Inc. took against fan websites displaying artwork from the game. The result was to suppress {{popularity of the}} game {{while it was still}} being published. This was in contrast to Wizards of the Coast, which allowed fair use reproduction of Magic: The Gathering copyrighted images online. The <b>collectability</b> of its chase cards was also notable across CCGs, especially [...] "The Lady of Pain." ...|$|E
50|$|Some Genuine Royal Navy Rum still pops up in premium auction houses, {{and apart}} from the <b>collectability</b> aspect, the {{contents}} are vintage, {{and because of the}} wax seal is still as powerful as the day it was bottled. It is rarely seen, though bought at auction (the last time for £1250) for special ceremonial events. This is {{not to be confused with}} the commercially bottled Pusser's Rum seen on supermarket shelves dated after 1970.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the passage}} of the Video Recordings (Labelling) Act of 1985 in the United Kingdom, videotapes and other video {{recordings}} without a certification symbol from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) on their covers - or on the tapes themselves - were no longer allowed to be sold or displayed by rental shops. These tapes are called [...] "Pre-Certs" [...] (e.g., Pre-certification tapes). Recently these tapes have generated a cult following, due to their <b>collectability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Western Models Limited {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{companies}} anywhere to produce high-quality hand built models for collectors, usually in lead based white metal (Johnson 1998, p. 246). 'Small Wheels' was a line name also used by Western Models, after purchasing a rival company of that name. Models were introduced annually but production runs were often limited, so <b>collectability</b> was insured. By about the year 2000, more than 70 different models had been made, with a new line of aircraft as well (Johnson 1998, p. 246-247).|$|E
50|$|When {{the advent}} of CD meant that many {{collectors}} needed their favourite music issued on the new format, Record Collector was already at the vanguard of covering reissued albums. More recently, {{there has been an}} upsurge in limited edition vinyl and CD releases, while - much as the picture disc, popular in the 80s, has become a huge source of <b>collectability</b> - many modern vinyl releases are making limited and coloured formats fashionable once again, aiming themselves directly at the collecting market that Record Collector helped to establish and serve.|$|E
5000|$|The 1990s saw {{a massive}} {{increase}} in the <b>collectability</b> of Zemaitis' guitars {{and the appearance of}} forgeries. These forgeries in [...] "new" [...] and [...] "second hand" [...] guise at first glance may look genuine but they will not sound like a true Zemaitis due to the use of second-rate materials. During his 39 years of production, Zemaitis had a policy of never making any two guitars the same, {{while at the same time}} limiting himself to the production of only ten guitars a year to ensure the quality of each individual model.|$|E
5000|$|Lightning Comics {{in the mid}} 90s was an {{independent}} comic publisher founded by Joseph and Steve Zyskowski. They wanted to make comic books unlike the ones they had read before. They believed the newest comics [...] "seemed to lack 'substance'." [...] Their first artists were Julius Jackson, Paul Abrams, Terral Lawrence, Karl Kerscl, and Eric Pence. The first comic published by Lightning Comics, Bloodfire #1, sold 50,000 comics. The company's idea was to make each issue a limited printing to enhance <b>collectability.</b> Also, after that first book, Greg Weed was hired to move the company from marker to airbrush.|$|E
5000|$|An aizōban (...) is a collector's edition volume [...] These volumes are {{generally}} more expensive and lavished with special features such as special covers created specifically for the edition, special paper used for the cover, higher quality paper, a special slipcase, and so on. Aizōban {{are generally}} printed in a limited run, thereby increasing the value and <b>collectability</b> of those few copies made. The aizōban format has begun to make inroads into the US market, with titles such as Fruits Basket, Rurouni Kenshin and Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin being reissued in aizōban format. Generally only the most popular manga are released in this format.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{traditional}} art world, market value and a work's <b>collectability</b> are deeply intertwined. This has posed {{a challenge to}} socially engaged artists seeking museum and gallery support, since many works go against the capitalist market to challenge traditional collecting practices. As a result, many socially engaged artists and producers must look elsewhere for support. The expansion {{of the art world}} in the 21st century has seen the emergence of alternative supports, such as non-profit organizations and the ever-growing biennale network. [...] Other partners include art fairs, or commissions and residencies associated with universities, foundations, and urban regeneration. [...] Artists and producers have also formed their own means of support, as artist-run exhibition spaces, journals and blogs demonstrate.|$|E
50|$|Security {{requirements}} vary, but traditionally {{focus on}} the value of the debtors ledger, supported by a pledge of specific assets as collateral and a charge or mortgage over the business, along with the personal guarantees of directors. Apart from some specialised lenders, real estate security is not taken. By focusing on the value and <b>collectability</b> of the accounts receivable ledger, most debtor finance credit lines will automatically increase in response to increases in sales, and provide ongoing working capital to fund the growth of the business. Typically the advance rate ranges from 70% of accounts receivable ledger value up to 90%. The remaining 30% to 10%, known as the 'retention' is released following receipt of payment of each invoice by the customer/debtor/buyer.|$|E
50|$|As a result, since 2007 the Roma {{community}} in Stolipinovo has started receiving 24-hour electricity supply. About 3 million EUR has been {{invested in the}} entire replacement of 185 kilometers of electricity grid, renovation or construction {{of a total of}} 17 transformer stations, opening of 4 cash desks on the territory of the neighbourhood, joining 6 400 subscribers to the grid. Success has been achieved, which few believed in before: the <b>collectability</b> in the neighbourhood has been raised from 3% in 2006 to 85% after the fulfillment of the project, and the technological losses decreased from 40% to 5%. The success in Stolipinovo reassured the management of EVN Bulgaria to apply the programme in other Roma-inhabited neighbourhoods on the territory of South Eastern Bulgaria and to ensure electricity supply according to all present-day standards.|$|E
50|$|With an ‘open door’ {{editorial}} policy, nostalgic {{outlook and}} focus on discographies and <b>collectability,</b> Record Collector has created a unique identity. Throughout the early-1980s, rival publications like Greatest Hits and the Record Hunter supplement of Vox were launched, {{but none of them}} lasted very long. It was not until the monthly Q magazine launched in 1986 - its focus on older music fans who were buying the new CD technology of the time - that a major competitor entered the music monthlies sector. Subsequently, in the 1990s, Classic Rock, Uncut and Mojo (who, in 2001, launched Mojo Collections as a direct competitor, though that folded after six issues and was incorporated into the main magazine) and myriad other monthly titles started, taking as their focus the nostalgic, or retrospective, outlook pioneered by Record Collector in 1980.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "White Label S302" [...] {{starts at}} $43,429 and {{includes}} a naturally aspirated 450hp 302ci 5.0L V8 engine. A manual transmission is standard but an automatic is optional. This model contains the Saleen S302 styling package for advanced aerodynamics. The White Label is available in 23 different colors, with 2 different wheel size options: standard 20" [...] 5 spoke, or an optional 19" [...] 7 spoke. Both wheels are available in standard Silver/Chrome, Carbonite, or Brushed Aluminum finish. To make this model Saleen specific, there is a Saleen logo deck lid insert and model specific badging. Other upgrades include a spoiler known as the [...] "Saleen high downforce wing" [...] and a Saleen exhaust system. The White Label can be configured in either a coupe or convertible version. Each vehicle is given its own VIN and is catalogued throughout the manufacturing process, giving it authentic <b>collectability</b> and higher resale values.|$|E
50|$|As the '80s were ending, {{more and}} more {{collectors}} started to surface, buying up the toys to keep in their original packaging for display purposes and for future <b>collectability.</b> This led to flooding of the action figure toy market. One {{of the most popular}} action figure lines of the late '80s and early '90s, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures were produced in such high quantities that the value for most figures would never be higher than a few dollars. In the mid-1990s, a new Star Wars figure line had surfaced and Spawn figures flooded the toy store shelves, proving action figures were not just for kids anymore. Beginning in 1997, ToyFare magazine would become a popular read for mature collectors in providing news and embracing nostalgia with a comedic twist. And with the gaining popularity of the Internet, websites such as Toy News International would soon offer information on upcoming collectible figures and merchandise.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first two}} {{criteria}} mentioned above {{are referred to}} as Performance. Performance occurs when the seller has done most or all of what it is supposed to do to be entitled for the payment. E.g.: A company has sold the good and the customer walks out of the store with no warranty on the product. The seller has completed its performance since the buyer now owns good and also all the risks and rewards associated with it.The third criterion is referred to as <b>Collectability.</b> The seller must have a reasonable expectation of being paid. An allowance account must be created if the seller is not fully assured to receive the payment. The fourth and fifth criteria {{are referred to as}} Measurability. Due to Matching Principle, the seller must be able to match expenses to the revenues they helped in earning. Therefore, the amount of Revenues and Expenses should both be reasonably measurable ...|$|E
50|$|Compared to {{the major}} brands Fender and Marshall, the <b>collectability</b> and {{playability}} of the guitar amps is a mixed affair. While vintage Fender amps consistently command high prices, Ampeg guitar amps such as the Reverberocket can often be found for prices atypical of vintage amplifiers. In general, Ampeg guitar amps until 1964 are less desirable as they have a darker, cleaner sound even when pushed hard. With {{the introduction of the}} Galaxy line (Gemini, Mercury, Reverberocket) in 1964, treble boost circuits and spring reverbs were added, and higher wattage models (such as the 30 watt Gemini II) were made available. Original SVT bass amps are highly sought-after for their pleasing sound and were used by many professional bassists in the '70s. V series guitar amps (V2 and V4 heads along with the VT-40 and VT-22 combos) are sought after for the classic 70s crunchy but clean sound. The V4-B is another sought after bass amp head; it has the SVT pre-amp section mated to a 100 Watt power amp section.|$|E
