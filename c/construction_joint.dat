25|$|Groundbreaking on {{the bridge}} {{occurred}} in 2001 in Mount Pleasant. The bridge was built as a design-build project, meaning that one contract was signed to both design and construct the bridge. This meant that construction could begin even while the design was not yet finalized. The bridge was built by a joint venture of two major construction firms operating under the name Palmetto Bridge Constructors. The joint venture partners were Tidewater Skanska of Norfolk, Virginia and Flatiron Constructors of Longmont, Colorado. The <b>construction</b> <b>joint</b> venture hired Parsons Brinckerhoff to complete the design. For the sake of simplifying labor and equipment resources, Palmetto Bridge Constructors actually managed {{the building of the}} bridge as five separate projects (the two highway interchanges {{at either end of the}} bridge, the two approach spans, and the cable-stayed span) going on simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringSunanda DissanayakeMotorists {{generally}} {{follow the}} guidance {{provided by the}} pavement markings while traveling on roads. Under certain circumstances, <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> may be necessary in concrete pavements, which are generally designed to be coincident with the pavement markings. At some locations, however, the <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> may not exactly match the pavement markings. These situations may create confusion {{in the minds of}} drivers, which may lead them to follow joints instead of the markings. In the absence of detailed studies on this topic, an effort was made in the present study to evaluate the effects of unmatched longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> and pavement markings on the lateral position of vehicles. Sites having the characteristics of unmatched longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> and pavement markings were identified, and detailed data were collected at one of the sites. Video camera technique was used for capturing the movements of vehicles along the test site for longer durations. The video tapes were later reduced in the laboratory to extract necessary information. The distance to {{the right side of the}} vehicles from right curb of the road, the type of vehicle, presence of vehicles in the adjacent lane, weather and light conditions, and the movement of the vehicles immediately after traversing the section of the road having unmatched longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> and pavement markings were the main parameters observed while reducing the data. Two surveys were also conducted for gathering the opinions of some practitioners and engineers on the issue. Statistical analyses were carried out using t-tests to evaluate if there were differences. Several comparisons were made for different types of vehicles based on various conditions. The analysis results indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the actual and expected distances to the center-line of vehicles, implying that the lateral position of vehicles may have been affected by the joints. A model was also developed to determine the lateral position of the vehicles by considering the parameters used in the analysis. Based on the survey results and analysis of field data, it was found that the lateral position of vehicles may have been affected by the unmatched joints and pavement markings...|$|R

40|$|Several tests, {{devoted to}} the study of {{cracking}} due to autogenous and drying shrinkage, exist in the literature. They are generally not relevant for the study of massive structures for which thermal strains plays a key role. Therefore, an active ring test has been developed to study cracking due to restrained thermal shrinkage. This test is an evolution of the restrained shrinkage ring test which allows us to take into account both autogenous and thermal shrinkage. With this test, the early age cracking due to thermal restrained shrinkage (effect of the temperature rate), the influence of reinforcement and <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> have been studied (Briffaut et al. (2011) [1]). Nevertheless, in this test, several phenomena occur simultaneously (hydration, shrinkage, creep...) and their effect cannot be easily decoupled. So, complementary tests have been performed to study each phenomenon separately and the ring test has been numerically simulated in order to identify coupling between creep and damage and to quantify the strength decrease due to <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> A good agreement between experimental and numerical results has been obtained for ring with reinforcement and <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> With the proposed model and the identified materials parameters validated on the active restrained ring test, numerical simulations of the construction of a real massive structure have been performed, and a parametric study has been achieved to highlight the creep effect...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeismic {{responses}} of the Zipingpu concrete face rockfill dam were analyzed using the finite element method. The dynamic behavior of rockfill materials was modeled with a viscoelastic model and an empirical permanent strain model. The relevant parameters were obtained either by back analysis using the field observations or by reference to parameters of similar rockfill materials. The acceleration {{responses of}} the dam, the distribution of earthquake-induced settlement, and the gap propagation under the concrete slabs caused by the settlement of the dam were analyzed and compared with site investigations or relevant studies. The mechanism of failure of horizontal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> was also analyzed based on numerical results and site observations. Numerical {{results show that the}} input accelerations were considerably amplified {{near the top of the}} dam, and the strong shaking resulted in considerable settlement of the rockfill materials, with a maximum value exceeding 90  cm at the crest. As a result of the settlement of rockfill materials, the third-stage concrete slabs were separated from the cushion layer. The rotation of the cantilever slabs about the contacting regions, under the combined action of gravity and seismic inertial forces, led to the failure of the <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> and tensile cracks appeared above the <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> The effectiveness and limitations of the so-called equivalent linear method are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{failure of}} {{longitudinal}} <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> {{is one of}} the critical factors causing accelerated pavement deterioration. Poor-quality longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> are often characterized by a difference in elevation between adjacent lanes or by unraveling of the hot mix asphalt (HMA). Current wave-based non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are efficient and economical for the evaluation of material properties. In this thesis, an innovative surface wave testing technique for condition assessment of longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> in asphalt pavements is presented. This method enables reduction of the number of cores required for large-strain testing and provision of a more uniform quality assessment of longitudinal joints as well as the relative condition of the asphalt pavements. The technical development is based on a theoretical study of the wave attenuation mechanisms and on the reported deficiencies in current seismic wave-based methods. Traditionally, the use of ultrasonic testing to determine small-strain elastic property for asphalt concrete was uniquely based on the measurement of wave velocity. However, isolated use of wave velocity does not provide complete information of the materials strength because of the different variables that affect the strength-velocity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to complement velocity data with independent information such as the change in attenuation and frequency content of the propagating pulse. The existing deficiencies in current seismic wave-based methods were addressed to improve reliability, accuracy and consistency for asphalt concrete material characterization in the laboratory and in the field. Refined and improved signal processing techniques were used to overcome the shortcomings in the existing wave-based methods that contribute to uncertainties in the interpretation of test results. To capture more information from a wave, the signal was analyzed in the time and frequency domains. The basic analyses included a simple method such as peak to peak amplitude of the first cycle of arriving wave, and complex methods such as maximum magnitude and area of corresponding frequency spectrum through Fourier transform. A novel approach based on wavelet transform of the signal was presented, which provides an alternative method to determine wave characteristics. Material characterization tests (experiment Phase I) were carried out to study the relationship between the wave characteristics obtained from UPV test {{and the quality of the}} asphalt concrete specimens prepared in the laboratory. The specimens were identical in terms of aggregate and asphalt binder ratio, but varying in volumetric properties produced by different compaction efforts. The specimen quality was determined using two methods: 1) the traditional method using density measurement and 2) an innovative approach using dynamic modulus which is recommended by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for use as a fundamental material property for characterizing Superpave mixes (Witczak, et al., 2002; Bonaquist et al., 2003; Christensen et al., 2004). The measured wave characteristics showed excellent correlations (R 2 > 0. 9) with the fundamental properties of the mix. The results revealed that the wave amplitude parameters as the condition index have the potential to provide a reliable assessment of the quality of HMA mixtures. The finding is very critical to moving the technology forward in the right direction, and form an important basis for the experiment Phase II. Experiment Phase II investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of using the wave characteristics identified in experiment Phase I to assess the condition of longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> Particular attention was given to examining the sensitivity of the wave-based technique to different types of <b>construction</b> <b>joints.</b> For this purpose, three types of <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> (good, fair and poor) were fabricated in the laboratory and identified using the wave-based technique. The research was intended to develop a suitable test procedure for condition assessment the longitudinal joints in asphalt pavement in the field. The data from experiment Phase II revealed that the wave-based technique enables assessment of not only the quality of different types of longitudinal <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> but also the relative condition of asphalt pavements...|$|R

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) structures {{must maintain}} sufficient proof strength and durability and achieve required performance throughout their service life. When constructing an RC structure in limited construction space, {{it is often}} constructed in sections (constructed in separate periods of time). Such a structure has <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> (Fig. 1), and cracks may occur at or near those joints and cause water penetration. In this way, air and water easily penetrate <b>construction</b> <b>joints</b> with cracks and create an environment where rebar easily becomes corroded, likely causing adverse effects on proof strength and durability of the RC structure. That greatly affects maintenance of the RC structure too. Thus, {{on the assumption that}} prevention of corrosion of rebars at such joints could alleviate the issue of long-term durability that greatly affects maintenance of RC structures, we carried out accelerated corrosion tests of rebars using rebars samples that had rebars and different types of existing antirust agent.
