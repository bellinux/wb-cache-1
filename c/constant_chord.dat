25|$|Though {{they were}} not a {{commercial}} success, the Bloch MB.90 and its variants were notable as the first French all-metal, meaning metal-framed, light aircraft. The MB.90 was a single engine, braced high wing design; the wing was in two parts, each with two I-section spars, <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and rounded tips. Their structure was duralumin and their covering fabric.|$|E
25|$|The wings, mounted without stagger, were {{straight}} {{edged with}} a <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and blunt wingtips.

A basic ogive-cylinder {{body with a}} length-to-diameter ratio of 10 was used to which was attached a series of wing planforms. The planforms included a family of delta wings and a family of rectangular wings having a <b>constant</b> root <b>chord</b> but varying spans so that wings of constant exposed area could be compared. In addition, a cranked-tip planform was included and a rectangular planform with reduced chord.

25|$|Designed by Theo Slot, who was {{responsible}} for all of Pander & Sons original designs, the Multipro is variously described as a side-by-side two-seat or three-seat light aircraft. It had high and almost <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> wings, braced on each side by a V-form pair of struts fixed to the lower fuselage longerons. The fuselage was a rounded, plywood-skinned structure, contemporaries remarking, as they had with other Panders, {{on the quality of the}} finish.|$|E
25|$|The design {{inherited}} some features {{from the}} earlier Mercury: it too had thin wings of <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> with square tips of about the same span as the later Mercuries and used wing warping rather than ailerons. The wing was wire braced from above via a kingpost and below via the undercarriage, and was built up around machined I-section ash spars. The Type D also had the triangular cross-section fuselage seen on several of Blackburn's aircraft from the Second Monoplane onward.|$|E
25|$|The <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> wings were gimbal {{mounted to}} the lower fuselage, with pairs of {{streamlined}} compression struts from about 30% span to the upper fuselage just ahead of each cockpit. The wing spars were duralumin structures, though {{the first of the}} two Mussels had spruce ribs. The wing section was the untried, thick RAF 33. The wings and empennage were fabric covered; the fin and unbalanced rudder had a shape not unlike the de Haviiland vertical tail and the horizontal tail was externally braced from below.|$|E
5000|$|The CPA 1 had a two part, braced wing of <b>constant</b> {{thickness}} and <b>chord</b> {{which was}} straight-edged and swept at about 7°, built around two wooden spars and fabric covered.

25|$|The {{wing of the}} E-30 was {{straight}} edged and of <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> with rounded wing tips and a large, rounded cut-out in the trailing edge above the fuselage to improve visibility from the rear cockpit. It was fabric covered over a wooden structure, with Spanish pine box spars and ribs. Its centre section contained an integral fuel tank and was mounted on the fuselage with three duraluminum cabane struts on each side to the fuselage top and sides.

The lateral division was at about 65% chord, with the rear part joined {{to the front}} with conspicuous V-shaped faired underwing hinges. In normal flight the two parts were close together and the rear sections acted both as lifting surface and, differentially, ailerons but they could also be lowered together as slotted flaps, moving rearwards as well as down to produce a slot between fore and aft parts.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-metal}} {{aircraft in}} the contemporary sense, with a structure of duralumin but largely fabric covering.

It was braced to the lower fuselage on each side {{with a pair of}} parallel, faired struts to about half span. The wing section to half span was moderately thick but thinned outboard, giving an overall maximum lift to drag ratio of almost 20.|$|E
40|$|What role does item {{similarity}} play {{in motor}} skill acquisition? To examine this question, {{we used a}} modified version of the chord learning task (Seibel, 1963) that entails producing simultaneous finger key presses, similar to playing a chord on a piano. In Experiment 1, difficulty, as indexed by response time (RT) to a particular chord on the first session, was held <b>constant,</b> and <b>chords</b> that were similar to other chords had longer RTs after practice than dissimilar chords. In Experiment 2, we used chords that produced different initial RTs to show that similarity affected asymptotic RT rather than the size of RT decrement achieved with practice. In Experiment 3, we eliminated differences in perceptual similarity by using Chinese characters for stimuli while retaining differences in motoric similarity, which resulted in nearly identical asymptotes for similar and dissimilar chords. Thus, the density effect observed in Experiments 1 and 2 appears to stem from competition triggered by similar stimuli. Because performance differences were immediately re-established when stimulus similarity was introduced in Experiment 3 during transfer sessions, competition appears to emerge among learned, central representations that can be coactivated by multiple stimuli...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{on-going}} {{research into}} ground effect aerodynamics at the University of Southampton, {{attempts have been}} made to shed light on variables that may influence the characteristic shape of a typical multi element airfoil downforce curve while varying ride height. To achieve the stated goal, a commercial CFD software package was used to perform a comparative aerodynamic analysis study. The height of a double element airfoil above the ground was varied, while the values of lift and drag obtained were recorded to provide baseline information. The angle of attack of the flap and the main element were then changed in order to discern any effects on the lift curve. Also investigated was the effect that the relative sizes of the main element and flap had on the lift and drag curves, since modern racing car wings vary in this manner across their span. Analysis of the resulting data showed that in the case of the double element airfoil, increasing the angle of attack of the main element reduced the downforce sensitivity. Additionally, as this angle was increased, the maximum downforce generated by the airfoil was reduced. Increasing the size of the flap element relative the main element, at <b>constant</b> airfoil <b>chord,</b> had the effect of reducing the ride heigh...|$|R
50|$|The Moineau was {{an equal}} span single bay biplane with bays defined by N-form interplane struts and wings with only slight stagger. The wings were built around two spruce tubes and had sed ribs and plywood leading edges. The lower wing was {{in two parts}} and {{attached}} to the lower fuselage; the three part upper wing had a short span, reduced chord centre section which was supported over the central fuselage on a tube steel cabane assisted by outward leaning N-form struts from mid-fuselage to the wing and slender forward interplane struts close to the fuselage. Both wings were strongly swept at 20° but only the upper wing had slight (about 1°) dihedral. Apart from the upper centre section the wings had <b>constant</b> and equal <b>chord</b> out to rounded tips. Only the lower wing carried ailerons.|$|R
25|$|Through {{the use of}} low wing- and span-loading to {{generate}} greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external fishplate joints are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 was {{a single}} engine biplane, seating two in tandem. It had unswept single bay wings of the same span and <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> with some stagger.

The upper wing was supported over the fuselage {{by a pair of}} N-shaped struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The upper centre section had a large cut-out in its trailing edge for better upward visibility, and also contained the fuel tank. Ailerons were fitted only on the lower wing. The HS-34 had its tailplane mounted on top of the fusealge, carrying split elevators. The rudder was horn balanced.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I {{it was difficult for}} the neutral Dutch armed forces to obtain aircraft from abroad and so the Ammunition Agency approached the Nederlands Automobile and Aeroplane Co. for an indigenous fighter. This request resulted in the Spijker V.1, a conventionally laid out tractor biplane powered by a 60kW (80hp) Swedish licence built Thulin Gnôme rotary engine. It was a single bay design with pairs of parallel interplane struts assisted by four parallel cabane struts between the central upper wing and the fuselage. There was neither stagger nor sweep to the fabric covered wings, which had <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> and squared tips. A semi-circular cut-out in the upper wing trailing edge over the cockpit enhanced the pilot's upward view.|$|E

The Maybach Mb.IVa water-cooled six cylinder inline engine was directly behind the pilot driving two propellers placed on outriggers in the inner bays. The fuselage was tapered toward the tail, where a broad chord, triangular fin carried a rectangular rudder that extended below the fuselage. The undercarriage was conventional, with wheels on a single axle mounted {{on a pair of}} V-struts to the fuselage.

They were high-wing monoplanes, the wings having <b>constant</b> <b>chord,</b> square tips and a thick Raf 24 section. The wings, {{like the rest of the}} aircraft were covered with the corrugated skin and carried balanced ailerons and outboard slots. There was a biplane tail unit with a pair of narrow chord planes, the lower attached to the fuselage underside and the upper mounted clear above. The outboard vertical tail surfaces were again very narrow and served as the main rudders; the single-engined and tri-motor variants also had a small triangular central fin, carrying an auxiliary rudder and supporting the upper horizontal plane. With one exception, the twin-engined Viastras had the central fin and rudder replaced by tubular bracing.|$|E

The wing planform remained the same (<b>constant</b> 64" [...] <b>chord</b> from centerline to 100 in out, then straight taper to 44" [...] chord at 208 inches from centerline), but the semi-Fowler flaps (slotted, rear-moving) were extended outboard, from Wing Station 100 to Wing Station 122, which allowed a lower landing speed (FAA certification regulations state that a single-engined aircraft must have a flaps-down, power-off stall speed no greater than 70 miles/hour). To compensate for the reduced aileron span, the aileron profile was changed and its chord enlarged.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringValidation is the {{essential}} process of evaluating the precision and reliability of analytical or computational solutions. In this dissertation, a series of comprehensive propeller wind tunnel tests were designed for validation of propeller design and analysis techniques. This work focused primarily on small propellers operating at lower Reynolds numbers {{in the range of}} 90, 000 to 120, 000, which is particularly helpful for unmanned aerial vehicle applications. Extensive propeller and experimental apparatus geometries along with test section spatial dimensionality are described. An open-source computer-aided design (CAD) method was used to create the propeller blades, nacelle, and spinner surface outlines, aiming for easy reproduction. Two different propeller designs were tested: a simple propeller with a <b>constant</b> pitch-to-diameter ratio, <b>chord</b> length, and thickness; and a complex propeller with a pitch-to-diameter ratio and chord length as a function of blade radius. Both propellers with a variable pitch of five degrees increment were tested at several angle settings. Critical test section flow field and geometry information that can be used as boundary conditions are also presented in this study. In addition to classical propeller performance plots of thrust and torque coefficients and efficiency against the advance ratio, nacelle surface pressure distribution in terms of coefficients and propeller wake survey results are provided. Two different wind tunnels were utilized to evaluate the experimental and facility bias. Known errors, uncertainties, and instrumental accuracies are quantified and presented here...|$|R

The Zephyr's pilot sat under the front wing with a long but downward sloping nose ahead of him. Four booms ran rearwards from the wings, two on each side converging in the vertical plane from the inner interplane struts to the tail, with rectangular bracing to stiffen them.

25|$|The D.8 was a {{tailless}} four bay unstaggered biplane {{with its}} wings swept at 32°. Its <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> wings were built up around two spruce spars, the forward one forming the leading edge. To help achieve stability the incidence and interplane gap decreased outboard, the former becoming negative. This washout on tips well behind {{the centre of}} gravity provided longitudinal stability {{in the same way}} as a conventional tailplane, set at lower incidence than the wings. Camber increased outwards. Simple, near parallel, pairs of interplane struts joined the spars. The outer interplane struts were enclosed with fabric, forming fixed side curtains that provided directional (yaw) stability. Wing tip elevons were used for control, operated by a pair of levers, one either side of the pilot. The D.8 initially used just a pair of these, mounted on the upper wing, a rectangular cutout in the side curtains allowing for their movement as on the D.5. Large parts of the aircraft were built by Short Brothers.|$|E
25|$|The wings had <b>constant</b> <b>chord</b> with roughly {{elliptical}} tips, {{with roots}} joining the upper longerons. On each side, {{a pair of}} streamlined struts from {{the front and rear}} wing spars at mid-span transmitted lift loads {{to the end of the}} stub wing. There was another, slighter pair of struts from each engine mounting vertically to the wing. The wing structure was mostly metal, with some wooden components, then fabric covered. Each wing carried a pair of ailerons with trim tabs to reduce control loads. The fuselage was built around the usual four metal longerons and covered with an aluminium skin. Pilot and co-pilot sat side by side with dual control in an enclosed cabin just ahead of the leading edge, with fuselage windows on either side for lateral and downward vision. Access to the large passenger cabin, 4.60 m long, was via a radio compartment. The cabin seated ten passengers, five down each side with their own window. At the back were baggage spaces and toilet facilities. Passengers entered by a port-side door and luggage loaded through a door on the other side.|$|E

An attempt to express all switches {{as a set of}} configuration variables is presented in Sivanagaraju et al. (2008). Each parameter of solution vector represents a switch. Since the value 0 and 1 denotes that a switch is open or closed, it is named binary coding. Fontan (2008) has proposed an improved characteristic vector which the network topology string stores only the opened switches positions. An encoding strategy based on keeping the number of <b>chords</b> <b>constant</b> has presented in Zhu (2002). Sawa (2009), Andervazh et al.

A look-up table based on loop cut set is built and each loop is considered as a control variable. The number of each open switch is lined up with the order of the loop number. One group of decimal integers is uniquely corresponding to a candidate solution. Based on the integer loop encoding strategy, a reliability-based encoding scheme is presented in Asrari et al. (2015).

40|$|Alleviating loads on a {{wind turbine}} blades would allow a {{reduction}} in weight, and potentially increase the size and lifespan of rotors. Trailing edge flaps are one technology proposed for changing the aerodynamic characteristics of a blade in order to limit the transformation of freestream wind fluctuations into load fluctuations within the blade structure. An instrumented wind turbine test rig and rotor were developed to enable a wide-range of experimental set-ups for such investigations. The capability of the developed system was demonstrated through {{a study of the}} effect of stationary trailing edge flaps on blade load and performance. The investigation focused on measuring the changes in flapwise bending moment and power production for various trailing edge flap parameters. The blade was designed to allow accurate instrumentation and customizable settings, with a design point within the range of wind velocities in a large open jet test facility. The wind facility was an open circuit wind tunnel with a maximum velocity of 11 m/s in the test area. The load changes within the blade structure for different wind speeds were measured using strain gauges as a function of flap length, location and deflection angle. The blade was based on the S 833 airfoil and is 1. 7 meters long, had a <b>constant</b> 178 mm <b>chord</b> and a 6 o pitch. The aerodynamic parts were 3 D printed using plastic PC-ABS material. The total loading on the blade showed higher reduction when the flap was placed further away from the hub and when the flap angle (pitching towards suction side) was higher. The relationship between the load reduction and deflection angle was roughly linear as expected from theory. The effect on moment was greater than power production with a reduction in moment up to 30 % for the maximum deflection angle compared to 6. 5 % reduction in power for the same angle. Overall, the experimental setup proved to be effective in measuring small changes in flapwise bending moment within the wind turbine blade. 4 month...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight tests have clearly {{demonstrated}} {{the potential of}} hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) to reduce 2 d-airfoil drag on a modern transport aircraft by about 50 % leading to a total drag reduction of about 10 % to 15 %. However, these tests also revealed that much of HLF technology's advantage might be obliterated {{by the weight of}} additional structures and systems. Consequently, one central objective of the EC funded programme ALTTA is the simplification of the suction system for an Airbus A 320 HLFC fin. The simplest internal structure for an HLF system would have only one suction chamber, the leading edge box itself. Unfortunately, the usage of combination with a constant-porosity suction surface results in a very ineffective suction speed distribution. From the aerodynamic point of view the porous surface has to be supported by stringers arranged in spanwise direction. Then the risk of inducing turbulent by nonporous parts of the surface is very small. Lift forces, meanwhile, have to be lead to the front spar by ribs. A very efficient structural solution is a second sheet between stringers and ribs. The outer porous surface, the supporting stringers and the inner sheet form a double sheet surface with a relatively high number of chambers. This structure also allows for a very efficient control the suction distribution. Assuming that the porosity of the suction surface is <b>constant</b> in <b>chord</b> and span direction, the local mass flow between two stringers can be adjusted by metering orifices in the inner sheet, making the whole leading edge box a single suction duct. Active computer control of the mass flow in the suction pipes through butterfly valves and corresponding sensor equipment have also contributed to the high complexity of suction systems in the past. In the present design such elements will not be used. The mass flow-controlling elements are the porous outer surface, the inner sheet with orifices and a suitable suction pump assumed to be located within the leading box. The system is designed to be fully self adapting for a certain range of Mach numbers, flight levels and yaw angles. The paper describes the assumptions and equations to calculate suction speed, mass flow, pressure and pressure losses of such a system. It is shown that this system allows very efficient suction distribution. Reversed turbulence inducing suction velocity (local outflow) can be avoided for a range of yaw angles of +/- 3 °. The transition location on the fin is determined by linear stability calculations. Based on general flight conditions, surface geometry, surface pressure distribution and the suction speed distribution the stability analysis of the laminar boundary layer is performed by means of the local stability code COAST 3. The transition location is determined using the stability results in combination with the so-called 2 -N-factor criterion. The calculation procedure described above is applied on a set of design and off-design flight conditions. It includes Mach numbers from 0. 76 to 0. 80, flight levels between 23000 and 39000 ft, yaw angles of +/- 4 °, ruder deflections of 2 ° and a variation of the suction surface porosity. With increasing Mach number the extent of laminar flow moves slightly downstream. The influence of the flight level is negligible. Varying yaw angle induced by the pressure distribution has a strong influence on the development of laminar flow. The essential result is that up to +/- 3 ° of yaw angle the boundary layer is kept laminar. At larger yaw angles local outflow causes transition of the laminar boundary layer. The extent of laminar flow varies between nearly 40 % on the outer half of the fin and about 30 % on the lower part. The simplified layout of the suction system fulfils the design objectives agreed by the ALTTA partners...|$|R
