60|$|And yet, {{the actual}} crisis {{had taken him}} quite by surprise, and shaken him far {{more than he could}} ever have {{conceived}} possible. For one thing, though he quite expected that some day he would run up unawares against Guy and Cyril, he did NOT expect it would be down in the country, and still less within a few miles' drive of Tilgate. In London, of course, all things are possible. Sooner or later, there, everybody hustles and clashes against everybody. For that reason, he had tried to suggest, by indirect means, when he launched them on the world, that the twins should tempt their fortune in India or the colonies. He would have liked to think they were well out of his way, and out of Granville's, too. But, against his advice, they had stayed on in England. So he expected to meet them some day, at the Academy private view, perhaps, or in Mrs. Bouverie Barton's literary saloon, but certainly NOT on the <b>close</b> <b>sward</b> of the Holkers' lawn, within a few short miles of his own home at Tilgate.|$|E
60|$|At the springs, a line {{of young}} girls with a steady {{mechanical}} action dipped the cups into the steaming source, and passed them impersonally up to their owners. With the patients at the Muhlbrunn it was often a half-hour before one's turn came, and at all a strict etiquette forbade any attempt to anticipate it. The water was merely warm and flat, and after the first repulsion one could forget it. March formed a childish habit of counting ten between the sips, and of finishing the cup with a gulp which ended it quickly; he varied his walks between cups by going sometimes to a bridge {{at the end of}} the colonnade where a group of Triestines were talking Venetian, and sometimes to the little Park beyond the Kurhaus, where some old women were sweeping up from the <b>close</b> <b>sward</b> the yellow leaves which the trees had untidily dropped overnight. He liked to sit there and look at the city beyond the Tepl, where it climbed the wooded heights in terraces till it lost its houses in the skirts and folds of the forest. Most mornings it rained, quietly, absent-mindedly, and this, with the chili in the air, deepened a pleasant illusion of Quebec offered by the upper town across the stream; but there were sunny mornings when the mountains shone softly through a lustrous mist, and the air was almost warm.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} a literature review of Holcus lanatus and records studies {{on both the}} growth and spread of the species and the response of it and of Lolium perenne to several management and edaphic factors. Holcus lanatus is an adaptable, competitive species with ecotypes growing {{in a wide range}} of environments. It is valuable on hill land, acid, low nutrient soils and to prevent erosion. Beef cattle grazing it have made greater liveweight gains than on L. perenne. Experiments used plants growing in pots and small field plots. A growth study of spaced H. lanatus plants showed they can produce up to 240, 000 seeds, most of which germinated shortly after being shed onto moist soil. Seedlings established poorly in a <b>closed</b> <b>sward.</b> Spaced plants produced runners in autumn whose plantlets established better when plants were cut regularly in spring. Holcus lanatus plants needed vernalization in order to flower. This was enhanced by and to a small extent replaced by short days. When H. lanatus plants in bud were cut, useful summer vegetative regrowth resulted. The New Zealand cultivar Massey Basyn was more productive than Oxfordshire H. lanatus in a pot trial. Holcus lanatus dominated a mixture with L. perenne in a glasshouse experiment, especially under high or infrequent cutting, but it was not so dominant in a field experiment. Cattle treading damaged H. lanatus more than it did L. perenne. Holcus lanatus responded to a high water table by producing adventitious and surface roots. Propyzamide at 2. 24 and linuron at 1. 12 kg a. i. /ha in early summer and asulam at 1. 12 or 2. 24 kg a. i. /ha in early September gave good control of established H. lanatus in L. perenne in preliminary trials. The agricultural significance of these results is discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine {{community}} patterns {{and the effects}} of disturbances on these patterns within successional subalpine grasslands at summer farms in Norway. On a broad scale, I investigate how environment, land-use history, and spatial variability affect vegetation patterns within and between farms. On a fine scale, I investigate the effect of the creation and revegetation of bare-ground gaps along a secondary successional sequence. Finally, I investigate seed germination responses in subalpine grassland plants, and relate these to the potential for establishment in semi-natural grasslands during succession. 	The study is based on field data and seed collections from 19 summer farms in two valleys in western and eastern Norway. The data originate from observational field studies via field experiments to phytotron germination trials, and the biological responses monitored range from floristic composition via field recruitment to the timing of germination in individual seeds. The temporal scales and resolutions range from snapshot studies via day-to-day monitoring of germination and four-year field experiments to 40 -year chronosequences. The data are analysed using different univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. 	Three major findings emerge from the study. (1) Disturbance, at scales ranging from the disturbance regimes of entire summer farms via gradients in disturbance intensity within landscapes to fine-scale gaps in a <b>closed</b> vegetation <b>sward,</b> exert considerable influence on the composition and functional traits of species at these various scales. Rare species increased in relative abundance in gaps. (2) The dynamics within fine-scale disturbances, and the responses of individual species to disturbance, change along a secondary successional sequence. This indicates that the processes operating at broad and fine spatial and temporal scales are not independent. (3) The secondary successions, gap revegetation, and regeneration from sown seeds in the field, were slow relative to seminatural vegetation elsewhere. (4) The seeds from subalpine populations of 11 species had consistently high temperature thresholds for germination relative to species from lowland grasslands in Norway and elsewhere. 	Together, these findings suggest that summer farm grasslands share some common characteristics with semi-natural vegetation elsewhere, but that they also have their own particularities. These may be related to climatic constraints. This study contributes to the knowledge of these systems by demonstrating that land-use changes have had, and will continue to have, dramatic effects on the vegetation and flora of subalpine semi-natural landscapes. The slow secondary successional rates in the mountains may explain why upland semi-natural vegetation is regarded as less immediately threatened than its lowland counterparts...|$|R
