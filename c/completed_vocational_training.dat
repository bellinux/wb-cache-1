40|$|BACKGROUND: While {{much has}} been {{published}} about the career outcomes of doctors who <b>completed</b> general practice <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> prior to 1990, no evidence is currently available about those who have qualified since that time. AIM: To obtain information about the career paths of doctors who had <b>completed</b> general practice <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> since 1990, and to compare the results with previously published data. METHOD: Postal questionnaire survey of all doctors <b>completing</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> during the period 1990 - 1995 in three regions of the United Kingdom. The study examined current work status, career path since completion of training, desire for and experience of part-time training, degree of difficulty in choosing and following a career, {{and the degree to}} which certain factors impeded career choice. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 64. 8 %, although there was a significant difference between the response rates for men and women. While virtually all responders were employed, with the majority working in general practice, women were significantly less likely than men to be working as principals in general practice, for all cohorts. These results were very similar to those cohorts described in earlier studies. The career paths of doctors only became stable after about four years. Of those working in general practice, about 20 % found it difficult to choose their career, and about 10 % found it difficult to follow their career. Out-of-hours work was the major factor impeding career choice. CONCLUSION: Although they are taking longer to reach, the final career destinations of doctors <b>completing</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> since 1990 are no different from those of earlier cohorts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the participation of}} vocational school graduates in further education in socialist Czechoslovakia between 1948 and 1989. Students at vocational secondary schools did not acquire a complete secondary education equivalent to that offered at academic and professional high schools. Therefore, they were formally ineligible to enroll in tertiary education. However, previous analyses have shown that about 16 % of all apprentices continued their education after <b>completing</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and thus {{had a chance to}} attain a secondary-school diploma, and were even eligible to obtain a college education. The main question I pose in this text is: who were the apprentices that re-entered school after <b>completing</b> their <b>vocational</b> <b>training?</b> Were they people selected, primarily on the basis of political criteria and loyalty to the communist regime, to form the working-class cadres, or were they children from politically disloyal families who for political reasons could not follow the regular educational career and after <b>completing</b> their <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> went on to study at schools they had been barred from entering immediately after completing elementary education?

40|$|Does {{technology}} {{have an impact}} on the labor market? In what direction do new technologies influence the demand for differing qualities in labor? Do the results found for the manufacturing industries also hold for services? These are the questions addressed in this paper. Various studies for a large number of countries have shown that new technology favors high skilled labor and acts substitutive to low skilled labor, a phenomenon called skill biased technological change. This paper aims to shed light on the effect of new technology on the demand for heterogeneous labor in business-related services. Starting from a dynamic factor demand model, it shows that investment in information and communication technologies acts substitutive to workers with a <b>completed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and complementary to university graduates. Further, traditional investment acts substitutive to unskilled labor. Thus, skill-biased technological change is also present in business-related services. Other findings are that labor costs do not play an important role in the demand for university graduates, in the demand for workers with <b>completed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and additional technical training and in the demand for unskilled workers. They rather turn out to be highly significant for workers with <b>completed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training.</b> Also, expected foreign competition has a significantly positive effect on the demand for both university graduates and unskilled labor alike while present foreign competition is only significant and positive in the demand for university graduates.

30|$|The {{findings}} of this study indisputably show that during commercial <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> knowledge is imparted that, according to previous curricular analyses, can be considered study-relevant for economics degree courses and, to some extent, provides students with a foundation for learning about various economics-related topics such as those assessed using the TUCE 4 -G items concerning macroeconomics. The findings also indicate, however, that beginning students have a limited amount of study-relevant knowledge only. The generally rather low mean values of the scores on TUCE 4 -G items indicate this as well (see “Histograms and t-tests” section). It would be interesting to use this study as a basis to examine longitudinally whether the generally higher level of knowledge gained by <b>completing</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> or a course in economics as a major subject at secondary school has a positive influence on knowledge acquisition over the course of higher education studies.|$|R

30|$|Beginning {{students}} {{of business and}} economics differ in the education they obtained before starting their university programs in economics: While some have <b>completed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training,</b> 1 others have completed courses in economics as a major subject at secondary school (Bouley et al. 2015; Brückner et al. 2015 b; Hillmert and Jacob 2003). Similarly, {{it is possible for}} the upper classes of secondary school (typically school years 11 – 13 or 11 – 12), students attended an upper secondary school specializing in economics (“Wirtschaftsgymnasium”) rather than a standard upper secondary school (“allgemeinbildendes Gymnasium”) (Chang 2005; Georg 2014). In their internationally established model of study success, Kuh et al. (2007) show the correlation between learning opportunities taken prior to beginning studies and beginning students’ knowledge upon starting their studies. Although investigation has been made into the impact of having <b>completed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> (Beck and Krumm 1994; Brückner et al. 2015 b; Happ et al. 2016 b; Van den Berg and Hofman 2005), a course in economics as a major subject at secondary school (Brasfield et al. 1993; Gill and Gratton-Lavoie 2011; Shim et al. 2009; Walstad et al. 2007) or attendance of an upper secondary school specializing in economics (Sczesny and Lüdecke-Plümer 1998) on knowledge of economics, these student-related variables generally have been examined in isolation of each other. From a learning-theoretical perspective, it could be assumed that students use their prior knowledge of economics to create a mental representation of economics-related problems. The more formal education in economics students have obtained prior to starting their university studies in economics, the greater their knowledge of economics is when they begin their studies. In this paper investigation is made into the extent to which prior education in economics accounts for study-relevant knowledge upon beginning university studies. Further, investigation is made into whether the (test-based) assessed level of knowledge of economics differs systematically between beginning {{students of}} business and economics that have had such prior educational experiences (i.e., <b>completed</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and/or a course in economics as a major subject at secondary school and/or attendance of an upper secondary school specializing in economics) and beginning students that have not (for a model of knowledge of business and economics, see Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia et al. 2014). The results of this research will provide important insight for designing target-oriented teaching methods that take into consideration the study-relevant knowledge of beginning students (cf. contributions in Hoyt and McGoldrick 2012).|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the impact of {{uncertainty}} as regards the retention of trainees <b>completing</b> <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> programmes on firms' training behaviour. As an alternative to <b>vocational</b> <b>training,</b> the external recruitment of skilled workers is considered via an opportunity costs approach. The uncertainty is traced back to staff turnover, considerable product market competition and changing skill requirements. Indicators of these causes of uncertainty are examined as to their impact on <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> and the recruitment of skilled workers with a fractional logit model, using a seemingly unrelated cluster-adjusted sandwich estimator with data from the IAB Establishment Panel. There is no confirmation that the presumed correlations exist in manufacturing. A negative correlation is identified in the service sector between high staff turnover coupled with rapid change in the skills required on the one hand, and commitment to <b>vocational</b> <b>training</b> on the other, while there is a positive link with the external recruitment of skilled workers.
