5|$|The more {{traditional}} taxonomy of the family, particularly the split into four groups, has been <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> recent research.

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of the mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that jasmonic acid is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for jasmonic acid synthesis.|$|E

Hartmann jumped {{out of the back of}} the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, Yaropolk {{became the}} son of the Grand Prince, as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev. Izyaslav's rule and thus Yaropolk's {{security}} were however quickly <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> Izyaslav's brother Svyatoslav and by his cousin Vseslav Briacheslavich. At this time among the Rurikids, there were two senior branches that could claim the Grand Princeship through descent from Vladimir the Great; namely, the descendents of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, cattle ranchers who observed condors feeding {{on the dead}} young of their cattle assumed that the birds killed the cattle.

5|$|In {{more recent}} years, the {{original}} Piagetian object permanence account has been <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> {{a series of}} infant studies suggesting that much younger infants do have a clear sense that objects exist even when out of sight. Bower showed object permanence in 3-month-olds. This goes against Piaget's coordination of secondary circular reactions stage because infants aren't supposed to understand that a completely hidden object still exists until they are eight to twelve months old. The two studies below demonstrate this idea.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} season, Orr was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> the veterans, and he earned respect by {{defeating}} Montreal tough guy Ted Harris {{in his first}} NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees {{for the first time}} in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17–43–10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans.|$|E

It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament.

Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained {{that it would be}} treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.|$|E

Although Hite's title to the land was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, the land baron of the area, the matter was settled amicably.|$|E
5|$|Kapeau {{served in}} the Privy Council as an advisor to the king from 1847 until 1854, the year of Kamehameha III's death. He {{also served as a}} member of the House of Nobles from 1848 to 1855. His {{appointment}} was <b>challenged</b> <b>by</b> Hawaiian historian and fellow Lahainaluna classmate Samuel Kamakau who regarded his rank of Kaukaualiʻi (low-ranking chief) as too inferior for him to sit as a noble. By the 1850s, however, the House of Nobles consisted mainly of Kaukaualiʻi.|$|E
