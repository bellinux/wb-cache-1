40|$|Dental resin {{composites}} {{are widely}} used in modern dentistry due to their aesthetic appearance. However, resin based restorations have inferior mechanical properties (fracture is the second reason for restorations replacement) in comparison to alloy based composites and their antimicrobial properties still remain poor, leading to secondary tooth decay development on tooth-filling interface (which is {{the primary reason for}} restorations failure). In this work the Bioactive glass (BAG) was used as an antimicrobial filler. Experimental composites were prepared with 0 - 15 wt % BAG filler and 72 - 57 wt % silane treated silica glass, keeping a total filler content constant at 72 wt%. <b>BAG</b> <b>composite’s</b> mechanical properties were examined, using 3 -point bending beams for flexural strength measurement, pre-cracked compact-tension samples, C(T), for fracture toughness and fatigue crack growth evaluation.

40|$|Electron beam curing of {{composites}} is a non-autoclave process, and consolidation pressure during cure has therefore {{been limited}} to that which may be provided by vacuum bagging the part, or by the application of direct mechanical force. Tooling to apply mechanical force tends {{to be limited to}} simple geometric shapes and may also block (shadow) the electron beam’s path to the <b>composite.</b> Vacuum <b>bagging</b> is readily adapted to most complex three-dimensional parts but the applied consolidation is limited to roughly atmospheric pressure and therefore cannot be relied on to collapse the expansion of volatiles during cure of the electron beam cured laminate. Preventive measures are therefore needed to reduce the factors that cause voids. A critical opportunity to reduce voids in the cured laminate is to minimize air entrapment between plies during lay-up. This paper reports the results of process trials conducted with IM 7 -GP- 12 K/ 3 K and IM 7 -GP- 12 K/ 8 HM unidirectional prepreg tapes to evaluate vacuum debulking and other parameters on the reduction of voids in electron beam cured laminates...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} biologic behavior of a composite of bioactive glass (BAG) (S 53 P 4) and copolymer of poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-DL-lactide) in experimental bone defects in rabbits. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were used for the study. Bone defects (4 x 6 mm) were prepared in the medial surfaces of the femoral condyles and the tibia. Cavities were filled with three different composites: composite with 60 wt% of small BAG granules (granule size < 45 microm) and composites with 40 and 60 wt% of large BAG granules (granule size 90 - 315 microm). Copolymer without BAG was used as a reference material. Follow-up period was 8 and 16 weeks. In the femur at 8 weeks all the samples were partly surrounded by fibrous capsule. New bone formation was noticed in the areas where glass granules were in direct contact with the bone. At 16 weeks fibrous capsule was thinner in all samples. Bone ingrowth was found in the superficial layers of the composites with large glass granules. However, the percent of direct bone contact decreased between 8 and 16 weeks (p < 0. 05). In the tibia at 8 weeks all the samples showed fibrous encapsulation. At 16 weeks fibrous capsules were thinner or occasionally disappeared. Bone ingrowth was noticed in the samples with large glass granules. Further, new bone formation was found in the medullary cavity. No signs of polymer degradation were seen at any time point. It can be concluded that the <b>composite</b> of <b>BAG</b> (S 53 P 4) and copolymer of poly(epsilon-caprolactone-co-DL-lactide) is biocompatible with the bone tissue within the 16 weeks implantation period...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study {{aimed to}} explore if {{initiation}} of biomimetic apatite nucleation {{can be used to}} enhance osteoblast response to biodegradable tissue regeneration composite membranes. Materials and Methods. Bioactive thermoplastic composites consisting of poly(ε-caprolactone/DL-lactide) and bioactive glass (BAG) were prepared at different stages of biomimetic calcium phosphate deposition by immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF). The modulation of the BAG dissolution and the osteogenic response of rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were analyzed. Results. SBF treatment resulted in a gradual calcium phosphate deposition on the <b>composites</b> and decreased <b>BAG</b> reactivity in the subsequent cell cultures. Untreated composites and composites covered by thick calcium phosphate layer (14 days in SBF) expedited MSC mineralization in comparison to neat polymers without BAG, whereas other osteogenic markers—alkaline phosphatase activity, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin expression—were initially decreased. In contrast, surfaces with only small calcium phosphate aggregates (five days in SBF) had similar early response than neat polymers but still demonstrated enhanced mineralization. Conclusion. A short biomimetic treatment enhances osteoblast response to bioactive composite membranes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present article expounds the {{development}} of sunnhemp fiber-reinforced waste polyethylene <b>bag</b> <b>composites.</b> No surface modifications of fibers were made. Sunnhemp fibers of 25. 4 mm in length with waste polyethylene bags were stacked and composite materials were fabri-cated using hot compression molding technique. These composites were prepared at different fiber volume fraction (Vf) varying from 0. 10 to 0. 50. Mechanical properties at different volume fractions of fibers were investigated. The tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, and flexural modulus of composites containing upto 0. 30 Vf were found to increase linearly with Vf and the results showed good agreement with the rule of mixtures. However, beyond 0. 30 Vf {{there was a significant}} deterioration in the mechanical properties. The work of fracture determined by Izod impact test shows increased impact strength with increased fiber volume fraction up to 0. 20 and then a decrease thereafter. The result of this study suggests that sunnhemp fibers have potential as reinforcing material in waste polyethylene bags to produce inexpensive thermoplastic composite materials with a high toughness for various applications like door panels, furniture, packaging, etc. Thus environmental pollution due to waste polyethylene bags can be minimized.

40|$|Hemp fibres compete {{very well}} with glass fibres {{in terms of their}} {{specific}} strength and stiffness and so can replace glass fibres as reinforcement in composites. Combining them with thermoplastics results in potentially cheap recyclable composite materials. The adhesion between the hemp fibre and thermoplastics such as polypropylene is {{a major factor in the}} mechanical properties of the composite. Interfacial bonding can be improved by modifications to the fibres, the matrix or both the fibres and the matrix. The aim of this thesis was to investigate low cost and efficient fibre treatment methods with low environmental impact such as bag retting and white rot fungi, and chelator/enzyme treatments which could be applied to hemp fibre in order to create better bonding fibre for potentially recyclable <b>composite</b> materials. 	 <b>Bag</b> retting was carried out by keeping fresh green hemp fibres in a sealed plastic bag for 1 to 2 weeks to allow natural retting to occur under sealed conditions. For white rot fungi treatments, the dried non-retted hemp fibres were gamma irradiated, and then inoculated with white rot fungi for 2 weeks. Chelator/enzyme treatment was achieved by immersing the fresh green non-retted hemp fibres in solutions consisting of either EDTMP. Na 5 (ethylene diamine tetra (methylene phosphonic acid pentasodium salt) or pectinase (P 2401) and laccase (53739) for 6 hours. Several characterization techniques, namely wet chemical analysis, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fibre density testing, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), zeta potential and single fibre tensile testing were used to assess the effect of treatment on hemp fibres. Wet chemical analysis and FT-IR, were used to measure the chemical compounds present in untreated and treated hemp fibres and showed all treatments removed non-cellulosic compounds from hemp fibre. The separation of untreated and treated fibres was investigated by visual inspection. An examination of surface morphology of hemp fibres carried out using SEM revealed that all treated fibres had cleaner hemp surfaces than untreated ones. The fibre density testing showed that the treated fibre had higher density than untreated fibre. XRD was carried out to assess modification of the crystallinity of fibres and the results showed hemp fibre crystallinity index increased in all treated fibres. Differential thermal analysis (DTA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to obtain the activation energies and relative thermal stability of fibres, and indicated that all treatments improved fibre thermal stability. Zeta potential indicated that all treated fibres were more hydrophilic than untreated fibre. Single fibre tensile testing was used to obtain the tensile strength of untreated and treated fibres and it was found that the tensile strength of all treated fibres was reduced. Short fibre composites were produced by extrusion and injection moulding. Fibres, polypropylene (PP) and a maleated polypropylene (MAPP) coupling agent were compounded using a twin-screw extruder, and then injection moulded into composite tensile test specimens. It was found that all fibre treatments increased the tensile strength of composites. White rot fungi Schizophyllum commune (S. com) treated fibre gave the highest tensile strength of 45 MPa, an increase of 28 % compared to composites using untreated fibre. Both the single fibre pull-out test and the Bowyer and Bader model were used to determine the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of untreated fibre and S. com treated fibre composites. The results obtained from both methods showed that IFSS of the treated fibre composites was higher than that for untreated fibre composites. This supports that the hemp fibre interfacial bonding with PP was improved by white rot fungi treatment. The Bowyer and Bader model was also used to calculate the tensile strength of untreated and S. com treated short fibre composites and results closely match the experimentally values...|$|R
