5|$|The {{character}} {{has been both}} criticised and praised by several commentators. Some viewed her as a <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> professional soldier, and considered her to be less sexualised than other female gaming characters due to her military clothing. Others, however, argued that she was weakened as the protagonist by features that undermined her role as heroine, and criticised some of her sexualised costumes that players receive as rewards for completing certain tasks within the games.|$|E

5|$|By 1927, Yorkshire {{wished to}} appoint a more <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> {{permanent}} captain, instead of continuing the succession of ineffective amateurs, and planned to ask Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional, to take the post. Frederick Toone encouraged Rhodes to offer his resignation as senior professional, possibly {{with a view to}} installing a new regime, but Rhodes declined. Meanwhile, the proposed appointment of Sutcliffe caused controversy; some members of the county believed Rhodes should be appointed. Rhodes pointed out he had not been offered the captaincy, nor had his views been sought. He felt unappreciated when he was not offered first refusal of the captaincy. A poll of Yorkshire members showed a marked preference for Rhodes over Sutcliffe as captain; the disagreements persuaded Sutcliffe to decline the offer, and another amateur was appointed.|$|E
5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member. She feels uncomfortable {{replacing}} a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that made her a cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} technique employed was fresco, {{in which}} the paint is applied to damp plaster. Michelangelo had been an apprentice in the workshop of Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{one of the most}} <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> prolific of Florentine fresco painters, {{at the time that the}} latter was employed on a fresco cycle at Santa Maria Novella and whose work was represented on the walls of the Sistine Chapel. At the outset, the plaster, , began to grow mold because it was too wet. Michelangelo had to remove it and start again. He then tried a new formula created by one of his assistants, Jacopo l'Indaco, which resisted mold and entered the Italian building tradition.|$|E
5|$|To {{complete}} her {{contract with}} Paramount Pictures, Wong made {{a string of}} B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles which were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. <b>Competent</b> <b>and</b> proud of their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939).|$|E
5|$|Another {{close friend}} of SpongeBob is Sandy Cheeks, a {{squirrel}} from Texas. She is a scientist and an expert in karate. She lives in an oak tree entrapped in a clear glass dome locked by an airtight, hand-turned seal. When outside of her dwelling, she wears an astronaut-like suit because she cannot breathe underwater. Mr. Krabs, a miserly crab obsessed with money, {{is the owner of}} the Krusty Krab restaurant and SpongeBob's boss. Krabs has a teenage whale daughter named Pearl, whom he values equally with his riches. His rival, Plankton, is a small green copepod who owns a low-rank fast-food restaurant called the Chum Bucket, located {{across the street from the}} Krusty Krab. Plankton spends most of his time planning to steal the secret recipe for Mr. Krabs's popular Krabby Patty burgers, so as to gain the upper hand and put the Krusty Krab out of business. The majority of Plankton's plans come from his intelligent yet sarcastic computer wife Karen, who is more <b>competent</b> <b>and</b> less conceited than him. When SpongeBob is not working at the Krusty Krab, he can often be found at Mrs. Puff's boating school (the underwater equivalent of a driver's education course). SpongeBob is perpetually unable to pass Mrs. Puff's exams, which is why he almost always walks around town.|$|E
