60|$|The sailing-ship, when I {{knew her}} in her days of perfection, was a {{sensible}} creature. When I say her days of perfection, I mean perfection of build, gear, seaworthy qualities and case of handling, not the perfection of speed. That quality has departed with the change of building material. No iron ship of yesterday ever attained the marvels of speed which the seamanship of men famous in their time had obtained from their wooden, copper-sheeted predecessors. Everything {{had been done to}} make the iron ship perfect, but no wit of man had managed to devise an efficient <b>coating</b> <b>composition</b> to keep her bottom clean with the smooth cleanness of yellow metal sheeting. After a spell of a few weeks at sea, an iron ship begins to lag as if she had grown tired too soon. It is only her bottom that is getting foul. A very little affects the speed of an iron ship which is not driven on by a merciless propeller. Often it is impossible to tell what inconsiderate trifle puts her off her stride. A certain mysteriousness hangs around the quality of speed as it was displayed by the old sailing-ships commanded by a competent seaman. In those days the speed depended upon the seaman; therefore, apart from the laws, rules, and regulations for the good preservation of his cargo, he was careful of his loading,--or what is technically called the trim of his ship. Some ships sailed fast on an even keel, others had to be trimmed quite one foot by the stern, and I have heard of a ship that gave her best speed on a wind when so loaded as to float a couple of inches by the head.|$|E

50|$|Galvalume {{steel sheet}} is carbon steel sheet coated with aluminium-zinc alloy by a {{continuous}} hot-dip process. The nominal <b>coating</b> <b>composition</b> is 55% aluminium and 45% zinc. A small but important addition of silicon {{is included in}} the coating alloy. It is added not to enhance the corrosion performance, but to provide good coating adhesion to the steel substrate when the product is roll-formed, drawn, or bent during fabrication.Galvalume steel sheet combines the excellent barrier corrosion protection of aluminium with the galvanic protection of zinc. The result is a coating that lasts a long time, a coating that provides cut-edge protection along sheared edges, and therefore, a coating that offers excellent protection to steel sheet. Although there are a few exceptions, for most applications in most types of environment, Galvalume steel sheet is the preferred product when long-term resistance to atmospheric corrosion is desired. It outlasts a galvanized coating of comparable thickness, and offers cut-edge protection that is not available with aluminium-coated sheet. This cut-edge protection means there is less rust-staining along sheared edges, at scratches, and other imperfections in the coating. Also, since the coating is so resistant to corrosion, it retains a very bright surface appearance when exposed to most atmospheres. These attributes make Galvalume steel sheet the preferred material for roofing. The superior corrosion resistance of Galvalume steel sheet is achieved by the presence of microscopic zinc-rich and aluminium-rich areas within the coating. The aluminium-rich areas, which corrode very slowly, provide the long-term durability while the zinc-rich areas, which corrode preferentially, provide galvanic protection. Galvalume metals are made with steel panels having a coating of corrosion resistant aluminium-zinc alloy applied by a continuous hot dip process. The nominal composition of the coating is 55% aluminium, 43.5% zinc and 1.5% silicon. Galvalume is the trade name for this patented sheet steel product. The alloy coating of aluminium and zinc combines the best properties of both metals. It has the corrosion resistance and heat reflectivity characteristic of aluminium coatings, with the formability and galvanic protection of cut edges characteristic of zinc coatings.|$|E

About biology of fibre production there are variations in <b>coat</b> <b>composition</b> and structure, fibre growth pattern and fibre structure and quality between these two main kinds of fibre producing animals. In single coat species all fibres are nearly similar in dimensions and grow permanently while in double coat species coat comprises a coarse outer-coat and a fine inner-coat with variations of <b>coat</b> <b>composition</b> and structure, and fibre growth pattern according to {{the season with a}} well defined duration of fibre growth. Genetic basis of hair growth pattern, <b>coat</b> <b>composition</b> and fibre structure are different between species. In small ruminants, these coat characters are additive and due to several genes while in rabbit, several autosomal recessive genes are determining fibre growth, <b>coat</b> <b>composition</b> and structure. In alpaca, the fleece type (Suri or Huacaya) is determined by a single dominant gene. This paper also reviews genetic parameters of fibre production traits in angora goat, angora rabbit and alpaca in which many aspects of the genetic basis of fibre production are analogous. There are many traits controlling both fibre quality and fibre quantity, and most of these traits tend to be moderately to strongly inherited with differences between species so that a rapid genetic progress in any traits is possible and indeed has been achieved. However there are differences in breeding programmes between the double-coated Angora rabbit and the single-coated species Angora goat and alpaca. In double coat species, selection for one single trait, the easy measurable total fleece weight has general beneficial effects on fleece quality. On the opposite, due to antagonistic relations between qualitative and quantitative traits, achieving this goal requires a multi-trait selection index approach. Gene mapping studies have recently identified several putative QTL’s and major genes affecting fibre production and fleece characteristics in sheep, goat and rabbit and were reviewed. The whole genome sequence of sheep and rabbit which will be available in the near future and the use of high-density SNP chip will allow fine mapping and dissection of the genetic basis of many production traits including fibre and fleece characteristics and thus will contribute to improving the efficiency, profitability and sustainability of small ruminant and rabbit fibre production...|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of CO 2 {{to the atmosphere}} from firing conventional fossil fuels {{has become a major}} concern for the power industry, due to the enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming predictions. The increasing worldwide demand for electricity production is another issue. The replacement of fossil fuels with increasing quantities of biomass is of interest as biomass is considered to be carbon neutral and is widely distributed. Unfortunately, due to its composition, the risk of fireside corrosion found on heat exchangers (super- heaters and re-heaters) is greater than in coal-fired plants. Consequently, biomass-fired power plants operate at lower steam temperatures and pressures, leading to their poorer efficiency. Biomass-fired power plants suffer from alkali chloride-induced corrosion, considered faster and more severe than alkali sulphate-based corrosion common in traditional coal-fired plants. The main aim of this project was to develop a range of novel <b>coating</b> <b>compositions</b> which would be resistant to fireside corrosion found on boiler tubes in biomass-fired power plants. To accomplish this, studies were carried out into salt stabilities, coating oxidation and deposit corrosion. Salt stability experiments have resulted in improved understanding of the evaporation and sulphidation behaviour of KCl, NaCl, K 2 SO 4 and Na 2 SO 4 at high temperatures in environments containing HCl and SO 2. KCl was chosen as a deposit for coating screening. Two-target magnetron co-sputtering was successfully used to deposit a range of <b>coating</b> <b>compositions.</b> These coatings were analysed at 550 °C in corrosion environments containing combinations of HCl, KCl and water vapour.
