40|$|<b>Two</b> <b>cellular</b> {{reprogramming}} <b>technologies</b> {{have emerged}} that demonstrate that cell-fate {{can be converted}} by ectopic expression of defined transcription factors: induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology and induced neuronal (iN) cell technology. These recent advances in cell reprogramming strategies have great potential utility for patient-specific disease modeling and for applications in regenerative medicine. Current models of neurodegenerative diseases are limited in their representation of disease phenotypes {{and there is an}} essential need for human cellular models of neurodegenerative disorders. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology offers a two-step approach to disease modeling, in which patient somatic cells are first reprogrammed to a pluripotent state and subsequently differentiated in neurons. In contrast, induced neuronal (iN) cell technology allows for the direct conversion of somatic cells to neurons. Here I demonstrate the modeling of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using both iPS and iN cellular reprogramming technologies. These bioengineered human cell-based models of AD provide unique and invaluable tools for elucidating the mechanism of AD pathogenesis...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{increasing}} mobile data traffic adds extra {{pressure on the}} almost congested mobile networks. In {{order to meet the}} new demand, mobile operators have to improve their networks but as revenues are not expected to rise, they have to add extra capacity in a cost-efficient way. The solution might come from shifting the mobile data traffic towards indoor alternative networks, an approach known as mobile data offloading. Among indoor solutions <b>two</b> <b>technologies</b> stepped forward, Wi-Fi and smallcells. This paper analyses the <b>two</b> <b>technologies</b> as complementing solutions for macrocell layer in the mobile data offloading context. The main discussed questions are whether the two solutions are interchangeable and what are the risks and pitfalls when choosing one of the <b>two</b> <b>technologies.</b> In order to answer the research questions, based on a proposed real life deployment scenario, a capacity-cost calculation has been driven. Thus, a newly built office building lacking indoor mobile coverage has been considered. Based on the calculated offered capacity, the deployment costs for a comprehensive solution using either of the <b>two</b> <b>technologies</b> have been estimated. The cost of provisioning for different solutions is {{based on the fact that}} either of these solutions needs to be built from scratch and no former type of coverage exists...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{object and}} {{software}} agent <b>technologies</b> are <b>two</b> integration methods for connecting enterprises. The <b>two</b> <b>technologies</b> have overlapping goals [...] interoperability and architectural support for integrating software components [...] though to date {{little or no}} integration of the <b>two</b> <b>technologies</b> has been made at the enterprise level. The primary difference between these <b>two</b> <b>technologies</b> is that distributed object technologies focus on the problems inherent in connecting distributed heterogeneous systems whereas software agent technologies focus on the problems involved with coordination and knowledge exchange across domain boundaries. This paper addresses the integration of these technologies in support of enterprise integration across organizational and geographic boundaries. The authors discuss enterprise integration issues, review their experiences with both technologies, and make recommendations for future work. Neither technology is a panacea. Good software engineering techniques must be applied to integrate an enterprise because scalability and a distributed software development team are realities...|$|R
