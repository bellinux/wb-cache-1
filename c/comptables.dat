40|$|In {{a recent}} issue of this journal, Argiles and Slof (2001) {{analysed}} the main features of the European Farm Accountancy Database Network (FADN) against the backdrop of IAS 41, the new international accounting standard on agriculture, and arrived at the conclusion that FADN offers an excellent tool for operationalizing IAS 41 in European farms. The present study revisits some of the key issues in Argiles and Slof's paper in a wider international context and highlights their implications for the harmonization of farm accounting practices around the world. In particular, this paper contends that there are some key provisions of IAS 41 that are incompatible with the European Union Fourth Directive which Argiles and Slof (2001, p. 364) apparently overlooked by focusing only on aspects of the directive that sanction current value measurement and ignoring those that relate to the treatment of associated holding gains or losses. Furthermore, this paper also demonstrates that Argiles and Slof's argument that simplicity is another improvement of IAS 41 vis-a-vis the French Plan <b>Comptable</b> General Agricole is flawed. Indeed, it is shown here that it would be virtually impossible to implement IAS 41 in Francophone countries {{in the absence of a}} fundamental revision, if not complete abandonment, of the plan <b>comptable,</b> at least in view of major conceptual differences between the notions of income, production and value added espoused by national statisticians and those enshrined in IAS 41. ...|$|R

A review of bills proposing accounting regulation shows that no significant progress was to be achieved. Furthermore, while some lawyers called for a comprehensive regulation of corporate groups, no such progress was made during the inter-war period. Ultimately it's the Vichy government which introduced the first regulations on accounting subsidiaries in the French Plan <b>Comptable</b> and limited the reciprocal shareholdings in the Act of March 4, 1943.

40|$|We wish {{to express}} our {{gratitude}} to the Xarxa <b>Comptable</b> Agrària de Catalunya for providing the data that made this paper possible. The agricultural sector has always been characterized by a predominance of small firms. International competition and the consequent need for restraining costs are permanent challenges for farms. This paper performs an empirical investigation of cost behavior in agriculture using panel data analysis. Our results show that transactions caused by complexity influence farm costs with opposite effects for specific and indirect costs. While transactions allow economies of scale in specific costs, they significantly increase indirect costs. However, the main driver for farm costs is volume. In addition, important differences exist for small and big farms, since transactional variables significantly influence the former but not the latter. While sophisticated management tools, such ABC, could provide only limited complementary useful information but no essential allocation bases for farms, they seem inappropriate for small farms...|$|R
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} sections method {{prescribed by}} the Plan <b>comptable</b> general (the French national accounting plan) since its origin is commonly {{attributed to the}} influence of the Rimailho Report (1928, in its final version). An in-depth analysis of the processes and management systems Rimailho set up, described in minute detail in his major works, has led to the belief that he was the pioneer of a certain type of the activity-based costing method. But other aspects of his work are far more interesting. With Rimailho, accountancy plays a role which is closely linked to his political and social convictions. Rimailho's management accounting appears as the strategic tool in a type of corporate regulation involving organizational slack, possible in a defender 's strategy deployed in a specific competitive and technological environment. Rimailho's organization does not fit into today's standard typologies (Anthony, Woodward, Ouchi, etc.). It is an appropriate challenge for researchers in accounting and management control.

40|$|Cette {{communication}} cherche à étudier l’impact de l’introduction des normes IFRS sur le traitement <b>comptable</b> des actifs incorporels, dont le poids ne cesse de croître au sein des états financiers. Une étude théorique et empirique compare le traitement <b>comptable</b> des actifs incorporels selon les normes françaises et internationales. Les résultats, issus de l’analyse des rapports annuels de l’année 2004 des entreprises du CAC 40, montrent que cinq configurations se dessinent, dont deux regroupent 83 % des entreprises. Pour la majorité d’entre elles, l’application des nouvelles normes ne génère aucun changement, ce qui va à l’encontre des conclusions de l’étude théorique. L’autre tendance significative rassemble les entreprises enregistrant une augmentation de l’écart d’acquisition au détriment des autres actifs incorporels, ce qui semble contraire aux objectifs visés par l’IASB. From 2005, European listed {{firms and}} many more {{around the world are}} required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The introduction of a uniform accounting system is expected to ensure greater comparability and transparency of financial reporting around the world. Over recent years there has been an increasing interest in the field of intangibles, which are gaining more and more importance in financial statements. This paper aims to study the impact of the adoption of IFRS standards on the accounting treatment of intangible assets. In a first part, we examine and compare the similarities and differences between the two accounting systems concerning intangible assets. Secondly, we conduct an empirical study, based on the analyse of French listed companies annual reports for 2004. In fact, 2004 heralds a crucial turning point in the countdown to 2005, the date by which all European Union-listed companies must report their consolidated accounts using IFRS. Findings show that five configurations representing the impact of IFRS application occur, two of which include 83 % of the companies selected. For most of them, the implementation of international standards does not imply any change. This is contrary to our findings presented in the first part. The other significant tendency concerns companies recording an increase in the amount of goodwill to the detriment of other intangible assets, and this seems contrary with the IASB objectives. This is followed by a discussion of findings and directions of future research. Actifs incorporels; Ecart d'acquisition; Normes françaises et IFRS; Etude comparative; Accounting standards;...|$|R
40|$|The {{franchising}} {{of public}} service activities (concessions de service public) has traditionally {{played a significant role}} in infrastructural provision in France, notably in the public utility sectors of electricity, gas and water. Concession accounting is troubled by two major problems. First, operating capability maintenance (OCM) is not achieved, primarily because of the failure to tackle the issue of backlog depreciation. In sectors with high capital intensity, long asset lives and marked technological change, the restrictive legislation pertaining to asset revaluation and, hence, depreciation, aggravates this OCM problem. Second, financial capital maintenance (FCM) is not achieved, particularly when amortization of the enterprise's investment in those concession assets which are surrendered to public authorities (I'amortissement de caducite) is abandoned. This evaluation of French practice is policy relevant for two distinct reasons. First, given the significance of concessions in France, it is important to establish a coherent translation of the principles of the Plan <b>comptable</b> general 1982 to concession assets; this will not be achieved by the proposals of the 1992 Committee on Concessions, whose implementation would represent a retreat from economic relevance. Second, the concession model is experiencing both a revival in francophone Africa and extension to the United Kingdom. ...|$|R
40|$|The Mercantile Style or Mode of Finance, the Choice of an Accounting Model in France {{under the}} Old Regime. Investigations into the {{accounting}} pratice of French compagnies in the XVIIIth century {{show that they}} used two principal models double entry and charge and discharge accounting. We have attempted to verify that the choice of an accounting model {{was determined by the}} social class of the shareholder {{as well as by the}} traditions and operating conditions particular to each branch of activity. For example, double entry, the merchant's model, was used in the textile industry, where the capital came from trade. Charge and discharge accounting, on the other hand, was the mining and model in which capital was injected mainly by the nobility or financiers. Nevertheless the dominance of stewardship accounting in these sectors is not entirely due to custom Founded upon the separation of capital ownership and management, focused upon the notions of responsibility and control, this model met the needs of the first joint stock companies. But the use of double entry won out, becoming widespread among the large industrial enterprises between the years 1810 to 1830, not without having incorporated certain basic concepts borrowed from its rival model.
