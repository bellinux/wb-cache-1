5|$|The Tour of Oman is {{the third}} of a trio of stage races in the Middle East that <b>come</b> <b>early</b> in the road cycling season, {{following}} the Dubai Tour and the Tour of Qatar, in 2015 won by Mark Cavendish and Niki Terpstra respectively. The distinctive feature of the Tour of Oman is the annual inclusion of the climb of Jebel Akhdar, the Green Mountain, which means the general classification is generally won by climbers. Many Grand Tour contenders start their seasons racing in Oman for this reason.|$|E
5|$|There are 24 vending {{stands in}} the {{corridor}} area behind the stands, with a selection of different snacks, light meals, and beverages. Other facilities include exhibition space, 330 toilets for men, 120 for women, and six for the disabled. Pre-match and half-time activities take place behind the terracing of the Northern Stand. This area is called Ståplatstorget ("The terracing square"), and includes eight vending stands and MFF Support's supporter centre. At the supporter centre, fans can buy souvenirs, and tickets to away matches. The square also contains publicly accessible benches and tables. Access between the {{different areas of the}} stadium was limited by a system of security gates {{until the end of the}} 2011 season, when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely, except for the areas occupied by away supporters. This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere, and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches. To further motivate spectators to <b>come</b> <b>early,</b> pre-match activities are often held at Ståplatstorget.|$|E

25|$|The Groundhog Day celebration {{is rooted}} in a Celtic and Germanic {{tradition}} that says that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on February 2, the Pagan holiday of Imbolc (known among Christians as Candlemas), winter and cold weather will last another six weeks. If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will <b>come</b> <b>early.</b> In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a hedgehog would cast its shadow, predicting snow {{all the way into}} May. When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the word}} [...] "{{optimization}}" [...] shares the same root as [...] "optimal", {{it is rare}} for the process of optimization to produce a truly optimal system. The optimized system will typically only be optimal in one application or for one audience. One might {{reduce the amount of}} time that a program takes to perform some task at the price of making it consume more memory. In an application where memory space is at a premium, one might deliberately choose a slower algorithm in order to use less memory. Often there is no [...] "one size fits all" [...] design which works well in all cases, so engineers make trade-offs to optimize the attributes of greatest interest. Additionally, the effort required to make a piece of software completely optimal— incapable of any further improvement— is almost always more than is reasonable for the benefits that would be accrued; so the process of optimization may be halted before a completely optimal solution has been reached. Fortunately, it is often the case that the greatest improvements <b>come</b> <b>early</b> in the process.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{charters}} of 1112 {{refer to}} Queen Urraca as [...] "empress" [...] (imperatrix), including an original of 18 May. All {{the uses of}} this title by the queen <b>come</b> <b>early</b> in her reign, and perhaps formed [...] "a conscious device to offset the authority of her ‘imperial’ husband", Alfonso the Battler, {{who was at the}} height of his power in the [...] "dark days" [...] of 1112. One of Urraca's most prolific known notaries, Martín Peláez, with fifteen surviving charters, three original, to his name, occasionally paired the title [...] "chancellor" [...] (cancellarius) for himself with that of [...] "empress" [...] for his sovereign. The use of a more dignified title than [...] "notary" [...] (notarius) may have been designed to buttress the use of the imperial title, which was probably considered excessively masculine, even in comparison to Urraca's regal powers. A charter of 6 September 1110 referring to Urraca as [...] "queen and empress" [...] (regina et imperatrix) and drawn up by a scribe named Petrus Vincentii is probably a falsification. There is another suspect charter, dating to 28 October 1114, while Urraca was wintering at Palencia with her court and Count Bertrán de Risnel, probably an ambassador from her husband's court. On that day she made a donation to the see of Palencia in which she appears with the title [...] "Empress of all Spain" [...] (totius hispaniae imperatrix), an exact feminine analogue of her father's usual lofty title, although this diploma survives only as a copy.|$|E
2500|$|The Fault in Our Stars {{received}} critical acclaim. Critics mostly {{praised the}} book for its humor, strong characters, language, themes and new perspective on cancer and romance. The New York Times review of the book called it [...] "a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny" [...] and said that it [...] "stays the course of tragic realism", while noting that the book's unpleasant plot details [...] "do nothing to diminish the romance; in Green's hands, they only make it more moving." [...] NPR's Rachel Syme noted that [...] " [...] voice is so compulsively readable that it defies categorization," [...] saying that the [...] "elegantly plotted" [...] book [...] "may be his best." [...] Time called The Fault in Our Stars [...] "damn near genius." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] " [...] love story is as real as it is doomed, and the gut-busting laughs that <b>come</b> <b>early</b> in the novel make the luminous final pages all the more heartbreaking", and gave the novel an overall A grade. Amazon.com calls it [...] "insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw" [...] and Green's [...] "most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet." [...] The Manila Bulletin says that the book is [...] "a collection of maudlin scenes and trite observations about the fragility {{of life and the}} wisdom of dying. And while it does talk about those things and more, the treatment of it is far from being maudlin or trite." [...] The Manila Bulletin also added that [...] "Just two paragraphs into the work, and he immediately wallops the readers with such an insightful observation delivered in such an unsentimental way that its hard not to shake your head in admiration." [...] The Manila Bulletin stated that The Fault in Our Stars was a triumph for John Green. USA Today called it a [...] "elegiac comedy." [...] They gave the book a rating of four out of four stars.The School Library Journal stated that it was [...] "a strong choice for Adult Collections." [...] The Fault in Our Stars received a starred review from Kirkus Reviews, who described it as [...] "a smartly crafted intellectual explosion of a romance." ...|$|E
