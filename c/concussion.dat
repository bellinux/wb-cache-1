5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it had ever done in the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss to Minnesota since 1977 and the largest to Minnesota at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a <b>concussion</b> during the game but still played after showing signs of a <b>concussion.</b> This revelation sparked calls for Brandon to be fired, including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or <b>concussion)</b> to Morris.|$|E

50|$|<b>Concussions,</b> {{a type of}} {{traumatic}} brain injury, are a frequent concern for those playing sports, from children and teenagers to professional athletes. Repeated <b>concussions</b> are a known cause of various neurological disorders, most notably chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which in professional athletes has led to premature retirement, erratic behavior and even suicide. Because <b>concussions</b> cannot be seen on X-rays or CT scans, attempts to prevent <b>concussions</b> have been difficult.|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as many as}} 1.6-3.8 million <b>concussions</b> occur in the US per year in competitive sports and recreational activities; this is a rough estimate, since as many as 50% of <b>concussions</b> go unreported. <b>Concussions</b> occur in all sports with the highest incidence in American football, hockey, rugby, soccer, and basketball.

Despite the <b>concussion,</b> Favre threw a 28-yard touchdown to Javon Walker on a fourth down play. Afterwards {{it was reported that}} Favre did not remember throwing the touchdown pass. Favre also had two significant touchdown streaks of note during the season. He had completed at least one touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games over the 2002–2004 seasons which at the time was the second longest streak in NFL history. Also, during the 2004 post-season, he broke Dan Marino's record for consecutive games with at least one touchdown pass in the post season. Favre went on to throw a touchdown pass in twenty consecutive playoff games which is still an NFL record.|$|E

40|$|The North American {{ice hockey}} world {{has come to}} realise that <b>concussions</b> are a major problem and {{a threat to the}} sport and to the National Hockey League (NHL). The media {{coverage}} of the <b>concussions</b> suffered by several NHL stars and of the scientific advancements in the detection and long-term effects of <b>concussions</b> has intensified over the last 20 years. A discourse analysis of Canadian newspaper coverage of <b>concussions</b> in the NHL in 1997 - 1999 and 2010 - 2012 focusing on the production of discursive objects and subjects reveals two important discourses. On the one hand, emerging objects of the discourses of blame and responsibility for the <b>concussions</b> in the NHL gained prominence in the later timeframe, especially blame on the NHL, the rulebook and hockey’s violent and risk-taking culture. On the other hand, a shift in reporting saw {{the emergence of a new}} subject position for the concussed hockey player, that of a frail and vulnerable subject. More NHL players are covered as ‘suffering’ subjects concerned with both physical pain and the mental health problems associated to <b>concussions,</b> rather than merely as athletes. Indeed, the impact of <b>concussions</b> on the personal lives of players is now an object of discourses that also produce the NHL player as a family member. Finally, former hockey players’ stories who have suffered serious <b>concussions</b> are recounted as a cautionary tale, opposing early retirement as a result of health issues to persistence in playing despite such health concerns...|$|R

A variety of signs accompany <b>concussion</b> including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Approximately 3. 8 million {{sport and}} {{recreational}} <b>concussions</b> occur per year, creating {{a need for}} accurate diagnosis and management of <b>concussions.</b> Researchers and clinicians are exploring the potential dose-response cumulative effects of concussive injuries using computerized neuropsychological exams, however, results have been mixed and/or contradictory. This study starts with a large adolescent population and applies strict inclusion criteria to examine how previous mild traumatic brain injuries affect symptom reports and neurocognitive performance on the Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) computerized tool. METHODS: After applying exclusion criteria and case matching, 204 male and 99 female participants remained. These participants were grouped according to sex {{and the number of}} previous self-reported <b>concussions</b> and examined for overall differences on symptoms reported and scores obtained on the ImPACT neurocognitive battery composites. In an effort to further reduce confounding factors due to the varying group sizes, participants were then case matched on age, sex, and body mass index and analyzed for differences on symptoms reported and scores obtained on the ImPACT neurocognitive battery composites. RESULTS: Case matched analysis demonstrated males with <b>concussions</b> experience significantly higher rates of dizziness (p[*]=[*]. 027, η(2) [*]=[*]. 035), fogginess (p[*]=[*]. 038, η(2) [*]=[*]. 032), memory problems (p[*]=[*]. 003, η(2) [*]=[*]. 055), and concentration problems (p[*]=[*]. 009, η(2) [*]=[*]. 046) than males with no reported previous <b>concussions.</b> No significant effects were found for females, although females reporting two <b>concussions</b> demonstrated a slight trend for experiencing higher numbers of symptoms than females reporting no previous <b>concussions.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that male adolescent athletes reporting multiple <b>concussions</b> have lingering concussive symptoms well after the last concussive event; however, these symptoms were found to be conflicting and better explained by complainer versus complacent attitudes in the population examined. Our results conflict with {{a significant portion of the}} current literature that uses relatively lenient inclusion and exclusion criteria, providing evidence of the importance of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and examination of confounding factors when assessing the effects of <b>concussions...</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Concussions</b> are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated <b>concussions</b> may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, and depression. <b>Concussions</b> are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures.
