5|$|Former World Bank Chief Economist {{and former}} Chairman of the U.S. <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Advisers</b> Joseph E. Stiglitz {{referred}} {{in the late}} 1990s to a growing consensus {{that something is wrong}} with a system having the capacity to impose high costs on a great {{number of people who are}} hardly even participants in international financial markets, neither speculating on international investments nor borrowing in foreign currencies. He argued that foreign crises have strong worldwide repercussions due in part to the phenomenon of moral hazard, particularly when many multinational firms deliberately invest in highly risky government bonds in anticipation of a national or international bailout. Although crises can be overcome by emergency financing, employing bailouts places a heavy burden on taxpayers living in the afflicted countries, and the high costs damage standards of living. Stiglitz has advocated finding means of stabilizing short-term international capital flows without adversely affecting long-term foreign direct investment which usually carries new knowledge spillover and technological advancements into economies.|$|E

40|$|In {{this comment}} to ITC Investigation 337 -TA- 745 (Certain Wireless Communication Devices, Motorola v. Apple) we, as {{teachers}} and scholars of economics, antitrust and intellectual property, remedies, administrative, and international intellectual property law, former Department of Justice lawyers and chief economists, {{a former executive}} official at the Patent and Trademark Office, a former counsel at the ITC Office of the General Counsel, and a former Member <b>of</b> the President’s <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Adviser</b> take the position that ITC exclusion orders generally should not be granted under § 1337 (d) (1) {{on the basis of}} patents subject to obligations to license on “reasonable and non-discriminatory” (RAND) terms. Doing so would undermine the significant pro-competitive and pro-consumer benefits that RAND promises produce and the investments they enable. A possible exception may arise if district court jurisdiction is lacking, the patent is valid and infringed, and the public interest favors issuing an exclusion order. We explain our position in the comment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the complex {{relationship}} between academic advice given to policy makers, economics as a science, and economic policy. It is seen {{from the viewpoint of}} a university teacher who serves (or did so formerly) as an adviser in the advisory <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the Federal Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> Affairs and the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Economic</b> Experts. The paper addresses the trade-off between doing research work and economic advising, as well as the extent to which economics as a science is established sufficiently enough to advise seriously. Moreover, the reputation <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>advisers</b> and the successful influence <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> advising on economic policy makers is discussed.
