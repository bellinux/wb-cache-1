40|$|Adaptive optics is {{concerned}} with the correction of phase distortions in wavefronts which degrade the quality of images produced by optical systems. It was originally developed for both astronomy and the military, where the Earth's atmosphere causes distortions, although other uses are now being developed. As ground based telescopes become increasingly large the size and complexity of adaptive optics systems also increase, creating "extreme adaptive optics”. This thesis deals with such an adaptive optics system. A novel self referenced phase shifting interferometer based on a liquid crystal (LC) waveplate is presented which can measure high spatial frequency phase distortions. This is then coupled to a LC spatial light modulator wavefront corrector. The geometry is matched such that {{there is no need for}} a wavefront reconstructor. The performance is measured in two stages. Firstly, spatially where static phase distortions are measured by the interferometer and corrected. Secondly, temporally where a simple analogue feedback is implemented to show correction over a single corrector pixel for fast time varying phase distortions. This work builds on other published research on using point diffraction interferometry in adaptive optics. The novelty lies in the development of a new implementation of a point diffraction interferometer, and in the demonstration of a high-speed <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>single</b> channel system. This work therefore contributes to the groundwork required to build an extreme adaptive optics system whose complexity scales linearly with the size (area) of the telescope aperture.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} two methods of designing robust two degree of freedom (TDF) controllers. Both design procedures will be illustrated and evaluated on a high purity distillation column example. In the first approach the feedback controller and the prefilter are designed in a single step using an H∞ optimization procedure. The second method optimizes the feedback controller and prefilter in two separate design stages. Roughly speaking, the feedback controller is designed to meet robust stability and disturbance rejection specifications, while the prefilter is used to improve the robust model matching properties of the <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> system. The <b>single</b> step approach has the advantages that it is easy to use, and that the resulting controller degree is the same as that of the plant. The two stage approach offers greater design flexibility and it may produce robust stability and robust performance margins which are significantly bigger than those achievable with the single stage approach. Set against that, the two stage technique is more difficult to use and it produces controllers which may have an order which is significantly bigger than that of the plant. © 1992...|$|R
