5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the employment rate. Since wages are fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} campaigns in The Age of Kings, {{containing}} historically based scenarios such as Genghis Khan's invasion of Eurasia, Barbarossa's Crusade, or Saladin's defence of the Holy Land.

5|$|Bioluminescence {{is used by}} {{a variety}} of animals to mimic other species. Many species of deep sea fish such as the {{anglerfish}} and dragonfish make use of aggressive mimicry to attract prey.

Additionally, Edaniel and Edrear's other sister, Elala, is found dead. After Edaniel and Edrear lock down the mausoleum, they send Dinah home and she discovers that Maphohetka, a girl hanged for witchcraft and who now as a ghost <b>can</b> <b>control</b> minds in the real world, is manipulating Eniri and the townspeople. Unsuccessful in her attempt to stop her, Dinah flees to the mausoleum and receives a special outfit melted from the gold tolls that she and Vincent paid {{to gain access to}} the mausoleum. Returning, she confronts Maphohetka, who then orders Edaniel to kill her.|$|E

5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player <b>can</b> <b>control</b> one specific character in each level. The game's playable characters are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu. Homer and Bart are played twice. When travelling on foot, the player character can walk, run, and perform {{three types of}} melee attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian vehicles that drive endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E
5|$|In cotton production, the {{replacement}} of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids <b>can</b> <b>control</b> pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner {{which has been}} caught in a strange cloud belt. They call the Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), a man who <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E

5|$|Later, Gil {{is taken}} to a {{solarium}} to receive the sun's healing rays. While he naps, he transforms into a reptilian creature, horrifying the other patients. Fleeing from the scene, Gil discovers his new appearance. Stern notifies Ann and Dr. Buckell about the incident, theorizing that the exposure to radiation caused a reversal of evolution, transforming Gil into a prehistoric reptile after exposure to sunlight. Stern suggests that Gil <b>can</b> <b>control</b> his symptoms by staying {{in the dark and}} remaining in the hospital, but admits that the patient cannot be held against his will.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{citizens}} of Oz, spurred on by Madame Morrible and Boq's testimony, band together to help rescue Dorothy from the clutches of the Wicked Witch of the West. Glinda has realized Morrible, who <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death, but when she confronts her, Morrible tells her that there is blood on her hands as well and advises her to smile and wave. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba as the angry mob sets out to Kiamo Ko to kill Elphaba. ("March of the Witch Hunters").|$|E
5|$|Moelia and {{his family}} depart for Ciwalirang the {{following}} morning, hoping that Noesa Brama will consent to the marriage of Moelia and Retna Sari. The priest accepts the proposal, but expresses regret over {{the destruction of the}} statue after he discovers that Retna Sari and Soerijati had not gone willingly with the men from Palembang. He weds Moelia and Retna Sari and has them promise that their first son will be raised a Hindu and become king of the Baduy; he then surrenders all his power to his daughter. Later, hoping that his spirit and those of his ancestors <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the volcano, Noesa Brama secretly commits suicide by jumping into the well. Several weeks later, activity at the volcano drops, although it remains active.|$|E

5|$|Most sponges work {{rather like}} chimneys: they {{take in water}} {{at the bottom and}} eject it from the osculum ("little mouth") at the top. Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the top, the suction effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|E
5|$|Nick Offerman as Ron Swanson, {{the cynical}} {{director}} of the parks department and Leslie's boss. Due to his incredibly negative view of government, he regularly works to make his department as inefficient as possible. This leads him to butt heads with Leslie {{on a number of}} occasions, as her philosophy regarding government is the polar opposite. Despite that, both he and Leslie have a large amount of respect for one another. Ron has been married twice; both of his ex-wives are named Tammy. He despises and fears them greatly, as they are the only two women in the world that <b>can</b> <b>control</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Normally, {{five players}} {{play in a}} {{standard}} round of Evolve, with four Hunters fighting one Monster. Playing with less than five players, including single player, is possible in all modes due to computer-controlled bots. These bots <b>can</b> <b>control</b> up to four of the characters, allowing between one and four human players in any game mode. Players can also switch to play as another class instantly in a single-player match.|$|E
30|$|The above {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the PP between the terminal points <b>can</b> be <b>controlled</b> by adjusting the voltage amplitude and phase angle of each terminal. In addition, the active and reactive power can be decoupled. Ideally, the value of PP should be controlled at zero to guarantee the maximum transmission power. The active PP <b>can</b> be <b>controlled</b> by arranging the amount of reactive power compensation at the terminal point properly. This contributes to adjusting the voltage amplitude. As for the reactive PP, the phase angle <b>can</b> be <b>controlled</b> by adjusting the unit operation mode at the adjacent areas of terminal points.|$|R
