40|$|ABSTRACT- The use of ultra high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber rope as a replacement for steel wire rope shows beneficial properties with the use of synthetic ropes in static line applications such as guylines. The promise shown establishes the basis for expanding its use to running lines for improvements in logging safety, worker ergonomics, and economic efficiency. Research is investigating the applicability of synthetic ropes to dynamic applications including winch lines on crawler tractors and rubber-tired skidders, a carriage dropline, and a mainline winch on a Koller K- 300 <b>cable</b> <b>yarder.</b> Required rigging connection modifications are discussed. Observed durability and wear of the synthetic rope are reported. Subjective evaluations by machine operators and researcher observations are briefly summarized. Future research ideas are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{is defined}} as an {{undesired}} sound that constitutes an unwarranted disturbance potentiality modifying animal behaviour or normal functioning. Forest operations commonly involve the use of equipment and machines that can produce noise and be a potential permanent or temporary disturbance for the wildlife. This study simulates noise propagation in a natural area generated during coppice stand harvesting by direct field noise measurements {{and the application of}} a specific GIS model. Two working phases were investigated: felling and yarding operations. Two potential systems were analyzed for the yarding operations: a) yarding by mobile <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> and b) skidding by tractor with a three point log grapple. The results are reported in terms of excess noise area for the third-octave bandwidths with the centre in 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. Felling by chainsaws presented the largest area where noise exceeds the ambient natural noise, while in the case of yarding, mobile cable yarding operations presented a smaller area of excess noise than skidding by tractor...|$|E
40|$|Hazards {{occurring}} to the fallers and chokersetters (breaker-outs) within <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> (hauler) crews {{working in}} windthrow salvage conditions were recorded.

The most hazardous parts of the faller’s job were those of felling, clearing around the tree to be felled and clearing a path to the tree to be felled. The two most dan-gerous tree types to deal with were “hung-up ” and “rootball trees”. The choker setters were exposed to a similar number of hazards per cycle as choker setting in normal condi-tions, {{but a number of}} previously undocumented hazards were recorded. The majority of choking hazards (70 %) occurred during the “wait ” phase of choking with the most frequent hazard being “standing within one tree length of the turn ”.

In the studied area, trees were felled by chain saw and the full-tree method was used to skid the felled trees to the <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> site using the Syncrofalke cable crane with a mounted Woody H 60 processor head. Further wood processing operations were carried out at the yarder site. Length measurement accuracy was illustrated through the frequency distribution and the modus of various lengths.

The difference between the nominal log length and the minimum required length resulted in a loss of 4. 38 % of the total log value. Further more, it was established that {{the first quarter of the}} stem actually contained 64 % of the total stem value. This means that the first cross-cut was responsible for nearly 50 % of the total loss and the second crosscut pushed the figure to 80 %.

40|$|Cable yarding {{can reduce}} the {{environmental}} impact of timber harvesting on steep slopes by increasing road spacing and reducing soil disturbance. To determine the cost of harvesting forest biomass with a small <b>cable</b> <b>yarder,</b> a 13. 4 kW (18 hp) skyline yarder was tested on two southern Appala-chian sites. At both sites, fuelwood was harvested from the boles of hard-wood trees 10 to 36 cm (4 to 14 inches) in dbh. The volume of pieces yarded 3 3 ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 63 m (0. 2 to 22. 4 ft). With a crew of four on a 3 small clearcut block and piece volumes averaging 0. 14 m 3 (5. 1 ft), yarding costs were $ 12. 03 per m 3 ($ 33. 70 per cunit). With a crew of two on a site 3 previously harvested for sawlogs, it cost $ 6. 78 per m ($ 19. 00 per cunit) to 3 3 yard pieces averaging 0. 21 m (7. 5 ft). Because productivity was generally constrained by the yarder's 429 kg (1, 150 lb) mainline pull capacity, the two-person crew proved the most efficient. Production and cost analyses integrating field studies with computer simulation showed that the total cost of yarding biomass with a two-person crew could range from $ 5. 50 to $ 11. 00 per m 3 ($ 15. 00 to $ 31. 00 per cunit), depending upon average piece volume.

These systems are found to be a competitive option when small volumes must be harvested far from a forest road, when there are other considerations to be taken account of in avoiding road construction, or in playing an important role in connection with catastrophes such as widespread wind-fall where road construction cannot be carried out in time to extract the timber...|$|R

In total 1888 accidents were recorded with 8. 7 % of these associated with cable yarding activities. The overall accident rate amounted to 36 incidents per million cubic meter extracted by <b>cable</b> <b>yarder.</b> There was a clear spike in accidents between 2 and 3 pm. Most accidents occurred onWednesdays and Mondays (26 and 25 %, respectively). The four months of March, June September and November accounted for 45 % of all accidents. The majority of accidents (63. 2 %) were caused by broken spar and anchor trees, bouncing cables and falling objects. Frequently injured body parts were the extremities such as hand and feet (64 %) and the head and neck area (15. 2 %). Contusions (37. 8 %) are the most common kind of injury followed by bone fractures (12. 8 %), sprain or strains (11. 6 %) and punctures or lacerations (10. 4 %). An average cable yarding accident required 17. 9 days for recovery, compared to the 25. 6 days for manual extraction and 29. 7 days for extraction by means of a tractor or skidder. Accident severity varied among body parts: eye injuries resulted in three lost work days, while injured extremities required 20 days for recovery. During wood extraction, some stems with branches may be unhooked and fall down. In this case, the accidents caused are the most severe needing 27 days for recovery...|$|E
40|$|Chokers are {{wire rope}} slings used {{to secure the}} felled trees to the rigging during <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> extracting. Standard chokers are set {{manually}} by the choker-setters along the corridor, and then unhooked manually by the yarder operator at the landing. Radio-controlled chokers are also set manually but have the advantage {{that they can be}} released remotely at the landing. In addition to possible safety improvement at the landing, the advantage is that it reduces the unhook phase of the operation and thereby potentially improve productivity. However, the additional weight of the radio controlled chokers may also increase the work load of the choker-setters on the slope. A standard manual choker bell weighs 0. 34 kg, whereas the radio- controlled choker bell weighs 1. 6 kg. To assess the possible efficiency and ergonomic benefits of radio-controlled chokers a study was carried out on aWanderfalke yarder. The study site was in the eastern Austrian Alps, working in Norway Spruce with a piece size ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 86 m 3, on slopes between 50 and 60 %, and in corridors of 90 to 200 m long. It included both a time and motion study in a full factorial layout as well as measuring the choker-setter workload through continuous monitoring of the heart-rate. Results showed that therewas a 9 %productivity gain using the radio-controlled chokers at the average piece size. However the workload of the choker-setter also increased; the percent heart rate reserve, a measurement of worker strain, increased from 40 to 44 %.

Three main aspects of sustainability are assessed: greenhouse gas emissions, represented by global warming potential (GWP) impact category, costs and direct employment potential. We investigate a whole tree system (innovative logging system) where the harvest of logging residues is integrated into the harvest of conventional wood products. The case study is performed in Valle di Fiemme in Trentino region (North Italy) and includes theoretical and practical elements. The system boundary is the alpine forest fuel system, from logging operations at the forest stand to combustion of woody biofuels at the heating plant. The functional unit is 1 m 3 solid over bark of woody biomass, delivered to the district heating plant in Cavalese (Trento). The relative sustainability of traditional and innovative systems is compared and energy use is estimated. Results show that the overall GWP and costs are about 13 kg CO 2 equivalent and 42 euro per functional unit respectively for the innovative system. Along the product supply chain, chipping contributes the greatest share of GWP and energy use, while extraction by yarder has the highest financial costs. The GWP is reduced by 2. 3 ton CO 2 equivalent when bioenergy substitutes fuel oil and 1. 7 ton CO 2 equivalent when it substitutes natural gas.

40|$|The authors {{conducted}} {{a survey of the}} residual stand damage and soil disturbance caused by harvesting Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean forests in Central and Southern Italy. Sixty-five stands were inspected, with the double purpose of estimating reference values for logging impacts, and of determining if alternative silvicultural prescriptions result in a different frequency, severity and distribution of stand damage and soil disturbance. Data was collected with simple methods, commonly used in similar studies and suitable for direct application to forest practice. The study indicated that 12 - 14 % of the residual trees are usually damaged during the conventional harvesting of Mediterranean forests. This proportion can grow to 20 % when crawler tractors are used. Soil disturbance was detected on 58 % of the surface of clear-fell sites, and on 42 % of the surface of thinning and partial cut sites. Furthermore, clear-fell sites presented 5 times as many occurrences of disturbance categorized by being greater than 5 cm depth as thinning and partial cut sites. The study also showed an obvious and direct relationship between impact levels and proximity to the main extraction trails. The study indicated that thinnings and partial cuts are not associated to a dramatic increase of stand damage, but they result in a lower incidence of soil disturbance. Extraction by tracked farm tractors causes more stand damage and soil disturbance than extraction by rubber-tired farm tractors or by <b>cable</b> <b>yarders.</b> The introduction of modern technology is likely to determine a dramatic reduction in the use of tracked and rubber-tired farm tractors in forest operations, but it may generate new and different impacts, which should be monitored with much care. Yarding causes the least stand and soil damage, suggesting that silvicultural prescriptions should favor the application of cable logging, if possible. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Land {{managers}} in the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon are currently faced with large areas of forest with health problems and extreme levels of fuel loading in the stand and on the forest floor. These conditions resulted {{from a combination of}} insect infestations, past management practices and the elimination of fire from the local ecosystems. These forests are now overstocked, diseased and contain vast amounts of dead woody debris on the forest floor posing a serious threat of large destructive fires. This paper presents an economic analysis of a harvesting system aimed at treating these stands while minimizing soil impacts. A combined thinning of the dense stands and salvage logging of the larger fuels from the forest floor was completed using a single-grip harvester to process the stems into logs and a small <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> to transport the logs to landings. The terrain on the site was flat and therefore presented logistical challenges for yarding. This unique combination of equipment was thosen to minimize machine traffic on the site in an attempt to reduce ground impacts on areas with sensitive soils or critical habitat concerns. The harvester was to fall and process all non-marked standing trees and process any solid stems on the forest floor into logs. A Koller K 501 yarder (33 ft tower), using a standing skyline, slackline system rigged with a tail tree and occasionally an intermediate support, was used to transport the logs to the landing. Production estimates obtained for the harvester and yarder were 7. 33 cunits/PMH (20. 74 m 3 /PMH 1) and 5. 41 cunits/PMH (15. 31 m 3 /PMH) respectively. Actual system production was approximately three to four truck loads removed off the site on an average days with some days as low as two loads and some as high as six loads. An average truck load contained 5 Mbf (28. 3 m 3) or 24 tons (21. 7 tonnes) of wood. Total logging cost for the system (stump to mill) was 78, 809 which equated to 97 /cunit (34. 24 /m 3) or 42. 44 /ton (46. 78 /tonne) of material removed.

40|$|The New Zealand forest {{industry}} produces a {{diverse range of}} log grades and sorts to meet domestic and export market demands and to maximise returns to the forest grower. An implication for the supply chain {{is the number of}} log grades and sorts a harvesting operation is expected to produce from one species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata). The number of log grades and sorts can impact on landing size and layout requirements, value recovery, log-making complexity, machine utilisation and quality control requirements. A study was conducted to investigate if the number of log sorts affects mechanised log processing productivity and value recovery. This would determine if any gross value gains derived from producing a higher number of sorts are offset by losses in log processing productivity. Two landing-based mechanised log processors at <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> harvesting operations were studied using different cutting scenarios producing five, nine, twelve and fifteen log sorts. The study collected data from over 26 hours of mechanised processing which included the processing of 578 stems at an average piece size of approximately 1. 6 m³. Machine utilisation results showed processors spending 84 % of total time on productive tasks and that 49 % of total time was spent on the primary productive tasks of log processing. Quadratic regressions were used to model log processing productivity trends which showed piece size and cutting scenario as significant predictor variables (p-value < 0. 01). There was a significant difference between cutting scenario with five log sorts and the cutting scenarios with twelve and fifteen log sorts (p-values < 0. 05), as well as {{a significant difference between the}} nine and fifteen log sort cutting scenarios (p-value < 0. 01). There was not enough evidence to suggest productivity was different between cutting scenarios producing five and nine log sorts. Based on this analysis, it was likely that the null hypothesis that the number of log sorts does not affect log processing productivity should be rejected. At a piece size of 2 m³, the productivity model estimated processing productivity was 10 % higher producing nine log sorts compared to producing fifteen log sorts. A linear regression model showed a strong relationship between gross value recovery, piece size and cutting scenario (p-value < 0. 01). Gross value recovery increased as the number of log sorts increased. A significant model suggested it is likely null hypothesis 2, that the number of log sorts does not affect gross value recovery, should be rejected. There were only some differences in variances between cutting scenarios which were statistically significant. Both the average results and regression estimates showed the five log sort cutting scenario recovering 94 % of the value of the cutting scenario with fifteen log sorts. Incremental gains in value recovery as the number of log sorts increased were marginal, which appeared to be due to log prices for many major log grades trading in a close range in relation to historic price trends. Regression trends for productivity and gross value recovery indicated that the most optimal cutting scenario, in terms of processing value outturn per productive machine hour, was the cutting scenario producing nine log sorts. This suggests that declines in processor productivity offset gains in gross value recovery when producing twelve and fifteen log sorts. Market sensitivity analysis suggested that differentials in log prices impact on the number of log sorts which optimise the value outturn per productive machine hour from log processing...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{development}} of bioenergy from biomass {{has dominated the}} minds of forest engineering researchers over the last decade. One of the main themes that has been generated from that research is that bioenergy from biomass has major operational hurdles to overcome before becoming economically feasible. More directly, {{the impact of the}} slope of the harvest area, the elevation of harvest sites and the ownership of the lands being harvested were, in this thesis, seen as major operational hurdles in western Oregon which would require further study. This thesis discusses two studies that were conducted to provide insight into the operational hurdles that are occurring in biomass development. The first of these studies was an exploratory field study conducted in the area of small wood (35 %). The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare traditional (cable) and contemporary (ground‐based) harvesting methods on steep terrain in an effort to determine the economic feasibility of the differing harvest methods. To achieve the purpose of this study, a shift‐level assessment was conducted on six different harvesting systems, all of which were conducting first‐entry commercial thinning. The six different harvesting systems were a Koller K 301 yarder with manual felling on steep terrain (> 35 %), a Koller K 301 yarder with a Ponsse Ergo harvester (double‐bogie) cutting and pre‐bunching whole trees with no processing on steep terrain (> 35 %), a Koller K 301 yarder with a Ponsse Ergo harvester (double‐bogie) cutting with cut‐to‐length felling, processing and pre‐bunching on steep terrain (> 35 %), a Ponsse Ergo harvester (double‐bogie) cutting and processing for a Ponsse Buffalo King forwarder (double‐bogie) on steep terrain (> 35 %) with an adverse haul to the landing, a Ponsse Ergo harvester (double‐bogie) cutting and processing for a Ponsse Buffalo King forwarder (double‐bogie) on steep terrain (> 35 %) with a favorable haul to the landing, and a Ponsse Ergo harvester (double‐bogie) cutting and processing for a Ponsse Buffalo King forwarder on flat terrain (< 35 %). To evaluate economic feasibility, the productivity and cost of each harvesting system was evaluated and compared. The results of the comparison of the six harvesting systems showed that the system with the lowest harvesting cost for first‐entry commercial thinning on steep terrain was the harvester/forwarder combination; under all scenarios studied. However, this study also found that by processing and pre‐bunching using the Ponsse Ergo harvester the productivity of the yarder was increased by 79 % and the harvesting cost was reduced by 50 %. Although the costs of the harvester/forwarder treatments were lower than the cost of the yarder treatments, there were still significant cost reductions and productivity increases when the harvester was paired with the <b>cable</b> <b>yarder.</b> The Ponsse Ergo harvester was the focus of evaluation for operational aspects of ground based machinery on steep terrain. A detailed time study revealed that significant differences occurred in the average cycle time of the harvester when it was placed on steep terrain. Further analysis showed that the significant difference was not a product of increased slope but rather was the product of factors that were outside of the scope of this study. The harvester's productivity was impacted by within unit and outside of unit drive times (the time spent driving between trees or driving between cutting areas and the time spent driving on the return trails for access to the next cutting road, respectively). Significant differences in the average within unit drive times was found at the extreme slope classes (65 +%) for all treatment units with some treatments having impacts at slopes as low as 45 %. However, the changes in average within unit drive times related to slope did not represent a large enough increase in drive times across the different slope classes within each treatment to be able to conclude that slope is the sole factor for decreased production on steep terrain. Thus, there are elements outside of the scope of this study which may have an unforeseen impact on drive times within the unit. Drive time outside of the unit accounted for a loss of an average of one hour per day of productive cutting, and had a significant impact on harvester productivity. Overall, a detailed analysis of the harvester data found that slope steepness had marginal impacts on the productivity of the harvester. This indicates that further analysis may be needed to identify the elements that were not included in the scope of this study that may impact the operability of the harvester on steep terrain. The second study used to provide insight into the operational hurdles of biomass development was a biomass assessment conducted using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data provided by the U. S. Forest Service. This assessment focused on the operational factors of land ownership, slope and elevation. This study works to assess the operational considerations of biomass harvesting at the landscape scale through a biomass assessment based on the ownership group (forest service, other federal, state & local and private), the elevation characteristics and the slope characteristics of timberlands in western Oregon. This assessment focused on comparing the biomass per acre (bone dry tons, BDTons) within a given unique feature to identify the trends or relationships that exist. With respect to ownership group, this study found that forest service lands had significantly more biomass per acre (BDTons) than all other ownership types and private lands had significantly less biomass per acre (BDTons) than all other ownership types. Other federal and state & local timberlands had no significant difference with respect to biomass per acre (BDTons). In order to make true comparisons within the elevation and slope categories, the impact of ownership group on these variables had to be accounted for to remove any possible bias. Thus, the categories of elevation and slope were looked at within each ownership group (forest service, other public and private) to provide a comparison with minimal bias. The study found that the amount of biomass per acre was not significantly different with changes in slope or elevation. This thesis works to fill the gaps in the literature regarding the operational considerations of harvesting biomass on steep terrain in western Oregon. The results and conclusions will build to the body of literature already present on this topic...|$|E
40|$|Concerns {{about the}} fast growth in {{greenhouse}} gas emissions have encouraged several countries to increase their use of renewable energy. According to the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), 20 % of all the energy production in the EU should come from renewable energy sources by 2020. Woody biomass can be one choice within bioenergy for mitigating climate change if replacing fossil fuels. However, the demand for wood fuels has increased recently, and in Europe, the demand is predicted to exceed European supply, so we therefore need to consider more wood energy sources. Here, wood fuels from mountain forests can be an interesting alternative. Globally, mountain forests cover 28 % of the total forested areas, while in Europe {{one quarter of the}} forest is located in mountain areas. Thus, there is a large potential for harvesting woody biomass for bioenergy use. The aim of this PhD study is to assess the GHG emissions associated with two wood fuel supply chains from mountain forests. Two case studies, one in Norway (Hedmark-Oppland counties) and one in Italy (Valle di Fiemme -Trentino-Alto Adige region) are analyzed and compared. The methodology used is the Life Cycle Assessment, which is an established tool for assessing the mentioned environmental impact for the supply system through its life cycle – from the forest stand to the user (bioenergy plant), through forest management, logging operations, transportation and combustion at the plant. The chosen functional unit is one solid cubic meter over bark (1 m 3 s. o. b.). The environmental impact category under assessment was climate change, expressed as global warming potential (GWP) with a time horizon of 100 years in terms of the amount of GHG emissions. In the study, a cost analysis (NOK or euro/m 3 s. o. b.) is performed, and an analysis of the employment impacts (hours/m 3 s. o. b.) is conducted in the Italian case related to the examined supply chains. Comparison with lowland forest or other types of renewable energy is outside the scope of this study. The PhD thesis consists of four papers. Papers 1 and 2 deal with the Norwegian case study, while Paper 3 describes the Italian case study. Paper 4 compares the main findings of each case study, analysing the differences and similarities between the Norwegian and Italian supply chains. Paper 1 provides {{the first part of the}} Norwegian case study, comprising the production stages from the mountain forest stands to the terminal. Mountain forests were highlands located in flat terrain. Forest management, logging operations and transportation to the terminal were the processes assessed. Forest residues, generally left at the forest stand, were harvested and bundled. Fuel consumption, raw material and primary energy use were calculated as input parameters. Results showed that the operation with the highest emissions and costs was transportation of woody biomass to the terminal, due to high fuel consumption and long transportation distance. Forest management had the lowest emissions, but highest costs. Bundling had high emissions and costs, even if long transport distance might make this operation advantageous in mountain areas. The present forest management and transport logistics are elements, which can be improved, seen from a GHG perspective. In Paper 2, the second part of the Norwegian supply chain is assessed; i. e. from the terminal to the biomass combustion plant. The benefits of replacing fossil fuel (natural gas, coal and oil) with wood fuel from the mountain sites, as described in paper 1, were calculated based on the assumption of carbon neutrality. Two alternatives were analyzed: i) a local supply chain, where raw materials from lowland forests were chipped at the terminal and transported by truck to a local district heating plant, and ii) an international supply chain, where raw materials from both lowland and highland forests were chipped at the terminal and exported by train to a combined heat and power plant in Sweden. The local supply chain had larger emissions than the export alternative. Both railway transportation and energy cogeneration made the international supply chain more efficient than the local alternative. The wood chips from mountain forests in Norway can be an option for covering the increasing demand for wood fuels in Sweden. Furthermore, the results indicate that the export of wood chips from Norway to Sweden is currently economically viable. Paper 3 presents the Italian case study carried out in Valle di Fiemme-Trentino region. In this paper, the social aspect (i. e. the direct employment potential) was assessed in addition to the environmental and economic aspects. The LCA concerned a local supply chain from mountain forest stands located in steep terrains to combustion at a district heating plant, where wood fuels were assumed to replace a fossil fuel plant (natural gas or oil plant). Logging residues, generally left at the forest stand, were harvested and chipped at the landing site. Chipping was the operation with the largest emissions followed by transportation by truck. Extraction by <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> was the operation with the highest costs along the supply chain. Regarding the analysis of employment, transportation and yarding operation created working opportunities. The use of woody biomass for energy can generate new jobs, although the topic of job creation is under discussion in the forestry sector. Furthermore, comparisons between an innovative (more mechanized) and a traditional logging system (more manual work) were presented, indicating that the substitution of a motor manual with a mechanized logging system reduced both emissions and costs. Paper 4 compares results from the Norwegian case study (paper 1 and 2) and the Italian case study (paper 3). Distinctive features of each case study, both similarities and differences, are discussed. The main results from the Norwegian case study were: a high rate of mechanization in harvesting highland forests located in flat terrain, chipping at the terminal, and a preference for an international supply chain (i. e. export to Sweden). The main features of the Italian supply chain were: a predominance of motor manual operations, felling trees in steep terrain, chipping at the landing of logging residues, absence of a terminal, and a local supply chain. The overall comparison between the case studies showed larger emissions for the Norwegian supply chain than the Italian one, due to higher mechanization and more steps involved in the supply chain. That also explained the higher costs for the Norwegian case. However, the greenhouse gas balance for the studied supply chains was still positive when wood fuels substituted fossil fuels. The analysis of employment was a critical aspect, and needs further investigation. The papers show large differences in how wood fuel supply chains are handled in the studied mountainous areas, making it difficult to formulate general conclusions. However, our case studies clearly show the potential for using woody biomass for bioenergy from mountain forests and the feasibility of harvesting wood fuels there with positive GHG impacts and without increasing the operative costs dramatically. The improvement of critical aspects of the supply chain operations may reduce emissions and costs. The evaluation of other impacts, in particular biodiversity aspects and deeper analyses should be made to ensure the fulfilment of sustainability criteria...|$|E
40|$|For {{achieving}} a high-quality and efficient management of forest ecosystems (Pentek et al. 2010), {{it is necessary}} to provide an optimally distributed network of primary and secondary forest road infrastructure. The openness of forest areas, the need to describe the existing situation and the tendency to rationalize the existing road network were described with traditional openness (density of forest roads). Traditional openness is a well-known parameter that has represented the size of the basis determined by the level of the achieved existing primary and secondary road density {{for a long time in}} forestry. In many previous researches, different authors described the current state with traditional openness of the secondary forest road network (Rebula 1983, Zdjelar 1990). Traditional openness is a numeric data that says little about the quality of road distribution on the observed areas. It represents only the quantity and distribution of primary and secondary forest roads. The transitional form of themodern view of the subject matter is a combination of traditional openness andmean skidding distance (Pentek et al. 2010, Pentek et al. 2007). Relative openness has, lately, (Pentek et al. 2010, Pentek et al. 2007) been increasingly used as a variable that describes more precisely and accurately the actual state of forest road infrastructure and defines the need for further opening of forests. The basic terrain characteristics (Šikić et al. 1989) such as relief altitudes, slopes and indented terrains determine the terrain configuration such as: the plain, hilly and mountainous terrains. Generally, relief and terrain can also be divided into plain and bumps, where the plains are – lowlands and plateaus, and bumps are – elevations (hills, highlands, mountains) and troughs (valleys, basins, river basins). The relative openness is both a quantitative and qualitative parameter (Pentek 2010), which gives a good insight into the spatial distribution of forest roads, and expresses the ratio of surface forest area opened by forest roads and the total forest area in percentage terms. It is the parameter that (Pentek 2002), with a good insight into the spatial distribution of forest roads, gives the possibility of establishing open and unopened areas, and offers to designers the option of choosing the most appropriate version of forest road routes. The relative openness is determined by the buffer method and the procedure consists in laying down the buffered areas around the forest road infrastructure. Primary and secondary relative openness can be distinguished depending on the category of forest roads. The secondary relative openness provides information on quantity and spatial distribution of secondary forest road network. The procedure of determining the secondary relative openness is very similar to the process of determining the primary relative openness, but for the calculation of the buffer zone width around skid roads, skid trailsor cable-yarder lines, the mean skidding distance is not taken into account. Depending on applied timber harvesting technologies, the following parameters can be used:• winch rope length,• forwarder cranes,• length of the <b>cable</b> <b>yarder</b> rope for sideward skidding. The primary forest road infrastructure is taken into consideration when calculating the secondary relative openness because the components of the primary forest road infrastructure can be used in winching roundwood. The importance of the quality of spatial distribution of secondary forest roads (skid roads and skid trails) is determined by the fact that with the same density of secondary roads, if their distribution is bad, the distance of timber extraction is twice bigger than when their distribution is carefully defined (Knežević 1980, Rebula 1981, Rebula 1983). The secondary forest opening depends on the relief area in which the procedure of fine opening is carried out, as well as on the applied (possible) timber harvesting technologies. On flat terrains, which allow skid road and skid trail routes to be laid out perpendicular to the contour lines, forest areas are opened in the shape of a rectangle network, i. e. components of secondary forest road network are separated from the primary components at right angle, and the components of lower order are also separated from those of higher order at right angle, within the network of secondary forest roads. Laying out the network of secondary forest roads in the plain area is not a major problem due to the fact that tractors can move in all directions, which makes the performance of the procedure very simple; no excavating is required, but only removing the stumps of cut trees. Here the system of secondary forest roads is represented through skid trails, which are in fact the defined timber extraction routes – the so called – parallel pattern. On subhilly and hilly terrains with developed hydrographic network and indented relief interlaced with coves and ditches, skid roads and skid trails, adapting to and following the terrain configuration, crawl along the waterways and bays, and at final parts of the watercourses they can be branched in fan-shaped pattern, in the so-called plumose pattern and fishbone pattern. In mountainous areas with large slope, skid roads and skid trails are developed on the slopes following them in an appropriate, allowable, positive longitudinal upward inclination – fishbone pattern. In karst terrain with abundant karst phenomena, particularly sinkholes, the routes of skid roads should be laid out on passes between sinkholes, and in other parts of the forest area they must be adapted to the relief configuration. Laying out skid roads in sinkholes is not justified because of uphill timber skidding, especially from deep sinkholes with steep slopes – irregular pattern. The research area was the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar«, Forest Office Perušić, Forest Administration Gospić. It is an integral part of North Velebitmassif, extending in the east to west direction. Due to its location and altitude, it is considered a high mountain area. The total area of forest management units amounts to 2, 413. 14 ha. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are the steep mountainous terrain and indented, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 20 – 40 °. These features suggest the need for good primary and secondary forest openness. The annual allowable cut (26. 36 m 3 /ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness of the completeManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar« is 9. 97 m per ha, while the openness of secondary forest roads is only 26. 74 m per ha. If only the selected area is taken into consideration, then the primary openness is 27. 13 m per ha, while the secondary openness is 45. 19 m per ha. Researches were carried out in the selection forests of the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume«, Forest Office Opatija, Forest Administration Buzet. The total area of management units is 1, 950. 87 ha. TheManagement Unit »Veprinačke šume« is part of the mountain Ćićarija. The basic features of forest opening and harvesting are steep and indented mountainous terrain, rich with karst phenomena, shallow soil, rocky substrates and heavy construction material categories. The average slope is 5 – 30 °. Based on these features, the need for an effective primary and secondary openness is obvious. The annual allowable cut (41. 59 m 3 /ha) is of very good quality. The primary openness is 8. 58 m/ha, or 16. 78 m/ha, if the old Italian public road with a superstructure made of crushed gravel is taken into account. The secondary openness is 101. 94 m/ha. The objectives of this study were defined through the following phases of work:• establishment of the secondary forest road cadastre,• analysis of the secondary relative openness for the selected skidder winch rope length,• designing (development) of the secondary forest road network. In the selected subcompartments of the ManagementUnit »Bovan-Jelar«, 123 skid roads were investigated of a total length of 46, 656 m. The research area covers 942. 10 hectares and the secondary openness with skid roads is 49. 52 m per ha. In the analysis of the secondary relative openness, the value of access to an area of 45 m was chosen based on the skidder winch rope length. Due to the terrain slope and surface barriers, the selected winch rope length was corrected by 10 % because of the increased directional felling. The analysis of conditions in the selected subcompartments of the Management Unit »Bovan-Jelar« showed a lack of the secondary relative openness. In order to achieve excellent secondary relative openness, a fine opening of further research areas was done for the selected winch rope length. When improving (upgrading) the existing network of secondary forest roads, the winch rope length of less than 45 mwas selected as relevant, with the aim of providing work humanization and adapting to the demanding terrain conditions. For this version, a high number of conceptual routes were designed – 83 new skid roads of a total length of 46, 438. 91 m. The newly designed secondary forest road network reached the secondary relative openness of 90. 47 %, by which excellent openness was achieved. Such secondary relative openness was achieved with a density of only 106. 88 m per ha of skid roads. The terrain of the observed area is mountainous and this is why the whole management unit was not taken into consideration. The rest of the management unit is extremely steep and has a protective character. The mountainous terrain is quite steep, but only slightly indented and rather unchanging, which explains the smaller traditional openness required to achieve excellent secondary relative openness than was the case in the previous studies (Jeličić 1983, Rebula and Zdjelar 1983, 1990). Asignificant contribution to a more efficient network of the secondary forest roads is provided by the application ofmodern technologies andmethods in the planning of secondary forest roads. Surveys conducted in the Management Unit »Veprinačke šume« cover 1, 326. 10 ha of forest area and include 629 skid roads of a total length of 152, 893. 44 m. The reason for such a large number of skid roads lies in the fact that the terrain is mountainous, very indented with a large amount of karst phenomena, and hence a higher number of skid roads is necessary because of large terrain indentation. In the researched area the existing secondary relative openness is very good (according to Pentek 2002), and it amounts to 83. 13 %. Traditional secondary openness is 134. 39 m per ha, and it includes the primary roads: the public roads and forest roads with skidding possibilities. The secondary relative openness was determined for three different skidder winch rope lengths: 30, 45 and 60 meters. The chosen winch rope length was decreased by 10 % because of the terrain slope and surface barriers. The surface barriers, spatial distribution of standing trees in the stand and directed trees felling were also taken into consideration. The corrected values were increased by the average value of timber assortments because it is enough to reach only the top of an individual assortment to increase the total area of reach of a tree. Designing new conceptual routes had to be done to improve the existing secondary road network to an excellent level of the secondary relative openness, which was achieved with 42 new skid roads of a total length of 14, 332 m. The secondary relative openness in this case amounts to 90. 13 %, and the road density is 144. 12 m per ha. In the Republic of Croatia harvesting is done by ground machinery, cable-yarders are very rare, and helicopters and other forms of air transport are not applied. Therefore, good primary and especially secondary forest openness by forest roads is extremely important. Comparing the results with previous studies in similar conditions (Rebula 1983 and Zdjelar 1990), the optimal secondary relative openness was achieved with less total length of secondary forest roads. A similar result was obtained by research of the terrain with similar characteristics in Bosnia and Herzegovina (Jeličić 1983), according to which secondary openness of 100 m per ha was recommended in even-aged forests and up to 200 m per ha in selection forests. In earlier studies (Pentek et al. 2008), in similar terrains, secondary forest road network optimization has been done for a various number of winch rope lengths: 30, 40, 50 and 60 meters. Due to terrain conditions, horizontal barriers, existing secondary forest road network and in order to provide work humanization, the winch rope length of 40 m was selected. The current secondary relative openness was 78. 42 %. By designing 23. 03 km of new skid roads, an excellent secondary relative openness of 90 % has been achieved with the traditional secondary openness of 113. 47 m per ha. Comparing the results with previous studies (Pičman and Pentek 2003), taking into account the particularities of individual research areas, results in constantly developing methods for estimating the existing and optimizing future networks of secondary forest roads, thus {{achieving a}}n excellent secondary relative openness with lower density of secondary forest roads. Planning a network of secondary forest roads is significantly determined by the existing secondary forest road infrastructure, which often directs further opening. The analysis of the current situation showed that the forest area is opened by the existing network of secondary roads two or even several times more than necessary, thus reducing the efficiency coefficient of the existing road network. This is the result of unsystematic forest opening in the past. It is therefore very important to use the modern methods of forest opening in the forest areas where the procedure of fine opening has been applied from the start, or where the secondary openness is very bad...|$|E
