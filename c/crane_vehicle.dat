40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} single and dual cycle operations for three types of resources, namely, quay <b>cranes,</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and yard <b>cranes</b> to improve the operating efficiency and reduce the energy consumption in a container terminal.

Statistical analyses are conducted to evaluate and compare the effect of different cycle strategies on the cycle reductions.

40|$|Abstract. Metal {{materials}} especially {{steel or}} cast iron are used extensively in {{many types of}} construction such as buildings, bridges, <b>cranes,</b> <b>vehicles</b> and so on, so detection or prediction of metal failure is very important, but deformation of metal material often deliveries heat energy which can be detected by infrared imager. The test specimen is installed between the two grips of the testing machine and then loaded in tension and in compression. The IR 913 A infrared imager is used to observe the deformation of metal specimen. The high-sensitive infrared thermal images of metal specimen in the different phase of deformation are obtained. The paper theoretically analyzes the reason from the thermodynamics and plastic mechanics, the conclusions are drawn as follows: 1) When applying loads, temperature field {{on the surface of}} metal specimen is changing, the local rise of temperature is remarkable, this can be observed from the infrared thermal images. 2) From the infrared thermal images, rising temperatures are found in the regions of stress concentrations. 3) When the test specimen approaches to failure or appears fracture, there is a remarkable change that can be shown from the infrared thermal images with remarkable colors...|$|R

30|$|The {{equipment}} at container terminals {{needs to be}} employed optimally by minimizing the completion time for handling containers, because a vessel’s turnaround time is the key performance indicator for terminal operators (De Koster et al. 2009; Bierwirth and Meisel 2010). In the literature, this is classified as a scheduling problem in which a number of jobs (e.g. containers) are assigned to available resources such as <b>cranes</b> and <b>vehicles</b> transporting containers between the quayside area and the stacking area. Because {{of the complexity of}} container terminal operations, scheduling problems in a particular area are investigated to simplify the scheduling of the overall terminal (Geerlings et al. 2018).|$|R

The giant helicopter was tested in Culver City, California over a three-year period beginning in 1952. The XH-17 flew in 1953 at a gross weight in excess of 50000 lb. It still holds the record for flying with the world's largest rotor system. Only one unit was built, since the aircraft was too cumbersome and inefficient to warrant further development.|$|R

40|$|According to {{previous}} researches, automated guided <b>vehicles</b> and quay <b>cranes</b> in container terminals {{have a high}} potential synergy.

Objectives of the model are to minimize total traveling time of the vehicles and delays in tasks of cranes. A genetic algorithm is developed {{to solve the problem}} in reasonable computational time. The most appropriate control parameters for the proposed genetic algorithm are investigated in a medium size numerical test case. It is shown that balanced crossover and mutation rates have the best performance in finding a near optimal solution for the problem. Then, ten small size test cases are solved to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization methods. The results show the applicability of the genetic algorithm since it can find near optimal solutions, precisely and accurately...|$|R

30|$|The {{construction}} {{process is the}} process of installing the check dam, divided into three work stages: earthworks (ground excavation, backfilling, etc.), installation (check dam assembly, etc.), and temporary works (stream water drainage, etc.).

The study covered the CO 2 emissions produced by the combustion of fuel (light oil and gasoline) for the backhoes, truck-mounted <b>cranes,</b> concrete-pump <b>vehicles,</b> generators, and other vehicles used during these various work stages. Fuel use was calculated from the duration of use of each type of machinery with reference to the Chisan and Forest Road Manual, Quantity Surveying and Construction Volume [15] (Table  1), and multiplied by the conversion factor for the CO 2 emissions produced by the combustion of each type of fuel [16] to obtain CO 2 emissions. The conversion factors used were 2.59  kg-CO 2 /l for light oil and 2.32  kg-CO 2 /l for gasoline.|$|R
