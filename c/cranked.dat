5|$|The {{underground}} {{prison was}} shot in real caves left by mining at Griffith Park, in the Bronson Canyon, previously used as the Batcave and in the 1930s Flash Gordon serial. Shots of {{the interior of the}} mine were captured at night so it appeared like the setting was underground. Since Narita and his crew weren't allowed to drill holes for lights in mine shafts, illumination had to come from practical lights that appeared {{to be part of the}} set. The elevator descent into the bowels of the mine was simulated by pasting fake rocks to a canvas being <b>cranked</b> in the background of the scene. While Zimmerman believed Shatner would hate the fight between Kirk and his doppelgänger, the actor enjoyed the theatrical sequence, and contributed to the choreography with his knowledge of judo and karate.|$|E

25|$|The crank became {{common in}} Europe {{by the early}} 15th century, often seen {{in the works of}} those such as the German {{military}} engineer Konrad Kyeser. Devices depicted in Kyeser's Bellifortis include <b>cranked</b> windlasses (instead of spoke-wheels) for spanning siege crossbows, <b>cranked</b> chain of buckets for water-lifting and cranks fitted to a wheel of bells. Kyeser also equipped the Archimedes' screws for water-raising with a crank handle, an innovation which subsequently replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading. The earliest evidence for the fitting of a well-hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c. 1425 in the German Hausbuch of the Mendel Foundation.|$|E
25|$|Hidden {{headlamps}} (also {{known as}} pop-up lights) {{were introduced in}} 1936, on the Cord 810/812.

They aided aerodynamics when the headlamps were not in use, and were among the Cord's signature design features.|$|E
25|$|The marching timpani {{were made}} of fiberglass, and were played by a four or five man line (similar to a modern-day bass drum line). The timpani were <b>cranked</b> by a handle {{sticking}} up {{on the side of}} the drum. Sometimes intricate, complex music was made using the possibilities of 4 or 5 players. While one man was cranking/tuning, another was playing. To help tuning problems (which some corps had), corps sometimes used tuning gauges.|$|E

50|$|On older styles, the spider—the multi-armed {{piece that}} connects the {{chainring}} to the bottom bracket axle—was a separate piece from the <b>crank</b> arm. The most common modern <b>cranks</b> have an integrated spider on the drive-side <b>crank</b> arm.

25|$|The M.23 was a small, {{conventional}} low-wing cantilever monoplane. It had a fixed undercarriage, the mainwheels {{mounted on}} a <b>cranked</b> axle, plus a tailskid. The fin and rudder assembly were broader and shorter {{than that of the}} M.19, though the shape varied with sub-type. A wide variety of engines were fitted, with power ranging from the 28kW (38hp) ABC Scorpion two-cylinder motor to the 112kW (150hp) of the seven-cylinder Siemens Sh 14a radial.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a hexagonal socket on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be <b>cranked</b> backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, this ballast {{resistor}} would fail and the classic symptom of this failure {{was that the}} engine ran while being <b>cranked</b> (while the resistor was bypassed) but stalled immediately when cranking ceased (and the resistor was reconnected in the circuit via the ignition switch). Modern electronic ignition systems (those used since the 1980s or late '70s) do not require a {{ballast resistor}} as they are flexible enough to operate on the lower cranking voltage or the normal operating voltage.|$|E
2500|$|Unicycle <b>cranks</b> vary {{in length}} to {{accommodate}} different unicycle wheel sizes, and different unicycling disciplines. As almost all unicycles are ungeared, <b>crank</b> length {{is a major}} factor in determining how much force is transmitted to the wheel. Larger wheel diameters (26" [...] to 36") require longer <b>cranks</b> , as do disciplines such as Mountain Unicycling, Trials, Street, and Flatland. These unicycles and disciplines commonly use <b>cranks</b> lengths greater than 125mm. For indoor unicycling such as freestyle or hockey, shorter <b>cranks</b> give a smoother pedaling motion and enable tighter turns without the pedal hitting the floor. <b>Crank</b> lengths of 100mm are common, although some riders use <b>cranks</b> as short as 79mm.|$|R
2500|$|Bicycle <b>cranks</b> {{can vary}} in length to {{accommodate}} different sized riders and {{different types of}} cycling. <b>Crank</b> length is measured {{from the center of}} the pedal spindle to the center of the bottom bracket spindle or axle.

The inner portion of each wing was markedly swept forward out to approx. quarter-span, where the swept-back outer wing panels were attached. This is arrangement allowed for maximum distance between the centre of gravity and the vertical stabilizer, and placed the pilot at the centre of gravity, so that differing pilot weights had little impact on stability.|$|E

He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever to crank the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then <b>cranked</b> the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{asynchronous}} (ASY) arm <b>cranking</b> (<b>cranks</b> at 180 ° relative to each other) with synchronous (SYN) arm <b>cranking</b> (parallel <b>crank</b> setting) during the 30 s Wingate anaerobic test. Methods: Thirty-two physically active men (aged 22. 1 ± 2. 4 y) completed two Wingate tests (one ASY and one SYN) separated by 4 d in a randomized counterbalanced order. The Wingate tests were completed on a modified electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. Performance measures assessed during the two tests include peak power, mean power, minimum power, time to peak power, rate to fatigue and maximum cadence (RPMmax). Blood lactate concentration was also measured before and 5 min after the tests. Results: Peak and mean power (both absolute and relative to body weight) during SYN arm <b>cranking</b> were significantly (p < 0. 001) less than during ASY arm <b>cranking.</b> Rate to fatigue and RPMmax were also significantly (p = 0. 012) lower during SYN arm <b>cranking</b> compared with ASY arm <b>cranking.</b> No significant difference was found between test conditions for minimum power, time to peak power or blood lactate concentration. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that ASY arm <b>cranking</b> results in higher peak and mean anaerobic power compared with SYN arm <b>cranking</b> during the Wingate test. Therefore, an ASY arm <b>crank</b> configuration should be used to assess anaerobic power in most individuals although specific population groups may require further testing to determine which <b>crank</b> configuration is most suitable for the Wingate test...|$|R
