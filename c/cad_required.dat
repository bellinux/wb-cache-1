The article illustrated the use of the relatively cheap combination of a PET micro and an A3 plotter for generating floor plans, shadow casting and daylight calculation.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Radiation therapy (RT), a {{critical}} component of breast-conserving therapy for breast cancer, has been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in numerous older studies, but the risk may be lower with modern techniques. METHODS. Observed rates of cardiac events in 828 patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and RT at the University of Michigan were compared with expected rates. Relations between potential risk factors and actuarial rates of first CAD event were analyzed. RESULTS. Observed risks of cardiac events were lower than expected. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of myocardial infarction (MI) was 0. 44 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 21 – 0. 70). The SIR of MI or <b>CAD</b> <b>requiring</b> intervention was 0. 50 (95 % CI: 0. 27 – 0. 68). With a median follow-up of 6. 8 years, 12 (1. 4 %) patients had at least 1 MI on follow-up and 20 (2. 4 %) had at least 1 MI or <b>CAD</b> <b>requiring</b> intervention. Median age at first cardiac event was 75. 9 years (range, 43. 1 – 91. 5). Median interval from RT to occurrence of the first cardiac event was 3. 7 years (range, 13 days to 15. 4 years). The 10 -year cumulative incidence of MI was 1. 2 % and cumulative incidence of MI or <b>CAD</b> <b>requiring</b> intervention was 2. 7 %. On multivariate analysis, age, diabetes mellitus, active smoking, and laterality of RT were significant predictors of MI. Age and active smoking were significant predictors of MI or <b>CAD</b> <b>requiring</b> intervention. CONCLUSIONS. Patients in this series had lower risk of ischemic cardiac events than expected. Although small in absolute magnitude, patients radiated to the left side did have a statistically significant increased risk of MI. These findings support further investigation of techniques to minimize the long-term cardiac risks faced by breast cancer patients. Cancer 2007 © 2007 American Cancer Society...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{prevalence}} and significance of myocardial edema in patients with non–ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). BackgroundMost patients with NSTE-ACS undergo angiography, yet not all have obstructive coronary artery disease (<b>CAD)</b> <b>requiring</b> revascularization. Identifying patients with myocardium at risk could enhance the effectiveness of an early invasive strategy. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can demonstrate edematous myocardium subjected to ischemia but has not been used to evaluate NSTE-ACS patients. MethodsOne hundred consecutive patients with NSTE-ACS were prospectively enrolled to undergo 30 -min CMR, including T 2 -weighted edema imaging and late gadolinium enhancement before coronary angiography. Clinical management including revascularization decision-making was performed without CMR results. ResultsOf 88 adequate CMR studies, 57 (64. 8 %) showed myocardial edema. Obstructive <b>CAD</b> <b>requiring</b> revascularization was present in 87. 7 % of edema-positive patients versus 25. 8 % of edema-negative patients (p < 0. 001). By multiple logistic regression analysis after adjusting for late gadolinium enhancement, perfusion, and wall motion scores, TIMI risk score was not predictive of obstructive CAD. Conversely, an increase in T 2 score by 1 U increased the odds of subsequent coronary revascularization by 5. 70 times (95 % confidence interval: 2. 38 to 13. 62, p < 0. 001). Adjusting for peak troponin-I, patients with edema showed a higher hazard of a cardiovascular event or death within 6 months after NSTE-ACS compared with those without edema (hazard ratio: 4. 47, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 00 to 20. 03; p = 0. 050). ConclusionsIn NSTE-ACS patients, rapid CMR identifies reversibly injured myocardium due to obstructive CAD and predicts worse outcomes.

40|$|AbstractCoronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) carries {{a high risk}} of {{mortality}} in dialysis patients. End-stage renal disease is considered to increase the vulnerability of patients with atherosclerosis superimposed on artery calcification. Recently, an increasing prevalence of CAD in dialysis patients has been attributed to a lack of effective prevention and treatment. Further studies have shown that optimal therapies for CAD in dialysis patients remain neglected and unclarified. These therapies include correction of anemia, control of blood pressure, and antiplatelet therapy. Because of bleeding tendencies in dialysis patients, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy and platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors for treating <b>CAD</b> <b>require</b> more research. In addition, a meta-analysis of retrospective studies in 2012 showed that dialysis patients with CAD receiving coronary artery bypass surgery had a lower long-term mortality rate and fewer postoperative cardiac complications than those receiving percutaneous coronary angioplasty.

40|$|Cinnamyl alcohol {{dehydrogenase}} (CAD) catalyzes {{the final step}} in monolignol biosynthesis. Although plants contain numerous genes coding for CADs, {{only one or two}} CADs appear to have a primary physiological role in lignin biosynthesis. Much of this distinction appears to reside in a few key residues that permit reasonable catalytic rates on monolignal substrates. Here, several mutant proteins were generated using switchgrass wild type (WT) PviCAD 1 as a template to understand the role of some of these key residues, including a proton shuttling HL duo in the active site. Mutated proteins displayed lowered or limited activity on cinnamylaldehydes and exhibited altered kinetic properties compared to the WT enzyme, suggesting that key residues important for efficient catalysis had been identified.

Methods: The case records of patients presenting acutely with premature CAD during the period 2007 - 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Age, sex and smoking matched controls were selected from same time period. Data records were obtained for family history, alcohol, waist size, blood pressure, hypertension, blood sugar, lipid profile and presence of cutaneous markers for both groups and analyzed using statistical software. Results: 234 smokers with CAD and 122 smokers without CAD were included in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

The caspase-activated DNase (CAD) is {{the primary}} {{nuclease}} responsible for oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis. The DNA fragmentation factor (DFF) is composed of the 40 -kDa CAD (DFF 40) in complex with its cognate 45 -kDa inhibitor (inhibitor of CAD: ICAD or DFF 45). The association of ICAD with CAD not only inhibits the DNase activity but is also essential for the co-translational folding of CAD. Activation of <b>CAD</b> <b>requires</b> caspase- 3 -dependent proteolysis of ICAD. The tertiary structures of neither the inactive nor the activated DFF have been conclusively established. Whereas the inactive DFF is thought to consist of the CAD/ICAD heterodimer, activated CAD has been isolated as a large (>MDa) multimer, {{as well as a}} monomer. To establish the subunit stoichiometry of DFF and some of its structural determinants in normal and apoptotic cells, we utilized size-exclusion chromatography in combination with co-immunoprecipitation and mutagenesis techniques. Both endogenous and heterologously expressed DFF have an apparent molecular mass of 160 - 190 kDa and contain 2 CAD and 2 ICAD molecules (CAD/ICAD) 2 in HeLa cells. Although the N-terminal (CIDE-N) domain of <b>CAD</b> is not <b>required</b> for ICAD binding, it is necessary but not sufficient for ICAD homodimerization in the DFF. In contrast, the CIDE-N domain of ICAD is required for CAD/ICAD association. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), dimerization of ICAD in DFF was confirmed in live cells. In apoptotic cells, endogenous and exogenous CAD forms limited oligomers, representing the active nuclease.
