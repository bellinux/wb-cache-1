On 19 July, he was found not guilty of murder, {{attempted}} murder, and negligence, but guilty of disgraceful conduct. On 5 October 2010, he was dismissed from the military and his rank was reduced to second lieutenant, but he was not sentenced to jail. Lieutenant-Colonel Jean-Guy Perron, explaining his sentencing, described Captain Semrau as a courageous soldier and leader, and that he was [...] "probably caught between his moral values and his duties as a soldier". He also said that Captain Semrau had even more responsibility towards his duties, because he was in a leadership position : [...] "How <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> our soldiers to respect the rules of engagement if our officers don't?".|$|E
2500|$|During Sun Quan's reign, some Wu {{officials}} abused {{the system}} of bureaucracy and exploited loopholes to find fault with other. Sun He saw that this could potentially become a serious problem if officials continued to abuse the system for personal gain (e.g. taking petty revenge against colleagues), so he wrote a memorial to the imperial court urging them to take actions to discourage and eliminate such harmful practices. On one occasion, two officials, Liu Bao (劉寶) and Ding Yan (丁晏), made accusations against each other. Sun He told Ding Yan, [...] "It's hard to find competent employees in both the civil and military sectors. If everyone starts attacking each other over trivial and petty disputes, then how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to have prosperity?" [...] He then stepped in to mediate the conflict and succeeded in helping them resolve their dispute.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{when it was}} {{announced}} that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as [...] "a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show". Other media sources branded them two of [...] "the most popular characters on the soap" [...] and an [...] "iconic couple". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, [...] "It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots.".|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Place is {{sometimes}} understood as reinforcing {{personal and cultural}} identity {{in the face of}} dissipating versions of modernism or postmodernism. However, that identity can also come with a variety of cultural neuroses and manias that are inscribed on place. I consider the ways in which terrorism has become a feature of place, and how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> to see the terror of the place in the future. First, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> a relative diminishment in ‘place-making imagination’, the ability to see places as rich, ambiguous, and multi-purposed. Second, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> the terror of the place to exhibit itself as an inability {{to come to terms with}} the other. Third, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> the continuation and development of a triumphalist narrative of place, including a sense of entitlement. Fourth, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> anticipate the death or the fear of the agora, the true ‘agoraphobia’, as the public space of discourse is closed down, and the private space of patriarchally enforced agreement gains ascendancy. Fifth, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> people to regard specific places as having fixed and permanent meanings, and to try to constrain those meanings in such a way as to guarantee that permanence. Sixth, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> topophobia, not only the fear of place but also stage fright, as the expression of self on the world stage becomes more and more limited and narrowly focussed. And seventh, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> a re-assertion of memory of place, perhaps with a shifte...|$|R

2500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cao Cao's position, Yu Jin encountered {{about a dozen}} {{injured and}} naked men on the road. When he asked them what happened, they told him that they were robbed by the Qingzhou Corps (青州兵). The Qingzhou Corps was a unit in Cao Cao's forces formed by the former Yellow Turban rebels who surrendered to Cao in Qing Province (Qingzhou) in the early 190s. The furious Yu Jin said, [...] "The Qingzhou Corps are part of Lord Cao's army. How dare they become robbers!" [...] He then led his men to attack and punish them. Some of the Qingzhou soldiers escaped to Wuyin and accused Yu Jin of committing the crimes they were responsible for. When Yu Jin reached Wuyin, he immediately set up defensive fortifications around the camp instead of reporting directly to Cao Cao. His subordinates told him, [...] "The Qingzhou soldiers framed you. You should explain matters to Lord Cao as soon as possible." [...] Yu Jin replied, [...] "The enemy is still in pursuit and may reach here anytime. If we don't set up defences now, how <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to hold them off? Lord Cao is intelligent and wise. Those accusations aren't a cause for concern." [...] After the defences were set up, Yu Jin went to meet Cao Cao and explained everything. Cao Cao was pleased and he said, [...] "How dangerous {{it was for me}} when we were defeated at the Yu River (淯水). General, you're able to bring order to chaos and hold your ground against a fierce enemy, and you display unwavering loyalty. Even the famous generals of ancient times couldn't have done better than you!" [...] Yu Jin was awarded the title [...] "Marquis of Yishou Village" [...] (益壽亭侯) in recognition of his contributions.|$|E
2500|$|The great {{turning point}} in Callas's career {{occurred}} in Venice in 1949. She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas {{that she would be}} singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her [...] "I guarantee that you can.". Michael Scott's words, [...] "the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Brünnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur". Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, [...] "We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... When <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> a new edition of La traviata with [...] Gino Bechi's Violetta?" [...] After the performance, one critic wrote, [...] "Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras." [...] Franco Zeffirelli recalled, [...] "What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the enormity of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, {{who is one of the}} great coloratura sopranos of our time." ...|$|E

60|$|Rings {{detached}} {{early in}} the process of concentration, consisting of gaseous matter having extremely little power of cohesion, can have little ability to resist the disruptive forces due to imperfect balance; and, therefore, collapse into satellites. A ring of a denser kind, whether solid, liquid, or composed of small discrete masses (as Saturn's rings are now concluded to be), we can expect will be formed only near the body of a planet when it has reached so late a stage of concentration that its equatorial portions contain matters capable of easy precipitation into liquid and, finally, solid forms. Even then it can be produced only under special conditions. Gaining a rapidly-increasing preponderance as the gravitative force does during the closing stages of concentration, the centrifugal force cannot, in ordinary cases, cause the leaving behind of rings when the mass has become dense. Only where the centrifugal force has all along been very great, and remains powerful to the last, as in Saturn, <b>can</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> dense rings to be formed.|$|E
