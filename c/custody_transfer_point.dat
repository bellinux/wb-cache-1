40|$|Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) {{operate in}} a {{environment}} characterized by intermittently connected links and long, variable latency. End-to-end reliability schemes, such as TCP, perform poorly, or not at all, in this environment. Source node storage becomes a constrained resource when intermittent links have long downtimes or latency to receive acknowledgement from the destination is long. To alleviate this constraint, <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> is a proposed DTN reliability scheme using hop-by-hop reliability to enhance end-to-end reliability. A simulation study of storage usage is {{presented in this paper}} comparing endto-end reliability and <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> with three different intermittent link connectivity schedules.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how the social {{services}} are applying the sections of the law concerning <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> within foster care. More specifically the aim was to find out what circumstances are underlying the social services decision to go through with a <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> within the foster care, and to find out which difficulties and possibilities the law offers when it comes to this process. The study was based on interviews with six respondents, within the social services, who have great experiences working with these issues. The study concluded that there are several factors which affects the decision whether to implement at <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> or not, and some of these are the child’s attachment, the child’s fundamental needs and consent from the involving parties in the case. The study also concluded that some of the difficulties with the process involve a contradictory law and the lack of support to the child´s new family after the <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> has been implemented.  Some of the positive aspects with <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> within the foster care, that the study showed, includes that the child get to live with the family the child regards as his or her own, and a reduced amount of concern and stress, to the benefit of a more stable and safe environment.

We present an implementation of this architecture for the TinyOS platform targeting data collection applications.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanism proposed for enhancing reliability in delay-tolerant networks. This mechanism, which utilizes hop-by-hop transfer of reliable delivery responsibility, shares many features {{in common with}} a database transaction. By considering <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> in this light, we observe that it can cause the creation of duplicate message fragments within the network that ordinarily may pose no significant problem, but can be cause for concern if in-network processing and data fusion are employed. We also extend the DTN architecture {{with the concept of}} a transaction abort, and show how it can be used for helping to free network resources being consumed by fragments that remain after completion of a previous message transfer.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Small Volume Provers (SVPs), {{used in the}} oil and {{gas industry}} to validate the performance of <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> meters. Recently Coriolis mass flow meters have been introduced for custody transfer; while these offer reduced maintenance requirements over traditional PD and turbine meters, proving Coriolis flow meters using SVP is challenging. This paper presents SVP results for a Coriolis meter which matches or exceeds the most stringent requirements for <b>custody</b> <b>transfer.</b> This is achieved in part by using a novel signal processing technique which reduces the dominant component of the measurement noise, associated with so-called Coriolis mode vibration, with negligible loss of dynamic response. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Positive {{displacement}} flowmeters {{are very}} accurate and have high turndown. They {{can be used}} in very viscous, dirty and corrosive fluids and essentially require no straight runs of pipe for fluid flow stream conditioning though pressure drop can be an issue. They are widely used in the <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> of oils and liquid fluids (gasoline) and are applied on residential home natural gas and water metering. A diaphragm meter, with which most homes are equipped, {{is an example of a}} positive displacement meter. This type of meter is appealing in certain <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> flow applications where it is critical that the metering be functional in order for any flow to take place.|$|R

50|$|The {{principle}} of Law of Similarity is used extensively for theoretical and experimental fluid machines. With respect to calibration of flowmeters, the Law of Similarity {{is the foundation}} for flow measurement standards. To satisfy the Law of Similarity, the central facility concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the laboratory meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined {{at the time of}} calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists between the field installation and the laboratory installation of the artifact. A proper manufacturer’s experimental pattern locates sensitive regions to explore, measure and empirically adjust. The manufacturer’s recommended correlation method is a rational basis for performance prediction provided the physics do not change. For instance, the physics are different between subsonic and sonic flow. To satisfy the Law of Similarity the in situ calibration concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the calibrated meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined at the time of calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists in the “field meter installation” over the entire <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> period.|$|R

In this paper, we describe the store-and-forward and <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> concepts {{that are used in}} DTNs. Then, we present simulation results that illustrate the usefulness of the <b>custody</b> <b>transfer</b> feature, and a message ferry in improving the end-to-end message delivery ratio in a multihop scenario where link availability can be as low as 20 %. In particular, our results indicate that one can achieve a delivery ratio as high as 90 - 99 % with appropriate buffer allocations. We also provide some preliminary insights on the design factors that influence the end to end delivery ratio, e. g., the link availability patterns and buffer allocation strategies.
