25|$|At {{approximately}} 14:30 on 16 March, TEPCO {{announced that}} the storage pool, located outside the Unit 4 <b>containment</b> <b>area,</b> might be boiling. Around 20:00 JST, it was then planned to use a police water cannon to spray water on Unit 4.|$|E
25|$|Rising heat {{within the}} <b>containment</b> <b>area</b> led to {{increasing}} pressure. Electricity {{was needed for}} both the cooling water pumps and ventilation fans used to drive gases through heat exchangers within the containment. Releasing gases from the reactor is necessary if pressure becomes too high and has the benefit of cooling the reactor as water boils off, but this also means cooling water is being lost, and must be replaced if the water level is not to fall too low. If there is no damage to the fuel elements, water and water vapor from inside the reactor should be only slightly radioactive.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 14:30 TEPCO announces its {{belief that}} the fuel rod storage pool of unit 4 – which is located outside the <b>containment</b> <b>area</b> — may have begun boiling, raising the possibility that exposed rods could reach criticality. By midday NHK TV is reporting white smoke rising from the Fukushima I plant, which officials suggest is likely coming from reactor 3. Shortly afterwards all but {{a small group of}} remaining workers at the plant are placed on standby because of the radiation rising to a dangerous level of up to 1Sv/h. TEPCO temporarily suspended operations at the facility. A TEPCO press release states that workers had been withdrawn at 06:00 JST because of abnormal noises coming from one of the reactor pressure suppression chambers.

The {{objective}} of Task 5 D, {{part of the}} Productive Uses Project, was to obtain information to facilitate plan-ning and implementation of concepts for the ultimate productive use of dredged material <b>containment</b> <b>areas.</b> 2. Because of constraints on open-water disposal of dredged material, the Corps of Engineers has had to resort {{more and more to}} land disposal. Land for disposal activities is becoming scarce, and the problem becomes more acute with the selection of each new disposal area. Attention, therefore, was directed toward identifying disposal concepts that would enhance rather than degrade available land. 3. Some DMRP work units under other tasks were designed to develop guidelines to improve disposal facility operations and management procedures. Others served to develop techniques for the reclamation of potentially valuable materials in order to extend the useful life and to enhance aesthetic and environmental characteristics of dredged material <b>containment</b> <b>areas.</b> However, all sites will eventually be filled, and the total DMRP picture would have been incomplete without considering concepts for the productive uses of the resultant created land. To this end, most of the problems associated with the land use of dredged material <b>containment</b> <b>areas</b> relate to a planning rather than an engineering function. The particular research effort reported on herein was one of five aimed at assessing the economic, technical, environmental, institutional, legal, and social incentives and constraints {{for the development of a}} rational basis for site selection, ultimate land use, and the management of the created land.

[...] of coal fly ash slurry was released. The coal-fired power plant, located across the Clinch River {{from the city of}} Kingston, uses ponds to dewater the fly ash, a byproduct of coal combustion, which is then stored in wet form in dredge cells. The slurry (a mixture of fly ash and water) traveled across the Emory River and its Swan Pond embayment, on to the opposite shore, covering up to [...] of the surrounding land, damaging homes and flowing up and down stream in nearby waterways such as the Emory River and Clinch River (tributaries of the Tennessee River). It was the largest fly ash release in United States history.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] unlined {{aboveground}} ash fill, {{which was}} situated [...] above the ash pond and [...] above the Emory River winter level, [...] above sea level, contained a watery slurry of fly ash {{generated by the}} burning of finely ground coal at the steam power plant. Fly ash is the fine particulate pollutants produced by the combustion of coal, which are collected rather than allowing them to escape into the atmosphere, then mixed with water {{so they can be}} pumped into the retaining pond. Once the particulate matter settles out, it is dredged to drying cells. The dredge cell was surrounded by [...] tall earthen walls, which had twice developed leaks since 2002. Although the land surrounding the power plant is largely rural rather than residential, the spill caused a mudflow wave of water and ash that covered 12 homes, pushing one entirely off its foundation, rendering three uninhabitable, and caused some damage to 42 residential properties. It also washed out a road, ruptured a major gas line, obstructed a rail line, downed trees, broke a water main, and destroyed power lines. Though 22 residences were evacuated, nobody was reported to be injured or in need of hospitalization.
