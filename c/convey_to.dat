5|$|Early in Becket's exile, Robert {{received}} a papal censure {{for not doing}} more to support Becket. In summer 1165, Robert accompanied Gilbert Foliot, the Bishop of London, on a papal mission to King Henry, to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the king Pope Alexander's complaints about the king's behaviour. The king had been preventing his subjects from visiting or appealing to the papacy, and Alexander wished to protest against that, as well as against the king's treatment of Becket. In 1166, Becket tried to convince Robert to switch sides, writing to Robert in conciliatory tones. John of Salisbury, a supporter of Becket's, prevailed upon two French academics to write to Robert, criticising him for hypocrisy.|$|E

25|$|Although Fred would {{plead with}} Stephen and Anna Marie (the only {{children}} {{to visit their}} father while on remand) to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> Rose that he loved her, Rose never acknowledged these overtures. In response, Fred withdrew his earlier confessions to having acted alone in the murders, and instead accused his wife of almost total culpability in all the murders {{to which he had}} been charged, excluding that of Anne McFall, which he claimed had been committed by his first wife.|$|E
25|$|Translucent: The {{new media}} is still {{justified}} {{in terms of}} the old and seeks to remain faithful to the older medium's character. This form of remediation seeks “to emphasize the difference rather than erase it” (P. 46). In translucent remediation “the new medium does not want to efface itself entirely” (p.46). For instance, in regards to the CD-ROM encyclopedia Encarta, Microsoft is attempting to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the consumer that, “she has purchased not simply an Encyclopedia, but an electronic, and therefore improved, Encyclopedia” (p.46).|$|E

25|$|People with DLB may swing {{dramatically}} {{between good}} days, with high alertness and few cognitive or movement problems, and bad days, {{and the level}} of care they require thus may vary widely and unpredictably. Sharp changes in behavior {{may be due to the}} day-to-day variability of DLB, but they also may be triggered by changes in the schedule or home environment, or by physical problems, such as constipation, dehydration, bladder infection, injuries from falls, and other problems they may not be able to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> caregivers. Potential physical problems always should be taken into consideration when an individual with DLB becomes agitated.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch {{could have}} chosen between Julius Caesar and Cornelius Scipio {{for a great}} Roman hero to write about and decided on Scipio. Caesar's life did not {{represent}} Christian values {{that he wanted to}} <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the reader. Cornelius Scipio, the hero of the poem, received the agnomen (nickname) of Africanus for defeating Hannibal and the Carthaginians. The title for the poem Africa is based on the nickname of the hero. The adopted grandson of the poem's hero is Scipio Aemilianus, also known as Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus – receiving his like agnomen for destroying Carthage {{at the end of the}} Third Punic War.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} Shia scholar Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei {{provides a}} counter argument to this belief. He states {{that even if}} Ali’s Quran incorporated additions that {{are not part of}} the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the Messenger of God was commanded to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the crisis, Turkey had {{repeatedly}} {{stated that it}} would be upset if the Jupiter missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, who was also Foreign Minister ad interim, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in Apulia as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, Ettore Bernabei, the general manager of RAI-TV, to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting. Unknown to the Soviets, the US regarded the Jupiter missiles as obsolescent and already supplanted by the Polaris nuclear ballistic submarine missiles.|$|E
25|$|His {{experiences}} during World War I undeniably left a deep {{impression on}} his psyche. The reality {{of war on}} the mind is especially explored in his novel Doberdob. Voranc wished to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> his reader the realism {{of the situation in}} which his characters lived and there is little that is sentimental about his depictions. Voranc preferred to write about the impoverished peasant and industrial working class against the impressionistic backdrop of a land that sometimes colludes against the peasant. His socialist leanings are key to understanding his later work. During the 1930s, while living away from his homeland, he became more aware of international socialism, although he adapted realism in his work to suit Slovene sensibilities.|$|E
25|$|The People's State Bank {{was cast}} in the {{commercial}} style of architecture and has detailing heavily influenced by Classical Revival, a popular style for bank buildings at the time. The building, a one-story structure, stands on a concrete foundation with 12 inch (30cm) thick walls, and a full basement. The Classical detailing is emphasized {{through the use of}} brick, glass, and concrete throughout the building. The simple design exhibits several Classical Revival influences, among them: its masonry construction, giving it a sturdy appearance, its symmetry, the brick divides on the wall which resemble pilasters, and the semi circular fanlights on the above the east and west facade windows. The size of the interior lobby further emphasized the feeling of solidity, which banks wished to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> their customers.|$|E
50|$|Blood is <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> {{the wall}} of the yolk sac by the {{primitive}} aorta, and after circulating through a wide-meshed capillary plexus, is returned by the vitelline veins to the tubular heart of the embryo. This constitutes the vitelline circulation, and by means of it nutritive material is absorbed from the yolk sac and <b>conveyed</b> <b>to</b> the embryo.|$|R

25|$|Hans Scholl, Alexander Schmorell, Christoph Probst, and Willi Graf were medical students. Their {{studies were}} {{regularly}} interrupted by terms of compulsory service as student {{soldiers in the}} Wehrmacht medical corps on the Eastern Front. Their experience during this time had {{a major impact on}} their thinking, and it also motivated their resistance, because it led to their disillusionment with the Nazi regime. Alexander Schmorell, who was born in Orenburg and raised by Russian nurses, spoke perfect Russian, which allowed him to have direct contact and communication with the local Russian population and their plight. This Russian insight proved invaluable during their time there, and he could <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> his fellow White Rose members what was not understood or even heard by other Germans coming from the Eastern front.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} lack of {{reliable}} basic flight instrument readings, constant contradictory warnings from the aircraft's flight computer (some of which were valid and some of which were not) and believing that they were at a safe altitude, 58-year-old Captain Eric Schreiber Ladrón de Guevara, a veteran pilot who had logged almost 22,000 flight hours, and 42-year-old First Officer David Fernández Revoredo, who had logged almost 8,000 flight hours, decided to begin descent for the approach to the airport. Since the flight was at night over water, no visual references could be made to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the pilots their true altitude or aid their descent. As a consequence of the pilots' inability to precisely monitor the aircraft's airspeed or vertical speed, they experienced multiple stalls, resulting in rapid loss of altitude with no corresponding change on the altimeter. While the altimeter indicated an altitude of approximately 9,700 feet, the aircraft's true altitude was in fact much lower.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} and still {{by the end}} of the war, {{considerable}} controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if anyone, was to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to review all the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a 'staff appreciation' of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I 'read it with increasing wonder till at last I felt it my duty to <b>convey</b> <b>to</b> the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict'. The account was classified as 'secret' and yet another version was commissioned, the 'Admiralty Narrative'. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty's, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.|$|E
