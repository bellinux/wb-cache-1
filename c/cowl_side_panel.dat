5000|$|The all-metal, {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{was basically}} oval in cross-section, changing to a tapered, semi-triangular oval behind the cockpit canopy, {{with a maximum}} depth of 1.35 m (4 ft 5 in). An unusual feature of the Ki-61 was that the engine bearers were constructed {{as an integral part}} of the forward fuselage, with the <b>cowling</b> <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> being fixed. For servicing or replacement, only the top and bottom cowling panels could be removed. A tapered, rectangular supercharger air intake was located on the port-side cowling. Behind the engine bulkhead were the ammunition boxes feeding a pair of synchronized 12.7 mm (.50 in) Ho-103 machine guns which were set in a [...] "staggered" [...] configuration (the port weapon slightly further forward than that to starboard) in a bay just above and behind the engine. The breeches partly projected into the cockpit, above the instrument panel. The Ho-103 was a light weapon for its caliber (around 23 kg/51 lb) and fired a light shell, but this was compensated for by its rapid rate of fire. The ammunition capacity was limited, having only around 250 rounds for each weapon. A self-sealing fuel tank with a capacity of 165 L (44 US gal) was located behind the pilot's seat. The windshield was armored and there was a 13 mm (.51 in) armor plate behind the pilot. The radiator and oil cooler for the liquid-cooled engine were in a ventral location below the fuselage and wing trailing edge, covered by a rectangular section fairing with a large, adjustable exit flap.|$|R

The <b>side</b> <b>panel</b> {{featured}} an access panel so the rider could {{turn on the}} choke without removing the <b>side</b> <b>panel.</b> Due to the <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> direct engine cooling could not work, so the flywheel gained cooling fins.|$|R
50|$|The body <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> are 3 mm thick, and {{are carried}} by {{columnar}} sections, in between which {{parts of the}} cabling channels are laid. The <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> encompass the area from {{the back end of}} the driver's cabs up {{to the beginning of the}} sloped roof section, which is part of the removable roof sections. They end toward the top in a hollow section, which then takes on the roof sections. The <b>side</b> <b>panels</b> are connected together by two welded wicket/belt made up of steel plate.|$|R
50|$|The Main Altar of the Kastulus Minster is the {{principal}} masterpiece of the wood sculptor Hans Leinberger of Landshut.
