25|$|Rapid {{access to}} {{all parts of the}} border line was {{required}} to ensure a quick response to escape attempts. This was initially a problem for the East Germans, as few patrol roads existed along the border in its early years.

500|$|Next to the Kolonnenweg {{was one of}} {{the control}} strips (Kontrollstreifen), a line of bare earth running {{parallel}} to the fences along almost {{the entire length of the}} border. There were two control strips, both located on the inward-facing sides of the fences. The secondary [...] "K2" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran alongside the signal fence, while the primary [...] "K6" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran along the inside of the fence or wall. In places where the border was vulnerable to escape attempts, the <b>control</b> <b>strip</b> was illuminated at night by high-intensity floodlights (Beleuchtungsanlage), which were also used at points where rivers and streams crossed the border.|$|E
2500|$|In the West, the <b>control</b> <b>strip</b> {{became known}} as the [...] "death strip" [...] (Todesstreifen) because of the shoot-to-kill orders given to the border guards. The East Germans {{preferred}} to call it by the more euphemistic name of the [...] "action strip" [...] (Handlungsstreifen). It was also nicknamed the Pieck-Allee ("Pieck Avenue") after East Germany's president Wilhelm Pieck (1949–60).|$|E
2500|$|The Soviets had {{pioneered the}} use of control strips on {{the borders of the}} USSR.

2500|$|The Kolonnenweg usually ran {{between the}} <b>control</b> <b>strip</b> (on the border side) and the watchtowers (on the inland side). Around [...] of patrol roads were built along the border, of which around [...] was fully paved. In {{addition}} to the main Kolonnenweg, there were numerous short access roads built through forests and fields in the Schutzstreifen. Constructed from the same perforated concrete as the Kolonnenweg, these gave the border guards rapid access from the hinterland to the border line. Some civilians were permitted to use these access roads for forestry or farm work, though only with special permission.|$|E
2500|$|The signal or [...] "hinterland" [...] fence (Signalzaun) was {{the first}} of the border fences, {{dividing}} the Sperrzone from the more heavily guarded protective strip (Schutzstreifen) adjoining the actual border. Its purpose was to provide the guards with an early warning of an escape attempt. The fence itself was not a particularly formidable obstacle, standing only [...] high. At the top, middle and bottom, rows of electrified barbed wire strands were attached to insulators. Cutting the wires or pulling them out of place resulted in an alarm being activated, alerting the guards to a possible breach of the fence. In practice, though, the border guards found that the fence frequently malfunctioned. The signal fence also had a [...] <b>control</b> <b>strip</b> on its eastern side. The fence was built on open high ground wherever possible, to ensure that intruders would be silhouetted against the sky and thus be more easily spotted. By mid-1989, [...] of signal fencing had been constructed along the border.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} control strips, both {{located on the}} inward-facing {{sides of the border}} fences. The {{secondary}} [...] "K2" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran alongside the signal fence {{to the rear of the}} Schutzstreifen, while the primary [...] "K6" [...] strip, [...] wide, ran along the inside of the border fence or wall. The K6 strip ran almost uninterrupted along the entire length of the border. Where it ran across roads, the road surface would be ripped up to make way for the control strip; where the border ran along streams and rivers, the strip was constructed parallel with the waterways. In places where the border was prone to escape attempts, the <b>control</b> <b>strip</b> was illuminated at night by high-intensity floodlights (Beleuchtungsanlage) installed on concrete poles, which were also used at vulnerable points such as rivers and streams crossing the border. The strip was patrolled several times a day by guards, who would inspect it carefully for signs of intrusion.|$|E

2500|$|Beyond {{the signal}} fence was the [...] "protective strip" [...] (Schutzstreifen). It was brightly lit by {{floodlights}} {{in many places}} to reduce an escapee's chances of using the cover of darkness. Guard towers, bunkers and dog runs were positioned at frequent intervals to keep a round-the-clock watch over the strip. Crossing the Schutzstreifen, the escapee would next reach the floodlit <b>control</b> <b>strip,</b> often called the [...] "death strip" [...] in the West. Tripwire-activated flare launchers were situated at various points to help the border guards pinpoint the location of an escape attempt. The last and most formidable obstacle was the outer fencing. In some places there were multiple parallel rows of fences, each up to several metres high, with minefields in between. The fences were not electrified but were booby-trapped with directional anti-personnel mines at intervals of , each {{one of which was}} capable of killing at a range of up to [...] Finally, the escapee had to cross whatever natural obstacles were on the western side of the border fence as well as traversing a strip of cleared ground that was up to 500 meters (1640ft) wide. While crossing this outer strip, the escapee would appear in clear view and shooting range of the border guards before reaching the safety of West German territory.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the tolerance development against the relaxant effect of nitric oxide donating drug isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle. METHODS: Relaxation responses of ISDN, and electrical field stimulation (EFS) were obtained {{before and after}} tolerance induction by ISDN incubation. RESULTS: ISDN (10 - 7 - 10 - 4 mol/L) and SNP (10 - 8 - 10 - 4 mol/L) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation on the basal tonus of the isolated rabbit IAS strips. After a period of 2 h incubation of the 6 x 10 - 4 mol/L ISDN the relaxation effects of ISDN and SNP did not change compared to <b>control</b> <b>strips.</b> EFS evoked frequency-dependent relaxation in internal anal sphincter smooth muscle and Emax obtained from <b>control</b> <b>strips</b> were not changed in ISDN tolerance-inducing condition.

40|$|The {{long term}} effect of either a salivary or a serum {{pellicle}} on Candida albicans biofilm formation on denture acrylic surfaces was investigated both by quantifying the ATP (adenosine triphosphate) {{content of the}} resultant biofilms and by scanning electron microscopy. When the biofilm formation on saliva-coated acrylic strips was examined, the yeasts initially colonised this surface at a slower rate than the controls although with increasing incubation time, at 72 h, the ATP content was almost ten-fold higher than the protein-free <b>control</b> <b>strips.</b> Ultrastructural studies revealed this {{to be due to}} cell aggregation and hyphal emergence, phenomena not observed in the controls. As compared with the <b>control</b> <b>strips,</b> biofilm activity of the serum-coated strips was almost 100 -fold greater within 48 h incubation, and scanning electron microscopy revealed multilayer blastospore-blastospore co-adhesion, germ tube, hyphal and pseudohyphal emergence and blastospore-hyphal coadherence. Further immunocytochemical observation revealed that concanavalin-A binding material and fibronectin were involved in biofilm formation on both saliva and serum coated specimens and, in addition, mannan-binding protein and protein-A binding material also contributed to the biofilm formation on serum coated specimens. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Controlling</b> cold <b>strip</b> {{profile is}} a {{difficult}} and significant problem {{has been found in}} industry during thin strip rolling. At present choosing the new type of strip rolling mill is the one of main methods to <b>control</b> the <b>strip</b> shape quality in cold rolling. The influences of rolling process parameters such as the work roll cross angle and work roll shifting on the strip shape and profile of thin strip are recognised throughout this study. The results show that the roll crossing and shifting is efficient way to <b>control</b> the <b>strip</b> shape. The increase of the work roll crossing angle would lead to improve the strip profile significantly by decreasing the exit strip crown and edge drop. The strip profile would be enhanced if the axial roll shifting was increased. Moreover, the total rolling force was analysed in detail by changing the roll cross angle and axial shifting roll.
