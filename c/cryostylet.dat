40|$|A {{method of}} cyclocryocautery, using the Kelman <b>Cryostylet,</b> is described. On rabbit eyes this brings about a {{statistically}} significant lowering of intraocular pressure and reduction of aqueous flow over an observation period of three months. The effects upon the facility of outflow are variable. Side effects are minimal. The intraocular temperature was measured at various points during and after cryocautery. An applicator temperature of about - 40 Â° C was found sufficient for the desired result with minimal side effects. Angiocryocautery of one or both long posterior ciliary vessels resulted only in a temporary reduction of intraocular pressure, as permanent obliteration of these vessels was not possible by this method. In a small series of eight patients with primary and secondary glaucomas, the procedure described was effective in six cases. Possible indications in other forms of glaucoma are discussed...|$|E
