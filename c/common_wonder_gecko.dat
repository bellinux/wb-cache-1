5000|$|In April 2013, Energy Micro {{announced}} EFM32 <b>Wonder</b> <b>Gecko</b> MCU family (EFM32WG series) {{based on}} ARM Cortex-M4F.|$|R
50|$|The EFM32 family {{consists}} {{of a number of}} sub-families, ranging from the EFM32 Zero Gecko, based on an ARM Cortex-M0+, to the higher performing EFM32 Giant <b>Gecko</b> and <b>Wonder</b> <b>Gecko,</b> based on Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 respectively. EFM32 technology is also the foundation for EFR32 Wireless Geckos, a portfolio of Sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz wireless system on a chip (SoC) devices.|$|R
50|$|Teratoscincus is a genus of geckos {{commonly}} referred to as <b>wonder</b> <b>geckos</b> or frog-eyed geckos; it is the only genus within the subfamily Teratoscincinae. Species in the genus Teratoscincus are found from the Arabian Peninsula in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Oman, west across southern Asia in Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, north to Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to Mongolia and China. The genus consists of six species.|$|R
50|$|ADC sensing {{applications}} (temperature): In {{a demonstration}} with the <b>Wonder</b> <b>Gecko</b> MCU {{and a standard}} temperature thermistor, setting the ADC to sample the thermistor every second (@1 Hz rate) equates to 1.3 uA average current. In the real world, this would equate to a 220 mA-hr CR2032 coin cell battery lasting for close to 20 years. This same application could be implemented with LESENSE and preset thresholds, instead of using regular time interval ADC samples. In the case of LESENSE and irregular triggers, a threshold trigger rate of 1 Hz would still produce average current of 1.5 uA, which equates to 16.85-year battery life.|$|R
5000|$|The key of {{my heart}} written by Juan Luis Guerra is a Latin pop song from 2007, but {{with a focus on}} decades of the 50th.Though the song is {{primarily}} written in Spanish, several parts of the lyrics are written in English. In the song, a man meets his match maker online even they do not have too much in <b>common</b> and <b>wonders</b> what he should do when he meets her thus opening [...] "the key to his heart".|$|R
60|$|She {{stopped at}} this cabin {{for a little}} time to rest, and to wait for some other friends and members of her {{household}} from the palace in Exeter to join her. Those friends were to wait until they found that the queen succeeded in making her escape, and then they were to follow, each in a different way, and all assuming such disguises as would most effectually help to conceal them. There was one of the party whom it must have been somewhat difficult to disguise. It was a dwarf, named Geoffrey Hudson, who {{had been a long time}} in the service of Henrietta as a personal attendant and messenger. It was the fancy of queens and princesses in those days to have such personages in their train. The oddity of the idea pleased them, and the smaller the dimensions of such a servitor, the greater was his value. In modern times all this is changed. Tall footmen now, in the families of the great, receive salaries in proportion to the number of inches in their stature, and the dwarfs go to the museums, to be exhibited, for a price, to the <b>common</b> <b>wonder</b> of mankind.|$|R
60|$|Istra {{had gone}} up to her room to sleep, bidding Mr. Wrenn do {{likewise}} and avoid the wrong bunch at the Caravanserai; for besides the wrong bunch of Interesting People there were, she explained, a right bunch, of working artists. But {{he wanted to get}} some new clothes, to replace his rain-wrinkled ready-mades. He was tottering through the <b>common</b> room, <b>wondering</b> whether he could find a clothing-shop in Aengusmere, when a shrill gurgle from a wing-chair by the rough-brick fireplace halted him.|$|R
40|$|Legal comparatists should wonder {{more about}} the {{theoretical}} assumptions of their studies, that is epistemology, the scientific knowledge of comparative law as opposed to <b>common</b> sense. <b>Wondering</b> what comparative law means, {{and what kind of}} knowledge is necessary to perform comparative studies, implies looking outside the legal context. The fuzzy logic and the fuzzy approach here explained arise from two considerations. Firstly, legal comparatists have not provided much information regarding classifications. Secondly, progress made by scholars of other disciplines may be useful for anyone concerned with this topic...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; but {{the field}} of usefulness; but what an old fool I am, after all my resolutions not to be ambitious for that boy; to be set a-going by {{such a thing as}} this! Still Norman is {{something}} out of the <b>common</b> way. I <b>wonder</b> what Spencer thinks of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, indeed," [...] {{replied the}} other, with a stately simper, [...] "there {{will be some}} {{satisfaction}} in looking on now, and I think it was rather a pity {{they should have been}} obliged to part. Young folks in their situation should be excused complying with the <b>common</b> forms. I <b>wonder</b> my son did not propose it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} wife, {{but when they}} got into their little {{apartment}} she cast an eye, opened to its meanness and narrowness, over the <b>common</b> belongings, and <b>wondered</b> if he would ask himself whether this was her real life. But she did not speak, though she was apt to speak out most things that she thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "True enough. The fellow {{would face}} the devil, at my side, and I don't {{see why he}} should {{hesitate}} to face the king. I sometimes call him Lady Oakes, Sir Wycherly, for he appears to {{think he has a}} right of dower, or to some other lawyer-like claim on my estate; and as for the fleet, he always speaks of that, as if we commanded it in <b>common.</b> I <b>wonder</b> how Bluewater tolerates the blackguard; for he never scruples to allude to him as under our orders! If any thing should befal me, Dick and David would have a civil war for the succession, hey! Atwood?" ...|$|R
50|$|Diego de Rosales is {{also known}} to have written a chronicle about the Society of Jesus in Chile, which was called Conquista Espiritual del reino de Chile. It {{was a series of}} biographies of the main missionaries of the order, {{combined}} with the descriptions of their personalities with tales of miracles, appearances and all sorts of <b>wonders</b> <b>common</b> in the minds and documents of the time. Unfortunately, this manuscript has only survived in part.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Le Cordon Bleu, Von Der Pool worked with many notable chefs, {{including}} Wolfgang Puck and Alice Waters. Von Der Pool has also {{worked as a}} personal chef for many prominent celebrities, like Patti Labelle, <b>Common,</b> Stevie <b>Wonder,</b> Venus and Serena Williams (Venus Williams wrote the forward for her cookbook Eat Yourself Sexy.) For three years, Von Der Pool worked exclusively for the sisters, teasingly claiming, “I ate, drank, and slept Serena and Venus” during her Miami New Times interview in 2015. Von Der Pool has also catered many high-profile events with her catering company, Von Der Pool Gourmet and Healthy Living Services. Von Der Pool has catered The Oscars, Grammy’s, BET Honors, The Espy’s, MTV Music Awards, The Congressional Black Caucus, Screen Actor Guild Awards, Olympics, Wimbledon and many others.|$|R
60|$|October 15.--My noble guests departed, pleased I believe {{with their}} visit. I {{have had to}} thank Lord Bathurst for former kindness. I respect him too, as one who being far from rich, has on the late {{occasion}} preferred political consistency to a love of office and its emoluments. He seems to expect no opposition of a formal kind this next session. What is wonderful, no young man of talents seems to spring up in the House of <b>Commons.</b> I <b>wonder</b> what comes of all the clever lads whom we see at college. The fruit apparently does not ripen as formerly. Lord Castlereagh remained with us. I bestowed a little advice on him. He is a warm-hearted young fellow, {{with some of the}} fashionable affectations of the age about him, but with good feelings and an inclination to come forward.|$|R
60|$|But I did see {{her again}} many times that winter; for not long after, as I passed down a certain street near my winter quarters, I came upon a flock of girls, eating their luncheon as they walked to and fro on the sunny side,--pretty, merry creatures, all {{laughing}} and chattering at once, as they tossed apples from hand to hand, munched candy, or compared cookies. I went slowly, to enjoy the sight, as I do when I meet a party of sparrows on the <b>Common,</b> and was <b>wondering</b> what would become of so many budding women, when, all of a sudden, I saw my little school-girl.|$|R
6000|$|A bright day smiled upon my enterprise, and at ten I {{reported}} {{myself to}} my General, received last instructions and {{no end of}} the sympathetic encouragement which women give, in look, touch, and tone more effectually than in words. The {{next step was to}} get a free pass to Washington, for I'd no desire to waste my substance on railroad companies when [...] "the boys" [...] needed even a spinster's mite. A friend of mine had procured such a pass, and I was bent on doing likewise, though I had to face the president of the railroad to accomplish it. I'm a bashful individual, though I can't get any one to believe it; so it cost me a great effort to poke about the Worcester depot till the right door appeared, then walk into a room containing several gentlemen, and blunder out my request in a high state of stammer and blush. Nothing could have been more courteous than this dreaded President, but it was evident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had asked for the nose off his respectable face. He referred me to the Governor at the State House, and I backed out, leaving him no doubt to regret that such mild maniacs were left at large. Here was a Scylla and Charybdis business: as if a President wasn't trying enough, without the Governor of Massachusetts and the hub of the hub piled on top of that. [...] "I never can do it," [...] thought I. [...] "Tom will hoot at you if you don't," [...] whispered the inconvenient little voice that is always goading people to the performance of disagreeable duties, and always appeals to the most effective agent to produce the proper result. The idea of allowing any boy that ever wore a felt basin and a shoddy jacket with a microscopic tail, to crow over me, was preposterous, so giving myself a mental slap for such faint-heartedness, I streamed away across the <b>Common,</b> <b>wondering</b> if I ought to say [...] "your Honor," [...] or simply [...] "Sir," [...] and decided upon the latter, fortifying myself with recollections of an evening in a charming green library, where I beheld the Governor placidly consuming oysters, and laughing as if Massachusetts was a myth, and he had no heavier burden on his shoulders than his host's handsome hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "What a hot evening!" [...] I cried, {{throwing}} {{open the}} lattice; for, indeed, I had seldom felt so feverish. Hearing a step ascending the <b>common</b> stair, I <b>wondered</b> whether the [...] "locataire," [...] now mounting to his apartments, were as unsettled {{in mind and}} condition as I was, or whether {{he lived in the}} calm of certain resources, and in the freedom of unfettered feelings. What! was he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in inaudible thought? He had actually knocked at the door--at MY door; a smart, prompt rap; and, almost before I could invite him in, he was over the threshold, and had closed the door behind him.|$|R
60|$|This {{atmosphere}} of terror, surrounding, as it did, {{a man of}} God of spotless character and orthodoxy, was a <b>common</b> cause of <b>wonder</b> and subject of inquiry among the few strangers who were led by chance or business into that unknown, outlying country. But many even {{of the people of}} the parish were ignorant of the strange events which had marked the first year of Mr. Soulis's ministrations; and among those who were better informed, some were naturally reticent, and others shy of that particular topic. Now and again, only, one of the older folk would warm into courage over his third tumbler, and recount the cause of the minister's strange looks and solitary life.|$|R
6000|$|Thither, in {{the course}} of time--for it was not far distant--the baby Maggot {{naturally}} trended; proceeding on the principle of [...] "short stages and long rests." [...] Never in his life--so he thought--had he seen such bright and beautiful flowers, such green grass, and such lovely yellow sand, as that which appeared here and there at the mouths of the holes and old shafts, or such a delicious balmy and sweet-scented breeze as that which came off the Atlantic and swept across the <b>common.</b> No <b>wonder</b> that his eyes drank in the beautiful sights, for they had seen little of earth hitherto, save the four walls of his father's cottage and the dead garden wall in front of it; no wonder that his nostrils dilated to receive the sweet odours, for they had up to that date lived upon air which had to cross a noisome and stagnant pool of filth before it entered his father's dwelling; and no wonder that his ears thrilled to hear the carol of the birds, for they had previously been accustomed chiefly to the voices of poultry and pigs, and to the caterwauling of the [...] "chet." ...|$|R
60|$|Elinor was not inclined, after {{a little}} observation, to {{give him credit for}} being so {{genuinely}} and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear. His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was the desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too <b>common</b> to be <b>wondered</b> at; but the means, however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife.|$|R
60|$|Though {{faithfully}} {{and even}} affectionately attached to Alida, her servant had {{many of the}} qualifications of an European domestic. Trained in all the ruses of his profession, he was of that school which believes civilization is to be measured by artifice; and success {{lost some of its}} value, when it had been effected by the vulgar machinery of truth and <b>common</b> sense. No <b>wonder</b> then the retainer entered into the views of the Alderman, with more than a usual relish for the duty. He heard the cracking of the dried twigs beneath the footstep of him who followed; and in order that there might be no chance of missing the desired interview, the valet began to hum a French air, in so loud a key, as to be certain the sounds would reach any ear that was nigh. The twigs snapped more rapidly, the footsteps seemed nearer, and then the hero of the India-shawl sprang {{to the side of the}} expecting François.|$|R
50|$|The treaty {{established}} national unity, the end {{of hostilities}} between the provinces, the withdrawal of military forces from Buenos Aires, a general amnesty for politically persecuted people, and the free navigability of the rivers Paraná and Uruguay by the signatories. It also called for deputies sent by them to be gathered in a congress in San Lorenzo, Santa Fe, 60 days afterwards, to decide on a federalist form of government. It noticeably excluded José Gervasio Artigas, former leader of the federalist Free Peoples' League, who had recently been defeated in the Battle of Tacuarembó (Eastern Bank, present-day Uruguay) by the Brazilian-Portuguese Empire. Artigas, who had been fighting along Santa Fe and Entre Ríos against the centralist government in Buenos Aires, denounced the pact as a treason {{on the part of}} his allies. López wrote back to him explaining that the treaty was for the <b>common</b> good, and <b>wondering</b> whether Artigas was aware of the situation in the provinces.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>common</b> to <b>wonder</b> why Vasco da Gama was {{overlooked}} for the position. Gama {{was available}} and, by royal letter, he {{was entitled to}} a say in Indies matters, so why wasn't he chosen for viceroy? In effect, he was just beaten to the prize. Like Almeida, Gama {{was connected to the}} opposition party, Santiago, etc., but had been too slow to switch over to the king's party and did not promise the king what he wanted to hear. Moreover, Almeida was of higher blood and patronizing the mighty Almeidas promised bigger political returns for the king than the lowly Gamas. More pertinently, Gama's judgment was also questioned in whispers through the court. The 4th Armada that Vasco da Gama had commanded to India in 1502 had not been a success. He had failed to bring the Zamorin to terms and, more egregiously, the coastal patrol he left behind, under his uncle Vicente Sodré, had nearly cost the Portuguese their position in India. While the fault should be properly assigned to the Sodré brothers for dereliction of duty, there was a sense in the royal court that the patrol's failure was at least partly Gama's fault. He had insisted on the appointment of the Sodrés, he was their familiar and their superior, and could not have been wholly ignorant of their plans. Finally, Gama was a bit distracted - he was still trying to secure his hold on the granted town of Sines, and pestering the king to no end about it, with the result that Gama was not, at that moment, particularly welcome in Manuel's court.|$|R
40|$|Both {{science and}} {{religion}} claim descent from wonder. In {{the first part of}} this essay, I analyze these paths of descent and use this <b>common</b> origin from <b>wonder</b> to model how {{science and religion}} could creatively act in concert. In the second portion of this essay, I try to show how new concepts of evolution coming from developmental biology and symbiosis research strengthen the links between science and religion. These concepts place the competitive model of evolution within a larger non-competitive, and even cooperative, framework. I use embryological models to discuss how new things are generated by interactions between prior entities that are different from one another yet sharing underlying similarity. In the third portion of the essay, I document the need for concerted action of science with religion in the conflicts and alliances between three great centers of social power: science, religion, and corporate interest. Recent data has shown the immediate need for strong alliances between science and religion in preserving wonder and life as we know it...|$|R
6000|$|Those wretched poetitos, who got praise, [...] By writing most confounded loyal plays, [...] With viler coarser jests, than at Bear-garden, [...] And silly Grub-street songs, {{worse than}} Tom Farthing; [...] If any noble patriot did excel, [...] His own and country's rights {{defending}} well, [...] These yelping curs were straight 'looed on to bark, [...] On the deserving man {{to set a}} mark; [...] Those abject fawning parasites and knaves. [...] Since they were such, would have all others slaves. [...] 'Twas precious loyalty, that was thought fit [...] To atone for want of honesty and wit; [...] No <b>wonder</b> <b>common</b> sense was all cried down, [...] And noise and nonsense swaggered through the town; [...] Our author then opprest would have you know it. [...] Was silenced for a non-conformist poet; [...] Now, sirs, since common sence has won the day, [...] Be kind to this as to his last year's play; [...] His friends stood firmly to him, when distressed, [...] He hopes the number is not now decreast. [...] He found esteem from those he valued most; [...] Proud of his friends, he of his foes could boast.|$|R
6000|$|As to that {{argument}} used for repealing the Test, {{that it will}} unite all Protestants against the <b>common</b> enemy, I <b>wonder</b> by what figure those gentlemen speak who are pleased to advance it: Suppose {{in order to increase}} the friendship between you and me, a law should pass that I must have half your estate; do you think that would much advance the union between us? Or, suppose I share my fortune equally between my own children, and a stranger whom I take into my protection; will that be a method to unite them? Tis an odd way of uniting parties, to deprive a majority of part of their ancient right, by conferring it on a faction who had never any right at all, and therefore cannot be said to suffer any loss or injury if it be refused them. Neither is it very clear, how far some people may stretch the term of common enemy. How many are there of those that call themselves Protestants, who look upon our worship to be idolatrous {{as well as that of}} the Papists, and with great charity put Prelacy and Popery together, as terms convertible? ...|$|R
40|$|Few {{issues are}} as {{troublesome}} {{as the problem}} of technology. On the level of <b>common</b> opinion, people <b>wonder</b> whether our consumptive culture will destroy the ecosystem necessary to sustain human life, whether the proliferation of biological and nuclear weapons threatens the existence of liberal democracies, and whether human cloning {{is consistent with the}} goodness of existence. Thinkers see matters of permanent significance in these occasional issues. Critics from a somewhat leftist perspective worry that the advance of technology turns human beings into anonymous cogs {{in the hands of a}} dehumanizing capitalist despotism. 1 Critics from a culturally conservative (whether religious, romantic, or existentialist) perspective think that technology destroys the aesthetic, spiritual, and moral horizon necessary for flourishing human life. 2 All concerned fear that the spread of technology brings with it an unstated but inescapable predisposition to life or being. Although we risk distortion in the name of simplicity, the technological attitude views the natural world as something to be brought under human control, and it discourages thinking about the ends served by human control. Technological people do not recognize beauty, revere a Creator, or recognize their enslavement to a mere means of production because they are busy trying to find ways to make the future brighter by escaping tradition and controlling nature...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} I have known another man whose motives were so entirely pure, so entirely unmixed with any {{personal}} calculation, whether of ambition, of prudence or of vanity. He caught up into his imagination the public gain as other men their private gain. For {{much of his life}} he had seemed, though a good soldier and a good shot, and a good rider to hounds, to care deeply for nothing but religion, and this religion, so curiously lacking in denominational limits, concerned itself alone with the communion of the soul with God. Such men, before some great decision, will sometimes give to the analysis of their own motive the energy that other men give to the examination of the circumstances wherein they act, and it is often those who attain in this way to purity of motive who act most wisely at moments of great crisis. It is as though they sank a well through the soil where our habits have been built, and where our hopes take root and are again uprooted, to the lasting rock and to the living stream. They are those for whom Tennyson claimed the strength of ten, and the <b>common</b> and clever <b>wonder</b> at their simplicity and at a triumph that has always an air of miracle about it.|$|R
40|$|The 1990 s {{have been}} called a “lost decade ” for Japan. Certainly it was {{a period in which}} the country seemed to {{flounder}} without a clear, long-term strategic vision, scrambling to cope with the long recession that followed the burst of the bubble economy and with the various problems that then came percolating to the surface. In the political sphere, there was a succession of party realignments, changes of government, and reforms of the administrative setup, but none of them amounted to the real reform that people had hoped for. The current decade may be seen as just the next act in the longer drama of Japan’s post–World War II history. Half a century since the war’s end, the cheery—and sometimes euphoric—first act ended. The second act has begun on a gloomy note. A whole series of “reforms ” have been undertaken on an emergency or ad hoc basis to deal with the changing conditions of the moment. The January 2001 overhaul of the ministries and agencies of the central government, however, has been seen by many as yet another supposed reform that lacks real substance. And the National Public Service Ethics Law, adopted after scandals sullied the reputation of the bureaucracy, is viewed with even greater skepticism. The background to each of these reform efforts, and the cool reception they have received, is similar. The media makes a great commotion over a problem without digging beneath the surface to uncover the deeper story. The ruling parties, which lack a solid base for their position in power, and the opposition parties, which lack a sense of direction, are swayed by the media uproar and cobble together a compromise set of measures designed more for show than for content. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy does its best to maintain the status quo. This—if I may offer my own media-style sketch—seems to be the <b>common</b> pattern. One <b>wonders</b> if the administrative setup will in fact be improved through this kind of repeated patching. But one ca...|$|R
