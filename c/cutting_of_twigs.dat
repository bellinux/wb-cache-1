40|$|We experimented {{the cutting}} ability and the {{finishing}} state <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> surface profile according to three type teeth of electric circular saw used at present for artificial green pruning operation. The experimental factors are Saw Type (tipped saw, original saw, filed saw), Size <b>of</b> <b>Twig</b> (8 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm), Cutting Speed (fast, slow), Species <b>of</b> <b>Twig</b> (Sugi, Hinoki), Cutting Angle (90 °, 45 °), and Moisture Condition <b>of</b> <b>twig</b> (dry, wet, live). We investigated these factors {{according to the}} experimental designs of orthogonal array L_ (3 _). The results are as follows; we can make cutting time shorter on cutting a twig "fast" and perpendicullarly to longitudinal direction <b>of</b> a <b>twig,</b> and save cutting energy with a thin edge blade and at "fast" Cutting Speed. But on the other hand, we need to prune at "slow" Cutting Speed and perpendicularly to longitudinal direction <b>of</b> a <b>twig</b> for preventing from the defects such as hang-nails or splits {{on the surface of}} the pruned tree. As pruning operation is popularly performed in drywinter season, so it is important to pay extra attention to pruning "small" twigs, which are apt to split電動丸鋸による枝打ち作業について鋸断性能と鋸断表面の仕上がり状態を調べるために, 歯形 (チップドソー, 鋸歯, 目立て歯), 枝の径 (8 mm, 12 mm, 18 mm), 鋸断速度 (速, 遅), 枝の樹種 (スギ, ヒノキ), 鋸断角度 (90 °, 45 °) および枝の乾燥状態 (乾, 湿, 生) の 6 因子を取り上げ, 直交表L_ (3 _) に従って実験計画を組み各因子の要因分析を行った。その結果, 枝軸に直角に素早く枝打ちすることで, 鋸断時間は短縮され, 一方鋸断速度を"速", 刃先の厚みの薄い歯を使用することで鋸断消費エネルギーは少なくなるが, しかし鋸断表面の仕上がり状態を良くするには鋸断速度を遅く, 枝軸に直角に当てる枝打ちがよい。また枝打ちは冬期の乾燥時期が最盛期であるから, 枝打ち面の割れ等を防ぐために, 小さい枝を打つときは特に注意が肝要である...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two types}} <b>of</b> <b>twig,</b> {{vegetative}} twigs and fruiting spurs. Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past. The age and rate of growth <b>of</b> a <b>twig</b> can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, down the length <b>of</b> the <b>twig.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects that}} woody plant {{chemical}} defenses may have on interactions between boreal hares that in winter feed almost entirely on twigs. We focus particularly {{on the fact that}} toxin concentration often varies with the age <b>of</b> <b>twig</b> segments. The model incorporates the fact that the woody internodes of the youngest segments <b>of</b> the <b>twigs</b> <b>of</b> the deciduous angiosperm species that these hares prefer to eat are more defended by toxins than the woody internodes of the older segments that subtend and support the younger segments. Thus, the per capita daily intake of the biomass of the older segments <b>of</b> <b>twigs</b> by hares is much higher than their intake of the biomass of the younger segments <b>of</b> <b>twigs.</b> This age-dependent toxicity <b>of</b> <b>twig</b> segments is modeled using age-structured model equations which are reduced to a system of delay differential equations involving multiple delays in the woody plant–hare dynamics. A novel aspect of the modeling was that it had to account for mortality <b>of</b> non-consumed younger <b>twig</b> segment biomass when older twig biomass was bitten off and consumed. Basic mathematical properties of the model are established together with upper and lower bounds on the solutions. Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for the linear stability of the equilibrium in which the hare is extinct, and sufficient conditions are found for the global stability of this equilibrium. Numerical simulations confirmed the analytical results and demonstrated the existence of limit cycles over ranges of parameters reasonable for hares browsing on woody vegetation in boreal ecosystems. This showed that age dependence in plant chemical defenses has the capacity to cause hare–plant population cycles, a new result...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> interval on production, and nutrition of gamal (Gliricidia sepium). The study was conducted on Agriranch sheep farm, Pandan Rejo Subdistrict, Bumi Aji District of Malang Regency from May 25 th to August 25 th 2012. Proximate Analysis was carried out at the Animal Nutrition Laboratory, Animal Husbandry Faculty, Brawijaya University. The study used Randomized Block Design (RBD) which consisted of four treatments and three cutting age groups. The treatments were U 60 (60 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age), U 80 (80 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age), U 100 (100 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age), and U 120 (120 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age). The study found that the lowest production <b>of</b> leaves, <b>twigs,</b> dry matter, organic matter, and fibre were at 60 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age. Meanwhile the highest production of them was at 120 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age. However, the lowest crude protein content was found at 120 days cutting age. The study suggests that gamal was able to provide better nutrition as animal forages at 80 days <b>of</b> <b>cutting</b> age...|$|R
