50|$|Silphium perfoliatum, the cup {{plant or}} <b>cup-plant,</b> is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} plant in the family Asteraceae, native to eastern and central North America. It is an erect herbaceous perennial with triangular toothed leaves, and daisy-like yellow composite flower heads in summer.|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} {{the feasibility of}} agricultural crop residues used as alternative raw materials for particle boards was investigated. Germany-grown <b>cup-plant</b> (Silphium perfoliatum L.), sunflower (Helianthusannuus L.) and topinambour (Helianthus tuberosus L.) were used as raw materials for particleboards produced at a conventional density of 600 kg/m 3. Particleboards were glued with two different adhesives, with methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) as well and urea formaldehyde (UF) resins. The physical and mechanical properties of prepared panels were measured according to standards. The raw materials were analyzed for their chemical composition; particle geometry was carefully monitored. It is shown that the obtained particleboards have acceptable performances, though properties were below those obtained from conventional spruce particleboards. Modulus of rupture of the alternative material particleboards {{were found to be}} lower than the spruce particleboards. Likewise, thickness swelling and water absorption of the agricultural residues made particleboards were higher than the compared spruce-made particleboards. The finding relevant for industrial applications was that the agricultural residue-produced particleboards bonded with MDI resins fully comply with the European standard EN 312 class P 1 (use in dry conditions). This means that non-wood particleboards are suitable to be used in furniture production...|$|E
