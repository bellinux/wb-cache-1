50|$|The chain {{catshark}} or <b>chain</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Scyliorhinus retifer) is a small, reticulated catshark that is biofluorescent. The species {{is common in}} the West Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico from George's Bank in Massachusetts, to Nicaragua. It is harmless and rarely encountered by humans. It has very similar reproductive traits to the small-spotted catshark (S. canicula).|$|E
50|$|In the Mid-Atlantic Bight, the <b>chain</b> <b>dogfish</b> {{is found}} along the outer {{continental}} shelf and upper slope. The shark occupies depths of 58 to 359 m and occupies shallower depths in the northern region compared to southern areas. Due to the shark’s depth distribution, {{it has been suggested}} that the shark does not perform large-scale migrations.|$|E
5000|$|Catsharks {{are found}} around seabeds in {{temperate}} and tropical seas worldwide, ranging from very shallow intertidal waters to depths of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) or more, {{such as the}} members of genus Apristurus [...] The Red spotted catshark lives in the shallower rocky waters ranging from Peru to Chile and migrate to deeper waters during the winter months. They are usually restricted to small ranges. Juvenile and adult <b>chain</b> <b>dogfish</b> live on the soft or rocky bottom of the Atlantic from Massachusetts to Nicaragua. Adults tend {{to live on the}} soft sandy bottoms possibly due to their need of egg deposition sites.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species of}} {{catshark}}, like the <b>chain</b> <b>dogfish,</b> are oviparous and lay eggs in tough egg cases with curly tendrils at each end, known as mermaid's purses, for protection, onto the seabed. It takes {{almost a year}} for a catshark to hatch from the egg. Instead of laying the eggs and letting them sit for a year, some species of catshark hold onto the egg until a few months before the shark hatches. Some catsharks exhibit ovoviviparity, aplacental viviparous, by holding onto the embryos until they are completely developed and then give live birth. Some species of catsharks mate by biting and holding the female’s pectoral fins and wrestle her into a mating position.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the type and amount of prey taken by <b>chain</b> <b>dogfish,</b> to examine how they utilize energy from their food, and to compare these results with those for other elasmobranchs and for teleosts. Most of this work was done with captive sharks, and the application of laboratory derived data to wild populations is discussed. ^ Growth and food consumption were monitored for captive sharks to determine the size at maturity, ration levels, food preferences, growth rate, and gross conversion efficiency. Both female and male sharks reached maturity at 280 g (40. 4 cm), or 8. 5 years. Juveniles consumed more squid and less fish than adults. The diet shift occurred in sharks between 150 and 200 g. Ration levels and maintenance rations were higher for juveniles than for adults. Both growth rate and ration decreased exponentially with increasing body weight. ^ To determine parameters of the bioenergetic equation, respirometry was used to measure metabolism, calorimetry was used to measure energy content of food and feces, and nutrient analysis of water was used to measure excretion. Standard metabolism was dependent on weight and was lower than that of teleosts. Active metabolism was dependent on weight and activity level, and introduced great variability into the equation. The SDA, fecal losses and excretion loss rates were similar to those found for carnivorous teleosts. All parameters of the equation represented similar proportions of ingested energy as those found for teleosts. A model was developed to allow prediction of growth at different levels of ration and activity. ^ No difference in diet was found between juveniles and adults or between different seasons for wild-caught sharks. The gastric evacuation, found by gastric lavage at intervals after a meal, was exponential for meals of fish, and followed a Gompertz curve for meals of squid. The exponential rate was used in conjunction with stomach contents of wild-caught sharks to determine the ration level of wild sharks, which was twice that of captives. It was determined that for wild-caught sharks to have a similar growth rate to captives, their activity level must be much higher. ...|$|E
