25|$|Most recently, a {{significant}} advance in grating-based imaging occurred {{due to the}} discovery of a phase moiré effect by Wen and colleagues. It led to interferometry beyond the Talbot self-imaging range, using only phase gratings and <b>conventional</b> <b>sources</b> and detectors. X-ray phase gratings can be made with very fine periods, thereby allowing imaging at low radiation doses to achieve high sensitivity.|$|E

A study conducted using adolescents with Excessive Internet video Game Play (EIGP) showed that such addictive behaviors were correlated with higher RD scores on the TCI, whereas both low and high scores of RD were implicated in specific alcoholic and drug addictions.|$|E

25|$|Sheffield's {{district}} heating network {{was established in}} 1988 and is still expanding today. It saves an equivalent 21,000 plus tonnes of CO2 each year when compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>sources</b> of energy – electricity from the national grid and heat generated by individual boilers. There are currently over 140 buildings connected to the {{district heating}} network. These include city landmarks such as the Sheffield City Hall, the Lyceum Theatre, Sheffield University, Sheffield Hallam University, hospitals, shops, offices and leisure facilities plus 2,800 homes. More than 44km of underground pipes deliver energy which is generated at Sheffield Energy Recovery Facility. This converts 225,000 tonnes of waste into energy, producing up to 60 MWe of thermal energy and up to 19 MWe of electrical energy.|$|E
500|$|CAPEX for {{the plant}} is {{estimated}} to $6.4billion, so financing the plant over a 20-year period adds another $5billion assuming the 6.5% unsecured rate. Considering CAPEX and fuel alone, {{the total cost of}} the plant is 6.4 + 5 + 4 = $15.4billion. Dividing the total cost by the energy produced over the same period gives a rough estimate of the cost of electricity for a 20-year lifetime operation: $15.4billion / 160billion kWh = 9.6 cents/kWh. A 40-year operation lifetime would lead to a cost of electricity of 4.8 cents/kWh. LLNL calculated the LCoE of LIFE.2 at 9.1 cents using the discounted cash flow methodology described in the 2009 MIT report [...] "the Future of Nuclear Energy". Although details on their calculation are lacking, the LIFE.2 LCoE is comparable to <b>conventional</b> <b>sources</b> of power.|$|E
500|$|In Dumville's view Æthelstan {{has been}} seen by historians as a shadowy figure because of an {{apparent}} lack of source material, but {{he argues that the}} lack is more apparent than real. Charters, law codes, and coins throw considerable light on Æthelstan's government. The scribe known to historians as [...] "Æthelstan A", who was responsible for drafting all charters between 928 and 935, provides very detailed information, including signatories, dates, and locations, illuminating Æthelstan's progress around his realm. [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] may have been Bishop Ælfwine of Lichfield, who was close to the king. By contrast with this extensive source of information, no charters survive from 910 to 924, a gap which historians struggle to explain, and which makes it difficult to assess the degree of continuity in personnel and the operation of government between the reigns of Edward and Æthelstan. Historians are also paying increasing attention to less <b>conventional</b> <b>sources,</b> such as contemporary poetry in his praise and manuscripts associated with his name.|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the energy}} for the MIT campus comes from a Central Utilities Plant (Building 42). Located between Albany and Vassar Streets, this {{cogeneration}} facility includes a 21 megawatt ABB GT10A Combustion Turbine Generator and a heat recovery system and produces electricity, steam heat, and chilled water for more than 100 campus buildings. MIT plans to replace the existing turbine, which is {{nearing the end of}} its useful life, with two new 22 megawatt units by 2020. Since the cogeneration plant came on line in 1995, MIT estimates it has used one third less fuel than it would have using <b>conventional</b> <b>sources</b> for electricity and steam. The plant is also capable of powering portions of the campus in an emergency.|$|E
2500|$|Peak oil as {{a proper}} noun, or [...] "Hubbert's peak" [...] applied more generally, {{refers to a}} {{predicted}} event: {{the peak of the}} entire planet's oil production. After peak oil, according to the Hubbert Peak Theory, the rate of oil production on Earth would enter a terminal decline. On the basis of his theory, in a paper he presented to the American Petroleum Institute in 1956, Hubbert correctly predicted that production of oil from <b>conventional</b> <b>sources</b> would peak in the continental United States around 1965–1970. [...] His prediction of inevitable decline has been incorrect, but the 1970 peak has yet not been surpassed. Hubbert further predicted a worldwide peak at [...] "about half a century" [...] from publication and approximately 12 gigabarrels (GB) a year in magnitude. In a 1976 TV interview Hubbert added that the actions of OPEC might flatten the global production curve but this would only delay the peak for perhaps 10 years. The development of new technologies has provided access to large quantities of unconventional resources, and the boost of production has largely discounted Hubbert's prediction.|$|E
