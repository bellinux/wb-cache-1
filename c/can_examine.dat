5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, with the Earth administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|Life Is Strange is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} played from a third-person view. The mechanic of rewinding time allows the player to redo any action {{that has been}} taken. The player <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> and interact with objects, which enables puzzle solving {{in the form of}} fetch quests and making changes to the environment. Items that are collected before time travelling will be kept in the inventory after the fact.|$|E
5|$|The quarry {{is also a}} prime {{location}} for geological research and provides opportunities for field studies {{in a variety of}} disciplines: sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geography, and industrial archaeology. Several features make this a unique {{location for}} the study of rock formations. Visitors <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> the extensively exposed rock faces, primarily Kentish Ragstone and Hassock facies, and study changes in vertical and lateral facies. The facies are glauconitic with some horizons of silicification. Shell debris (ammonites, belemnites, nautiloids, bivalves, etc.) and bioturbation are also present. The quarry could be important for future research via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate.|$|E

5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E

25|$|Self-report survey {{methodology}} is {{the most}} used approach in OHP research. Cross-sectional designs are commonly used; case-control designs have been employed much less frequently. Longitudinal designs including prospective cohort studies and experience sampling studies <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> relationships over time. OHP-related research devoted to evaluating health-promoting workplace interventions has relied on quasi-experimental designs and, less commonly, experimental approaches.|$|E
25|$|Colonoscopy {{is similar}} to sigmoidoscopy—the {{difference}} being related to which parts of the colon each <b>can</b> <b>examine.</b> A colonoscopy allows {{an examination of the}} entire colon (1200–1500mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon.|$|E

25|$|A multinomial discrete-choice model <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> the {{responses}} to these questions (model G, model H, model I). However, these models are derived under the concept that the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives the answer that provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural {{to think that the}} respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered probit models are derived under this concept.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{and size of}} a company must be distinguished. Depending on which dispositions are predominant, {{the size of the}} company, the sector, and the number of employees in an organization, one <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> whether approaches of Taylorism are prevalent. It is believed to be predominant in the automotive industry. In {{spite of the fact that}} a lot of activities have been replaced by machines during the production, it is ultimately the person who can check the quality of a product.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their unique genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen.|$|E

25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy beam of electrons, and have to be of a size that will fit on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E
25|$|Warmer {{temperatures}} {{in the region have}} brought increased precipitation to Greenland, and part of the lost mass has been offset by increased snowfall. However, there are {{only a small number of}} weather stations on the island, and though satellite data <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> the entire island, it has only been available since the early 1990s, making the study of trends difficult. It has been observed that there is more precipitation where it is warmer, up to 1.5 meters per year on the southeast flank, and less precipitation or none on the 25–80 percent (depending on the time of year) of the island that is cooler.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacogenomics: type {{of genetic}} testing that determines the {{influence}} of genetic variation on drug response. When a person has a disease or health condition, pharmacogenomics <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> an individual’s genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and most beneficial to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people’s genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual’s response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing {{can be used for}} cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of the cancer tissue can be sent in for genetic analysis by a specialized lab. After analysis, information retrieved can identify mutations in the tumor which can be used to determine the best treatment option.|$|E

25|$|RoboMary <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at a red tomato, and see exactly how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see a red tomato.|$|E
25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, talk to that character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{vascular}} arterial system supplying {{fresh blood}} branches into {{smaller and smaller}} vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the area of activity and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to {{the area where the}} neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI <b>can</b> <b>examine</b> a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimers), subcortical nuclei such as the caudate, putamen and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum.|$|E
