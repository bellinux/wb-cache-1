50|$|A {{flyback diode}} (sometimes called a snubber diode, commutating diode, {{freewheeling}} diode, suppressor diode, suppression diode, clamp diode, or <b>catch</b> <b>diode)</b> is a diode used to eliminate flyback, {{which is the}} sudden voltage spike seen across an inductive load when its supply current is suddenly reduced or interrupted.|$|E
40|$|A buck {{converter}} with a given output filter is operated with pulse-width modulated and quasi-resonant switching schemes {{at the same}} nominal load and switching frequency. Electromagnetic interference generated by the natural switching action of the converter is examined by Fourier spectral analysis. Interference caused by excitation of parasitic elements is examined experimentally. Quasi-resonant converters are {{found to have a}} lower switching frequency harmonic bandwidth than the equivalent pulse-width modulated converter. The most significant parasitic responses are the turn-on current and turn-off voltage of the <b>catch</b> <b>diode,</b> and the gate charge current of the MOSFET switch. A significant decrease in radiated and conducted noise is obtained when the gate drive voltage rise and fall times are increased, which is possible without loss of efficiency using quasi-resonant switching...|$|E
