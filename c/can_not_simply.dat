2500|$|Some of {{the interpretations}} of the play {{have been based on}} {{psychology}} and its diverse theories. In 1972, Alex Aronson argued that Theseus represents the conscious mind and Puck represents the unconscious mind. Puck, in this view, is a guise of the unconscious as a trickster, while remaining subservient to Oberon. Aronson thought that the play explores unauthorised desire and linked it to the concept of fertility. He viewed the donkey and the trees as fertility symbols. The lovers' sexual desires are symbolised in their forest encounters. In 1973, Melvin Goldstein argued that the lovers <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> return to Athens and wed. First, they have to pass through stages of madness (multiple disguises), and discover their [...] "authentic sexual selves". In 1979, Norman N. Holland applied psychoanalytic literary criticism to the play. He interpreted the dream of Hermia {{as if it was a}} real dream. In his view, the dream uncovers the phases of Hermia's sexual development. Her search for options is her defence mechanism. She both desires Lysander and wants to retain her virginity.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{assumptions}} surrounding issues of hyper-fertility in developing countries, ethical controversy surrounds {{the idea of}} whether or not access to assisted reproductive technologies should comprise a critical aspect of reproductive health or at least, whether or not the distribution and access of such technologies should be subject to greater equity. However, as highlighted by Inhorn [...] the overarching conceptualisation of infertility, to a great extent, disguises important distinctions that can be made within a local context, both demographically and epidemiological and moreover, that these factors are highly significant in the ethics of reproduction. An important factor, argues Inhorn, is the positioning of men within the paradigm of reproductive health, whereby because rates of general infertility mask differences between male and female infertility, men remain a largely invisible facet within the theorisation and discourse surrounding infertility, as well as the related treatments and biotechnologies. This is particularly significant given that male infertility accounts {{for more than half of}} all cases of infertility [...] and moreover, it is evident that the attitudes and behaviours of men have profound implications for the reproductive health of both individuals and couples. For example, Inhorn [...] notes that when couples in Egypt are faced with seemingly intractable infertility problems - due to a range of family and societal pressures that centre around the place of children in constituting the gender identity of men and women - it is often the women who is forced to seek continued treatment; this continues to occur, even in known instances of male infertility and that the constant seeking of treatment frequently becomes iatrogenic for the women. Inhorn states that infertility often leads to “marital demise, physical violence, emotional abuse, social exclusion, community exile, ineffective and iatrogenic therapies, poverty, old age insecurity, increased risk of HIV/AIDS, and death” [...] Significantly, Inhorn demonstrates that this phenomenon <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> be explained by a lack of knowledge, rather it occurs in a complex interaction between the centrality of children in the male gender identity as a symbol of maturity and the relative lack of power of women in Egyptian society, whereby they effectively become scapegoats for a culturally accepted narrative as a site of blame for the lack of childlessness. It should be emphasised that this is not simply an issue of “women oppressed by men” but rather, that men and women both share the burden of this narrative, but in different, unequal and highly complex ways. [...] Therefore, while the notion that reproductive health is a ‘women’s issue’, may have powerful social currency, especially within popular discourse and indigenous systems of meaning, the reality of infertility suggests that medical and health paradigms have a significant part to play in challenging the validity of this entrenched belief [...] Moreover, the effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention, medical or otherwise will be contingent on such outcomes and has an important part to play in the alleviation of gendered suffering, especially the burden imposed on women, who continue to suffer disproportionately from the effects of infertility.|$|E

5000|$|CA IV {{has been}} {{identified}} in pulmonary epithelium of many mammalian species and may be uniquely adaptive for gas exchange necessary for the high metabolic requirements of mammals. A majority of the CO2 produced by metabolism is transported as bicarbonate (HCO3-). At the tissue capillary, CO2 diffuses from tissue to plasma. Other forms of carbonic anhydrase enzyme are not present in the plasma, restricting the equilibrium reaction of CO2+H2O = H2CO3 = H+ HCO3-. CO2 in the plasma diffuses into the Red Blood Cell. CA is present within the Red Blood Cell, facilitating the conversion of CO2 to HCO3-. HCO3- so produced is transferred by the HCO3-/Cl- [...] "shuttle" [...] from {{the interior of the}} Red Blood Cell to the plasma. HCO3- doers not diffuse across cell membranes and, in the absence of CA, stays as HCO3- and concentrates in plasma. Up to 80% of metabolically produced CO2 is transported in plasma in the form of HCO3-. Blood moves from the tissue capillary to the pulmonary capillary where CO2 is exchanged at the lung. In the pulmonary capillary, bicarbonate <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> diffuse either into the Red Blood Cell or the alvioli. It is traditionally thought that HCO3- is returned to the interior of the Red Blood Cell by a reversal of the HCO3-/CO2- shuttle, where, in the presence of CA, it is returned to a CO2 form to diffuse from the interior of the Red Blood Cell, to the plasma and then into the alvioli. Membrane bound CA (CA IV) on the luminal side of the pulmonary membrane would have direct contact with plasma HCO3- and would enzimatically convert HCO3- to CO2 in the area immediately proximal to the exchange membrane, greatly increasing the concentration gradient for exchange. In this way, plasma HCO3- can be converted to CO2 within the plasma compartment and exchanged with the alvioli without the requirement of returning the HCO3- to the interior of the Red Blood Cell.|$|E
