50|$|Inbreeding {{increases}} {{the chances of}} the expression of deleterious recessive alleles by increasing homozygosity and therefore {{has the potential to}} decrease the fitness of the offspring. With continuous inbreeding, genetic variation is lost and homozygosity is increased, enabling the expression of recessive deleterious alleles in homozygotes. The inbreeding coefficient, a term used to describe the degree of inbreeding in an individual, is an estimate of the percent of homozygous alleles in the overall genome. The more biologically related the parents are, the greater the inbreeding coefficient (See <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inbreeding),</b> since their genomes have many similarities already. This overall homozygosity becomes an issue when there are deleterious recessive alleles in the gene pool of the family.

Indeed, in some species, high levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> {{are thought to be}} the major cause of poor semen quality. It is, however, not clear whether inbreeding affects fertility in horses. In this study, the relationship between inbreeding and semen quality was examined in 285 immature Shetland pony stallions submitted for breeding soundness examination in March-April of the years 1992 - 1997. The majority of stallions examined were 3 years old (85 %) and their <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> ranged from 0 to 25 % (mean ± S. D. : 3 ± 4. 6 %).

The degree <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> significantly affected many aspects of sperm production and quality, based on a standard examination of two ejaculates collected at a 1. 5 - 3 h interval.

50|$|Even in {{the absence}} of {{preferential}} consanguinity, alleles that are rare in large populations can randomly increase to high frequency in small groups within a few generations due to the founder effect and accelerated genetic drift in a breeding pool of restricted size.

5000|$|The Kennel Club {{committed}} £1.2 million after PDE {{to a new}} KC genetics centre {{to focus}} on development of new DNA tests. It developed an online tool called Mate Select which allows people to look up health test results and inbreeding level of individual dogs compared to the breed average. The database can also calculate for breeders the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> (COI) that two selected dogs will produce. A father/daughter mating will produce puppies with a COI of 25%. Such matings are now banned by the KC but many dogs registered will have a much higher COI than this despite no close matings. This is because of decades of [...] "keeping it in the family" [...] with common ancestors appearing repeatedly in the distant pedigree. Geneticist Steve Jones says damage can be reduced by banning close inbreeding; mating with cousins is almost as bad and if such matings continue, problems build up. Some breeders go to considerable lengths {{to make the most}} of genetic diversity in their breeds, but dogs will suffer while the KC still allows this degree of inbreeding. Jones says the measures taken so far are tentative and reluctant.|$|E
5000|$|The fitness {{consequences}} of consanguineous mating {{have been studied}} since their scientific recognition by Charles Darwin in 1839. [...] Some of the most harmful effects known from such breeding includes its effects on the mortality rate {{as well as on}} the general health of the offspring. Within the past several decades, there have been many studies to support such debilitating effects on the human organism. Specifically, inbreeding has been found to decrease fertility as a direct result of increasing homozygosity of deleterious recessive alleles. Fetuses produced by inbreeding also face a greater risk of spontaneous abortions due to inherent complications in development. Among mothers who experience stillbirths and early infant deaths, those that are inbreeding have a significantly higher chance of reaching repeated results with future offspring. Additionally, consanguineous parents possess a high risk of premature birth and producing underweight and undersized infants. Viable inbred offspring are also likely to be inflicted with physical deformities and genetically inherited diseases. Studies have confirmed an increase in several genetic disorders due to inbreeding such as blindness, hearing loss, neonatal diabetes, limb malformations, Schizophrenia and several others. Moreover, there is an increased risk for congenital heart disease depending on the inbreeding coefficient (See <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>Inbreeding)</b> of the offspring, with significant risk accompanied by an F =.125 or higher.|$|E

Most researchers conclude that the relation between <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> estimated from pedigrees and fitness traits (inbreeding-fitness correlations) better reflects inbreeding depression than the relation between marker heterozygosity and fitness traits (heterozygosity-fitness correlations). However, it has been suggested recently that heterozygosity-fitness correlations should only be expected when inbreeding generates extensive identity disequilibrium (correlations in heterozygosity and homozygosity across loci throughout the genome). We tested this hypothesis in Mohor gazelle (Gazella dama mhorr) and Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). For Mohor gazelle, we calculated the inbreeding coefficient and measured heterozygosity at 17 microsatellite loci. For Iberian lynx, we measured heterozygosity at 36 microsatellite loci. In both species we estimated semen quality, a phenotypic trait directly related to fitness that is controlled by many loci and is affected by inbreeding depression. Both species showed evidence of extensive identity disequilibrium, and in both species heterozygosity was associated with semen quality. In the Iberian lynx the low proportion of normal sperm associated with low levels of heterozygosity was so extreme that it is likely to limit the fertility of males. In Mohor gazelle, although heterozygosity was associated with semen quality, inbreeding coefficient was not. This result suggests that when <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> is calculated {{on the basis of a}} genealogy that begins after a long history of inbreeding, the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> fails to capture previous demographic information because it is a poor estimator of accumulated individual inbreeding.

5000|$|Pedigrees are {{diagrams}} of familial {{connections between}} {{individuals and their}} ancestors, and possibly between {{other members of the}} group that share genetical inheritance with them. They are relationship maps. A pedigree can be analyzed, therefore, to reveal <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> and co-ancestry. Such pedigrees actually are informal depictions of path diagrams as used in path analysis, which was invented by Sewall Wright when he formulated his studies on inbreeding. Using the adjacent diagram, the probability that individuals [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] have received autozygous alleles from ancestor [...] "A" [...] is 1/2 (one out of the two diploid alleles). This is the [...] "de novo" [...] inbreeding (ΔfPed) at this step. However, the other allele may have had [...] "carry-over" [...] autozygosity from previous generations, so the probability of this occurring is (de novo complement multiplied by the <b>inbreeding</b> <b>of</b> ancestor A [...] ), that is [...] (1 − ΔfPed [...] ) fA [...] = [...] (1/2) fA [...] Therefore, the total probability of autozygosity in B and C, following the bi-furcation of the pedigree, is the sum of these two components, namely [...] (1/2) + (1/2)fA [...] = [...] (1/2) (1+f A [...] ) [...] This can be viewed as the probability that two random gametes from ancestor A carry autozygous alleles, and in that context is called the <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> parentage ( [...] fAA [...] ).

40|$|Understanding the {{magnitude}} and causes of genetic and phenotypic resemblance among relatives is key to understanding evolutionary processes. Contrary to basic expectation, individual <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> (f) were recently hypothesized to be intrinsically correlated across parents and offspring in structured populations, potentially creating an additional source of phenotypic resemblance in traits that show inbreeding depression. To test this hypothesis, we used individual-based simulations to quantify the parent-offspring correlations in f arising under random mating in populations of different size, immigration rate, and mating system. Parent-offspring correlations in f were typically positive (median r approximate to 0. 2 - 0. 4) in relatively small and isolated populations. Relatively inbred parents therefore produced relatively inbred offspring on average, although {{the magnitude}} of this effect varied considerably among replicate populations. Correlations were higher given more generations of random mating, greater variance in reproductive success, polygynous rather than monogamous mating, and for midparent-offspring rather than parent-offspring relationships. Furthermore, f was also positively correlated across half-siblings, and closer relatives had more similar inbreeding coefficients across entire generations. Such intrinsic resemblance in f among relatives could provide an additional genetic benefit of mate choice and bias quantitative genetic analyses that do not account for correlated inbreeding depression...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the author (1929 a) presented data show-ing that as close inbreeding is continued in chickens hatcha-bility decreases. The kind <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> practised was full-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings. It was observed that hatchability results are affected {{to a greater}} ex-tent {{in the first year}} <b>of</b> such close <b>inbreeding</b> than in successive years, though there is a general decline in hatchability each year that such close inbreeding is continued. Similar results were secured in Barred Plymouth Rocks and "White Leghorns. In another paper, the author (1929 b) determined that hatcha-bility decreases as the <b>coefficients</b> <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> increase. Since the intercrossing of highly inbred strains of corn pro-duces a remarkable state of rejuvenation, as demonstrated by Bast and Jones (1919), it was decided to determine the effect of intercrossing the inbred strains of Barred Plymouth Rocks and White Leghorns. Originally four pens each of the two breeds mentioned were started in the inbreeding project but in two years two pens of Barred Plymouth Rocks had practically exterminated them-selves through decreased hatchability. Two more pens of fnll-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings, however, were started to replace the two depleted pens. In 1928 two pens of Barred Plymouth Rocks had been in-bred for three generations so that their progeny represented the fourth year of progressive full-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings; two pens of Barred Plymouth Rocks have been likewise inbred for one generation and four pens of "White Leghorns had been similarly inbred hj using full-brother-and-sister and half-brother-and-sister matings for three succes-sive years. In 1929 the inbred strains were intercrossed by ex-changing the males in the first and second and the third and fourth matings, respectively, of each variety...|$|R
