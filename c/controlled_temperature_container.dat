The removed snails were fixed in 10 percent neutral formalin and prepared for serial sectioning and staining.

30|$|There {{is little}} policy {{with regard to}} freight wagons save {{the high level of}} regulations, but even these can be {{delineated}} as a relatively standard post 1945 freight wagon, and the addition in the 1960 s of new brake systems. The uniformity of freight wagons in Western and Eastern Europe means that the potential shortage of wagons pre 1991 was assuaged by the release of excess capacity from the former COMECON countries. The very low level of asset value and the surplus volumes in the wagon fleet has meant that there has been little appetite for novel electrically powered wagons with such features as condition monitoring, power supplies for <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>containers</b> etc. However the need for such modern wagons has been seen by the industry and the European Union and directly influenced by this research and others in the SPECTRUM project, the Shift 2 Rail Joint Undertaking, a joint venture between the sector and the EU, has made the development of such wagons a research and innovation priority, with funding, in its 2015 Multi-Annual Action Plan [25]. What is not addressed in the plan are business models that can generate returns on investment to attract operators or leasing companies to invest in such new innovative wagons, although this has since been explored by Siciliano et al. in this very journal [26].|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of retrieving {{changes in the}} depth of snow cover {{by means of the}} LISA (LInear SAR) Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture Radar system has been investigated. The LISA instrument con-sists of a computer-controlled sledge moving along a linear axis 5 m long, a set of transmit and receive antennas, a network analyzer, and a C-Band amplifier. All the equipment is installed inside a <b>temperature</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>container.</b> The centre frequency used in the measurement campaign is 5. 83 GHz (C-band), with a 60 MHz bandwidth. The resolution of a single SAR image is in the order of 6 m in azimuth and 2. 5 m in range, while in the interferometric mode, the range resolution in the coherence images is below 2 mm in the line-of-sight direction. Typical image products of LISA {{are similar to those of}} space or aerial radar missions. The only particularity of LISA is that the image covers a much smaller area (a few square km). However, it has the advantage of providing images at a much larger acquisition rate (about some tens in a single day). Over several weeks this amounts to a very large time-series of radar images that gives the opportunity to assess the feasi-bility of using a GB-SAR (Ground Based Synthetic Aperture Radar) system to monitor structural changes of the snow cover.

40|$|In {{extended}} space missions, foods will be {{heated to}} enhance the psychological {{as well as the}} physiological well-being of the crew. In the low-gravity space environment natural convection is essentially absent so that the heat transfer within the food is by conduction alone.

The Skylab food-heating system utilizes a tray with receptables for the food containers. The walls of the receptacles are lined with thermally controlled, electrical-resistance, blanket-type heating elements.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the modeling and control 	of a double-walled thermostatic container. This container 	is an important element of a device which measures 	the difference of pressures between two points in tunnels. 	The principle of this measuring method is comparison between 	constant pressure in the container and external 6 ne 	at two points. (1) In order to obtain the exact constant pressure, 	the <b>temperature</b> in the <b>container</b> must be controlled 	at a high accuracy within 10 - 3 °C.

First, several parameters of a bilinear control system 	can be estimated using the least-squares and the correlation 	-regression algorithms from input-output measurements. 	Using these parameters, the <b>temperature</b> in the <b>container</b> 	can be estimated. Next, the ambient air temperature influences 	the accuracy of the <b>temperature</b> <b>control</b> in the <b>container.</b> 	In order to eliminate this influence, a feedforward 	controller is added to regulate the output of the 	heater according to the atmospheric temperature.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} describe the pasteurization, by hot filling, of fruit purees.

Specific filling <b>temperatures</b> combined with <b>container</b> dimensions are required to achieve a target pasteurization value. However, {{only some of the}} adequate conditions offer final products with maximum quality. Several simulations were carried out to investigate the effect of filling <b>temperature,</b> <b>container</b> shape, type of cooling medium and pasteurization value on final quality retention expressed as vitamin C retention. Using statistical factorial analysis the most important parameters affecting quality were filling temperature and pasteurization value, followed by cooling medium.
