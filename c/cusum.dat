25|$|Human {{dwelling}} on {{the territory of}} present-day Novi Sad has been traced {{as far back as}} the Stone Age (about 4500 BC). Several settlements and necropoleis were unearthed during the construction of a new boulevard in Avijaticarsko Naselje, and were dated to 5000 BC. A settlement was located on the right bank of the river Danube in the territory of present-day Petrovaradin. In antiquity, the region was inhabited by Celtic tribes, especially by the Scordisci. Celts were present in the area since the 4th century BC and founded the first fortress on the right bank of the Danube. Later, in the 1st century BC, the region was conquered by the Romans. During Roman rule, a larger fortress was built in the 1st century with the name <b>Cusum</b> and was included in the Roman province of Pannonia.|$|E

40|$|Often {{the least}} {{appropriate}} assumption in traditional control charting technology is that process data constitute a random sample. In reality most process data are correlated—either temporally, spatially, or due to nested sources of variation. One approach to monitoring temporally correlated data uses a control chart on the forecast errors {{from a time}} series model of the process with, possibly, a transfer function term to model compensatory adjustments. If the time series term is an integrated moving average, then a sudden level shift in the process results in a patterned shift in the mean of forecast errors. Initially the mean shifts by the same amount as the process level but then it decays geometrically back to zero corresponding {{to the ability of}} the forecast to “recover ” from the upset. We study 4 monitoring schemes: cumulative sums (<b>CUSUMs),</b> exponentially weighted moving averages, Shewhart individuals charts, and a likelihood ratio scheme. Comparisons of signaling probabilities and average run lengths show that <b>CUSUMs</b> can be designed to perform at least as good as, and often better {{than any of the other}} schemes. Shewhart individuals charts often perform much worse than the others. Graphical aids are provided for designing <b>CUSUMs</b> in this context...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with deriving the limit distributions of stopping times devised to sequentially uncover structural breaks in the parameters of an autoregressive moving average, ARMA, time series. The stopping rules are defined as the first time lag for which detectors, based on <b>CUSUMs</b> and Page's <b>CUSUMs</b> for residuals, exceed {{the value of a}} prescribed threshold function. It is shown that the limit distributions crucially depend on a drift term induced by the underlying ARMA parameters. The precise form of the asymptotic is determined by an interplay between the location of the break point {{and the size of the}} change implied by the drift. The theoretical results are accompanied by a simulation study and applications to electroencephalography, EEG, and IBM data. The empirical results indicate a satisfactory behavior in finite samples.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{weighted}} <b>cusums,</b> a technique found in authorship attribution studies, {{for the purpose of}} identifying sublanguages. The technique, and its relation to standard <b>cusums</b> (cumulative sum charts) is first described, and the formulae for calculations given in detail. The technique compares texts by testing for the incidence of linguistic 'features' of a superficial nature, e. g. proportion of 2 - and 3 -letter words, words beginning with a vowel, and so on, and measures whether two texts differ significantly in respect of these features. The paper describes an experiment in which 14 groups of three texts each representing different sublanguages are compared with each other using the technique. The texts are first compared within each group to establish that the technique can identify the groups as being homogeneous. The texts are then compared with each other, and the results analysed. Taking the average of seven different tests, the technique is able to distinguish the sublanguages in only 43 % of the case. But if the best score is taken, 79 % of pairings can be distinguished. This is a better result, and the test seems able to quantify the difference between sublanguages...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{interest}} in risk-adjusted cumulative sum charts, <b>CUSUMs,</b> to monitor the performance of e. g. hospitals, {{taking into account the}} heterogeneity of patients. Even though many outcomes involve time, only conventional regression models are commonly used. In this article we investigate how time to event models may be used for monitoring purposes. We consider monitoring using <b>CUSUMs</b> based on the partial likelihood ratio between an out-of-control state and an in-control state. We consider both proportional and non-proportional alternatives, as well as a head start. Against proportional alternatives, we present an analytic method of computing the expected number of observed events before stopping or the probability of stopping before a given observed number of events. In a stationary set-up, the former is roughly proportional to the average run length in calendar time. Adding a head start changes the threshold only slightly if the expected number of events until hitting is used as a criterion. However, it changes the threshold substantially if a false alarm probability is used. In simulation studies, charts based on survival analysis perform better than simpler monitoring schemes. We present one example from retail finance and one medical application. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Blunted nocturnal {{decline in}} blood pres-sure (BP) is {{associated}} with increased risk of stroke. Mean day–night BP difference (dipping) and cusums-derived circadian alteration magnitude (CDCAM) of BP are the common measures of diurnal BP variation. Although {{a significant number of}} clinical trials have demonstrated that dipping {{is associated with}} a lower risk of cardiovascular events, the clinical value of CDCAM of BP is unknown. We evaluated the association between dipping and CD-CAM of BP and the risk of stroke. Methods: We analyzed 24 -h ambulatory BP recordings of 110 control subjects and 91 stroke survivors enrolled in a case-control stroke study. Nondipping was defined as nocturnal drop of, 10 mm Hg in systolic BP. The associations between nondipping, CDCAM of BP, and risk of stroke were calculated in the same sample. Results: There were significantly fewer nondippers in the control group as compared with those among the stroke survivors. The odds ratio for stroke of nondippers was 2. 3. By contrast, {{there was no significant difference}} in CDCAM of systolic BP between the control and stroke survivor groups. This finding could not be explained by the presence of reverse dippers in both groups. Conclusions: In this case-control study, classification of subjects into dippers and nondippers was found to be more clinically useful than <b>cusums</b> analysis of BP profile. Analysis of prospective data is needed to determine the clinical value of the <b>cusums</b> analysis of BP profile. Am...|$|R
40|$|Methods are {{presented}} for estimating {{the effect of}} known site changes on temperature and rainfall measurements. Parallel cumulative sums of seasonally adjusted series from neighbouring stations are a useful exploratory tool for recognizing site-change effects at a station that {{has a number of}} near neighbours. For temperature data, a site-change effect can be estimated by a difference between the target station and weighted mean of neighbouring stations, comparing equal periods before and after the site change. For rainfall the method is similar, except for a logarithmic transformation. Examples are given. In the case of isolated stations, the estimation is necessarily more subjective, but a variety of graphical and analytical techniques are useful aids for deciding how to adjust for a site change.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review some of the key {{literature}} on response time as it has played a role in cognitive ability measurement, providing a historical perspective as well as covering current research. We discuss the speed-level distinction, dimensions of speed and level in cognitive abilities frameworks, speed–accuracy tradeoff, approaches to addressing speed–accuracy tradeoff, analysis methods, particularly item response theory-based, response time models from cognitive psychology (ex-Gaussian function, and the diffusion model), and other uses of response time in testing besides ability measurement. We discuss several new methods that can be used to provide greater insight into the speed and level aspects of cognitive ability and speed–accuracy tradeoff decisions. These include item-level time limits, the use of feedback (e. g., <b>CUSUMs),</b> explicit scoring rules that combine speed and accuracy information (e. g., count down timing), and cognitive psychology models. We also review some of the key psychometric advances in modeling speed and level, which combine speed and ability measurement, address speed–accuracy tradeoff, allow for distinctions between response times on items responded to correctly and incorrectly, and integrate psychometrics with information-processing modeling. We suggest that the application of these models and tools is likely to advance both the science and measurement of human abilities for theory and applications...|$|R

40|$|When {{applied to}} a {{sequence}} of repeated surveys, the traditional sample survey estimators of means or totals for one time period only, fail {{to take advantage of}} any time series structure. Such structure may result from correlation between successive responses for resampled individuals, or from time series properties in the parameters of interest. Historically, the initial published papers on time series improvement of repeated sample survey estimates allowed only the first possibility, treating the sum over the population of the individual responses as fixed; individual responses were seen as having stochastic properties only with respect to the sampling scheme. The alternative and later development allowed that both individual responses and their sum have stochastic properties with respect to a superpopulation from which the population of individual responses are drawn. Superpopulations allowed the application of mainstream time series techniques, including signal extraction and stochastic least squares, to repeated sample survey data. These developments in their historical perspective are the topic of Chapter 1. Superpopulation models may also be applied to sample surveys from a single time period, and superpopulation and design properties of the one period linear non-homogeneous sample survey estimator form the topic of Chapter 2; this estimator is sufficiently general to subsume almost all single period non-informative sample survey estimators, and Chapter 2 allows systematisation {{of a wide range of}} previously disparate results. This linear estimator may also be extended beyond one time period to include the known estimators for repeated surveys, and this topic, together with a consideration of the effects of data agqregation on non-stochastic and stochastic least squares, is the subject of Chapter 3. Given the central role of the general linear model, and the time series nature of repeated surveys, projection and parameter updating formulae for linear models should form an integral part of repeated survey analysis. The correlation of sample survey errors however, invalidates the formulae appropriate to the known iid error case, and Chapters 4 and 5 develop the general formulae to allow correlated error structure. Chapter 4 considers parameter vectors of fixed length, as for example, for polynomial models, and provides formulae for estimating the length of the parameter vector, and for calculating independent recursive residuals and <b>cusums</b> when further data are added to the model. Chapter 5 considers updating and projection formulae in a wider context, and allows that the parameter vector may be stochastic or non-stochastic and that its length may increase with additional data; it consequently provides a general extension of the Kalman filter to the case of coloured noise over time. The paucity of suitable data has limited data analysis to that contained in Chapter 6, where a simulation study and an analysis of medical data gauge the efficacy of polynomial models in time with multiple observations per time point and autocorrelated errors. The formulae of Chapter 4 allow testing for the constancy of the regression relationships over time. The appendix details SAS computer programs for fitting the polynomial models of Chapter 6...|$|R
