50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> era, some cashiers omitted the 1- and 2-cent coins {{from the}} change they gave. Owner-operated {{businesses}} often rounded down the net amount to be paid to the nearest multiple of 5 cents.|$|R
5000|$|In Cyprus, {{however, the}} cent is officially called cent (...) both in {{singular}} and plural. This {{is the name}} formerly used for [...] of the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> chosen for its neutrality to both official languages of the Republic (Greek and Turkish).|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 2008, {{with the}} Republic of Cyprus {{switching}} its currency from the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> to the Euro, the British sovereign bases on Cyprus (Akrotiri and Dhekelia) followed suit making the Sovereign Base Areas the only territory under British sovereignty to officially use the euro.|$|R
25|$|The mill {{was used}} with the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound,</b> {{starting}} with decimalization in 1955, and lasting until 1983. However, coins smaller than 5 mils were not used since the mid 1960s. When switched to cents in 1983, a ½-cent coin was struck that was abolished a few years later.|$|R
50|$|The Central Bank of Cyprus (Kεντρική Τράπεζα της Κύπρου Kıbrıs Merkez Bankası), is {{the central}} bank of the Republic of Cyprus, located in Nicosia. It was {{established}} in 1963.

50|$|However {{the pound}} {{sterling}} was decimalised in various British colonial territories before the United Kingdom (and {{in several cases}} in line with William Brown's proposal that the pound be divided into 1000 parts, called mils). These included Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866; Cyprus from 1955 until 1960 (and continued on the island as {{the division of the}} <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> until 1983); and the Palestine Mandate from 1926 until 1948.|$|R
25|$|There are no {{economic}} statistics gathered for Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The main economic activities are {{the provision of}} services to the military, as well as limited agriculture. When the territory under the effective control of the Republic of Cyprus switched currencies from the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> to the euro on 1 January 2008, Akrotiri and Dhekelia followed suit making the Sovereign Base Areas the only territory under British sovereignty to officially use the euro.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 2008 {{the euro}} {{replaced}} the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> {{as the official}} currency.

The de facto Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus continues {{to use the new}} Turkish lira as its primary currency and the euro as its secondary currency.|$|R

50|$|The Governor has the {{responsibility}} of chairing the meetings of the Central Bank's Governing Council and Board of Directors. He or she had {{the responsibility}} for setting the Central Bank's policy {{in relation to the}} Cypriot economy, but this responsibility passed to the President of the European Central Bank on 1 January 2008, which is also the date that Cyprus changed over to the euro from the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound.</b> The Governor {{is a member of the}} Governing Board of the European Central Bank.|$|R
50|$|The {{acquisition}} of a DC-8 several months later allowed for non-stop service. Cyprus also added flights to Saudi Arabia at this time. The company was soon able to order a pair of new BAC 1-11s, added to the sister aircraft already in the fleet. The economic loss of the Turkish invasion to the airline {{was estimated to be}} 1.6 million <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pounds.</b> To survive, the airline decided to reduce the salaries of all its employees to minimum, who accepted it.|$|R
5000|$|... "The <b>Cypriot</b> <b>Pound,</b> {{which has}} been legal tender since 1960, will cease to exist and will be {{replaced}} by the common European currency. This is a fundamental, albeit natural, change for a small economy, brought about by Cyprus’ accession to the EU in 2004. The economy can reap important benefits from its participation in the single currency area, although it will face significant challenges. Everyone must play its [...] role in this important journey, the government and the Central Bank, businesses, workers, and consumers." ...|$|R
50|$|When Cyprus became {{independent}} in 1960, general duty revenues were reintroduced. A set denominated in milliemes was issued, and in 1977 {{two of these}} values were surcharged with new values. Between 1983 and 1995 this set was reissued but denominated in the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound.</b> Between 1986 and 2001, some of these stamps were issued overprinted with the date of issue. With {{the adoption of the}} euro currency in 2008, a new set was issued bearing the coat of arms in hologram, and this consisted of nine values ranging from 7 eurocents to €34.10.|$|R
50|$|With the {{adoption}} of the euro by Cyprus per 1 January 2008, the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which had previously used the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound,</b> also decided to adopt the euro. The base areas are an overseas territory of the United Kingdom, an EU member state which itself does not use the euro, but are outside of the EU and under military jurisdiction. Their laws and currency have been aligned with those of the Republic of Cyprus, leading to the euro's adoption in the two areas.|$|R
50|$|The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus {{introduced}} the euro {{at the same}} time as Cyprus, on 1 January 2008. Previously, they used the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>Pound.</b> Since the independence of Cyprus, treaties dictate that British territories in Cyprus will have the same currency as the Republic of Cyprus. These are the only places under British control where the euro is legal tender. They do not issue separate euro coins. Following the British vote to withdraw from the EU in June 2016, Ioannis Kasoulides, Foreign Minister of Cyprus, announced that Cyprus wished to have EU citizen privileges remain for these areas if the UK ceases to be a member.|$|R
50|$|The {{minister}} of Labor and Social Works {{of the administration}} was İsmet Kotak. The administration reorganized the customs of the port of Famagusta and reopened it on 6 September 1974. Initially, the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> {{was used as the}} currency, but the severed ties with the Cypriot central bank and resulting monetary difficulties prompted the administration to switch to the Turkish lira. The Ercan International Airport, then called the Tymbou Airport, was opened to chartered flights and some 75,000 tons of citrus fruits grown in the territory were exported. Efforts were made to reopen the closed tourism establishments, and nine hotels were reopened until November 1974. With help from the Turkish Airlines, the Cyprus Turkish Airlines was established and started flights to Turkey by January 1975.|$|R
5000|$|In 1955, a {{decision}} was made by the British colonial authorities to decimalise the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound,</b> and in this they used the system proposed by William Brown, a member of the United Kingdom parliament, who suggested in 1855 that the pound sterling in the United Kingdom should be divided into one-thousand parts, each called a mil. [...] Although this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, it was used in several British colonies, including Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866; and the British Palestine Mandate from 1926 until 1948. This latter example may have been the impetus to use a pound-mil system in Cyprus as the Palestinian pound was for a brief period accepted as legal tender in Cyprus.|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} Chairman of the Currency Board {{was held}} by the Accountant General, {{also known as the}} Auditor General, of the Government of Cyprus. The Board could issue notes and coins, {{initially}} denominated in the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound,</b> shillings and piastres, and later, following decimalization, in Cyprus pounds and mils. However, the local currency was pegged at one Cyprus pound to one pound sterling meaning ultimate fiscal control still rested with the Bank of England in London and the Government of the United Kingdom. This link was maintained by the requirement that for every Cyprus pound issued by the Currency Board in Cyprus, one pound sterling issued by the Bank of England had to be deposited by the Government of Cyprus with the Crown Agents in London.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{the pound}} {{sterling}} in the United Kingdom, and the sterling-equivalent <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> in British-run Cyprus, the Palestine pound was from its introduction a decimal currency, albeit with each pound divided into one thousand parts, called mils. This system {{was derived from}} a proposal made in 1855, by William Brown, {{a member of the}} United Kingdom parliament, that the United Kingdom pound should be decimalised by being divided into one-thousand parts, each called a mil. [...] Although this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, it was used by the British colonial authorities first in Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866, and then in the British Palestine Mandate from 1926 until 1948. It was also adopted in Cyprus in 1955, where the Palestinian pound had briefly been introduced as legal tender, following a currency shortage in 1943.|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, {{the economy has}} shifted from {{agriculture}} to light manufacturing and services. The services sector, including tourism, contributes almost 80% to GDP and employs more than 70% of the labor force. Industry and construction account for approximately one-fifth of GDP and labor, while agriculture is responsible for 2.1% of GDP and 8.5% of the labor force. Potatoes and citrus are the principal export crops. After robust growth rates in the 1980s (average annual growth was 6.1%), economic performance in the 1990s was mixed: real GDP growth was 9.7% in 1992, 1.7% in 1993, 6.0% in 1994, 6.0% in 1995, 1.9% in 1996 and 2.3% in 1997. This pattern underlined the economy's vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (i.e., to economic and political conditions in Cyprus, Western Europe, and the Middle East) {{and the need to}} diversify the economy. Declining competitiveness in tourism and especially in manufacturing are expected to act as a drag on growth until structural changes are effected. Overvaluation of the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> prior to the adoption of the euro in 2008 had kept inflation in check.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to Cypriot {{accession}} to the EU in 2004, EU law {{did not apply}} to the sovereign base areas. This position was changed by the Cypriot accession treaty and EU law, while still not applying in principle, applies to the extent necessary to implement a protocol attached to that treaty. This protocol applies EU law relating to the Common Agricultural Policy, customs, indirect taxation, social policy and justice and home affairs to the sovereign base areas. The sovereign base areas' authorities have also made provision for the unilateral application of directly applicable EU law. [...] The UK also agreed in the Protocol to keep enough control of the external (i.e. off-island and northern Cyprus) borders of the base areas to ensure that the border between the sovereign base areas and the Republic of Cyprus can remain fully open and will not have to be policed as an external EU border. Consequently, the sovereign base areas will become a de facto part of the Schengen Area if and when Cyprus implements it. The base areas are already de facto members of the eurozone due to their previous use of the <b>Cypriot</b> <b>pound</b> before it was replaced by the euro in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Because of the debased {{values of}} the piastres in the Middle East, these piastres became {{subsidiary}} units for the Turkish, <b>Cypriot</b> and Egyptian <b>pounds.</b> Meanwhile, in Indochina, the piastre continued into the 1950s and was subsequently renamed the riel, the kip, and the dong in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam respectively.|$|R
