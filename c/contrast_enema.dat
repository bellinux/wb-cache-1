25|$|Administration {{through the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract is sometimes termed enteral or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, {{in the sense}} that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a <b>contrast</b> <b>enema,</b> whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects.|$|E

40|$|Rectal {{bleeding}} often heralds serious colonic disease. The {{literature suggests}} that colonoscopy is superior to barium enema plus sigmoidoscopy, although no good comparative studies exist. Seventy one patients with overt rectal bleeding had prospectively flexible sigmoidoscopy, double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> and colonoscopy completed independently. Against the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of colonoscopy were 0. 69 and 0. 78 respectively for a spectrum of colonic lesions, while for combined flexible sigmoidoscopy and double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> these values were 0. 80 and 0. 56, respectively. When assessing adenoma or carcinoma, colonoscopy was more sensitive at 0. 82 v 0. 73, while flexible sigmoidoscopy plus double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> was superior for detecting diverticular disease.

50|$|The {{condition}} {{is not usually}} immediately life-threatening. The intussusception can be treated with either a barium or water-soluble <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> or an air-contrast enema, which both confirms the diagnosis of intussusception, {{and in most cases}} successfully reduces it. The success rate is over 80%. However, approximately 5-10% of these recur within 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|If {{contrast}} {{cannot be}} refluxed into the distal small bowel, ileal atresia remains a diagnostic possibility. Jejunal and ileal atresia {{are caused by}} in utero vascular insults, leading to poor recanalization of distal small bowel segments, {{a condition in which}} surgical resection and reanastamosis are mandatory. Hirschsprung disease is due to an arrest in neural cell ganglia, leading to absent innervation of a segment distal bowel, and appears as a massively dilated segment of distal bowel on <b>contrast</b> <b>enema.</b> Surgical resection is necessary for this condition as well. Imperforate anus also requires surgical management, with the diagnosis made by inability to pass the rectal tube through the anal sphincter. Supportive intravenous hydration, gastric decompression, and ventilatory support may be needed due to poor neonatal nutrition resulting from dysfunctional bowel absorption.|$|E
50|$|A low {{obstruction}} {{is suspected}} on plain film, but needs {{follow up with}} a gastrografin enema, which itself can be therapeutic. The differential for low obstruction is ileal atresia, meconium ileus, meconium plug syndrome and Hirschsprung disease. In cases of meconium ileus or ileal atresia, the colon distal to the obstruction is hypoplastic, usually less than 1 cm in caliber, as development of normal colonic caliber in utero {{is due to the}} passage of meconium, which does not occur in either of these conditions. When diffusely small caliber is seen, it is referred to as microcolon. Radiographs in meconium ileus classically demonstrate a bubbly appearance in the right lower quadrant due to a combination of ingested air and meconium. If, on <b>contrast</b> <b>enema,</b> reflux into the dilated distal small bowel loops can be achieved, the study is both diagnostic and therapeutic, as the ionic contrast medium can dissolve the meconium to allow passage of enteric content into the unused colon.|$|E

40|$|To {{establish}} {{the sensitivity of}} double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> (DCBE) for detection of colorectal carcinoma in a tertiary referral centre and consider its possible role as a suitable imaging method in screening for this disease. A total of 160 patients with a histopathologically proven diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma over a two year period were reviewed. Subsequently 112 of the 160 patients were identified as having undergone DCBE, the results of which were analysed to determine its sensitivity for detecting colorectal carcinoma. Colorectal carcinoma was missed in 4 of the 112 barium enemas performed. This corresponds to a sensitivity of 96. 5 % with a false negative rate of 3. 5 %. The Dukes Classification in these 4 cases showed that Dukes stage B, C and D were missed, with tumours located in {{the right and the}} sigmoid colon. The mean delay to operation in these four cases was 6 weeks. Our study correlates with previous studies showing a false negative rate for DCBE of 3. 5 %. Colonoscopy also fails to detect small numbers of tumours with false negative rates reported as high as 10 %. We suggest that double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> should be effective as a screening method in any future colorectal cancer screening program...|$|R

Administration methods directly into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and enteral nutrition. Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.The rectal route is an effective route of administration for many medications, especially those used at the end of life. The walls of the rectum absorb many medications quickly and effectively. Medications delivered to the distal one-third of the rectum at least partially avoid the [...] "first pass effect" [...] through the liver, which allows for greater bio-availability of many medications than that of the oral route. Rectal mucosa is highly vascularized tissue that allows for rapid and effective absorption of medications. A suppository is a solid dosage form that fits for rectal administration. In hospice care, a specialized rectal catheter, designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications provides a practical way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum, giving health practitioners a way to leverage the established benefits of rectal administration.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with Hirschsprung disease {{lack the}} normal rectoanal {{inhibitory}} reflex, {{which can be}} studied with anorectal manometry or US. OBJECTIVE: To see whether the rectoanal inhibitory reflex could be visualised with a modified <b>contrast</b> <b>enema,</b> thereby increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> and {{reducing the number of}} rectal biopsies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine boys and 42 girls (median age, 12 months) with suspected Hirschsprung disease were examined with a modified <b>contrast</b> <b>enema,</b> supplemented with two injections of cold, water-soluble contrast medium, to induce the reflex. Two paediatric radiologists evaluated the anonymised examinations in consensus. The <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> findings were correlated with the results of rectal biopsy or clinical follow-up. RESULTS: Five boys and one girl (median age, 7. 5 days) were diagnosed with Hirschsprung disease. The negative predictive value of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was 100 %. A <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> with signs of Hirschsprung disease in combination with an absent rectoanal inhibitory reflex had the specificity of 98 % and sensitivity of 100 % for Hirschsprung disease. CONCLUSION: The modified <b>contrast</b> <b>enema</b> improves the radiological diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. By demonstrating the rectoanal inhibitory reflex in children without Hirschsprung disease, we can reduce the proportion of unnecessary rectal biopsies...|$|E
30|$|SID {{can also}} be {{detected}} as an intra-abdominal cystic mass in prenatal ultrasonography [13].

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} {{a leading cause of}} death and the third most common cancer in Canada. Evidence {{suggests}} that screening can reduce mortality rates and the cost effectiveness of a program compares favourably with initiatives for breast and cervical cancer. The objectives of the Association des gastro-entérologues du Québec Task Force were to determine the need for a policy on screening for colorectal cancer in Quebec, to evaluate the testing methods available and to propose {{one or more of these}} alternatives as part of a formal screening program, if indicated. Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), endoscopy (including sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy), barium enema and virtual colonoscopy were considered. Although most clinical efficacy data are available for FOBT and sigmoidoscopy, there are limitations to programs based on these strategies. FOBT has a high false positive rate and a low detection yield, and even a combination of these strategies will miss 24 % of cancers. Colonoscopy is the best strategy to both detect and remove polyps and to diagnose colorectal cancer, with double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> also being a sensitive detection method. The Task Force recommended the establishment, in Quebec, of a screening program with five- to 10 -yearly double <b>contrast</b> barium <b>enema</b> or 10 -yearly colonoscopy for individuals aged 50 years or older at low risk. The program should include outcome monitoring, public and professional education to increase awareness and promote compliance, and central coordination with other provincial programs.
