5000|$|The {{origin of}} bubur ayam was {{probably}} derived from Chinese chicken congee. The traces of Chinese cuisine influences are {{the use of}} cakwe (youtiao), tongcay and soy sauce. Bubur ayam employs {{a wide range of}} poultry products, such as shredded chicken meat for the main dish and different dishes made <b>with</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>offal</b> as side delicacies. Bubur ayam is often eaten with the addition of boiled chicken egg, chicken liver, gizzard, intestines and uritan (premature chicken eggs acquired from butchered hens), served as satay. There are some variants of bubur ayam, such as bubur ayam Bandung and bubur ayam Sukabumi, both from West Java. The later variant uses raw telur ayam kampung (lit. [...] "village chicken egg", i.e. free-range eggs) buried under the hot rice congee to allow the egg to be half-cooked, with the other ingredients on top of the rice congee. The recipe and condiments of bubur ayam served by travelling vendors and warung are also slightly different with those served in fast food establishments or hotel restaurants.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} ninety six growing snails of mean weight 91. 23 ± 2. 4 g {{were used to}} {{determine}} the effects of partial or total replacement of local fish meal, a source of protein but expensive to a less expensive, alternative source, chicken offal in the diet of growing snails. Completely randomized design was used for the study. The feeding trial had four treatments, C 1, C 2, C 3 and C 4 in which fish meal fraction of the diets was replaced at 0, 50, 75 and 100 % <b>with</b> <b>chicken</b> <b>offal</b> respectively. The parameters taken were weight gain, feed intake. Feed conversion ratio, total feed cost, and cost per weight gain were calculated. The trial lasted for twelve weeks. Significant differences were not observed in the mean weekly feed intake of the snails in all the treatments. The mean weight gain in all the treatments were not significantly influenced by the inclusion of chicken offal in the diet (P> 0. 005). Total feed cost and cost/weight gain reduced as the level of the chicken offal increased while the lowest cost/weight gain was observed in C 4. The inclusion of Chicken offal in all the diets had no detrimental effect on the snails in all the treatments. Based on the present results chicken offal could replace local fish meal in the diet of growing snail up to 100 % and hereby reduce feed cos...|$|R

40|$|One {{hundred and}} fifty day-old broiler chicks {{were used for the}} study. 30 chicks were {{assigned}} to each dietary treatment, which was replicated thrice. The chicks were reared on a deep litter system with feed and water supplied ad-libitum. The experiment lasted for 5 weeks. The poultry offal used for the study was collected from a broiler processing farm in Ikorodu, Lagos. The boiled, cooled and dried poultry offal was crushed and fine-milled. Five experimental diets were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric with graded levels of poultry offal meal replacing fishmeal as follows: 0 %; 100 % (control), 25 %; 75 %, 50 %; 50 %, 75 %; 25 % and 100 %; 0 %. The average dry matter intake of <b>chickens</b> fed <b>with</b> poultry <b>offal</b> meal (POM) as replacement for fish meal (FM) increased as more poultry offal meal replaced fishmeal from 1210. 60 grammes in diet I (100 %FM) to 1289. 00 grammes in those fed diet V (100 %POM). However, there were no significant (P> 0. 05) differences in dry matter intake between the treatment means. The average body weight gain of broiler starters in the study which ranged between 603 grammes for chickens fed diet II (25 %POM) and 703. 80 grammes for those fed diet V (100 %POM) did not significantly (P> 0. 05) differ as the level of replacement of fishmeal by poultry <b>offal</b> meal increased. <b>With</b> the feed conversion ratio, though broiler chickens fed diets IV (75 %POM) and V (100 %POM) respectively showed negligible superiority (1. 83 and 1. 84) over others, there were no significant (P> 0. 05) differences among treatment means...|$|R

40|$|Background: Anti-ganglioside {{antibodies}} with a {{pathogenic potential}} {{are present in}} C. jejuni-associated Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) patients and are probably induced by molecular mimicry. Immunization studies in rabbits and mice have demonstrated that these anti-ganglioside antibodies can be induced using purified lipo-oligosaccharides (LOS) from C. jejuni in a strong adjuvant. Methodology/Principal Findings: To investigate whether natural colonization of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> a ganglioside-mimicking C. jejuni strain induces an anti-ganglioside response, and to investigate the diversity in anti-ganglioside response between and within genetically different chicken lines, we orally challenged <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> different C. jejuni strains. Oral challenge of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> a C. jejuni strain from a GBS patient, containing a LOS that mimics ganglioside GM 1, induced specific IgM and IgG anti-LOS and anti-GM 1 antibodies. Inoculation of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> the Penner HS: 3 serostrain, without a GM 1 -like structure, induced anti-LOS but no anti-ganglioside antibodies. We observed different patterns of anti-LOS/ganglioside response between and within the five strains of chickens. Conclusions: Natural infection of <b>chickens</b> <b>with</b> C. jejuni induces anti-ganglioside antibodies. The production of antibodies i...|$|R
