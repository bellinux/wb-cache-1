The aim of present work was to show the effect of various super disintegrants on the disintegration time and in vitro drug release rate.

The sodium starch glycolate, cross <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> and pregelatinized starch (Starch 1500) were used in different concentrations according to the simplex lattice design as the super disintegrants. The tablets were evaluated for diameter, thickness, hardness, friability, weight variation, wetting time, percentage of water absorption, disintegration time and in vitro dissolution studies. The disintegration time of all formulation showed less than 89 seconds. Formulation containing equal amount of Cross <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> and pregelatinized starch showed fastest disintegration than other formulations containing Starch 1500, cross <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> and sodium starch glycolate in various proportions and the percentage drug release was 99. 5 within 10 minutes...|$|E

As nifedipine is practically insoluble in water and aqueous fluids; its solid dispersions in CCS and SSG has markedly enhanced the dissolution rate of nifedipine. Matrix tablets formulated employing nifedipine dispersions in CCS and SSG with gum olibanum alone and in combinations with methocel K 4 M. The matrix tablets gave slow, controlled and complete release over a period of 12 hrs. Drug release from these tablets followed first order kinetics and the release was diffusion controlled.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{optimize}} and formulate fast disintegrating tablets (FDTs) for nausea and vomiting using aminoacetic acid, <b>carmellose</b> and <b>sodium</b> alginate with enough mechanical strength. Ondansetron HCl (water soluble) or domperidone (water insoluble) drug were added to FDTs and their disintegration behaviour was evaluated. Plackett Burman Screening Design was used to screen the independent active process variables [concentration of aminoacetic acid (X 1), concentration of carmellose (X 2) and tablet crushing strength (X 3) ] which were found to actively influence the dependent variables [disintegration time in the mouth (DT), wetting time (WT), and water absorption ratio (WAR) ] for both the drugs. Also, the coefficients of active variables (DT, WT and WAR) of FDTs containing domperidone was found to be significantly different (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) from the coefficients of active factors (X 1, X 2 and X 3) containing ondansetron HCl FDTs. Further, FDTs containing domperidone was prepared according to central composite design for estimating the effect of active factors (X 1, X 2, X 3) in extended spherical domain. The regression analysis of quadratic fit revealed that DT, WT and WAR were 98 % correlated with active factors (X 1, X 2 or X 3). The optimized domperidone FDTs were further compared with superdisintegrants (croscarmellose sodium or crospovidone). The data revealed that optimized domperidone FDTs were better than domperidone FDTs containing croscarmellose or crospovidone.

40|$|Purpose: Dry eye {{is often}} {{characterized}} by increased tear evaporation due to poor tear film quality, {{especially of the}} lipid component of the tear film. Using an environmental chamber to induce environmental stress, this study compared the effect of three lubricant eye drops on various aspects of tear physiology in a crossover design (evaporation was the principal outcome measure). Methods: Three eye drop formulas were tested: 0. 5 % <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> (Drop C), 0. 5 % <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> with added lipid (Drop C-L) and 1. 0 % glycerine with added lipid (Drop G-L). Nineteen control and 18 dry eye subjects used each product for 2 weeks, three times per day, in a random order, with a minimum 1 -week washout between treatment periods. Tear evaporation, break up time, osmolarity, tear structure (by interferometry) and patient symptoms were assessed with the subjects adapted for 10 min in an environmental chamber controlled at 20 % relative humidity and 22 C. The treatment effects were analyzed using general linear model repeated measures analyses of variance. Results: In dry eye subjects, evaporation, break up time, osmolarity and symptoms improved for all formulas (p 50. 05). Normal subjects showed some improvements: evaporation with C-L, osmolarity with C and symptoms with C-L and G-L. Change in evaporation was greater for both C-L and G-L versus C (p 50. 05), {{and there was a}} trend for C-L to reduce evaporation more than G-L (p 50. 11). There were no significant treatment effects on tear film structure. Conclusion: Overall, the eye drop formula containing both <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> and lipid (C-L) produced a greater treatment effect on tear evaporation than the other formulations containing only one of these ingredients. This study also demonstrates the utility of a controlled environmental chamber in showing the difference in performance between dry eye treatments...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of occlusion using hydrocolloid-containing patches on in-vitro triamcinolone acetonide (TACA) penetration of the epidermis while monitoring the uptake of water by the patches as a result of transepidermal water loss. The hydrocolloid patches were a laminate of a pressure-sensitive hydrophobic adhesive (containing a dispersion of 39 % of either pectin or <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium)</b> and a polyethylene film. The diffusion of a representative corticosteroid (TACA) through isolated epidermal sheet was shown to depend on the site from which the skin was removed. The two patch-types exhibited markedly different hydration rates when applied to the membranes. For example, after 96 h the <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> patch showed ten times the weight increase of the pectin patch. Epidermal diffusion rates were, however, similar, both showing a 3 - 4 -fold enhancement over unoccluded conditions. The increase in TACA diffusion with the patches can be explained by the increase in skin hydration that occurs during occlusion. Despite the large differences in transepidermal water transfer through the epidermal membranes with the two types of hydrocolloid patch, however, this level of stratum corneum hydration was apparently similar. As the rate of diffusion was also independent of hydrocolloid patch component, it seems possible that the hydrophobic component of the patch matrix may also influence the level of skin hydration and consequent drug diffusion...|$|E

Various parts of this tree are {{commonly}} used in traditional medicine to treat pain, fever, inflammation, hepatitis, gastric ulcer and other ailments. An oral suspension containing dried extract of A. moluccanus was developed and in vivo anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated. Extract 100 and 50 mg/ml loaded oral suspensions were prepared using different suspending agents. The formulations were analysed by their appearance, pH, density, redispersion time, rate of settling, rheological behaviour, distribution of particle size and zeta potential. The dose uniformity was determined by measuring the content of total phenolic compounds expressed in swertisin by a validated HPLC method, {{as well as the}} dissolution profile. The stability of oral suspensions was analysed in accelerated studies (40 °C for 6 months). The anti-inflammatory activity was analysed using an in vivo paw oedema model. The taste and odour of the suspensions were shown to be characteristic of the extract. <b>Carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> (CS; 0. 5 %) and microcrystalline cellulose and <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> mixture (MCCS; 1 %) showed better physical behaviour.

Objective: The present investigation reports incorporation of camphor, cross <b>carmellose</b> <b>sodium</b> (CCS) and spray dried lactose (SDL) into MCC pellets to enhance the dissolution rate of telmisartan. Materials and methods: A full factorial design (32) was used in the study.

Pellets were produced by extrusion–spheronization technique and evaluated for percentage yield, particle size analysis, flow characteristics, percentage porosity, drug content and in vitro drug release. Contour plots and 3 -D surface plots were presented for graphical expression of the results. Results and discussion: Pellet formulations exhibited acceptable morphological, flow and mechanical properties. As against to 38. 54 % drug release after 60 min with MCC pellets, pellets prepared with optimized formulation, composed of proper combination of MCC, SDL, camphor and CCS, released 100 % drug after 60 min.
