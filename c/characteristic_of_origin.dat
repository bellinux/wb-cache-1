Immigrants from advanced country groups outperform native internal migrants, while those from many African country groups underperform them. Immigrants with advanced degrees from certain country groups {{are also more likely}} to be employed in unskilled, informal sector jobs. Variation in outcomes across origin country groups is smaller at higher levels of education.

In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, origins are defined at discrete sites. Regular spacing and diverse firing <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>origins</b> {{are thought to}} be required for efficient completion of replication, especially in the presence of replication stress. However, a S. cerevisiae chromosome III harboring multiple origin deletions has been reported to replicate relatively normally, and yet how an origin-deficient chromosome could accomplish successful replication remains unknown. To address this issue, we deleted seven well-characterized origins from chromosome VI, and found that these deletions do not cause gross growth defects even in the presence of replication inhibitors. We demonstrated that the origin deletions do cause a strong decrease in the binding <b>of</b> the <b>origin</b> recognition complex. Unexpectedly, replication profiling of this chromosome showed that DNA replication initiates from non-canonical loci around deleted origins in yeast.

The parameter γ can be interpreted as a friction coefficient. We find such parameter values that critical cases in the stability problem are realized. We show that the characteristic equation for zero solution stability can have arbitrary many roots in the vicinity of imaginary axis. So, the critical case of an infinite dimension is realized. We construct normal forms analogues to describe dynamics <b>of</b> the <b>origin</b> equation.

40|$|The {{electron}} signatures {{which appear}} together with Alfven waves observed by the Freja satellite in the auroral region are reported. Precipitating electrons are detected both with {{and just before}} the wave. The observed Alfven waves must therefore be capable of accelerating electrons to higher energies than the local phase velocity of these waves {{in order for the}} electrons to move in advance of the wave. The <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> such electrons suggest electrons moving infront of the wave have <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> from warmer and lower density plasma while the electrons moving with the wave have <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> cooler and denser plasma. The pitch angle distribution of the electrons moving with the wave indicates that there is continuous acceleration of new particles by the wave, i. e. a propagating Alfven wave is the source of these electrons. A simple model of a propagating source is made to model the electrons that are moving in advance of the wave. Depending on whether accelerated electrons leave the wave above or below the altitude where the Alfven wave has the highest phase velocity, the detected electron signatures will be different; electron dispersion or potential drop like, respectively. It is shown that the Alfven wave acceleration can create electron signatures similar to inverted-V structures...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, policymakers and {{business}} leaders throughout New England have expressed concern regarding the region’s ability {{to attract and retain}} skilled workers, given the economic climate of the region compared with other parts of the nation. Indeed, net domestic migration for New England became increasingly negative after the 2001 recession, as the number of people leaving the region exceeded those entering. Examining the factors underlying these migration trends is important for determining what role, if any, public policy might play in addressing their potential impact on the region’s labor supply. Using a logistic migration model, this paper examines the relative role of economic factors—namely labor market conditions, per capita incomes, and housing affordability—in determining domestic state-to-state migration flows. Using such flows from the Internal Revenue Service for each of the 48 states in the continental United States from 1977 through 2006, the model controls for demographic <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> states as well as state-specific fixed amenities, such as climate, culture, and natural features. The model’s estimates show that while all three measures of relative economic conditions are significant determinants of migration, the magnitude of their impact varies. The estimates also show that the impact of these economic factors on state-to-state migration flows has changed considerably over time. For example, th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAccessibility {{improvement}} for pedestrians {{has received}} increasing attention in planning. However, pedestrian space {{is more likely}} to be designed only for individual streets to secure minimum easiness of walking, and little attention has been paid to developing a street network for pedestrians to walk around multiple destinations on a neighbourhood scale. There is also a lack of empirical analysis of how much pedestrian accessibility would vary depending on the <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> streets on routes to specific destinations. This paper is aimed at examining the spatial relationship between pedestrian flows by street type and various street characteristics around multiple destinations in a city centre. First, a literature review summarises what street characteristics should be considered in accessibility analysis for pedestrians. Then, a pedestrian flow model is developed in a way that measures accessibility with street <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>origins,</b> destinations, and routes on multi-scales from on-street ones to neighbourhood-scale ones. A multiple regression model is made using data from the West End area in London, in which street characteristics are taken for routes from each street segment to nearby stations and attractions. As a result, this analysis found that the route characteristics to a single nearest station and attraction can account for pedestrian flows well, but route characteristics to multiple nearby stations and attractions do not improve the model fit. These results are more prominent for pedestrianised streets. Their implication may be that these destinations are currently not linked well for pedestrians, and pedestrianisation is required to contribute more to the linkage...|$|R
