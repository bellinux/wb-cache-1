The {{large number of}} single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) available provides a powerful molecular resource for identifying complex genetic interactions associated with complex traits or diseases but also presents unprecedented data analysis challenges. In this work we developed new quantitative genetics methods and parallel <b>computing</b> <b>tools</b> to detect complex interactive SNP effects underlying complex traits or diseases using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The new quantitative genetics methods allow detection of novel interactions between genes, sex and environment including second order and third order gene-gene, gene-sex, gene-environment interactions, where each gene may have additive, dominance or parent-of-origin effects. The parallel <b>computing</b> <b>tools</b> allow such complex analysis to be conducted {{in a timely manner}} for any large scale GWAS and can be scalable to meet growing data analysis challenges in the future. The analytical and computing methods were applied to the analysis of a Holstein cattle GWAS data set and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) data. Significant epistasis and single-locus effects were detected affecting human cholestoral levels and dairy production, fertility and body traits. The analytical methods and <b>computing</b> <b>tools</b> will significantly facilitate the discovery of complex mechanisms underlying phenotypes using GWAS...|$|R

Methodology: An observational study with descriptive cases was designed, with no intervention, including patients from an urban, tertiary university hospital. Patients pending admittance were recruited, starting at the very first hours of the day, {{any day of the}} week. Inclusion criteria were age above 18 years old, with glycaemia > 150 mg/dl upon admittance to hospital (with a known diabetes or not) who were admitted to hospital from the Emergency Department. The study period included was from June to October 2012. The independent variables were age, sex, previous treatment for diabetes, type of diet prescribed upon admittance, corticosteroid treatment, serum creatinine and glycaemia upon admittance to the Emergency Department. The outcome variable was the treatment suggested by the software program, which was evaluated with 11 items gathered by the specific <b>computing</b> <b>tool</b> (GLIKAL©).
