40|$|Phosphatidylinositol-specific {{phospholipase}} C (PI-PLC) {{produced by}} Bacillus thuringiensis {{has been used}} as a probe for the distribution of phosphatidylinositol in hepatocyte membranes. Approx. 50 % of this phospholipid was hydrolysed in microsomal vesicles (endoplasmic reticulum) with no significant hydrolysis of the remaining membrane phospholipids. Latency of mannose- 6 -phosphatase was retained during treatment indicating that the vesicles remained impermeable. Stripping of the ribosomes did not increase hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol; however, when the vesicles were opened using dilute sodium carbonate, hydrolysis increased to greater than 90 %. Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol of Golgi membranes was 35 % and of plasma membranes was 50 %. After treatment with PI-PLC, radiolabelled secretory proteins were retained in Golgi membranes and trapped lactate dehydrogenase was retained in plasma-membrane preparations indicating that the vesicles remained <b>closed.</b> <b>Hydrolysis</b> of phosphatidylinositol increased to greater than 90 % when the membranes were opened by treatment with dilute sodium carbonate. These observations indicate that PI-PLC of Bacillus thuringiensis is a suitable probe for the distribution of phosphatidylinositol in membranes, and that in liver membranes this phospholipid occurs on each side of the bilayer, a topography consistent with its diverse roles...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the crystallographic {{snapshots}} of Rayment and his collaborators [Fisher, A. J., Smith, C. A., Thoden, J. B., Smith, R., Sutoh, K., Holden, H. M., & Rayment, I. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 8960 – 8972], we have understood some basic principles about the early stages of myosin catalysis, namely, ATP is drawn into the active site, over which the cleft <b>closes.</b> Catalyzed <b>hydrolysis</b> occurs, and the first product (orthophosphate) is released from the backdoor of the cleft. In the cleft-closing process, the active site incidentally signals its movement to a particular remote tryptophan residue, Trp- 512. In this work, we expand on some of these ideas to rationalize the behavior of a mutated system in action. From the behavior of recombinant myosin systems in which Arg- 247 and Glu- 470 were substituted in several ways, we draw the conclusions that (i) the force between Arg- 247 and γ-phosphate of ATP may assist in closing the cleft, and incidentally in signaling to the remote Trp, and (ii) in catalysis, Glu- 470 is involved in holding the lytic H 2 O (w 1). We also propose that w 1 and also a second water, w 2, enter into a structure that bridges Glu- 470 and the γ-phosphate of bound ATP, {{and at the same time}} positions w 1 for its in-line hydrolytic attack...|$|R
5000|$|The exact {{molecular}} {{details of}} the catalytic mechanism are still not fully understood. Although there is much debate on this issue, it seems certain that a [...] "closed" [...] conformation {{is required for the}} hydrolysis of ATP, and it is thought that the residues that are involved in the process move to the appropriate distance. The glutamic acid Glu137 {{is one of the key}} residues, which is located in subdomain 1. Its function is to bind the water molecule that produces a nucleophilic attack on the ATP’s γ-phosphate bond, while the nucleotide is strongly bound to subdomains 3 and 4. The slowness of the catalytic process is due to the large distance and skewed position of the water molecule in relation to the reactant. It is highly likely that the conformational change produced by the rotation of the domains between actin’s G and F forms moves the Glu137 <b>closer</b> allowing its <b>hydrolysis.</b> This model suggests that the polymerization and ATPase’s function would be decoupled straight away.|$|R
40|$|Protein hydrolysates were {{prepared}} {{from the head}} waste of Penaens vannamei, a China seawater major shrimp by autolysis method. Autolysis conditions (viz., temperature, pH and substrate concentration) for preparing protein hydrolysates from the head waste proteins were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) using a central composite design. Model equation was proposed {{with regard to the}} effect of temperature, pH and substrate concentration. Substrate concentration at 23 % (w/v), pH at 7. 85 and temperature at 50 degrees C were found to be the optimal conditions to obtain a higher degree of <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>close</b> to 45 %. The autolysis reaction was nearly finished in the initial 3 h. The amino acid compositions of the autolysis hydrolysates prepared using the optimized conditions in different time revealed that the hydrolysates {{can be used as a}} functional food ingredient or flavor enhancer. Endogenous enzymes in the shrimp heads had a strong autolysis capacity (AC) for releasing threonine, serine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan. Endogenous enzymes had a relatively lower AC for releasing cystine and glycine. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{building}} blocks of protein structure are defined stereo-chemically and have remained frozen to only poly-l alphabet. The D-enantiomer can be explored to diversify shapes of proteins stereochemically and diversity in shape may enhance proteins in the scope of functional design. Illustrating the scope, we describe here design of a hydrolase mimic over twenty Land D-alpha-amino-acid residues. The design is accomplished by mutating canonical poly-L beta-hairpin in a pair of cross-strand residues to D-stereochemical structure to provide a bend to bhairpin structure that allows its elaboration as a monomer freely soluble in water. The aromatic residues were suitably positioned in the designed mimic to stabilize the molecular fold and to bind aromatic substrate using pi-pi interaction. The catalytic triad residues were positioned in <b>close</b> proximity for <b>hydrolysis</b> of aromatic-anchored ligand. The designed peptide variants are proven to bind p-nitrophenyl phosphate using fluorescence studies and hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl acetate using UV-based enzyme kinetic assays. The study thus highlights the role of stereochemistry in design of novel folds with desired function...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{coordination}} of the magnesium ion in proteins by triphosphates {{plays an important}} role in catalytic hydrolysis of GTP or ATP, either in signal transduction or energy conversion. For example, in Ras the magnesium ion contributes to the catalysis of GTP hydrolysis. The cleavage of GTP to GDP and Pi in Ras switches off cellular signaling. We analyzed GTP hydrolysis in water, Ras, and Ras·Ras-GTPase-activating protein using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations. By comparison of the theoretical IR-difference spectra for magnesium ion coordinated triphosphate to experimental ones, the simulations are validated. We elucidated thereby how the magnesium ion contributes to catalysis. It provides a temporary storage for the electrons taken from the triphosphate and it returns them after bond cleavage and Pi release back to the diphosphate. Furthermore, the Ras·Mg 2 + complex forces the triphosphate into a stretched conformation in which the β- and γ-phosphates are coordinated in a bidentate manner. In this conformation, the triphosphate elongates the bond, which has to be cleaved during hydrolysis. Furthermore, the γ-phosphate adopts a more planar structure, driving the conformation of the molecule <b>closer</b> to the <b>hydrolysis</b> transition state. GTPase-activating protein enhances these changes in GTP conformation and charge distribution via the intruding arginine finger...|$|R
40|$|TRPM 7 is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} nonspecific cation {{channel that}} has been implicated in cellular Mg(2 +) homeostasis. We have recently shown that moderate overexpression of TRPM 7 in neuroblastoma N 1 E- 115 cells elevates cytosolic Ca(2 +) levels and enhances cell-matrix adhesion. Furthermore, activation of TRPM 7 by phospholipase C (PLC) -coupled receptor agonists caused a further increase in intracellular Ca(2 +) levels and augmented cell adhesion and spreading in a Ca(2 +) -dependent manner (1). Regulation of the TRPM 7 channel is not well understood, {{although it has been}} reported that PIP(2) <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>closes</b> the channel. Here we have examined the regulation of TRPM 7 by PLC-coupled receptor agonists such as bradykinin, lysophosphatidic acid, and thrombin. Using FRET assays for second messengers, we have shown that the TRPM 7 -dependent Ca(2 +) increase closely correlates with activation of PLC. Under non-invasive "perforated patch clamp" conditions, we have found similar activation of TRPM 7 by PLC-coupled receptor agonists. Although we could confirm that, under whole-cell conditions, the TRPM 7 currents were significantly inhibited following PLC activation, this PLC-dependent inhibition was only observed when [Mg(2 +) ](i) was reduced below physiological levels. Thus, under physiological ionic conditions, TRPM 7 currents were activated rather than inhibited by PLC-activating receptor agonists...|$|R
40|$|The cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) {{is a member}} of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily that functions as an epithelial chloride channel. Gating of the CFTR ion conduction pore involves a conserved irreversible cyclic mechanism driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis at two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) : formation of an intramolecular NBD dimer that occludes two ATP molecules opens the pore, whereas dimer disruption after ATP <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>closes</b> it. CFTR dysfunction resulting from inherited mutations causes CF. The most common CF mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (DeltaF 508), impairs both protein folding and processing and channel gating. Development of DeltaF 508 CFTR correctors (to increase cell surface expression) and potentiators (to enhance open probability, Po) is therefore a key focus of CF research. The practical utility of 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) benzoate (NPPB), one of the most efficacious potentiators of DeltaF 508 CFTR identified to date, is limited by its pore-blocking side effect. NPPB-mediated stimulation of Po is unique in that it involves modulation of gating transition state stability. Although stabilization by NPPB of the transition state for pore opening enhances both the rate of channel opening and the very slow rate of nonhydrolytic closure, because of CFTR's cyclic gating mechanism, the net effect is Po stimulation. In addition, slowing of ATP hydrolysis by NPPB delays pore closure, further enhancing Po. Here we show that NPPB stimulates gating at a site outside the pore and that these individual actions of NPPB on CFTR are fully attributable to one or the other of its two complementary molecular parts, 3 -nitrobenzoate (3 NB) and 3 -phenylpropylamine (3 PP), both of which stimulate Po: the pore-blocking 3 NB selectively stabilizes the transition state for opening, whereas the nonblocking 3 PP selectively slows the ATP hydrolysis step. Understanding structure-activity relationships of NPPB might prove useful for designing potent, clinically relevant CFTR potentiators...|$|R
40|$|Die Proteinbiosynthese (Translation) ist ein für alle Lebewesen zentraler Prozess, bei dem in mehreren Schritten die genetische Information der DNA in die Aminosäuresequenz eines Proteins übersetzt wird. Die Translation setzt sich aus vier Phasen zusammen, der Initiation, der Elongation, der Termination und dem Ribosom‐Recycling. Dem Recycling der Ribosomen kommt dabei eine entscheidende Schlüsselfunktion zu, da es die Termination mit einer neu eingeleiteten Initiation verbindet und somit den Prozess der Proteinbiosynthese zu einem sich wiederholenden Zyklus macht. Der Prozess des Recyclings wird hierbei hauptsächlich von dem ATP‐bindenden Protein ABCE 1 umgesetzt, welches das Ribosom (80 S/ 70 S) in seine große (60 S/ 50 S) und kleine (40 S/ 30 S) Untereinheit spaltet. Ribosom‐Recycling findet dabei nicht nur innerhalb eines korrekt ablaufenden Zyklus der Proteinbiosynthese statt, sondern auch an leeren Ribosomen sowie während der Ribosomen‐Biogenese und sogenannter mRNA surveillance‐Vorgänge, wenn die Translationsmaschinerie z. B. auf Grund von sekundären Strukturen der mRNA unwiderruflich gestoppt wird [...] . Protein {{synthesis}} is {{a central}} process within every living cell, where information embodied in the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA is translated into the primary sequence of proteins. The translation procedure comprises four steps: initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling. Ribosome recycling orchestrated by the ATP‐binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCE 1, renders mRNA translation into a cyclic process, connecting termination with re initiation. In Archaea and Eukarya, the ABC protein ABCE 1 catalyzes ribosome recycling by splitting the ribosome (80 S/ 70 S) into the small 40 S/ 30 S and large 60 S/ 50 S subunits, providing them for the next translation round. The ABC‐type ATPase {{one of the most}} conserved proteins, present in all Archaea and Eukarya, but not in Bacteria, is essential for life in all organisms examined so far. ABCE 1 was initially identified as RNase L inhibitor (Rli 1), involved in the antiviral RNA immunity, and as host protein 68 (HP 68) playing a role in HIV capsid assembly. However, the strong sequence conservation of ABCE 1 points towards a more fundamental function within cell homeostasis, which was found by its involvement in various translation processes. ABCE 1 {{turned out to be the}} major ribosome recycling factor indispensable for life in Eukarya and Archaea, being involved in canonical translation, mRNA surveillance, ribosome biogenesis, and translation initiation. Recent functional and structural data provided first insights into the mechanism of ABCE 1 in ribosome recycling. The nucleotide‐binding domains (NBDs) sandwich two ATP molecules in the NBD 1 ‐NBD 2 interface causing an NBD engagement, which is released upon ATP hydrolysis. In case of ABCE 1, this ATP‐dependent tweezer‐like motion of the NBDs transfers mechanical energy to the ribosome and tears the subunits apart. The FeS‐cluster domain may swing out of the NBD cleft into the inter‐subunit space of the ribosome, which drives the subunits apart either directly or via the bound a/eRF 1. Hence, the subunits are released and the post‐splitting complex (PSC, 40 S/ 30 S∙ABCE 1 ∙ATP) is available for re‐initiation events, presumably occurring via the known interactions of ABCE 1 with initiation factors. One of the most crucial aspects of this model is the nucleotide‐dependent conformational switch of ABCE 1, which drives ribosomal subunit splitting. However, the conformational states, which ABCE 1 undergoes during ribosome recycling, including their mechanistic importance for its diverse functions, remain unknown. Further, the exact role and movement of the essential FeScluster domain during ribosome recycling are not yet understood. Additional, it remains elusive where ABCE 1 is bound in the post‐splitting complex and how the splitting mechanism is regulated concerning the asymmetric NBDs and the coupling of nucleotide binding with NBD <b>closing</b> and ATP <b>hydrolysis.</b> Thus, in order to monitor the conformational dynamics of the ribosome recycling factor ABCE 1 two complementing methods in structural biology, namely single‐molecule based Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) and pulsed electron‐electron double resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy were applied. Single‐molecule FRET as an integrated biophysical approach based on Förster resonance energy transfer and single‐molecule detection was used to understand the fundamental molecular principles of ABCE 1. Contrary to the anticipated two‐state model of ABC proteins, it was shown in this thesis that both nucleotide‐binding sites of ABCE 1 are always in a dynamic equilibrium between conformational states with distinct properties: open, intermediate, and closed. The equilibrium in the two nucleotide‐binding sites is distinctly affected when ABCE 1 interacts with ribosomal subunits and nucleotides. While ABCE 1 can adopt all three conformational states in its free or 30 S bound situation, the closed state has the highest affinity for 30 S subunit. Further, dissociation of ABCE 1 from the small ribosomal subunit, a step that completes the recycling process, is followed by the opening of the NBSs. Hence, the current findings have important implications not only for ribosome recycling but represent a new paradigm for the molecular mechanisms of twin‐ATPases. The complementing PELDOR measurements provide the advantage of high distance precision and reliability studying macromolecular complexes. Distance distributions of a number of ABCE 1 variants even bound to the 1 ‐MDa post‐splitting complex (30 S∙ABCE 1 ∙AMP‐PNP), composed of the 16 S rRNA, 28 ribosomal proteins, and ABCE 1, was analyzed. Thus, the available crystal structures of ABCE 1 in the open state were validated, since all distances of ABCE 1 measured in this study perfectly correspond to this crystallized state. Unfortunately, ABCE 1 could not be trapped in the closed state under the experimental conditions applied, although plenty different approaches to stabilize this state were performed. In the second part of this study the architecture yet unknown of the 1 ‐MDa post splitting complex (40 S/ 30 S∙ABCE 1 ∙ATP), concerning especially the ABCE 1 binding site and its interactions with translational proteins, was probed by a method, which combines chemical cross linking with mass‐spectrometry (XL‐MS). Following this approach, it was demonstrated that ABCE 1 remains bound at the translational GTPase‐binding site after ribosome splitting, contacting the S 24 e protein of the small subunit. The platform for the intensive contacts to the small ribosomal subunit is thereby provided by the unique helix‐loop‐helix motif of ABCE 1. Notably, the FeScluster domain of ABCE 1 undergoes a large rotational and translational rearrangement towards the small ribosomal subunit S 12 upon nucleotide‐dependent closure of the NBDs. Thus, a key complex in the translational cycle, resembling the link between translation initiation and ribosome recycling processes, was reconstituted and structurally analyzed...|$|R
