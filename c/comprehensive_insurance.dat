5000|$|<b>Comprehensive</b> <b>insurance</b> {{covers all}} of the above and damage to the vehicle caused by the driver themselves, as well as {{vandalism}} and other risks. This is usually the most expensive type of insurance. Interestingly, it is custom in the UK for insurance customers to refer to their <b>Comprehensive</b> <b>Insurance</b> as [...] "Fully Comprehensive" [...] or popularly, [...] "Fully Comp". This is a tautology as the word 'Comprehensive' means full. [...] Some classes of vehicle ownership, or use, are [...] "Crown Exempt" [...] from the requirement to be covered under the Act including vehicles owned or operated by certain councils and local authorities, national park authorities, education authorities, police authorities, fire authorities, health service bodies, the security services and vehicles used to or from Shipping Salvage purposes. Although exempt from the requirement to insure this provides no immunity against claims being made against them, so an otherwise Crown Exempt authority may chose to insure conventionally, preferring to incur the known expense of insurance premiums rather than accept the open-ended exposure of effectively, self-insuring under Crown Exemption.|$|E

5000|$|Scheduled health {{insurance}} plans are an expanded form of Hospital Indemnity plans. In recent years, these plans have taken the name mini-med plans or association plans. These plans may provide benefits for hospitalization, surgical, and physician services. However, they {{are not meant to}} replace a traditional <b>comprehensive</b> health <b>insurance</b> plan.
