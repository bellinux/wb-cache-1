2500|$|Volume 1 {{focuses on}} the {{introduction}} of the characters of the story, marking the events that lead to their team formations. All the while, mysterious thefts of Dust are occurring around the city of Vale, notably organized by the show's antagonist, Roman Torchwick. Volume 2 follows up from these events of Volume 1, and team RWBY sets out in order to investigate the meaning behind these thefts. They aim to discover the villain's plans for the city of Vale before the Vytal Festival—a festival between the four kingdoms of Remnant where they have their best students demonstrate their skills and abilities in celebration of the peace between all four kingdoms. Volume 3 starts with the beginning of the Vytal Festival; however, a sinister plot lurks behind the celebratory events, and the heroes <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to prepare for the evil that is coming. Volume 4 takes place six to eight months following the events of Volume 3, with the members of Team RWBY separated and {{in different parts of the}} globe, mainly trying to get to [...] "Mistral" [...] (another location in the series) where another Huntsman Academy is located, to prepare it for a new evil. Volume 5 follows the members of Team RWBY each making their way to Mistral, as well as picking themselves back up after recovering during the previous Volume.|$|E

5000|$|Dave Schilling of The Guardian panned Gooding's performance, writing: [...] "his whiny, gravely voice sounds {{absolutely}} {{nothing like the}} real O. J. Simpson’s deep, commanding tones." [...] Michael Starr of New York Post was also highly critical of Gooding's performance, saying that he [...] "portrays Simpson as a hollow, sad-sack cipher who speaks in a high-pitched whine and sleepwalks in a fog he never shakes after being arrested for the brutal double murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman. He’s a forgettable, annoying presence in what should be a showcase role for Gooding — who, to be fair, is reciting lines written for him, so he <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with the material."

Late into the night with Nick, Liz and Uncle Jed all keeping vigil but dozing off, Tugfire gets up, and going straight to Nick, seems to be all right. After a quick examination, Uncle Jed believes he is indeed all right and will be able to race. In the excitement of Tugfire’s improved condition, Liz gives Nick a quick kiss, which is the first time Nick sees Liz in a more romantic light.|$|E

Published in January 2000, Database Nation {{provides}} {{the reader with}} {{a clear understanding of}} what privacy is today. Starting with a broad definition of privacy, he goes in depth on various new technologies and practices that have reshaped our lives, at the cost of privacy. Garfinkel goes into great detail to describe each type of privacy intrusion. [...] The current system prevents the individual from resisting; the individual <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to maintain his privacy. His most important point is that the right to privacy is a constitutionally protected right and it {{does not have to be}} traded away for our way of life. He calls the government to take a stand for privacy by establishing an agency that will enforce privacy laws and act as a representative of individual privacy. Overall, he hopes to increase public awareness on the issue of privacy and raise the standard for individual privacy.|$|E

50|$|An ongoing {{problem with}} the engines was their {{propensity}} for surging or stalling with 68 incidents reported between 2003 and October 2016 though this rate had reduced after {{the introduction of the}} Block 3 engine version. The US Naval Air Systems Command intends to award Rolls Royce two contracts to examine the effectiveness of proposed reliability improvements, the first is a software tweak to the engine management software for the compressor guide vanes that internal testing showed could improve surge margin by 0.8% at sea level and 3% at altitude. The second is the discovery that a temperature sensor at the inlet of the compressor sends incorrect readings leading to 2.5% out of 4% steady power shortfall at the compressors correct rotational speed again correctable with a software fix. In addition Bell-Boeing are developing an inlet barrier system to reduce the power loss from the engine ingesting dust and sand particles to supplement the engines existing centrifugal based particle separators as they <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to improve the quality of}} air they receive.|$|E
5000|$|Participant {{observation}} <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for {{the researcher}} because the sole {{presence of the}} researcher in the field will influence the participants' behavior (see:observer-expectancy effect). Researchers engaging {{in this type of}} qualitative research method must be aware that participants may act differently or put up a facade that is in accordance to what they believe the researcher is studying. [...] This is why it is important to employ rigor in any qualitative research study. A useful method of rigor to employ is member-checking or triangulation. [...] While gathering data through participant observation, investigator triangulation would be a way to ensure that one researcher is not letting his or her biases or personal preferences in the way of observing and recording meaningful experiences. As the name suggests, investigator triangulation involves multiple research team members gathering data about the same event, but this method ensures a variety of recorded observations due to the varying theoretical perspectives of each research team member. In other words, triangulation, be it data, investigator, theory or methodological triangulation, is a form of cross-checking information.|$|E

5000|$|David Drake of Pitchfork Media wrote, [...] "irony and irreverence <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> lifting on {{a record}} this thin. Neon Icon is hardly {{an affront to}} hip-hop’s very foundation; instead, it’s an adequate, listenable rap album, and for a {{part-time}} rapper/full-time jaw-dropper, there couldn’t be a more damning outcome." [...] Jesse Fairfax of HipHopDX stated, [...] "Neon Icon seems aimless and not very well thought out. There are occasional hilarious moments; he throws pesos at strippers and refers to himself as “The White Wesley Snipes.” Riff ratchets up the oddity factor and gets creativity points for rhyming over Mac Miller’s sparse piano keys {{and the sound of}} a skittering dolphin (“Aquaberry Dolphin”). But on face value, Neon Icon is neither entertaining as sheer parody, nor a passable attempt at making a sincere Hip Hop album when judged by its merits." [...] Justin Block of XXL said, [...] "The final Neon Icon product is merely 15 songs picked in the hope of just one catching some crossover play. There are many opportunities on this album for that. But on the whole, it’s completely incohesive and difficult to listen to. In some ways, Neon Icon is a sunk cost album after delays and the sheer amount of material recorded. It pans out as—at the very least—a unique and varied production that asks to be received seriously, even if Riff Raff’s choppy, uneasy flow and absurdist imagery runs counter to that." ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 16, 2016, Nichols, in an {{interview}} with Vox’s Gregory Ellwood, spoke of when development on Loving first began four years ago, he thought the film would help influence the Supreme Court's debate over same-sex marriage, in which Nichols stated, [...] "the verdict came in there was this idea that it was all going to be taken care of, and of course it's not ... You have religious liberty laws added and you soon realize that the Supreme Court <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> The letter of the law sometimes gets it right. But {{it takes a long time}} for society to get it right, and that is what has always been surprising to me. We never got over that hurdle, and maybe we never will." [...] Speaking at the press conference for the film in Cannes, on May 16, 2016, Negga spoke of her hopes that the issue addressed in the film will become part of a broader discussion. On May 20, 2016, during a Q&A session at Cannes when asked of the film's focus, Nichols speaks of the topics of race and marriage inequality, wherein he states, [...] "... the conversation about racism in the US is finally starting to get serious.

Had I tried to make a movie that encompasses the civil rights movement, I would feel like a fraud." ...|$|E
5000|$|Views of {{the acting}} {{of the two}} leads were often positive. The Daily Californian conceded that [...] "Despite the plot's failings, Cuthbert does a convincing job in her role, exuding an outer shell so tough that when her inner, softer layers emerge, it's a natural change of character." [...] Empire Movies agreed, commenting that [...] "this is Elisha Cuthbert's best film {{performance}} to date. Cuthbert's Nina has {{the majority of the}} most graphic and disturbing dialogue in the film, especially during one particular lunchroom scene where the camera is close up on Cuthbert and Belle's faces." [...] Metroactive also noted that [...] "Belle nearly carries The Quiet in her close-ups." [...] SFStation agreed that [...] "performance wise, The Quiet belongs to Camilla Belle and Elisha Cuthbert," [...] noting that [...] "Belle ... has to act through body language and facial expressions and mostly carries it off, but even a talented actress <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> with such a passive role ... Cuthbert acquits herself well in the more active, substantive role (again, for the most part), but her performance is undermined by the questionable decision to put her character in skimpy clothing." [...] However, Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle dissented, arguing that [...] "Cuthbert flounces around a lot but doesn't have the range to express Nina's feelings." [...] Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe said of Belle that [...] "on screen she's hollow. The film is already visually dead, and it dies a little more whenever she's alone in a scene, which is often." ...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} ways in which {{touch-points}} can influence the pre-purchase stage of the consumer’s decision making process. The pre-purchase stage can be said {{to be one of the}} most important stages of the consumer decision making process as it is where the consumer recognizes that they have a need for a product or a service. It is at this point of realization that pre-purchase touch-points are crucial, because of the fact that this is the stage where the consumer actively searches for information about a certain product. Such a search for information can be conducted via advertising, social media, internet search, word-of-mouth and family and friends’ experiences etc. It is important that during this stage, in order for consumers to consider purchasing from a brand, that they create relevant touch-points that increase brand appeal. To further reiterate such a statement, in the present day, consumers have access to multiple electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and television and are sometimes connected to all such devices simultaneously. As a result, brands may not acquire the desired amount of exposure because of the consumer’s tendency to frequently switch from one device to another and from one task to another task. Therefore, brands must create short and engaging advertisements in order to capture the attention of the consumer during the pre-purchase stage of his or her decision making process. Such action will ensure that the consumer will be able to relate to a brand and will instil the belief that the brand has their interests at heart. Although brands or companies cannot precisely manage the touch-points at the pre-purchase stage to work in their favour, they <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as to make sure that they monitor the channels by which consumers search for product/service information to make sure they are readily accessible.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the praise}} {{for the rest of}} the cast, Travolta and Gooding's {{respective}} portrayals of Shapiro and Simpson have been met with mixed reviews by critics. Brian Lowry of Variety called Travolta [...] "awful" [...] in the role, adding: [...] "Yes, Shapiro spoke in stiff, measured tones, but the actor's overly mannered line readings turn the attorney into a buffoon, in sharp contrast to the more nuanced portrayals around him." [...] Nicole Jones of Vanity Fair called his performance [...] "campy and calculated." [...] Dan Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also criticized his performance, calling it [...] "a mesmerizingly bad performance from the eyebrows down." [...] He also wrote that [...] "His unnecessary accent varies by episode, and Travolta's laser intensity feels arch and almost kabuki at times, turning Shapiro into a terrifying character from the next American Horror Story installment, rather than a part of this ensemble." [...] Maureen Ryan of Vanity Fair, conversely, became more impressed with Travolta as the season progressed: [...] "I started in the realm of puzzled disbelief, arrived at amusement, and ultimately traveled to a place of sincere appreciation. You simply can't take your eyes off Travolta, and that is a form of enchantment." [...] Dave Schilling of The Guardian panned Gooding's performance, writing: [...] "his whiny, gravely voice sounds absolutely nothing like the real O.J. Simpson's deep, commanding tones." [...] Michael Starr of New York Post also was highly critical of Gooding's performance, saying that he [...] "portrays Simpson as a hollow, sad-sack cipher who speaks in a high-pitched whine and sleepwalks in a fog he never shakes after being arrested for the brutal double murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.

[...] On the other hand, Joe McGovern was more positive on Gooding's performance, writing that his casting [...] "takes a risk and pulls it off." [...] In spite of the mixed reviews on their performances, Gooding and Travolta received Emmy nominations. Additionally, Travolta was among the recipients for Outstanding Limited Series, being one of the show's producers.|$|E
