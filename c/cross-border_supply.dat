40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{decision}} support system (DSS) to enhance the performance of <b>cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chain, the goal of which is to improve order planning and fulfill customer orders within the warehouse. Design/methodology/approach - An intelligent DSS, namely order picking planning system (OPPS) with the adoption of case-based reasoning, is proposed to support managers in making appropriate order fulfilling decisions when an order involves cross-border activities. Similar cases in the past are retrieved and adapted in reference to the new order. A case study is then conducted to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. Findings - Recommendations are given to replace the objective decision-making process in <b>cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chain with the help of the DSS. The warehouse order planning time has been reduced and useful information from past order records can be applied to solve new problems. Originality/value - With the increasing demand for material sourcing across different places, <b>cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chain has raised the concern for manufacturers to seek lower material and rental costs.

Using a set of criteria that can be identified from the EU VAT program for the single market, we analyze the potential superiority of the Commission’s 1996 VAT proposal and four alternative VAT systems over the current transitional regime. We argue that the recent withdrawal of the 1996 VAT proposal is economically beneficial, as this VAT reform would have generated substantial costs for EU member states due to losses in national tax autonomy and adverse incentives in VAT collection and control.

30|$|In today’s world {{agriculture}} {{has to be}} {{more intensive}} to feed a booming world population. The detrimental impacts of conventional agriculture can be widely known including water pollution, land degradation, soil erosion, an increase in pest resistance, pesticide drift and diffusion throughout the food chain and ecological equilibrium disruption (Altieri and Koohafkan 2008). Productivity has no longer been seen as a solely metric to evaluate agricultural development. Sustainable agriculture has been gaining significant attention from farmers, policy makers and consumers worldwide (Theocharopoulos et al. 2012). Sustainable agricultural supply chain management can be understood as managing resources and risks to create a more effective, efficient and productive supply chain network in order to produce more valuable and competitive agriculture commodities from the same land area while reducing negatively environmental impacts and increasing contributions to environmental improvements and the development of societies (Pretty et al. 2011). Furthermore, <b>cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chains are admittedly becoming increasingly popular in agriculture. Local famers in developing countries have connections with traders in developed countries to sell their products at higher prices, achieving a vertical <b>cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chain network (Jaffee and Siegel 2008). <b>Cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chains not only make profit for individuals or separate companies, but can also stimulate the development of local agriculture, boost the economy, reduce the unemployment rate, develop the sustainability of the societies and environment, and secure global food security (Roekel et al. 2002). However, when a <b>cross-border</b> <b>supply</b> chain becomes more popular in the agricultural sector, the supply chain will experience increasing risks such as policy and institutional related risk, operational managerial related risks. For this reason, managing a sustainable supply chain is vital in order to maintain long-term business relationships and stabilise the economic development of the world (Farina and Reardon 2000).|$|E

The paper contributes to a debate about the problem faced by the water sector in general, namely that prices and tariffs are almost universally below the full-cost of supply. This means that inefficiencies exist and needs to be carefully examined based on proper allocation of variable and fixed costs of water abstraction. Analyzed water pricing of existing cross-border WSS clearly demonstrates a wide plethora of applied water pricing approaches mainly based on pure negotiation principles demonstrating different bargaining positions of partners. In order to overcome this situation applicable water pricing principles were analyzed. National guidelines and academic publications endorse two possible approaches: marginal cost approach and recovery of full cost approach.

This study applies an accessibility approach to investigate for most municipalities in ten countries in mainland West Europe if foreign transport supply is lagging behind, and if population growth in these municipalities has been affected by the limits that national borders have imposed on market access. To do so, data describing historical population changes and road networks between 1961 and 2011 have been used. The results show that in the study area, cross-border transport accessibility was not at a disadvantage in 1961 and has since then grown even more than domestic accessibility. However, municipal population growth has depended almost exclusively on domestic market access. Processes of economic international integration in the study area are found to coincide with the growth of cross-border accessibility, but do not have a clear coincidence with the effects of cross-border accessibility on population growth.

40|$|A recent {{string of}} "new {{economic}} geography" (NEG) models has set {{focus on the}} impacts of trade liberalisation on the intra-national distribution of economic activity. What the existing contributions {{have in common is}} a basic two-sector assumption (agriculture/manufacturing) and a resulting focus {{on the question of whether}} liberalisation leads to a greater concentration of aggregate manufacturing activity. Reconsidering these models from a multi-sectoral perspective, the aim is to allow for sectoral differences in the spatial adjustments to liberalisation. This introduces a conceptual nexus between comparative advantage (CA) -type sectoral recomposition effects of trade and NEG-type spatial adjustments. In the analysis of Mexican manufacturing location 1993 - 2003, incipient empirical evidence is found in favour of the hypothesis that sectors characterised by a revealed comparative advantage and/or <b>cross-border</b> intermediate <b>supplies</b> grow faster in regions with good foreign market access, whereas import competing ones gain in relative terms in regions with higher "natural protection" from poor market access. The relevancy of the proposed NEG/CA framework concerns both efficiency and equity objectives of trade adjustment policies, and opens a new perspective on the long-run effects of trade on spatial inequality.

40|$|Paper part of Energy Forum study "The Energy Dimension in Russian Global Strategy"The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to clarify the {{prospects}} for energy links between Russia and the Asia Pacific region (primarily Northeast Asia). [1] Russia is important for Northeast Asia as a sizable potential supplier of oil and natural gas. The future of Russia’s energy links with this large energy consuming area is assessed in the context of the nation’s domestic priorities, its potential to fulfill the role of a massive energy supplier and Russia’s long-term plans to export oil and gas and diversity markets. The most important among the topics discussed in this paper is the capacity of Russia to deliver energy to Asian regional markets on a large scale. Russia’s Eastern neighbors generally underestimate this capacity. This paper begins with a brief overview of the energy links between Russia and Europe, as well as an interview of oil production dynamics in recent years. There are certain misconceptions concerning plans to construct an export-oriented delivery infrastructure for oil transportation in Eastern Russia. More specifically, the pipeline routes to Nakhodka and Daqing are commonly seen as mutually exclusive projects. Initially, Russia’s state oil transportation monopoly, Transneft, proposed a 3, 765 km-long pipeline with a capacity of 1 million barrels per day (b/d) from Angarsk to Nakhodka only, including a deep-water port and an oil terminal with storage tanks. [2] Later, a pipeline to China was added to this plan, as a replacement for the project backed by Russia’s Yukos and the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). This paper provides more details on the routes of these pipelines and some background information related to the design of the integrated system. Detailed and balanced information on Russia’s long-term plans to export oil and gas to Northeast Asia is often missing. In this regard, the Energy Storage to 2020 [3] adopted in 2003 proposes important changes in Russia’s long-term production and export plans for oil and natural gas projects in Eastern Siberia and the Far Eastern region. The plan specifies that towards the end of the projected period, oil and natural gas exports to Asia should respectively amount to one-third and one-sixth of their total <b>cross-border</b> <b>supplies.</b> This paper addresses some issues related to natural gas projects in Eastern Siberia and prospects for the available gas reserves to be monetized, utilized domestically and exported. Finally, this paper examines the problem of dealing with Russia as a major supplier of oil by the oil importing economies in the context of their policies towards the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ...|$|R

40|$|EU VAT {{authorities}} {{are close to}} turning the tables on missing traders. For many years organized fraudsters have been stealing huge amounts of VAT on the domestic re-sale of exempt <b>cross-border</b> <b>supplies.</b> Losses have been enormous whether the transactions are in goods (notably cell phones and computer chips) or in tradable services (CO 2 permits and VoIP). No market has been safe from the fraudsters. Answers are developing, but these answers may look more like Armageddon than measured enforcement. Solutions are so draconian, and so all-encompassing that very few intra-community traders will feel safe from the gathering storm. The situation is not optimal, but {{it appears to be}} where we are headed. This paper discusses the alignment of (1) the joined cases of Axel Kittel v. Belgium and Belgium v. Recolta Recycling SPRL; (2) the Criminal Proceedings against R; and (3) the Council Directive 2010 / 24 /EU of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties, and other measures. A concluding section presents a series of six hypothetical fact patterns that apply these imperatives. In a nutshell, the argument presented through these hypotheticals is that Kittel is not for domestic-only application. Kittel responds just as effectively to multi-jurisdictional missing trader fact patterns as it does to domestic patterns. Secondly, it argues that “R” is an effective backstop to Kittel when tax authorities attack missing trader fraud across Community borders. Third, it argues that MARC provides sweeping cross-jurisdictional investigative assistance to any Member State that is pursuing recovery from a fraudster, or group of fraudsters. And finally, it argues that because Member States are under an affirmative obligation to pursue missing traders throughout the Community to protect the common system of VAT from assault by criminals, these tools are being readied for use in a wide-ranging wave of MTIC enforcement efforts throughout the Community. MARC’s enhanced investigative and enforcement powers allow/compel an easy flow of information, notification and protective measures among the member States. Multiple recoveries are a very distinct possibility. The EU VAT does not have a mechanism that assures one recovery, and neither the ECJ nor the judiciary of the member States seem anxious to find one. This may all be the result of the severity of the missing trader problem coming home to roost, but it is not good for legitimate business. Unfortunately we may witness a perfect storm.
