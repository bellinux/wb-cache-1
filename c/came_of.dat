5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing <b>came</b> <b>of</b> it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E
5|$|French rugby <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s: they won their first Five Nations {{championship}} and completed a successful tour of South Africa.

France won their first outright Five Nations championship in 1959; they won with two wins, a draw (against England) and a defeat (against Ireland).|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner {{was hired as}} director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous.

Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4million, turning down all three roles.|$|E

5|$|John de Vieuxpont died in 1241, {{before he}} <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was {{not old enough}} to inherit, so the family's lands {{remained}} in wardship. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age in around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He {{was one of the}} northern lords that revolted in support of Simon de Montfort in the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King HenryIII. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the shrievalty of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.|$|E
5|$|Once the new king, Edward III, <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age {{and assumed}} {{personal}} control of government, he annulled {{the charges against}} his uncle. The title and estates of the Earl of Kent descended on Edmund's son, also called Edmund. When this Edmund died, in 1331, his brother John became earl. Though he was officially exonerated, Edmund did not enjoy a great reputation during his life and afterwards, due to his unreliable political dealings.|$|E
5|$|Robert's father, William Tatton, {{drowned in}} the River Mersey when Robert was 10 years old. As the only male heir Robert {{inherited}} his father's estate in Wythenshawe, but as a minor he was made a ward of the king, Charles I, until he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age. On 9January 1628, Robert married Anne Brereton, the third daughter of William Brereton of Ashley. The couple went on to have four sons and two daughters.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of food riots had ended by 1801, {{and there were}} certain political undertones to the actions, though lack of leadership meant that little <b>came</b> <b>of</b> it.

5|$|The {{notion of}} making an {{animated}} adaptation of Valérian dates back to at least 1976. In 1982, Mézières produced concept art for an episode titled The Asteroids of Shimballil (Les Astéroïdes de Shimballil) which was later published in 2000 as an appendix to the album release of Bad Dreams. In 1991, Dargaud Films financed {{the production of a}} three-minute pilot, directed by Bernard Deyriès and animated by Studio 32 in Paris and Luxembourg, but nothing <b>came</b> <b>of</b> this venture. Several stills from this pilot episode were published in Mézières Extras. Another pilot, directed by Florient Ferrier, was made by the French animation studio 2 Minutes in 2001. Nothing <b>came</b> <b>of</b> this attempt either.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of San Juan were furious with Capt. Rivero-Méndez and blamed {{him for the}} destruction wreaked on their city by American bombardments.

5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess.

Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing <b>came</b> <b>of</b> the submission.|$|E
5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he <b>came</b> <b>of</b> age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
