5|$|Research at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson {{into contact}} with medical {{researchers}} investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance {{was the work of}} National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide <b>carcinogenesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to <b>carcinogenesis.</b> A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. <b>Carcinogenesis</b> in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
25|$|When the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) exposed {{male and}} female rats and mice to {{naphthalene}} vapors on weekdays for two years, {{male and female}} rats exhibited evidence of <b>carcinogenesis</b> with increased incidences of adenoma and neuroblastoma of the nose, female mice exhibited some evidence of <b>carcinogenesis</b> based on increased incidences of alveolar and bronchiolar adenomas of the lung, and male mice exhibited no evidence of <b>carcinogenesis.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{molecular}} <b>carcinogenesis</b> of canine mammary {{tumors are}} not completely understand. However, the increasing information on molecular pathways involved in the <b>carcinogenesis</b> of this canine tumor has potential to complement and refine the current diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this tumor type. Furthermore, current data show that significant similarities and differences exist between canine and human mammary tumors at the molecular level.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} of <b>carcinogenesis</b> and cancer treatment that fall outside the mainstream of scientific opinion, due to lack of scientific rationale, logic, or evidence base. These theories may be used to justify various alternative cancer treatments. They should be distinguished from those theories of <b>carcinogenesis</b> that have a logical basis within mainstream cancer biology, and from which conventionally testable hypotheses can be made.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to these}} processes, PAH {{compounds}} {{are thought to}} play a role in the initiation and early promotion stage of <b>carcinogenesis.</b> Fish exposed to PAHs develop a range of liver lesions, some of which are characteristic of hepatocarcinogenicity.|$|E
25|$|Specific {{epigenetic}} processes include paramutation, bookmarking, imprinting, gene silencing, X chromosome inactivation, position effect, DNA methylation reprogramming, transvection, maternal effects, {{the progress}} of <b>carcinogenesis,</b> many effects of teratogens, regulation of histone modifications and heterochromatin, and technical limitations affecting parthenogenesis and cloning.|$|E
25|$|This {{model of}} <b>carcinogenesis</b> is popular because it {{explains}} why cancers grow. It {{would be expected}} that cells that are damaged through radiation would die or at least be worse off because they have fewer genes working; viruses {{increase the number of}} genes working.|$|E
25|$|Oncomirs are {{associated}} with <b>carcinogenesis,</b> malignant transformation, and metastasis. Some oncomir genes are oncogenes, in that overexpression of the gene leads to cancerous growth. Other oncomir genes are tumor suppressors in a normal cell, so that underexpression of the gene leads to cancerous growth.|$|E
25|$|In a 2016 {{study by}} the Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore {{published}} in <b>Carcinogenesis,</b> Endosulfan was found to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a concentration and time-dependent manner leading to double-stranded breaks in the DNA and also found to favour subsequent erroneous DNA repair.|$|E
25|$|A new way {{of looking}} at <b>carcinogenesis</b> comes from {{integrating}} the ideas of developmental biology into oncology. The cancer stem cell hypothesis proposes that the different kinds of cells in a heterogeneous tumor arise from a single cell, termed Cancer Stem Cell. Cancer stem cells may arise from transformation of adult stem cells or differentiated cells within a body. These cells persist as a subcomponent of the tumor and retain key stem cell properties. They give rise to a variety of cells, are capable of self-renewal and homeostatic control. Furthermore, the relapse of cancer and the emergence of metastasis are also attributed to these cells. The cancer stem cell hypothesis does not contradict earlier concepts of <b>carcinogenesis.</b> The cancer stem cell hypothesis has been a proposed mechanism that contributes to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of histologically normal fields surrounding neoplastic growths (adenomas and colon cancers) in the colon also show reduced MBD4 mRNA expression (a field defect) compared to histologically normal tissue from individuals {{who never had}} a colonic neoplasm.

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{amount of}} Bửu Hội's contributions {{are in the}} field of chemical <b>carcinogenesis</b> and the synthesis of related organic chemical compounds. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, he had extensive collaborations with the quantum chemistry personnel of the Radium Institute on various aspects of the electronic theory of <b>carcinogenesis.</b> Bửu Hội was the first to propose the involvement of noncovalent forces. Together with Lacassagne and Rudali, in the 1940s he became the first to describe the phenomena of synergisma and antagonism between carcinogens. He demonstrated this by using hydrocarbons on the skin of mice and later extended this to hepatic and other carcinogens. Starting in 1947, he collaborated with François Zajdela and Lacassagne in exploring the relationships between the structure and carcinogenic activity of polynuclear compounds. The study spanned a groundbreaking scale and depth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Carcinogenesis,</b> {{also called}} {{oncogenesis}} or tumorigenesis, is {{the formation of}} a cancer, whereby normal cells are transformed into cancer cells. The process is characterized by changes at the cellular, genetic, and epigenetic levels and abnormal cell division. Cell division is a physiological process that occurs in almost all tissues and under a variety of circumstances. Normally the balance between proliferation and programmed cell death, in the form of apoptosis, is maintained to ensure the integrity of tissues and organs. According to the prevailing accepted theory of <b>carcinogenesis,</b> the somatic mutation theory, mutations in DNA and epimutations that lead to cancer disrupt these orderly processes by disrupting the programming regulating the processes, upsetting the normal balance between proliferation and cell death. This results in uncontrolled cell division and the evolution of those cells by natural selection in the body. Only certain mutations lead to cancer whereas the majority of mutations do not.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the {{electronic}} theory of molecular structure {{was in its}} formative years and was not considered as a vehicle by biologists for explaining phenomena, however Lacassagne saw promise in the prospect of Schmidt's hypothesis in attempting to explain <b>carcinogenesis</b> {{by a combination of}} elements of electron quantum theory, geometry and chemical structure.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies showed}} that {{methionine}} restriction also inhibits aging-related disease processes in mice and inhibits colon <b>carcinogenesis</b> in rats. In humans, methionine restriction through dietary modification could be achieved through a vegan diet. Veganism being a completely plant based diet is typically very low in methionine, however certain nuts and legumes may provide higher levels.|$|E
25|$|MPyV {{contains}} three proteins extensively {{studied for}} their ability to induce neoplastic transformation (that is, carcinogenesis); these proteins are expressed from the early region of the viral genome and are known as large, middle, and small tumor antigen. Murine polyomavirus and its close relative hamster polyomavirus are historically the only two known viruses whose genomes contain middle tumor antigen, by far the most efficient of the three early proteins at inducing <b>carcinogenesis.</b> In 2015 the genome sequence of a rat polyomavirus was reported to contain middle tumor antigen as well, consistent with expectations that it evolved uniquely in the rodent lineage of the polyomavirus family. Expression of MT from a transgene or introduction in cell culture can be sufficient to induce transformation. Studies using MT have played key roles in understanding host-cell oncogenes and their effects on <b>carcinogenesis,</b> particularly {{in the study of the}} Src family of tyrosine kinases. Transgenic mice expressing MT are widely used as models for cancer progression and metastasis, particularly of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|ROS are {{constantly}} generated and eliminated {{in the biological}} system and are required to drive regulatory pathways. Under normal physiological conditions, cells control ROS levels by balancing the generation of ROS with their elimination by scavenging system. But under oxidative stress conditions, excessive ROS can damage cellular proteins, lipids and DNA, leading to fatal lesions in cell that contribute to <b>carcinogenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In rare cases, {{lymphedema}} {{can lead}} to a form of cancer called lymphangiosarcoma, although the mechanism of <b>carcinogenesis</b> is not understood. Lymphedema-associated lymphangiosarcoma is called Stewart-Treves syndrome. Lymphangiosarcoma most frequently occurs in cases of long-standing lymphedema. The incidence of angiosarcoma is estimated to be 0.45% in patients living 5 years after radical mastectomy. Lymphedema is also associated with a low grade form of cancer called retiform hemangioendothelioma (a low grade angiosarcoma).|$|E
25|$|In 1975, a {{study of}} three small villages in central Cappadocia—Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır—found that {{mesothelioma}} was causing 50% of all deaths. Initially, this was attributed to erionite, a zeolite mineral with similar properties to asbestos, but detailed epidemiological investigation demonstrated that the substance causes the disease mostly in families with a genetic predisposition to mineral fiber <b>carcinogenesis.</b> The studies are being extended {{to other parts of}} the region.|$|E
25|$|MD Anderson enjoys {{university}} {{status by}} providing fellowship, internship and residency opportunities to Ph.D.s and medical professionals. The institution offers master's degrees and Ph.D.s to {{students enrolled in}} The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, which it operates with UT Health Science Center at Houston. Areas of study include: immunology, cancer biology, genes and development, molecular <b>carcinogenesis,</b> medical physics, biomathematics and biostatistics, experimental therapeutics, and virology and gene therapy.|$|E
25|$|While {{genetic and}} {{epigenetic}} alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes change {{the behavior of}} cells, those alterations, in the end, result in cancer through their effects on the population of neoplastic cells and their microenvironment. Mutant cells in neoplasms compete for space and resources. Thus, a clone with a mutation in a tumor suppressor gene or oncogene will expand only in a neoplasm if that mutation gives the clone a competitive advantage over the other clones and normal cells in its microenvironment. Thus, the process of <b>carcinogenesis</b> is formally a process of Darwinian evolution, known as somatic or clonal evolution. Furthermore, {{in light of the}} Darwinistic mechanisms of <b>carcinogenesis,</b> it has been theorized that the various forms of cancer can be categorized as pubertarial and gerontological. Anthropological research is currently being conducted on cancer as a natural evolutionary process through which natural selection destroys environmentally inferior phenotypes while supporting others. According to this theory, cancer comes in two separate types: from birth to the end of puberty (approximately age 20) teleologically inclined toward supportive group dynamics, and from mid-life to death (approximately age 40+) teleologically inclined away from overpopulative group dynamics.|$|E
25|$|The role {{of iodine}} in marine fishes (rich in iodine) and {{freshwater}} fishes (iodine-deficient) {{is not completely}} understood, {{but it has been}} reported that freshwater fishes are more susceptible to infectious and, in particular, neoplastic and atherosclerotic diseases, of marine fishes. Marine elasmobranch fishes such as sharks, stingrays etc. are much less affected by cancer than freshwater fishes, and therefore have stimulated medical research to better understand <b>carcinogenesis</b> so it can be useful in other animals and especially in humans.|$|E
25|$|Mammary {{stem cells}} provide {{the source of}} cells for growth of the mammary gland during puberty and {{gestation}} and {{play an important role}} in <b>carcinogenesis</b> of the breast. Mammary stem cells have been isolated from human and mouse tissue as well as from cell lines derived from the mammary gland. Single such cells can give rise to both the luminal and myoepithelial cell types of the gland, and have been shown to have the ability to regenerate the entire organ in mice.|$|E
25|$|According to a review, {{the main}} {{mechanisms}} by which environmental compounds increase breast cancer risk are acting like hormones, especially estrogen, or affecting susceptibility to <b>carcinogenesis.</b> The evidence to date generally supports an association between breast cancer and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). dioxins and organic solvents, on the other hand, have only shown an association in sparse and methodologically limited studies, but are suggestive of an association. Overall, however, evidence is still based on {{a relatively small number}} of studies.|$|E
25|$|Associations {{have been}} {{observed}} between neprilysin expression and various types of cancer; however, the relationship between neprilysin expression and <b>carcinogenesis</b> remains obscure. In cancer biomarker studies, the neprilysin gene {{is often referred to}} as CD10 or CALLA. In some types of cancer, such as metastatic carcinoma and some advanced melanomas, neprilysin is overexpressed; in other types, most notably lung cancers, neprilysin is downregulated, and thus unable to modulate the pro-growth autocrine signaling of cancer cells via secreted peptides such as mammalian homologs related to bombesin.|$|E
25|$|At {{around the}} same period in 1944, Bửu Hội met , the Director of Biological Research at the Radium Institute. At the time Lacassagne was {{establishing}} an interdisciplinary team for exploring the possibilities and uses of a hypothesis by Otto Schmidt, which became known as the electronic theory of hydrocarbon <b>carcinogenesis.</b> One {{of the effects of the}} Nazi occupation was that the foreign scientific literature brought into France was almost entirely German. As a result, this exposed Lacassagne to what to be the scientific foundation of his highly fruitful collaboration with Bửu Hội.|$|E
25|$|Hsp90 plays {{apparently}} conflicting {{roles in}} the cell, as {{it is essential for}} both the creation and the maintenance as well as the destruction of proteins. Its normal function is critical to maintaining the health of cells, whereas its dysregulation may contribute to <b>carcinogenesis.</b> The ability of this chaperone to both stabilize the 26S proteasome (which enables the cell to degrade unwanted and/or harmful proteins) and to stabilize kinases against the same proteasome demonstrates its functional diversity. The uses of Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer treatment highlight Hsp90's importance as a therapeutic target.|$|E
25|$|Hepatocellular carcinoma, {{like any}} other cancer, {{develops}} {{when there is a}} mutation to the cellular machinery that causes the cell to replicate at a higher rate and/or results in the cell avoiding apoptosis. In particular, chronic infections of hepatitis B and/or C can aid the development of hepatocellular carcinoma by repeatedly causing the body's own immune system to attack the liver cells, some of which are infected by the virus, others merely bystanders. While this constant cycle of damage followed by repair can lead to mistakes during repair which in turn lead to <b>carcinogenesis,</b> this hypothesis is more applicable, at present, to hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C causes HCC through the stage of cirrhosis. In chronic hepatitis B, however, the integration of the viral genome into infected cells can directly induce a non-cirrhotic liver to develop HCC. Alternatively, repeated consumption of large amounts of ethanol can have a similar effect. The toxin aflatoxin from certain Aspergillus species of fungus is a carcinogen and aids <b>carcinogenesis</b> of hepatocellular cancer by building up in the liver. The combined high prevalence of rates of aflatoxin and hepatitis B in settings like China and West Africa has led to relatively high rates of hepatocellular carcinoma in these regions. Other viral hepatitides such as hepatitis A have no potential to become a chronic infection and thus are not related to hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Nongenotoxic, or {{epigenetic}} carcinogens {{are different}} and slightly more ambiguous than genotoxic carcinogens {{since they are}} not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of <b>carcinogenesis</b> {{does not change the}} sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes. Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, {{little is known about the}} mechanistic pathway. It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of metabolizing enzymes.|$|E
