Scientist Hao Feng found a method that could significantly {{reduce the cost of}} the energy involved in making butanol. His team was able to isolate the butanol molecules during the fermentation process so they do not kill the organisms, and produces 100% or more butanol. After the fermentation process, they used a process called <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> separation to recover the butanol which used 4 times less energy.|$|E
2500|$|When {{biodiesel}} is cooled below {{a certain}} point, {{some of the}} molecules aggregate and form crystals. The fuel starts to appear cloudy once the crystals become larger than {{one quarter of the}} wavelengths of visible light – this is the <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> (CP). As the fuel is cooled further these crystals become larger. The lowest temperature at which fuel can pass through a 45micrometre filter is the cold filter plugging point (CFPP). As biodiesel is cooled further it will gel and then solidify. Within Europe, there are differences in the CFPP requirements between countries. This is reflected in the different national standards of those countries. The temperature at which pure (B100) biodiesel starts to gel varies significantly and depends upon the mix of esters and therefore the feedstock oil used to produce the biodiesel. For example, biodiesel produced from low erucic acid varieties of canola seed (RME) starts to gel at approximately [...] Biodiesel produced from beef tallow and palm oil tends to gel at around [...] and [...] respectively. There are a number of commercially available additives that will significantly lower the pour point and cold filter plugging point of pure biodiesel. Winter operation is also possible by blending biodiesel with other fuel oils including #2 low sulfur diesel fuel and #1 diesel / kerosene.|$|E

The <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> is the temperature when the wax precipitates out of the fuel {{in the form of}} small wax crystals, making the fuel cloudy and more difficult to move within the fuel lines and systems of vehicles. The lower the <b>cloud</b> <b>point</b> of a particular fuel is, the more suitable it is in colder environments.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cloud</b> <b>points</b> upon cooling {{and heating}} of a thermoresponsive polymer {{solution}} do not coincide because {{the process of}} equilibration takes time. The temperature interval between the <b>cloud</b> <b>points</b> upon cooling and heating is called hysteresis. The <b>cloud</b> <b>points</b> are dependent on the cooling and heating rates, and hysteresis decreases with lower rates. There are indications that hysteresis {{is influenced by the}} temperature, viscosity, glass transition temperature and the ability to form additional intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in the phase separated state.|$|R

30|$|After {{obtaining the}} 3 D dense <b>point</b> <b>cloud,</b> 3 D {{watertight}} surface {{needs to be}} constructed, over the <b>point</b> <b>cloud.</b> For construction of surface over a 3 D dense <b>point</b> <b>cloud,</b> the <b>point</b> <b>cloud</b> needs to have 3 D coordinates (X, Y, Z) and surface normals (nx, ny, nz) at each point. The surface normals for each point in a <b>point</b> <b>cloud</b> may be calculated from its (X, Y, Z) coordinates using principal component analysis (PCA).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to invest igate the {{properties}} of <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> derived from aerial image matching and to compare them with <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> from airborne laser scanning. A set of aerial images acquired in years 2010 - 2013 over the city of Elblag were used for the analysis. Images were acquired with the use of three digital cameras: DMC II 230, DMC I and DigiCAM 60 with a GSD varying from 4. 5 cm to 15 cm. Eight sets of images that were used in the study were acquired at different stages of the growing season – from March to December. Two L iDAR <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> were used for the comparison – one with a density of 1. 3 p/m 2 and a second with a density of 10 p/m 2. Based on the input images <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> were created with the use of the semi - global matching method. The properties of the obtained poi nt clouds were analyzed in three ways: – b y the comparison of the vertical accuracy of <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> with reference to a terrain profile surveyed on bare ground with GPS - RTK method – b y visual assessment of <b>point</b> <b>cloud</b> profiles generated both from SGM and LiDAR <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> – b y visual assessment of a digital surface model generated from a SGM <b>point</b> <b>cloud</b> with reference to a digital surface model generated from a LiDAR <b>point</b> <b>cloud.</b> The conducted studies allowed a number of observations about the quality o f SGM <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> to be formulated with respect to different factors. The main factors having influence on the quality of SGM <b>point</b> <b>clouds</b> are GSD and base/height ratio.
