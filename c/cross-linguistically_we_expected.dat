40|$|We {{present a}} machine {{translation}} {{framework in which}} the interlingua [...] Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) [...] is coupled with a definitional component that includes bilingual (EuroWordNet) links between words in the source and target languages. While the links between individual words are language-specific, the LCS {{is designed to be}} a language-independent, compositional representation. We take the view that the two types of information [...] shallower, transfer-like knowledge as well as deeper, compositional knowledge [...] can be reconciled in interlingual machine translation, the former for overcoming the intractability of LCS-based lexical selection, and the latter for relating the underlying semantics of two words <b>cross-linguistically.</b> <b>We</b> describe the acquisition process for these two information types and present results of hand-verification of the acquired lexicon. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the two information types in interlingual MT...|$|R

40|$|We propose an {{annotation}} {{framework to}} explicitly identify dropped subject pronouns in Chinese. We acknowledge and specify 10 concrete pronouns that exist as words in Chinese and 4 abstract pronouns {{that do not}} correspond to Chinese words, but that are recognized conceptually, to native Chinese speakers. These abstract pronouns are identified as “unspecified”, “pleonastic”, “event”, and “existential ” and are argued to exist <b>cross-linguistically.</b> <b>We</b> trained two annotators, fluent in Chinese, and adjudicated their annotations to form a gold standard. We achieved an inter-annotator agreement kappa of. 6 and an observed agreement of. 7. We found that annotators had the most difficulty with the abstract pronouns, such as “unspecified ” and “event”, but we posit that further specification and training {{has the potential to}} significantly improve these results. We believe that this annotated data will serve to help improve Machine Translation models that translate from Chinese to a non pro-drop language, like English, that requires all subject pronouns to be explicit...|$|R
40|$|We {{argue that}} early French {{relative}} clauses (RCs) with gaps involve movement, contrary to Labelle's (1990) conclusion, {{but that it}} is movement of the relative head, not of an operator. We suggest that children lack relative operators for maturational reasons (Wexler (1991)). Our account shows that the deviation of early RCs from adult grammar is due to this lacuna and is compensated for {{in a manner consistent with}} Universal Grammar (UG). This analysis explains the absence of "pied piping" and the preponderance of gaps in object relative clauses in Labelle's corpus. We assimilate relative clauses where the relativized NP occurs in situ to wh-in situ in French interrogatives. This is compatible with UG given that internally headed relative clauses are attested <b>cross-linguistically.</b> <b>We</b> consider child and adult Korean (Lee, Lust, and Whitman (1991)) in this context. This approach also captures Flynn and Lust's (1980) observation that free relatives are acquired earlier than restrictive relatives...|$|R

40|$|In a {{canonical}} inflectional paradigm, inflectional affixes mark distinctions in morphosyntactic value, {{while the}} lexical stem remains invariant. But stems {{are known to}} alternate too, constituting a system of inflectional marking operating according to parameters which typically {{differ from those of}} the affixal system, and so represent a distinct object of inquiry. <b>Cross-linguistically,</b> <b>we</b> still lack a comprehensive picture of what patterns of stem alternation are found, and hence the theoretical status of stem alternations remains unclear. We propose a typological framework for classifying stem alternations, basing it on the paradigm-internal relationship between the features marked by stem alternations versus those marked by affixes. Stem alternations may mark completely different features from the affixes (§ 2), or the same features (§ 3). Within the latter, the values may match (§ 3. 1) [*]–[*]a rare situation[*]–[*]or be conflated (§ 3. 2). Conflation in turn may involve natural semantic/morphosyntactic classes (§ 3. 2. 1), or phonological conditioning (§ 3. 2. 2), or be morphologically stipulated (§ 3. 2. 3). These patterns typically reveal stems’ continued allegiance to lexical as opposed to inflectional organizing principles...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} the {{previous}} sections {{there are differences in}} actual freedom and in perceived freedom, and each correlate with happiness.

Conversely, <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> perceived freedom to be more a mental construal than a result of the environment, hence <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> perceived freedom to be determined mainly by psychological freedom; therefore, the influence of psychological freedom on happiness should be mediated by perceived freedom. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> 1) an influence of psychological freedom on happiness via perceived freedom and a direct effect, 2) a direct influence of social freedom on happiness, 3) a direct influence of potential freedom on happiness.|$|R
