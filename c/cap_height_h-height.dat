40|$|Abstract. The gas seepage {{characteristics}} of four kinds of broken rocks of different gradations {{and the relationship}} between the <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> and the porosity were studied by means of the simulation experiment and the theoretical analysis. The results show that the air flow in the capping layer composed of broken rocks is in the non-Darcy state which can be described as Forchheimer equation and Ergun equation. Moreover, {{on the basis of the}} experimental data, the relational expressions between the permeability, the non-Darcy β factor and the porosity were determined. Through the numerical fitting, the equation of the minimum <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> and the porosity was ultimately derived, which provided the basis and the reference for the determination of <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> and the air leakage control of mine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During surface-underground {{combined}} mining, {{the method}} {{to control the}} ground air leakage is adopted by the capping layer using the fragmented rocks and the discarded tailings. In order to study the air leakage characteristic with the capping, the porosity of the rock particles of seven sizes and the air leakage characteristics of the capping were studied {{and the relationship between}} the air leakage coefficient and amount of air leakage with the <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> were found basing on the laboratory analogue simulation tests. It can provide the theoretical basis for determining the <b>capping</b> <b>height</b> of iron mine...|$|R
25|$|The {{handwriting}} {{found in}} New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often {{written in a}} distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the baseline and the <b>cap</b> <b>height,</b> while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the baseline and <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.|$|R
2500|$|In the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (sometimes collectively {{referred}} to as LGC) scripts, one can refer to {{the distance from the}} baseline to the top of regular lowercase glyphs (mean line) as the x-height, and the part of a glyph rising above the x-height as the ascender. [...] The distance from the baseline {{to the top of the}} ascent or a regular uppercase glyphs (cap line) is also known as the <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> The height of the ascender can have a dramatic effect on the readability and appearance of a font. The ratio between the x-height and the ascent or <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> often serves to characterize typefaces.|$|R

50|$|The Manual {{suggests}} that, for screen viewing, fonts {{should be}} readable at 9 points per em at 72 dpi. Particular {{attention should be}} paid to the <b>cap</b> <b>height,</b> x-height, and baseline, so that the font retains its normal character while not producing exaggerated effects at small sizes.|$|R
5000|$|In digital type, the {{relationship}} of the height of particular letters to the em is arbitrarily set by the typeface designer. However, as a very rough guideline, an [...] "average" [...] font might have a <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> of 70% of the em, and an x-height of 48% of the em.|$|R
50|$|In typography, {{the mean}} line, {{also called the}} midline, is half the {{distance}} from the baseline to the <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> This {{may or may not be}} the x-height, depending on the design of the lower case letters. A very high or very low x-height may mean that the midline is above or below the x-height.|$|R
50|$|Fonts {{can have}} {{different}} kinds of numerals, including, as described above, proportional (variable width) and tabular (fixed width) as well as lining (upper-case height) and text (lower-case height) figures. They may also include separate styles for superscript and subscript digits. Professional fonts may include even more complex settings for typesetting numerals, such as numerals intended to match the <b>height</b> of small <b>caps.</b> In addition, some fonts such as Adobe’s Acumin and Christian Schwartz’s Neue Haas Grotesk digitisation offer two heights of lining (upper-case height) figures: one slightly lower than <b>cap</b> <b>height,</b> intended to blend better into continuous text, and one at exactly the <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> to look better in combination with capitals for uses such as UK postcodes. With the OpenType format, {{it is possible to}} bundle all these into a single digital font file, but earlier font releases may have only one type per file.|$|R
50|$|England's tallest tower mill is the nine-storeyed Moulton Windmill in Moulton, Lincolnshire, with a <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> of 97.5 ft / 30 metres. Since 2005 {{the mill}} {{has a new}} white {{rotatable}} cap with windshaft and fantail in place, the stage was erected during 2008 and new sails were fitted on 21 November 2011 to complete {{the restoration of the}} mill.|$|R
50|$|In typography, <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> is {{the height}} of a capital letter above the {{baseline}} for a particular typeface. It specifically is {{the height of}} capital letters that are flat—such as H or I—as opposed to round letters such as O, or pointed letters like A, both of which may display overshoot. The height of the small letters is the x-height.|$|R
50|$|Otl Aicher vividly {{encouraged}} {{the use of}} the quart, also providing a suggested list of common sizes.Note that Aicher’s font sizes are based on the DIN standard then in development, which uses the H-height, whereas in lead typesetting the larger <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> was used. Some typographers have proposed using the x-height instead, because the psychological size depends more on the size of default, lowercase letters.|$|R
5000|$|When Fry's successors closed, {{this version}} was {{acquired}} and issued (or possibly recut) in hot metal by Stephenson Blake {{under the name}} [...] "Baskerville Old Face", with many imitations following its design, often adding lining figures at <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> and the cropped descenders necessary for American printing. Moore's italic was considered substandard by revivalist printers, and Baskerville Old Face revivals have tended to either synthesise their own or offer none.|$|R
50|$|The {{hallmark}} of effective TrueType glyph programming techniques {{is that it}} does as much as possible using variables defined just once in the whole font (e.g., stem widths, <b>cap</b> <b>height,</b> x-height). This means avoiding delta instructions as much as possible. This helps the font developer to make major changes (e.g., {{the point at which the}} entire font's main stems jump from 1 to 2 pixels wide) most of the way through development.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to extra font width and weight combinations, the fonts are digitally interpolated, so that character widths scale uniformly with changing font weights. For fonts {{within a specific}} font weight, <b>caps</b> <b>height,</b> x-height, ascender and descender heights are the same. For oblique fonts, the slope is increased from 12° to the 16° of Frutiger's original drawings, and the character widths were adjusted optically. In addition, characters such as &, ®, euro sign, are redesigned, the ampersand to Frutiger's preferred true et ligature.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} design contained {{a number of}} alternate characters for the letters J and r, intended for letter positions at the start and end of words, which have generally not been included in digitisations. The common digitisation also simplifies the design considerably, omitting the subtle bevelling of dots on 'i' and 'j' and flared stroke ends seen on the original metal type release. An eccentricity preserved in the digitisation is the ampersand, which is only {{as high as the}} x-height, not the <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b>|$|R
50|$|Working {{with the}} most richly ornamented letters ever {{to have been made}} for {{letterpress}} printing, Pouchée's staff created fat-face style letters featuring flowers, fruit, animals, agricultural implements, musical instruments and Masonic symbols. Up to 26 lines in <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> and made from single blocks of end-grain boxwood, they were intended as eye-catching elements for printed posters. They were described in one of the extra scenes of the documentary film Typeface as the most ambitious and most beautiful types created in wood in any period.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Monotype Bookman (inner lines) {{compared}} to {{samples of the}} original ATF Bookman (the top one from a larger point size) scaled to the same <b>cap</b> <b>height.</b> It {{can be seen that}} the modern Bookman revival has generally wider characters than the original, a somewhat higher x-height (taller lower-case letters) and several detail differences. Ovink describes the rounded 'a' as being based on the Oldstyle Antique prepared by a Philadelphia foundry, and the straight-topped 'a' as that prepared by Miller & Richard. Visible also is a compressed descender on the 'g' to allow tighter linespacing.) ...|$|R

50|$|Unicode defines {{subscript}} and superscript {{characters in}} several areas; in particular, {{it has a}} full set of superscript and subscript digits. Owing to the popularity of using these characters to make fractions, most modern fonts render most or all of these as <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> superscripts and baseline subscripts. The same font may align letters and numbers in different ways. Other than numbers, the set of super- and subscript letters and other symbols is incomplete and somewhat random, and many fonts do not contain them. Because of these inconsistencies, these glyphs may not be suitable for some purposes (see Uses, above).|$|R
25|$|As {{with many}} metal type faces, the metal type of Akzidenz-Grotesk shows {{variation}} between sizes, with adaptation of letter-spacing and proportions to different sizes. In addition, there is variation between weights: Karl Gerstner notes that even comparing one size (20pt), the medium and bold weights have different x-height, <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> and descender length {{to the light}} and regular weights. This is common with nineteenth-century sans-serifs, which were often not designed as {{with the intention of}} forming an extended family that would match together. The differences in proportions between different sizes and weights of Akzidenz-Grotesk has led to a range of contemporary adaptations, reviving or modifying different aspects of the original design.|$|R
50|$|By February 2012, {{the ground}} floor {{concrete}} was almost done and the lower podium had reached the 5th floor. On May 18, 2012 a construction update was released which stated that the superstructure work was continuing, and that forms, rebar, and concrete placement work was also continuing. Additionally, utilities for the site were being installed. The construction agency expected the lower podium to reach a <b>capped</b> <b>height</b> of 7 stories by September 2012. As of August 2013, construction on the podium is nearly complete, {{and work on the}} rest of the podium and the tower will continue in January 2014, when the tower crane is returned to the site.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing lower-case fonts varying only in serif size (0 %, 5 %, and 10 % <b>cap</b> <b>height),</b> we {{assessed}} legibility using size thresholds and reading speed. Five percentage serif fonts were slightly more legible than sans serif, {{but the average}} inter-letter spacing increase that serifs themselves impose, predicts greater enhancement than we observed. RSVP and continuous reading speeds showed no effect of serifs. When text is small or distant, serifs may, then, produce a tiny legibility increase due to the concomitant increase in spacing. However, our data exhibited no difference in legibility between typefaces that differ only in {{the presence or absence}} of serifs...|$|R
50|$|Lowercase letters whose {{height is}} greater than the {{x-height}} either have descenders which extend below the baseline, such as y, g, q, and p, or have ascenders which extend above the x-height, such as l, k, b, and d. The ratio of the x-height to the body height {{is one of the major}} characteristics that defines the appearance of a typeface. The height of the capital letters is referred to as <b>Cap</b> <b>height.</b> X-height is most important in regular designs, such as most serif and sans-serif designs; script typefaces that mimic irregular handwriting and calligraphy may not have a consistent x-height across all letters.|$|R
50|$|Font metrics {{refers to}} {{metadata}} consisting of numeric values relating to size and {{space in the}} font overall, or in its individual glyphs. Font-wide metrics include <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> (the height of the capitals), x-height (the height of the lower-case letters) and ascender height, descender depth, and the font bounding box. Glyph-level metrics include the glyph bounding box, the advance width (the proper distance between the glyph's initial pen position and the next glyph's initial pen position), and sidebearings (space that pads the glyph outline on either side). Many digital (and some metal type) fonts are able to be kerned so that characters can be fitted more closely; the pair 'Wa' is a common example of this.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is built}} of hard local limestone, with {{sandstone}} detailing, on a shallow platform of 71 ft in diameter. The mill tower with a <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> of 36 ft, unique worldwide in structure and mechanics, is supported on six semicircular arches, on piers, the outer faces {{of which are}} arcs of circles radiating from a common centre. A sandstone string course surmounts the six arches and runs round the tower, below the windows. There are four windows in the tower, two small and two much larger with stone mullioned windows. A three-light window set in the roof {{on the opposite side}} to the sails, has a small plaque above it with the letters [...] "E. P. 1632".|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this record. This study {{examines}} pre-industrial control simulations from CMIP 5 climate models in an effort to better understand the complex relationships between Arctic sea ice and the stratosphere, and between Arctic sea ice and cold winter temperatures over Eurasia. We present normalized regressions of Arctic sea-ice area against several atmospheric variables at extended lead and lag times. Statistically significant regressions are found at leads and lags, suggesting both atmospheric precursors of, and responses to, low sea ice; but generally, the regressions are stronger when the atmosphere leads sea ice, including a weaker polar stratospheric vortex indicated by positive polar <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> anomalies. Significant positive midlatitude eddy heat flux anomalies are also found to precede low sea ice. We argue that low sea ice and raised polar <b>cap</b> <b>height</b> are both a response to this enhanced midlatitude eddy heat flux. The so-called “warm Arctic, cold continents” anomaly pattern is present one to two months before low sea ice, but is absent in the months following low sea ice, suggesting that the Eurasian cooling and low sea ice are driven by similar processes. Lastly, our results suggest a dependence on the geographic region of low sea ice, with low Barents–Kara Sea ice correlated with a weakened polar stratospheric vortex, whilst low Sea of Okhotsk ice is correlated with a strengthened polar vortex. Overall, the results support a notion that the sea ice, polar stratospheric vortex and Eurasian surface temperatures collectively respond to large-scale changes in tropospheric circulation.
