5|$|As the {{inception}} of the United Nations as an intergovernmental entity slowly began formalizing in 1944, delegates from 44 of its early member states met at a hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire for the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, now commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods conference. Delegates remained <b>cognizant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects of the Great Depression, struggles to sustain the international gold standard during the 1930s, and related market instabilities. Whereas previous discourse on the international monetary system focused on fixed versus floating exchange rates, Bretton Woods delegates favored pegged exchange rates for their flexibility. Under this system, nations would peg their exchange rates to the U.S. dollar, which would be convertible to gold at $35 USD per ounce. This arrangement is commonly referred to as the Bretton Woods system. Rather than maintaining fixed rates, nations would peg their currencies to the U.S. dollar and allow their exchange rates to fluctuate within a 1% band of the agreed-upon parity. To meet this requirement, central banks would intervene via sales or purchases of their currencies against the dollar. Members could adjust their pegs in response to long-run fundamental disequillibria in the balance of payments, but were responsible for correcting imbalances via fiscal and monetary policy tools before resorting to repegging strategies. The adjustable pegging enabled greater exchange rate stability for commercial and financial transactions which fostered unprecedented growth in international trade and foreign investment. This feature grew from delegates' experiences in the 1930s when excessively volatile exchange rates and the reactive protectionist exchange controls that followed proved destructive to trade and prolonged the deflationary effects of the Great Depression. Capital mobility faced de facto limits under the system as governments instituted restrictions on capital flows and aligned their monetary policy to support their pegs.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the blocked static ports, the basic flight {{instruments}} relayed false airspeed, altitude and vertical speed data. Because the failure was not in any of the instruments, but rather in a common supporting system, thereby defeating redundancy, the erroneous altimeter data was also broadcast to Air Traffic Control, who was attempting to provide the pilots with basic flight data. This led to extreme confusion in the cockpit as the pilots were provided with some data (altitude) which seemed to correlate correctly with instrument data (altimeter) while the other data provided by ATC (approximate airspeed) did not agree. Although the pilots were quite <b>cognizant</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility that all of the flight instruments were providing inaccurate data, the correlation between the altitude data given by ATC and that on the altimeter likely further compounded the confusion. Also contributing to their difficulty were the numerous cockpit alarms that the computer system generated, which conflicted both {{with each other and with}} the instruments. This lack of situational awareness was revealed by the cockpit voice recorder transcript. The fact that the flight took place at night and over water, thus not giving the pilots any visual references, was also identified as a major factor.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a sensor}} network and {{aggregate}} queries over the values sensed by subsets <b>of</b> nodes in <b>the</b> network, {{how do we}} ensure that high quality results are served for the maximum possible time? The issues underlying this question relate to <b>the</b> fidelity <b>of</b> query results and lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network.

Experimental results over real world data support our claim that, for aggregate queries with associated coherency requirements, a prediction-based, asynchronous scheme provides higher quality results for a longer amount of time than a synchronous scheme.

This is because the service providing devices are themselves mobile in MANETs and hence, the service–device binding cannot be tightly coupled over <b>the</b> lifetime <b>of</b> an application. Therefore, during <b>the</b> progress <b>of</b> a distributed application, a user should be capable of discovering and utilizing several different instances of a particular service in the network, if necessary. A common goal of all service discovery protocols is to discover the required services in a timely and scalable fashion, so that the application can run smoothly. In this paper, we investigate a related dimension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service discovery problem, namely, service composition. In general terms, service composition refers to <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> combination of multiple simple services in order to form a larger, more complex distributed service. This offers users a great degree of transparency in discovery and selection of required services, instead of having to be <b>cognizant</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> details about the simpler services that constitute the complex ones. Also, this can reduce discovery latency at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> executing distributed applications.
