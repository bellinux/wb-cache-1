5|$|East of Jacobsville, MD 177 {{receives}} {{the eastern end}} of MD 100. There is no direct access from eastbound MD 100 to westbound MD 177. The state highway becomes a three-lane road with the <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> controlled by lane use signals. During rush hours, there are two lanes in the relevant direction; at all other times, the <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> serves as a center left turn lane. The eastern end of the three-lane section is at South Carolina Avenue in the community of Lake Shore. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road and passes a loop of Old Mountain Road. At Pinehurst Road, which leads to Downs Memorial Park, the route veers southeast toward Gibson Island. MD 177 reaches its eastern terminus at the gatehouse that guards the private island community {{on the north side of}} the mouth of the Magothy River at the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 {{begins to}} turn to the {{southeast}} as it heads through more residential areas of the city. At East Avenue, a local street just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> begins, enabling left turns from both directions. The route passes north of the school and St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues past several blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. The boulevard ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E
5|$|A westward freeway {{extension}} of MD 177 was under construction from MD 3 (Glen Burnie Bypass) east to MD 2 by 1963. The freeway opened as MD 177 in 1964 with intermediate interchanges at MD 174 and Oakwood Road. In 1966, the freeway was extended slightly east to terminate at Mountain Road at an intersection {{at the site}} of today's ramps to and from westbound MD 100. By 1967, an {{extension of}} the freeway east to beyond Jacobsville was proposed. The eastward freeway extension opened in 1971; however, the extension and the freeway west to MD 3 were designated MD 100. MD 177 was expanded to a divided highway from MD 2 to MD 10 when the latter freeway was extended south from MD 648 to MD 100 between 1987 and 1989. The divided highway was extended east to Lipin's Corner in 1997. Since the late 1970s, heavy traffic on MD 177 east of MD 100 has spurred efforts to build a bypass of the Lake Shore section or widen the highway, projects that have been opposed by residents who fear increased development on the peninsula. Congestion on the highway was eased significantly when lane use signals were added to allow the <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> of the highway to become a travel lane during rush hours in July 1999.|$|E

25|$|In April 2013, {{changes were}} made to {{increase}} safety on the westbound span during two-way operations: signs, pavement markings, and rumble strips were modified, and a buffer zone between the left and <b>center</b> <b>lanes</b> was created.

25|$|Upon {{reaching}} Tyholtveien {{the double}} track shifts to a single-direction loop run clockwise. Upbound trams continued along Tyholtveien to the stop at Asbjørns gate, which served the Tyholt neighborhood. This section consisted of double track laid {{prior to the}} loop being built. Asbjørns gate was used for a regulation pause in the schedule. The line continued along Henrik Mathiesens vei to a stop named Lærerhøyskolen. This served the neighborhood of Rosenborg and a campus of the Norwegian College of Teaching in Trondheim. The line then continued down one block of Christians Monsens gate before reaching Stadsingeniør Dahls gate. Just afterwards the tram made a stop. The line continues along the <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> {{to a stop at}} Nonnegata. The street turns slightly and changes its name to Festningsgata and then completes the loop.|$|E
25|$|Between the South Carolina {{line and}} the US74 bypass, US1 is a two-lane road but sees a {{considerable}} amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US74/US220 and I-73/I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US1 goes through downtown Rockingham, with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County, it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines, Vass and Cameron. US1 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford, and on to Cary and Raleigh. US1 runs concurrently with US64 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. North of Raleigh, US1 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses Interstate 540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to Interstate 85 near Henderson. The North Carolina Department of Transportation has begun a corridor study for this section of US1. Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US1 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US1 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US1 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> for alternate passing towards US Highway 58 before South Hill.|$|E

500|$|Grimshaw v. Ford Motor Co., {{decided in}} February 1978, {{is one of}} two {{important}} Pinto cases. [...] A 1972 Pinto driven by Lily Gray stalled in the <b>center</b> <b>lane</b> of a California freeway. [...] The car was struck from behind by a vehicle initially traveling at 50mph and impacted at an estimated between 30 and 50mph resulting in a fuel tank fire. [...] Gray died {{at the time of the}} impact. [...] The passenger, Richard Grimshaw, was seriously burned. The plaintiff's bar collaborated with Mother Jones and The Center for Auto Safety to publicize damning information about Ford prior to trial. [...] The jury awarded $127.8 million in total damages; $125 million in punitive damages and $2,841,000 in compensatory damages to passenger Richard Grimshaw and $665,000 in compensatory damages to the family of the deceased driver, Lily Gray. The jury award was said to be the largest ever in US product liability and personal injury cases. [...] The jury award was the largest against an automaker at the time. The judge reduced the jury's punitive damages award to $3.5 million, which he later said was [...] "still larger than any other punitive damage award in the state by a factor of about five." [...] Ford subsequently decided to settle related cases out of court.|$|E
