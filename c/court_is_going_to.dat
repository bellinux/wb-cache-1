40|$|When libel law {{conflicts}} with the First Amendment, the United States Supreme Court has held that the measure of protection {{received by the press}} depends primarily on whether the plaintiff is a public or private person. This article questions whether this “public figure doctrine” is, or should become, part of the constitutional test applied to tort actions for invasion of privacy. This inquiry is made more urgent by the willingness of at least two members of the current Supreme Court, in Bartnicki v. Vopper, to incorporate the public figure doctrine into constitutional privacy law. Part II of this article briefly describes the rise of the public figure doctrine in constitutional libel law. Part III examines the limited use of the public figure doctrine in privacy law prior to the Court’s decision in Bartnicki. The Court repeatedly seemed to reject a plaintiff’s public/private status as part of the constitutional analysis in privacy cases. However, Part III notes that the common law of privacy has always embraced the public/private figure distinction and that the Court has used the doctrine in a related area—the individual’s right of informational privacy against the government. It was against this background that the Court decided Bartnicki. Part IV sets out the conflicting views of the justices in the 2001 decision and explores Justice Breyer’s view that a plaintiff’s status (as a public or private person) is a core component of the test for constitutional protection in privacy cases. This article argues that Justice Breyer’s approach is a multifactored, ad hoc, balancing analysis that is dramatically different, and in many ways, inferior, to its libel law cousin. Part V questions the future of the public figure doctrine after Bartnicki and predicts that a person’s status will become part of constitutional privacy law. However, this article suggests that, if the <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> transplant a public figure doctrine into constitutional privacy law, it should adopt a doctrine based on definitional balancing, akin to that currently in libel law, and reject Justice Breyer’s ad hoc approach...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{development}} on the lands of the American Indian nations has been spotty at best. Almost everyone knows the great success stories with Indian gaming, which has been furthered by federal legislation, but those economic benefits have not been felt uniformly. Some tribes have prospered because of this peculiarly favored form of enterprise; others have not and, in many cases, probably cannot. Substantial economic development in Indian country will not occur without significant infusions of outside capital, but investment by non-Indian and nongovernmental sources is risky, or {{is perceived to be}} so, which leads to the same practical result. This situation has many causes, none of which is easily remedied, but one important reason is uncertainty about the powers of federal, state, and tribal governments to impose their taxes on transactions within, and those doing business in, Indian country. If a prudent investor cannot predict the tax liability he will incur on his investment with reasonable certainty, he is likely to look for investment opportunities elsewhere. No investor should expect absolute certainty in taxation, of course: tax laws change, and American courts have not been sympathetic to the argument that a taxpayer has a due-process right to a continuation of existing laws. If a taxpayer invests on the assumption that his income will be taxed at a 35 -percent rate for federal purposes and Congress raises the rate to 50 percent, the taxpayer is out of luck. He can argue until he is blue in the face that he relied on the 35 -percent figure in making his investment decisions, and he may find friendly listeners at the country club. But no <b>court</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come to his aid: one cannot reasonably rely on an assumption that national or state legislation will remain unchanged. Those looking for absolutely clear answers in American Indian law are nevertheless likely to be frustrated by this Article; the structure of taxation in Indian country can be made only so transparent. Although general principles can be stated, the analysis of a specific issue is likely to be particularistic, depending on such factors as treaty language (if a treaty is involved); relevant statutory, executive order, or regulatory language; the specific facts at issue; and the scope given to interpretational principles intended to resolve disputes such as the Indian “canons of construction,” discussed below. Moreover, most commentators agree that, because of particularistic analyses and the ebb-and-flow of judicial sympathy for tribal concerns, Supreme Court decisions do not come close to establishing a coherent body of law. One can sometimes find unifying themes in the cases, but the process of rationalization can go only so far. Generally applicable principles suggest one operational standard for a potential investor in Indian country: because the investor is likely to be subject to federal and state taxation anyway (except in special circumstances), he should be negotiating with tribal officials to lessen any otherwise applicable tribal taxation. The investor should be trying to convince tribal officials that the benefits of economic development outweigh the short-term revenue loss attributable to any tax break the investor receives...|$|E

40|$|After the {{ten years}} of work and {{discussion}} of the proposal the European Commission has published the proposal of CCCTB directive on 16 th March, 2011.

Therefore even though the fact that suggested system is unique and addresses a lot of problems which are facing companies running business on the internal market, the provisions regarding the consolidation rules and rules for group formatting may still lead not to unified interpretation.

40|$|This brief {{was filed}} {{in support of}} the {{petitioner}} in No. 16 - 405 (U. S., cert. granted Jan. 13, 2017). ] BNSF Railway Co. should win this case, but on statutory grounds alone. BNSF makes three arguments: 1) That Daimler AG v. Bauman forbids Montana’s exercise of general personal jurisdiction here; 2) That Congress has not sought to license the state’s exercise of jurisdiction; and 3) That such a license would be void under the Fourteenth Amendment. BNSF’s first two arguments are fully persuasive and decide the case. As a result, the Court should decline to reach the third argument. Not only is it unnecessary to decide, it has the further defect of being wrong. Respondents’ case hinges on whether Congress in 1910 affirmatively licensed state personal jurisdiction over railroads doing business within state lines. It did not. The 1910 Act specified which federal courts might hear certain actions under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act. It did not say which state courts might do so—only *that* state courts might do so. Later discussions of doing-business jurisdiction in fact referred to a preexisting standard for state personal jurisdiction, established well before International Shoe. Respondents’ theory gets things backwards: Congress did not reshape state personal jurisdiction to fit the statutory rules for federal courts; rather, it shaped the statutory rules for federal courts to fit preexisting rules for state personal jurisdiction. While Congress in 1910 left state personal jurisdiction as it found it, this Court’s modern decisions have not. Respondents do not ask for Daimler to be overruled, nor do they deny that Daimler requires reversal {{in the absence of a}} statutory override. This is enough to end the case. That being so, the Court has no need to reach an important constitutional question. This Court has never squarely decided whether Congress may license the exercise of state personal jurisdiction that might otherwise be invalid. It should not do so in this case. “[N]ormally the Court will not decide a constitutional question if there is some other ground upon which to dispose of the case,” and here there are further reasons for reticence. The United States did not participate before the Montana courts, and limiting Congress’s power in this case may have the effect of striking down other federal statutes or may undermine ongoing legislative efforts and treaty negotiations. If the <b>Court</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> restrict the power of Congress, it should wait for a case in which Congress has actually tried to use the power in question, and in which the United States has been available to defend it. The Court may be tempted to reach the issue regardless, simply because it seems easy—so easy, in fact, as to obviate any need for caution. Congress cannot license what the Constitution forbids, and the Constitution is widely thought to forbid particular types of personal jurisdiction. Yet that widespread belief is actually mistaken. When originally enacted, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments did not themselves impose any fixed limits on personal jurisdiction. They required only that a court *have* jurisdiction, over the subject matter as well as the parties—with the substantive doctrines of personal jurisdiction supplied by separate bodies of general and international law. The Fourteenth Amendment, in particular, was correctly understood by this Court in Pennoyer v. Neff to create a federal question of what had been merely a matter of general law, outside the scope of Article III appellate review. Modern doctrine is correct to hold that federal courts can review state judgments for their compliance with jurisdictional standards. But it is wrong to suggest that those standards are supplied by the Constitution itself, and so may not be altered by treaty or by Congress’s enumerated power under Article IV. To be clear: this brief does not suggest that the Court conduct its own inquiry as to the original law of due process, or even discuss the issue in any way. The necessary arguments were not briefed at the certiorari stage; they were not raised in the Montana courts; and they have been overlooked by decades of contrary decisions. Yet if the Court now finds itself in a deep hole of incorrect precedent, the least it can do is to stop digging. It should reverse and remand this judgment on statutory grounds, and it should wait for an appropriate case in which to consider the powers of Congress...|$|E

40|$|Drug <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> a recent, but {{apparently}} compelling, {{addition to the}} criminal justice system, designed to positively influence the drug-crime nexus. They operate as a specialised criminal court, involving cooperation between the courts and drug treatment professionals, by streamlining drug-related cases away from traditional processing and punishment into an intensive drug treatment program. The very proliferation of drug courts renders them deserving of study. While there are surveys of individual Australian courts, there has, to date, been no comparative study across the various Australian jurisdictions. This thesis fulfils this need. Although there is increasing debate in the United States about the theoretical basis of drug <b>courts,</b> this debate <b>is</b> largely taking place after their creation. Australian drug <b>courts</b> have largely <b>been</b> implemented without reference to any philosophical underpinnings. This thesis places the drug court phenomenon within its political, social, and philosophical environment, and provides {{an explanation of the}} legal contexts within which the drug court process operates. There are many untested assumptions about drug courts, most importantly claims that they are successful. If drug <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue to operate and become more widely accepted, it is necessary to recognise their underlying rationale and to identify the link between the social, political, and theoretical bases and the actual outcomes. The indicia for success within the drug court context have never been definitively articulated, and by identifying key elements of success, and then categorising the relationships of those elements to contexts and processes, this thesis will go some of the way towards defining drug court success. In other words this thesis attempts to provide answers to the questions – do drug courts work? And if so, what makes them workable...|$|R
40|$|The United States 2 ̆ 7 {{commitment}} to adversarial justice is {{a defining feature of}} its legal system. Standing doctrine, for example, {{is supposed to}} ensure that courts can rely on adverse parties to present the facts courts need to resolve disputes. Although the U. S. legal system generally lives up to this adversarial ideal, it sometimes does not. Appellate courts often look outside the record the parties developed before the trial court, turning instead to their own independent research and to factual claims in amicus briefs. This deviation from the adversarial process is an important respect in which the nation 2 ̆ 7 s adversarial commitment is more myth than reality. This myth is problematic for many reasons, including the fact that it obscures the extent to which some of the most significant cases the Supreme Court decides, such as Citizens United v. FEC, rely upon 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 that have not been subjected to rigorous adversarial testing. The adversarial myth exists because the U. S. legal system 2 ̆ 7 s current procedures were designed to address adjudicative facts-facts particularly within the legislative facts-more general facts {{about the state of the}} world. Recognizing knowledge of the parties-but many cases turn instead on this distinction between adjudicative and legislative facts helps identify those cases in which existing practices undermine, rather than promote, adversarial justice. This Article concludes with suggestions for reform, including liberalizing standing doctrine when legislative facts are at issue. If <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn to nonparties for help in resolving disputes of legislative fact, it is better that they be brought into the process earlier so the factual claims they offer can be rigorously tested...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes {{the very}} people who are {{supposed}} to teach, nurture, and protect students in public schools — the students’ teachers, principals, coaches, and other school officials — are instead the people who harm them. Public school officials have beaten students, causing significant physical harm. They have also left students suffering from depression, suicidal ideation, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. When school officials cause such severe harm to students, all the federal courts of appeals to consider the issue have concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment at least in theory protects them, regardless of whether the form of the harm is emotional or physical. Yet, an analysis of the cases across the circuits reveals that the courts have yet to actually find that a case of severe emotional harm on its own violates the Constitution, even though they have been willing to find physical harm unconstitutional. Not only do the courts not find stand-alone emotional harm sufficient to make out a constitutional violation, they also collectively evaluate students’ emotional harm very differently than their physical harm. This Article explores the distinction in the way the courts treat standalone emotional harm in public school students’ Fourteenth Amendment cases. It contends that if the <b>courts</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> recognize that the Constitution protects students from severe harm regardless of its physical or emotional form, as they do, then the distinction in treatment of emotional harm is untenable. Drawing on substantive due process theory, psychology, and law and emotions theory, this Article argues that the distinction in treatment is the result of emotions stigma, analogous to the long-recognized phenomenon of mental illness stigma, that discredits students’ emotions-based claims. It proposes a paradigm for evaluating students’ emotional harm that responds to and helps to overcome emotions stigma so the Constitution will protect students when school officials cause them severe emotional harm...|$|R

Using an agent-based-model (abm) we tested different criteria: the actual legal framework (first in first out), the provision of priorities based on seriousness of the offences, and a criterion based on crime diffusion. Since reducing crime is the same as decreasing social losses caused by crime, the reduction of social cost of crime becomes an output of judicial services. Preliminary test results show that each criterion affects workload and caseload for different crimes, also considering the social costs of each crime. ...|$|R

Some contested <b>court</b> decision and <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> file complaints to prosecutor's office. Others, including popular Moscow clubs B2 and IKRA, fixed their violations quickly and resumed operations. St. Petersburg Fire Safety Authority {{as a result of}} surprise checks motioned suspension of activity for 25 venues.|$|R

In comments at sentencing of the three, Judge George Layton stated, “One of the strange things about this case is that these defendants didn’t accomplish any of their purpose. The didn’t succeed in springing Oscar Lopez. They didn’t succeed in springing anybody from Pontiac Correctional Center. And they didn’t even succeed in planting the bombs. Why? Because in this case, in this court’s judgement, represents one of the finest examples of preventive law enforcement that has ever come to this <b>court’s</b> attention ...They <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> plant bombs in public buildings during a holiday.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Douds {{has also}} been criticized for {{undermining}} the First Amendment right to freedom of association. This right was also enshrined in the First Amendment. [...] In 1945, the Court had declared in Thomas v. Collins, 323 U.S. 516 (1945) that freedom of association held a [...] "preferred place" [...] {{in the pantheon of}} constitutional values. Three years later, in United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations, 335 U.S. 106 (1948) Justice Rutledge had concluded that, when confronted with the freedom of association, [...] " [...] judgment does not bear the same weight and is not entitled to the same presumption of validity, when the legislation on its face or in specific application restricts the rights of conscience, expression and assembly protected by the Amendment..." [...] Yet, in Douds, the <b>Court</b> announced it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show great deference to legislative determinations regarding the danger communists posed.|$|R
5000|$|As a result, Griswold and Buxton {{decided to}} test {{whether or not the}} law would be enforced, and opened a birth control clinic in New Haven. The clinic was shut down almost {{immediately}} and Griswold and Buxton were arrested and found guilty of violating the law by providing birth control. The case <b>was</b> taken to <b>court,</b> with Catherine Roraback representing Griswold and Buxton. She took a different approach to this case and argued that the law violated the right to privacy for married couples. During the trial, Roraback continued to argue the right to privacy for married couples. However, after a brief time, it was understood that the Connecticut <b>courts</b> <b>were</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change their stance on birth control and Roraback would lose the case. The courts valued the moral issues of the law to too great an extent to change. While defending Griswold and Buxton in what was then known to be the Buxton case in the Connecticut Superior Court, Roraback had already begun to file the appeals so that the case would be taken to the United States Supreme Court. Much to Roraback's belief, the jury ruled against Griswold and Buxton, considering the law necessary for the [...] "preservation of mankind", a ruling that Roraback found ridiculous. She brought the case to the Supreme Court, where it {{came to be known as}} Griswold v. Connecticut.|$|R
6000|$|Sir, this classing, in my opinion, is {{a serious}} and solid {{security}} {{for the performance of}} a minister's duty. Lord Coke says, that the staff was put into the Treasurer's hand to enable him to support himself when there was no money in the Exchequer, and to beat away importunate solicitors. The method which I propose would hinder him from the necessity of such a broken staff to lean on, or such a miserable weapon for repulsing the demands of worthless suitors, who, the noble lord in the blue ribbon knows, will bear many hard blows on the head, and many other indignities, before they are driven from the Treasury. In this plan, he is furnished with an answer to all their importunity,--an answer far more conclusive than if he had knocked them down with his staff:--"Sir, (or my Lord,) you are calling for my own salary,--Sir, you are calling for the appointments of my colleagues who sit about me in office,--Sir, you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> excite a mutiny at <b>court</b> against me,--you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> estrange his Majesty's confidence from me, through the chamberlain, or the master of the horse, or the groom of the stole." ...|$|R
40|$|What {{should be}} the broad {{principles}} guiding the copyright and competition policy governing online music? In short, what are the key concerns or values that we want preserved {{in relation to the}} distribution of music online? We will outline the background to the present investigations and existing law in Part I and argue in Part II that these concerns can be encapsulated in two broad areas: (1) the preservation of some scope for private and personal use and (2) the encouragement and growth of a diverse sector for the distribution of copyrighted works online. We also argue that, at least at present, the proper balance has not been achieved in either area. The particular principles we identify as important for promoting competition in the music industry include maximizing (1) content availability, (2) distribution technology, (3) fair individual use of content, and (4) the welfare of all stakeholders, as well as minimizing technologies of control that invade users 2 ̆ 7 privacy or unduly restrict use of content. Of course, regulators do not have free reign to pursue these principles. Current law and market structure constrain them. Our next question then moves from the realm of the ideal to the real: What {{should be the}} minimum terms of settlement? In Part III, we propose three key concessions from the recording industry, including the agreement 1) not to sue small and limited forms of digital music file sharing (known as virtual private networks), 2) to include consumer groups on industry standard-setting bodies, and 3) to disclose and limit digital rights management techniques. Second, we ask: How can we evaluate the means possible to achieve these ends? We contend that proposed reforms should be evaluated along axes of plausibility and comprehensiveness. As we will argue, those proposals which are most comprehensive - that is, the proposals most likely to achieve our stated aims in full - are also least plausible in the current institutional and legal environment. This motivates us to look for more realistically achievable, albeit less comprehensive goals. In other words, we would like to explore not just principle, but also issues of what, pragmatically, can be done in light of existing institutions and path dependence as well as principle. Third, we ask: What institutions are available that can plausibly promulgate and effectively apply regulations to achieve these ends? It is here in Part III that we turn to the antitrust authorities as potential promulgators of regulations embodying our preferred outcomes. We will argue that, in the context of these technological developments, in the area of copyright law, neither the legislature, nor the <b>courts,</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> strike the right balance. We therefore look to regulatory agencies, and in particular, the antitrust agencies, which are less likely in this context to be subject to capture by copyright interests. In Part IV, we outline the relative competencies and liabilities of Congress, the courts, and a range of administrative agencies in applying such regulation. We conclude by endorsing an expanded role for administrative agencies and a more restricted one for the courts...|$|R
