2500|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, the {{scientific}} consensus shifted {{to the view that}} gender plays no role in intelligence. In his 1916 study of children's IQs, psychologist Lewis Terman concluded that [...] "the intelligence of girls, at least up to 14 years, does not differ materially from that of boys". He did, however, find [...] "rather marked" [...] differences on a minority of tests. For example, he found boys were [...] "decidedly better" [...] in arithmetical reasoning, while girls were [...] "superior" [...] at answering <b>comprehension</b> <b>questions.</b> He also proposed that discrimination, lack of opportunity, women's responsibilities in motherhood, or emotional factors may have accounted for the fact that few women had careers in intellectual fields.|$|E
60|$|I {{can only}} profess {{at once that}} the sense of this last round about one was, at certain hours when {{the music and the}} chant of {{consolation}} rose in the stillness from our improvised stage {{at the end of the}} great hall, a thing to cloud with tears any pair of eyes lifted to our sublime saved roof in thanks for its vast <b>comprehension.</b> <b>Questions</b> of exhibited type, questions as to a range of form and tradition, a measure of sensibility and activity, not our own, dwindled and died before the gross fact of our having here an example of such a world-tragedy as we supposed Europe had outlived, and that nothing at all therefore mattered but that we should bravely and handsomely hold up our quite heavy enough end of it. It is because we have responded in this degree to the call unprecedented that we are, in common with a vast number of organisations scattered through these islands, qualified to claim that no small part of the inspiration to our enormous act of welcome resides in the moral interest it yields. One can indeed be certain of such a source of profit but in the degree in which one has found oneself personally drawing upon it; yet it is obvious that we are not treated every day to the disclosure of a national character, a national temperament and type, confined for the time to their plainest and stoutest features and set, on a prodigious scale, in all the relief that the strongest alien air and alien conditions can give them. Great salience, in such a case, do all collective idiosyncrasies acquire--upon the fullest enumeration of which, however, as the Belgian instance and the British atmosphere combine to represent them, I may not now embark, prepossessed wholly as I am with the more generally significant social stamp and human aspect so revealed, and with the quality derived from these things by the multiplied examples that help us to take them in. This feeling that our visitors illustrate above all the close and comfortable household life, with every implication of a seated and saturated practice of it, practice of the intimate and private and personal, the securely sensual and genial arts that flow from it, has been by itself the key to a plenitude of observation and in particular to as much friendly searching insight as one could desire to enjoy.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this classrom action research are {{to find out the}} messages conveyed by the song of ―Bismillah‖ written by Yusuf Islam which people recognized him as Cat Stevens and to enrich students‘ interests in learning English. This is based on the basic competence number 3. 11 and 413 as stated in the 2013 curriculum book that is to find out the messages of the song. In this research the teacher has applied the ―Bismillah‖ song in the two cycles. The teacher has applied <b>comprehension</b> <b>question</b> tests both in the first cycle and the second cycle to assess students‘ achievements in this research. The result of students‘ <b>comprehension</b> <b>question</b> after the song of ―Bismillah‖ being applied in classromm in the first cycle was 70, 71 % achievement, it was below the achievement level based on the assessment of school kkm which is stated 75.

40|$|Starting {{from the}} students’ {{difficulties}} in answering {{these types of}} question: (1) Best-Title Question, (2) Direct Referential Question, (3) Indirect Referential Question, (4) Direct Inferential Question, (5) Structural Question, (6) Vocabulary Question, I am interested in finding out how far the reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>question</b> types have helped the first year students of S. M. A. K. Santo Stanislaus in their reading comprehension. Therefore, I decide to conduct a study on reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>question</b> types and reading comprehension proficiency {{of the first year}} students of S. M. A. K. Santo Stanislaus to see whether they really correspond to each other. Different expert suggest differently about the types of reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>question.</b> Type of question that I use in this study are suggested by: Aliyah Abdul Karim, Desmond R. Burton, William E. Norris. Some considerations in selecting the types of question used in this study are: 1. 	The types of question should have been used repeatedly in class. 2. 	The question should be suitable for the first year students’ level. The questions that fulfill some considerations above are: 1. 	Best-Title Question 2. 	Direct Referential Question 3. 	Indirect Referential Question 4. 	Direct Inferential Question 5. 	Structural Question 6. 	Vocabulary Question The subjects of this study are all the students of S. M. A. K. Santo Stanislaus who during 1986 - 1987 school year belong to classes I 1, I 2, I 3. The method used in carrying out this research is descriptive method i. e. correlation in case study. To obtain the data for this research, I conduct a reading comprehension test. The procedures in constructing the test are: (1) the planning, (2) the trying out of the test, (3) the analyzing of the result of testing, (4) the improving of the test. The result of the test after it was improved has the coefficient of reliability. 73. As a homemade test, it may be regarded satisfactory. In future this test can be used directly since it has fulfilled the validity and the reliability of a good test. Using Two Serial Correlation, data analysis was done between the students’ scores on Best-Title Question and the students’ scores on Summary; the students’ scores on Direct Referential Question and the students’ Score in Summary; the students’ scores on Indirect Referential Question and the students’ scores on Summary; the students’ scores on Direct Inferential Question and the students’ scores on Summary; the students’ scores on Structural Question and the students’ scores on Summary; the students’ scores on Vocabulary Question and the students’ scores on Summary. The result of data analysis shows that there are four reading <b>comprehension</b> <b>question</b> types which are significantly account for the first year students’ reading comprehension proficiency. They are as follows: 1. 	Direct Referential Question 2. 	Indirect Referential Question 3. 	Direct Inferential Question 4. 	Vocabulary Question However, the two others i. e. the Structural Question and the Best-Title Question do not significantly account for the students’ reading comprehension proficiency. Types of question which significantly account for the a students’ reading comprehension proficiency can be ranked according to their coefficient of determination as follows: 1. 	Indirect Referential Question 2. 	Direct Inferential Question 3. 	Vocabulary Question 4. 	Direct Referential Question Three kinds of suggestions were given. First, for the English teacher of the first year students of S. M. A. K. Santo Stanislaus where the study was carried out. Second, for the future English curriculum designers.

50|$|A typical {{experiment}} {{designed to}} study the N400 will usually involve the visual presentation of words, either in sentence or list contexts.

Stimuli must be presented centrally because eye movements will generate large amounts of electrical noise that will mask the relatively small N400 component. Subjects will often be given a behavioral task (e.g., making a word/nonword decision, answering a <b>comprehension</b> <b>question,</b> responding to a memory probe), either after each stimulus or at longer intervals, to ensure that subjects are paying attention. Note, however, that overt responses by the subject are not required to elicit the N400—passively viewing stimuli will still evoke this response.|$|R
