40|$|Given {{a global}} {{specification}} contract {{and a system}} described by a composition of contracts, system verification reduces to checking that the <b>composite</b> <b>contract</b> refines the specification contract, i. e. that any implementation of the <b>composite</b> <b>contract</b> implements the specification contract {{and is able to}} operate in any environment admitted by it. Contracts are captured using high-level declarative languages, for example, linear temporal logic (LTL). In this case, refinement checking reduces to an LTL satisfiability checking problem, which can be very expensive to solve for large composite contracts. This paper proposes a scalable refinement checking approach that relies on a library of contracts and local refinement assertions. We propose an algorithm that, given such a library, breaks down the refinement checking problem into multiple successive refinement checks, each of smaller scale. We illustrate the benefits of the approach on an industrial case study of an aircraft electric power system, with up to two orders of magnitude improvement in terms of execution time. © 2014 EDAA...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{key problem}} that {{challenges}} the designers of serviceoriented systems is ensuring {{the consistency of}} composite Web service contracts based on their parameters. This paper utilizes constraint satisfaction approach to examine the problem at design time and by focusing on quality of service (QoS) contract parameters. It proposes a generic framework to formalize service contract composition as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). It also introduces an initial tool design for automating <b>composite</b> <b>contract</b> consistency checking and adaptation based on QoS parameters. The tool aims at supporting Web service orchestrators to specify appropriate contract parameter values and adapt them so that consistency of composite contracts is increased to some extent. Further, it enables them to analyze and reason about violation percentages during contract negotiation phase. The benefits of the proposed CSP framework and the tool design have been illustrated through a Stock Manager Web service composition scenario.

40|$|Slotting fee (hereafter SF) is an upfront fee a {{supplier}} {{is required to}} pay a retailer {{in order to have}} his product sold on the retailer's shelves. It is becoming increasingly common, but also widely reviled. This paper considers a newsvendor product whose expected demand is dependent on retail price and sales effort. The question we pose is: given that the Stackelberg-dominant retailer has to choose a pricing contract with which she transacts with the supplier, how would the supply-chain stakeholders fare when the retailer implements SF instead of another practical pricing contract? We show that, contradicting its negative public image, SF empowers the dominant retailer to specify contract terms that will benefit all the stakeholder-groups. That is, the supplier's and the retailer's profits are higher, the production workers are asked to produce more, and the consumers pay a lower retail price. We also propose a new <b>composite</b> <b>contract</b> format that incorporates both the SF and buyback features. This composite format empowers the retailer to provide even greater benefits to the supply-chain's stakeholders. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.

40|$|International audienceAbadi and Lamport {{established}} a general theorem for composing specifications [1]. Based on an assume-guarantee principle, it enables one {{to prove the}} specification of a composite system from the ones of its components. But the general application of this theorem to software composition is not that straightforward because the resulting abstract specification of the composite depends upon the hidden guarantees of its subcomponents. In this paper, we investigate how this result can be exploited without blurring responsibilities between the different participants. Our contributions leverage an existing contracting framework for hierarchical software components [7], in which contracts are first-class objects during configuration and run times. This framework already associates specifications and responsibilities to software components, within the traditional horizontal form of composition. We show here how the vertical one can be made operational using the theorem as a sound formal basis. The resulting <b>composite</b> <b>contracts</b> make possible not only to detect violations, but also to determine and exploit precisely responsibilities upon them, related to both forms of composition...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{materials}} {{based on}} glass fibre/epoxy composites {{have been produced}} by embedding TiNiCu alloy wires. Prestrained TiNiCu wires can generate large recovery stresses in a constrained condition and, therefore, modify the physical and mechanical properties of the composites if they are heated above the reverse transformation temperature of the wires. In this paper {{it has been shown}} that the rate at which the recovery stress increases with temperature, dsigma/dT, decreases with increasing prestrain level. For wires with a high prestrain level (4 - 6 %), the recovery stress increases immediately upon heating, even when the temperature is still below the reverse starting temperature, A(s). As a result, the absolute value of the strain rate at which the <b>composites</b> <b>contract</b> decreases with increasing prestrain level, and the composites with a high prestrain level (4 - 6 %) contract immediately upon heating.

40|$|The open/dynamic {{environment}} of Service-Oriented Computing requires middleware that can cope with {{services that are}} heterogeneous, and possibly unknown, unreliable or untrusted. Service-oriented middleware also needs to support both, ad-hoc and long-lived relationships between such services, and provide mechanisms for service coordination and cooperation. This needs to be achieved in a rapidly changing technical context with standards that are continually changing and evolving. This paper introduces adaptive application-specific middleware composites which are built using the ROAD framework. These composites are adaptive runtime role structures that allow services to be composed and autonomously reconfigured. In these <b>composites,</b> dynamic <b>contracts</b> control interactions between services, set non-functional requirements for those interactions, and measure the QoS of services against those requirements.

40|$|For {{flooring}} applications, calcium carbonate-filled poly(vinyl chloride), PVC, {{has long}} been the material of choice for both flexible sheeting and tile products. However, PVC-based formulations must be processed with plasticizers, which have recently raised some concerns from a sustainability point of view. In the research work reported here, calcium carbonate-filled formulations based on polyolefin plastomers, POP, are prepared in a laboratory-scale mixer, and their mechanical properties are studied for flooring applications. Plastomers are olefin copolymers synthesized using new metallocene catalyst technologies. The POP plastomer used in this research is Affinity 1140 a copolymer of ethylene and octene, and does not require any plasticizers for processing. The key mechanical properties of the calcium carbonate-filled POP, which include tensile strength, elongation and impact strength, are found to compare very favourably to those of PVC formulations at filler loadings of 200 phr. In addition, the filled POP formulations are able to incorporate a significant amount of post-consumer polyethylene(PC-PE) while maintaining adequate physical properties. Two types of PC-PE are tested in this research work: the first one is a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), and the second is a high density polyethylene (HDPE). The DSC analysis technique is used to study the difference in behavior between the two recycled resins. Dimensional stability tests are also reported, indicating that POP <b>composites</b> <b>contract</b> slightly more than the PVC-based ones. Overall, this study shows that calcium carbonate-filled POP should be studied further as a more sustainable alternative to filled PVC for flooring applications...|$|R

If the inclusions are placed randomly in the elastomer body, the <b>composite</b> always <b>contracts</b> along {{the direction of the}} applied field. For a simple cubic distribution of inclusions, contraction occurs if the applied field is directed along the [001] direction of the lattice. For inclusions occupying the sites of other lattice structures such as body-centered or face-centered cubic crystals, the composite elongates along the field direction if it is applied along the [001] direction. The stability of the elongation against the imperfectness of the lattice site positions and the distortion ratio of the initial structures are examined. Finite elongation windows show up for the initially distorted body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic crystals {{as a function of the}} distortion ratio of the initial structure. The existence of these elongation windows are also predicted from the analysis of the electrostatic energy of the distorted body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic lattice structures.

40|$|The {{application}} {{is based on}} works carried out in 5 distinct phases throughout a career at the University of Surrey spanning 36 years but with a 20 month gap in 1982 where I worked at Wimpey Laboratories undertaking research work on lightweight concretes. Initially, I was employed on an EPSRC NETCEM contract awarded to Prof Dave Hannant and Dr Jeff Keer where I developed and tested {{a replica of the}} Big 6 asbestos cement sheet. There was then a period where I was then employed on an advanced polymer <b>composites</b> <b>contract</b> awarded to Prof Len Hollaway. Although I had no specific technical knowledge of advanced polymer composites at this time I did have considerable expertise in conventional engineering materials and in experimental techniques. Within the period of this contract I gained sufficient knowledge and understanding to co-author a follow up contract. Additionally, I was able to contribute to the supervision of experimental techniques and the numerical modelling of structures undertaken by the PhD students in the research group at that time. Once taken on as a member of staff, albeit on a contractual basis, I undertook supervision and co-supervision of contracts that I had co-authored. I also applied for EPSRC starter funding available at the time. Whilst the application was not successful, Prof Len Hollaway and I were invited to take the principles of the application for reinforcing and strengthening conventional construction materials further and to expand them into a full application where we were subsequently awarded an EPSRC contract. Prof Len Hollaway and I were also requested by Prof Chris Clayton (then Head of Civil Engineering) to include other members of staff onto our contract applications. The first application included Prof Gerry Parke (then Reader in the Department of Civil Engineering) and the second application included a new member of staff Dr Toula Onoufriou (Reader in the Department of Civil Engineering). Both EPSRC applications were successful and resulted in fruitful contracts. We further included other new members of staff, albeit not successfully, on EPSRC applications for novel composite concrete beam configurations for which I took the principal investigator roll. I have since taken a proactive roll in investigating new areas of research, firstly with a PhD studentship in Electronic Engineering with Prof Graham Reed (then Reader in Silicon Wave Guide Applications in the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering) and then with the Composites Group in the Materials Department. This link with Prof Steve Ogin incorporated Graham’s expertise for our investigations into measurements in composite materials and then damage detection in composite materials. The major thrust in all of the work throughout this latter period of my career has been in the development and application of FRP composites through research into aspects of applied physics, optoelectronics, materials science and engineering and structural mechanics. It has been made possible through grants and contracts to which I have acted as co-investigator and co-supervisor of PhD students. This has been through both my own research effort and through my participation in an inter-disciplinary research group of staff in the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences spanning across the underpinning engineering disciplines. For the first 16 years, I was the primary member of this group with specific expertise in numerical modelling and simulation of engineering structures under mechanical and environmental loading conditions. Whilst I have been the primary lead in these areas over this period it has always been necessary to choose the Principal Investigator carefully to suit the funds applied for. In this early stage of the development into the research area we have been investigating fundamental materials research based on the formative crack density work conducted by Prof Steve Ogin, Prof Paul Smith and Dr Lynne Boniface. It was thus necessary to install Steve as the Principal Investigator over either Graham or myself for the applications to be successful...|$|R
