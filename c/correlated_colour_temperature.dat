The recent discovery of 'non-visual' retinal receptors has confirmed an anatomical basis for the non-image forming, biological effects of light and has stimulated interest {{in the use of}} light to enhance wellbeing in the corporate setting. Methods A prospective controlled intervention study was conducted within a shift-working call centre to investigate the effect of newly developed fluorescent light sources with a high <b>correlated</b> <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> (17000 K) upon the wellbeing, functioning and work performance of employees. Five items of the SF- 36 questionnaire and a modification of the Columbia Jet Lag scale, were used to evaluate employees on two different floors of the call centre between February and May 2005. Questionnaire completion occurred at baseline and after a three month intervention period, during which time one floor was exposed to new high <b>correlated</b> <b>colour</b> <b>temperature</b> lighting and the other remained exposed to usual office lighting.

40|$|Colour {{preference}} of lighting is generally influenced by {{three kinds of}} contextual factors, which are the features of light, object and observer. In this study, a series of psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate and compare the effect of certain factors on colour preference, including spectral power distribution of light, lighting application, observers’ personal colour preference, regional cultural difference and gender difference. Certain LED lights with different <b>correlated</b> <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> were used to illuminate {{a wide selection of}} objects. Participant response was quantified by a 7 -point rating method or a 5 -level ranking method. It was found that the preferred illumination for different objects exhibited a similar trend and the influence of light was significantly stronger than that of other factors. Therefore, we conclude that the light itself (rather than, for example, the objects that are viewed) is the most crucial factor for predicting which light, among several candidates with different CCTs, an observer will prefer. In addition, some of the gamut-based <b>colour</b> quality metrics <b>correlated</b> well with the participants’ response, which corroborates the viewpoint that colour preference is strongly influenced by colour saturation.

Research showed that high intensity light has the capacity of restoring this disturbed cycle to the normal, 24 -hour, rhythm again. Moreover, the action spectrum for non-image forming effects lies in the bluish part of the light spectrum. Therefore, the question is if full-spectrum, blue-enriched highintensity light in a regular setting has better results than red-enriched light.

40|$|White hybrid inorganic/organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) were fabricated by combining a novel organic colour converter {{with a blue}} inorganic LED. An organic small molecule was specifically synthesised to act as down-converter. The characteristics of the white colour were controlled by changing the concentration of the organic molecule based on the BODIPY unit, which was embedded in a transparent matrix, and volume of the molecule and encapsulant mixture. The concentration has a critical effect on the conversion efficiency, i. e. {{how much of the}} absorbed blue light is converted into yellow light. With increasing concentration the conversion efficiency decreases. This quenching effect is due to aggregation of the organic molecule at higher concentrations. Increasing the deposited amount of the converter does not increase the yellow emission despite more blue light being absorbed. Degradation of the organic converter was also observed during a period of 15 months from LED fabrication. Angular-dependent measurements revealed slight deviation from a Lambertian profile for the blue and yellow emission peaks leading to a small change in "whiteness" with emission angle. Warm white and cool white light with <b>correlated</b> <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> of 2770 K and 7680 K, respectively, were achieved using different concentrations of the converter molecule.

The study considers objective investigations on optical material properties (i. e. spectral reflection factor) compared to subjective tests on colour attributes evaluation of artworks lighted by common lamps (incandescent and fluorescent lamps) and LED lighting sources. Commission International Eclairage (CIE) developed several mathematical methods to predict colour rendering of lighting source, as well visual attributes of materials, but are only an approximation of the material appearance: too many parameters of influence, subjects expectancy included, influence the appearance. In artwork exhibition visual appearance is of fundamental importance and currently no reliable and robust appearance model is available.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the structure of the prepared nanoparticles was of cubical shape, which is also evident in TEM images. The size of the nanoparticles for core (SrF 2 : 3 Dy) is found to increase when core is covered by shell (CaF 2).

In the photoluminescence investigation, emission spectra of SrF 2 : 3 Dy is found to be highly enhanced when SrF 2 : 3 Dy is covered by CaF 2 due to the decrease of cross relaxation amongst the Dy 3 +-Dy 3 + ions.

30|$|The {{relatively}} broad line-width of red emission from OLEDs {{makes it}} difficult to achieve excellent color quality and high efficacy simultaneously. Nevertheless, over the last years an enhanced interest towards OLEDs has {{led to the development of}} new units characterized by higher luminous efficacy, longer life-spam, lower cost and better light and colour quality (warm light with different <b>Correlated</b> <b>Colour</b> <b>Temperatures).</b> According to two other studies carried out by the US Department of Energy [4, 5], the average cost of OLEDs, estimated equal to 500 $/klm in 2014 for an OLED panel will drop to 50 dollars/klm in 2015 and to 25 dollars /klm in 2020, whilst the luminous efficacy is expected to reach values as high as 135 lm/W in 2015 (being 45 lm/W in 2011 and 80 lm/W in 2014), with a feasible goal of 190 lm/W. The brightness is also expected to double its value in 2015 compared to the current performance. On the geometrical side, the sizes of OLED units, presently limited to 300 mm ∗ 100 mm (but 100 mm ∗ 100 mm square unites are typically manufactured) will be consolidated in 30 mm ∗ 30 mm square units in 2015. According to [5], from laboratory measurements, “Konica Minolta has shown a 15  cm 2 panel with an efficacy of 131  lm/W at 1000  cd/m 2 and 118  lm/W at 3000  cd/m 2, while Panasonic has successfully scaled their technology to an area of 25  cm 2, achieving efficacy of 112  lm/W at 1000  cd/m 2 and 98  lm/W at 3000  cd/m 2.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were to explore {{different approaches to}} improve energy efficiency and colour quality, {{and to find out}} the subjective preference of LED office lighting. Four approaches (optimization of LED spectra, lighting retrofitting, hue-heat hypothesis, and smart indoor lighting control) were studied for energy efficiency and colour quality improvement. Two experiments, one in lighting booths and the other in an office room, were conducted to examine subjective preferences. In the optimization of LED spectra, simulation work and subjective preference studies conducted in lighting booths suggested that preferred complex LED spectra (realized with 9 to 11 different types of LEDs) found in previous user acceptance studies can be optimized both for efficiency and cost without sacrificing the colour quality of the light. The lighting retrofitting case study showed that by replacing T 8 fluorescent luminaires with LED luminaries, and the LED luminaries with inbuilt control systems, energy savings of up to 38 % and 68 % respectively, can be achieved with improvement of lighting quality and user satisfaction. The experiment conducted to test the hue-heat hypothesis using different <b>correlated</b> <b>colour</b> <b>temperatures</b> (CCTs) of white light did not provide support for the existence of a general correlation between CCT and thermal sensation or thermal comfort and indicated that people felt thermally more comfortable in an indoor workplace at the CCT of 4000 K than at the CCT of 2700 K or 6200 K. A methodology to incorporate data from lighting studies relating colour quality to comfort and productivity to the building automation system has been proposed and demonstrated. The subjective preferences in terms of illuminance and CCT and the CCT preference of three ethnic groups (Asian, European, and African) for LED office lighting were investigated in an office room. Nine different lighting situations (combining 300 lx, 500 lx, and 750 lx with 3000 K, 4000 K, and 5000 K) were compared. The combination of 750 lx with 4000 K was statistically significantly preferred over the other combinations for LED office lighting. It was also found that the CCT of 4000 K was preferred over the CCT of 3000 K for office lighting at 300 lx, 500 lx, and 750 lx. The results indicated that the impression of brightness, the feeling of stimulation, and the impression of spaciousness in office room increases with increased CCT. The study also showed that for office lighting the European group prefer the CCT of 4000 K, and with the Asian and African groups the preference between 4000 K and 5000 K depends upon illuminance levels...|$|R

In astronomy, the stellar classification of stars and their place on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram are based, in part, upon their surface temperature, known as effective temperature. The photosphere of the Sun, for instance, has an effective temperature of [...]|$|R
