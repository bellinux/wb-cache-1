30|$|The {{value of}} the {{activation}} energy reflects not only the degree of difficulty the reaction {{takes place in the}} riser reactor; it also embodies the sensitivity of the reaction to the reaction temperature [9]. According to TableÂ  5, several conclusions can be deduced: (1) the activation energies of cracking heavy oil, diesel, gasoline and LPG increase sequentially, which indicates that the longer the carbon chain of the hydrocarbon is, the more readily it cracks. This agrees well with the carbonium ion mechanism in FCC processes; (2) the activation energy of producing low-carbon olefin from <b>cracking</b> <b>gasoline</b> olefins is a little smaller than that of producing low-carbon alkanes, and the energy barrier that needs to be crossed in reactions of <b>cracking</b> <b>gasoline</b> olefins is much higher than that in reactions of <b>cracking</b> <b>gasoline</b> saturates. The phenomena indicate that an improved yield of propylene would be obtained when gasoline which is rich in the olefins is fed into the riser. Indeed, Li [5] showed that light gasoline with a relative high content of olefins gives rise to a higher propylene yield than heavy oil and full-cut gasoline. This is consistent with the target of decreasing the content of olefins in gasoline and improving the yield of propylene with the second-stage riser reactor in the TMP process.|$|R

50|$|The {{evaluation}} of the octane number by the two laboratory methods requires a standard engine, and the test procedure can be both expensive and time-consuming. The standard engine required for the test {{may not always be}} available, especially in out-of-the-way places or in small or mobile laboratories. These and other considerations led to the search for a rapid method for the {{evaluation of}} the anti-knock quality of gasoline. Such methods include FTIR, near infrared on-line analyzers (ASTM D-2885) and others. Deriving an equation {{that can be used for}} calculating the octane quality would also serve the same purpose with added advantages. The term Octane Index is often used to refer to the calculated octane quality in contradistinction to the (measured) research or motor octane numbers. The octane index can be of great service in the blending of gasoline. Motor gasoline, as marketed, is usually a blend of several types of refinery grades that are derived from different processes such as straight-run gasoline, reformate, <b>cracked</b> <b>gasoline</b> etc. These different grades are considered as one group when blending to meet final product specifications. Most refiners produce and market more than one grade of motor gasoline, differing principally in their anti-knock quality. The ability to predict the octane quality of the blends prior to blending is essential, something for which the calculated octane index is specially suited.|$|E
40|$|The {{contributions}} of three major gasoline blending components (reformate, alkylate and <b>cracked</b> <b>gasoline)</b> to potential environmental impacts (PEI) are assessed. This study estimates losses of the gasoline blending components due to evaporation and leaks through their life cycle, from petroleum refining to vehicle refuelling. A sensitivity analysis {{is performed using}} different weighting factors for each potential environmental impact category, {{in order to assess}} the effect of each blending component on the total potential environmental impacts. The results indicate that reformate and <b>cracked</b> <b>gasoline</b> mainly contribute to photochemical oxidation followed by aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity by ingestion. On the other hand, alkylate contributes mostly to aquatic toxicity but very little to photochemical oxidation. From the sensitivity analysis, a high weighting on the impact categories for aquatic toxicity, terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity by ingestion leads to alkylate having the largest potential impacts of the three blending components, whereas other combinations of weighting factors indicate that alkylate has the lowest potential impacts...|$|E
30|$|It is {{generally}} expected that {{a rise in}} hydrocarbon partial pressure will increase the rate of all bimolecular reactions, including hydrogen transfer, relative to cracking, which is unimolecular [49]. An increase {{in the rate of}} hydrogen transfer will result in a reduction of olefins in both gasoline and LPG, and an increase in gasoline range aromatics and paraffins. The change in the rate of hydrogen transfer could also affect the gasoline sulfur concentration as well as the effectiveness of gasoline sulfur reduction catalysts and additives. Moreover, the effectiveness of ZSM- 5 additives, which are used to produce light olefins, especially propylene, could be affected by the hydrocarbon partial pressure. As ZSM- 5 works by <b>cracking</b> <b>gasoline</b> range olefin molecules, changing the rate of hydrogen transfer could have a profound impact on the propylene yield.|$|R

The {{results showed that}} acidity and hydrothermal stability of zeolite have changed with modification. Comparing the acidity of zeolite modified with Cu, V or Zn, the intensity of acid of zeolite modified with V was the weakest, and then was with Zn, and with Cu was the strongest. Vanadium destroyed crystal structure of zeolite heavily, while Zn was more lightly. Sulphur compounds cracking need more weak L acid active sites in catalyst, and more strong L acid led to producing coke.

40|$|Catalytic {{cracking}} in {{fluidized bed}} {{is one of}} the most complicated and difficult processes in the sense of understanding. The reason for this is due to the fact, that change of one single parameter is related with changes of one or several parameters, which is consequence of utilities system balance. Statistic data processing from manufacturing FCC Unit can accede to more complete information regarding regularities, which relate yields and product quality to process parameters at acceptable parameters variations. By means of regressive analysis of 49 operating days of FCC Unit type âside by sideâ G- 43 - 107 (Grozni design) equations were obtained, which take in consideration the impact of process variables on conversion and yields. It is clear that conversion depends on catalyst activity, on the ratio catalyst/feed and on presence of naphtha precursor in feed. It is clear, also that naphtha production ca be increased by reduction of reactor temperature and increase of catalyst-feed ratio.

30|$|This {{phenomenon}} can {{be explained}} from the above characterization results. The HZSM- 5 zeolite contains BrÃ¸nsted acid sites which can supply protons for the FCC reaction. The shifting of proton results {{in the formation of}} carbonium ions which favors the FCC reaction towards the formation of light olefins such as propylene and butylene [37, 38]. It is well know that the FCC reaction is a parallel sequential mechanism. The cracking of the crude oil primarily produce gasoline and diesel oil. However, in the secondary stage, it produces light olefins such as propylene and butylene. As listed in TableÂ  4, the ZC 7300 catalyst with HZSM- 5 improves the selectivity of the reaction to form secondary cracking products, which results in the increase in the yield of light olefin and decrease in the yield of the primary <b>cracking</b> products <b>gasoline.</b> The decrease of the yields of coke may be attributed to the mesopore structure derived from the interspaces of ZSM- 5 crystals that endow the corresponding catalyst with improved accessibility to hydrocarbon molecules and thereafter, lower down the coke selectivity.|$|R
