60|$|I {{knew not}} what had aroused me, but I found {{myself out of}} my bunk, on my feet, wide awake, my soul {{vibrating}} to the warning of danger {{as it might have}} thrilled to a trumpet call. I threw open the door. The <b>cabin</b> <b>light</b> was burning low. I saw Maud, my Maud, straining and struggling and crushed in the embrace of Wolf Larsen’s arms. I could see the vain beat and flutter of her as she strove, pressing her face against his breast, to escape from him. All this I saw on the very instant of seeing and as I sprang forward.|$|E
60|$|One thing only {{disturbed}} {{them for}} a moment. Even these children had wolf memories and vied with Old Tomah in eagerness of telling. They remembered one fearful winter, years ago, {{when most of the}} families of the little fishing village on the East Harbor had moved far inland to sheltered cabins in the deep woods to escape the cold and the fearful blizzards of the coast. One still moonlit night, when the snow lay deep and the cold was intense and all the trees were cracking like pistols in the frost, a mournful howling rose all around their little <b>cabin.</b> <b>Light</b> footfalls sounded on the crust; there were scratchings at the very door and hoarse breathings at every crack; while the dogs, with hackles up straight and stiff on their necks, fled howling under beds and tables. And when Mooka and Noel went fearfully with their mother to the little window--for the men were far away on a caribou hunt--there were gaunt white wolves, five or six of them, flitting restlessly about in the moonlight, scratching at the cracks and even raising themselves on their hind legs to look in at the little windows.|$|E

5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed.

5000|$|The Renault AGC is a {{conventional}} <b>cabin</b> <b>light</b> {{truck with a}} 1.5 tonnes payload produced between 1938 and 1940. It replaced the Renault ADK. For military use, it was delivered with a wheelbase of 3760 mm, a length between 5680 mm (long version) and 5000 mm, and width of 1950 mm. The engine was a 2.4-litre inline-four unit with a maximum power output of [...] at 2,800 rpm. The gearbox was a 4-speed manual unit. Besides a simple truck, the AGC was produced as a van and as a bus for 12 to 14 passengers.|$|E
40|$|Much {{has been}} made of the safety record of the airline industry. Every {{incident}} from a <b>cabin</b> <b>light</b> failure to total hull destruction is recorded in virtually every newspaper and television broadcast. Each and every detail is analyzed minutely and the pundits are asked to comment. It would seem that aircraft accidents were always the result of “someone who has done something wrong. ” “He must be found! He must be punished! ” was the general attitude. But the facts were otherwise! System failures were just as important as human frailties. Major hull-loss incidents are remarkably rare. Even in the late 1960 s when the ill-fated Comets were no longer flying, there were only 45 major events per one-million departures. Nevertheless, that was and is not good enough! It was an Australian chemist, David Warren, who turne...|$|E

50|$|The Bü 181 evolved {{very little}} during the war, the {{differences}} between the B type and the C types were minimal, the most important being the increased autonomy of the C types. The main difference between the B-1 & C-1 and the B-2 and C-2 sub-types was the presence of pitot heating and position & <b>cabin</b> <b>lights</b> while the B-2 and C-2 types lacked any electrical system.|$|R
50|$|The APUs {{also provide}} {{enough power to}} keep the <b>cabin</b> <b>lights,</b> {{pressure}} and other systems on while the engines are off. The valves used to control the airflow are usually electrically controlled. They automatically close at a pre-determined speed. As part of the starting sequence on some engines, fuel is combined with the supplied air and burned instead of using just air. This usually produces more power per unit weight.|$|R
50|$|The Citroën Hypnos is {{a concept}} {{mid-size}} luxury crossover produced by Citroën at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. It has a 5-door SUV body style and {{is powered by a}} diesel hybrid drivetrain with a rear axle-mounted electric motor. The car's most distinctive design feature is its interior, with rainbow-coloured, offset seats, and a system which analyzes the driver's face to gauge his state of mind and adjust the <b>cabin</b> <b>lighting</b> and scented air freshener fragrance in consequence.|$|R

The buttons to turn the lights on and off are usually located directly on the overhead console on most narrowbody aircraft, while on most widebody aircraft, the buttons are usually found together with the in-flight entertainment controls, generally located on the armrests, on seat backs, or through the touch screen interface on some personal televisions.|$|R

The ventilation system doubled as cooling for the braking resistances. During cold weather the carriage air could be routed via the resistance to heat it, and warm and cold air could be mixed at various levels. As there was no resistance in the trailers, these were equipped with electric heaters. The trams had a 24-volt <b>lighting</b> system with <b>cabin</b> <b>lighting</b> from fluorescent lamps.|$|R
50|$|Late in 1935 V.K. Tairov helped {{form the}} OKO (experimental design section) in Kiev. In 1937 the OKO-1 was {{completed}} as a six-seat passenger transport, with all wood construction, this single engined monoplane demonstrated good performance with state-of-the-art systems. Electrically driven flaps, pneumatic wheel brakes, trimmers {{on all the}} tail surfaces, heated <b>cabin,</b> <b>lighting</b> and instruments for night or blind flying, full sound-proofing and full GVF(civil air fleet) equipment were all incorporated. The performance of the aircraft in flight tests was regarded as excellent but, for unknown reasons, production was not undertaken.|$|R

It is typically found next to, on, or inside, each flight attendant's jump seat and is for use in an emergency situation where there has been a loss of cabin electrics. It is primarily to be used by flight attendants to ensure that their cabin area is clear of passengers before they leave the aircraft.
