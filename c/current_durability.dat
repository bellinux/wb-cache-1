40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is {{preparing}} to initiate processing of Sludge Batch 7 a (SB 7 a) in May 2011. To support qualification of SB 7 a, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was requested to execute a variability study (VS) to assess {{the applicability of the}} current Product Composition Control System (PCCS) durability models for the Frit 418 -SB 7 a compositional region of interest. The objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate applicability of the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models to the SB 7 a compositional region of interest and acceptability of the SB 7 a glasses with respect to the Environmental Assessment (EA) glass in terms of durability as defined by the Product Consistency Test (PCT). To support programmatic objectives, twenty-eight SB 7 a glasses were selected based on the nominal sludge projections used to support the frit recommendation. Twenty-three of the SB 7 a VS glasses were based on the use of Frit 418, while 5 glasses were based on the use of Frit 702. Frit 702 was also identified as a viable candidate for SB 7 a, especially if SO{sub 4 } concentrations are found to be higher than anticipated. Frit 702 has shown a higher SO{sub 4 } retention capability as compared to Frit 418. With respect to acceptability, the PCT results of the SB 7 a-VS glasses are acceptable relative to the EA glass regardless of thermal history (quenched or canister centerline cooled) or compositional view (target or measured). More specifically, all of the SB 7 a glasses have normalized boron release values (NL [B]) less than 0. 9 g/L as compared to the benchmark NL [B] value for EA of 16. 695 g/L. With respect to the applicability of the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models to the SB 7 a VS compositional region of interest, all of the study glasses (based on target compositions) lie within the 95 % confidence intervals of the model predictions. When model applicability is based on the measured compositions, all of the SB 7 a VS glasses are predictable with the exception of SB 7 aVS- 02 and SB 7 aVS- 06. Although the NL [B] values of these two glasses range from 0. 66 to 0. 73 g/L (considered very acceptable), the PCT responses are not considered predictable by the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models. The <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models are conservative for these glasses since they are more durable than predicted by the models. These two glasses are extreme vertices (EV) based compositions coupled with Frit 418 at 36 % WL and target the maximum Na{sub 2 }O content (15. 01 wt% Na{sub 2 }O) of the SB 7 a VS glasses. Higher alkali glasses for which the model overpredicts the PCT response have been observed previously in the Sludge Batch 3 (SB 3) Phase 1 VS and the Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) VS...|$|E

40|$|Low noise road {{surfaces}} of existing types may in favourable cases {{and in new}} conditions provide up to 7 dB of noise reduction. For higher noise reductions, innovative solutions must be sought. Poroelastic road surfaces (PERS) may be such a solution, which currently is studied in the EU project PERSUADE. This paper presents results of trials with a PERS version prefabricated {{by one of the}} project partners. Tests were made in a laboratory at TUG, where different tyres were tested on drums covered with PERS, and later field tests were made on a local street in Sweden where VTI had constructed a 25 m long trial section. The field tests were made with a CPX trailer from TUG. Both laboratory and field results showed that tyre/road noise reductions of 9 - 11 dB were achieved compared to a dense asphalt concrete pavement with maximum aggregate size 11 mm. This is the best result so far in the project. At the same time, this PERS, despite being relatively soft, reduces rolling resistance of passenger car tyres to record-low values, which is important for reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. It is concluded that this type of prefabricated poroelastic road surface offers a very efficient way of reducing tyre/road noise, provided <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> problems can be solved...|$|E

40|$|During the {{progressive}} {{development of the}} cold cap model (as it applies to a potential melt rate predictive tool), {{the formation of an}} Al-Li-silicate phase was identified as an intermediate reaction phase that could possibly hinder melt rate for SB 4. To test this theory, six glasses were designed (using Frit 320 's composition as the baseline) to maintain a constant 20 wt% sum of alkali content (in frit) by varying Na{sub 2 }O to Li{sub 2 }O ratios. The Li{sub 2 }O concentration ranged from 8 wt% down to 0 % in either 2 % or 1 % increments with the differences being accounted for by an increase in Na{sub 2 }O concentration. Although the primary objective of the ''lower Li{sub 2 }O'' frits was to evaluate the potential for melt rate improvements, assessments of durability (as measured by the Product Consistency Test (PCT)) were also performed. The results suggest that durable glasses can be produced with these ''lower Li{sub 2 }O'' frits should it be necessary to pursue this option for improving melt rate. In addition to the series of glasses to support melt rate assessments, a series of frits were also developed to challenge the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> model based on the limits proposed by Edwards et al. (2004). Although the ''new'' limits allow access into compositional regions of interest (i. e., higher alkali systems) which can improve melt rate and/or waste loading, there may still be ''additional'' conservatism. In this report, two series of glasses were developed to challenge the ''new'' durability limits for the SB 4 system. In the first series, the total alkali of the Frit 320 -based glasses (designed to support the melt rate program) was increased from 20 wt% to 21 wt% (in the frit), but the series also evaluated the possible impact of various Na{sub 2 }O and Li{sub 2 }O mass ratio differences. The second series pushed the alkali limit in the frit even further with frits containing either 22 or 24 wt% total alkali as well as various Na{sub 2 }O and Li{sub 2 }O mass ratios. The results of the PCT evaluation indicated that all of the ''higher alkali'' glasses are acceptable as defined by their NL [B]'s as compared to the Environmental Assessment (EA) glass (with a 16. 695 g/L NL [B]) [...] regardless of the compositional view (measured or target) or thermal heat treatment (quenched versus centerline canister cooled). The least durable glass (based on NL [B] and target compositions) was Low-Li- 7 (quenched) with a NL [B] of 1. 11 g/L. With the measured PCT responses being acceptable (i. e., all < 1. 11 g/L), the results suggest additional conservatism exists within the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> model even with the ''proposed'' limits. More specifically, the ''proposed'' limits still appear to restrict access to compositional regions of interest (higher alkali glasses) even though their measured PCT responses are acceptable...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} amount of {{concrete}} {{in the capital}} infrastructure, the maintenance and management burden is increasing and the calculation of life-cycle-cost and service lifetime are gaining in importance. The design, construction, maintenance, and management of structures raises the following questions : (1) Will the concrete structure provide service over its lifetime without reinforcement and repair? (2) How will performance and safety deteriorate if the structure is left alone? (3) How can <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> designs be checked? Accordingly, {{there is a need}} to predict the deterioration and service life of concrete structures. A method of achieving this needs to be established as soon as possible.

This paper describes the development of a technique and a case-study in which the technique is applied to a tentative model. The case-study results show that the water-cement ratio and depth of cover over reinforcing steel influenced deterioration over time due to neutralization and steel corrosion. Between some cases of choosing of the rate, several-fold variations in neutralization depth and a factor of two in the time until the onset of steel corrosion were recognized.

40|$|This {{report is}} the second {{in a series of}} studies of the impacts of the {{addition}} of Crystalline Silicotitanate (CST) and Monosodium Titanate (MST) from the Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) process on the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) glass waste form and the applicability of the DWPF process control models. The KT 05 -series glasses were selected, fabricated, and characterized to further study glass compositions where iron titanate crystals had been previously found to form. The intent was to better understand the mechanisms and compositions that favored the formation of crystals containing titanium. Formation of these crystalline phases was confirmed. Increased Na{sub 2 }O concentrations had little if any impact on reducing the propensity for the formation of the iron titanate crystalline phases. Other physical properties of these glasses were not measured since the intent was to focus on crystallization. Additional studies are suggested to investigate the potential impacts of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } and K{sub 2 }O on crystallization in glasses with high TiO{sub 2 } concentrations. The KT 06 -series glasses were selected, fabricated, and characterized to further study glass compositions that, while broader than the current projections for DWPF feeds with SCIX material, are potential candidates for future processing (i. e., the compositions are acceptable for processing by the Product Composition Control System (PCCS) {{with the exception of the}} current TiO{sub 2 } concentration constraint). The chemical compositions of these glasses matched well with the target values. The chemical durabilities of all the glasses were acceptable relative to the Environmental Assessment (EA) benchmark. Minor crystallization was identified in some of the slowly cooled glasses, although this crystallization did not impact chemical durability. Several of the KT 06 -series compositions had durability values that, while acceptable, were not accurately predicted by the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models. It was shown that for these high TiO{sub 2 } concentration glasses, relatively high Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } concentrations combined with relatively high Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } concentrations led to durabilities that were unpredictable. Several of the KT 06 -series glasses also had measured viscosity values that were not well predicted by the current model. A statistical partitioning routine showed that the measured viscosities became unpredictable by the current model when the Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } concentration in the glasses was less than about 8. 2 wt % at the elevated TiO{sub 2 } concentrations. The <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> and viscosity models will have to be further evaluated should compositions in these regions become necessary for DWPF processing. Overall, the results presented for the KT 06 -series glasses show that TiO{sub 2 } from the SCIX streams can be incorporated into DWPF-type glasses at concentrations of 6 wt % (in glass) without any detrimental impacts on crystallization or chemical durability that are of practical importance. The measured values for chemical durability and viscosity were acceptable for processing; however, not all of the values were predictable by the current PCCS models. Since the compositions selected for the KT 06 -series glasses were outside the current projections for DWPF processing with the SCIX streams (in terms of waste components other than TiO{sub 2 }), these results help identify compositional regions that, if necessary for processing, would require modifications to the current models. Additional experiments are currently underway. Once completed, all of the measured data will be reviewed and compared to model predictions to better determine whether the validation range of the DWPF process control models can be confidently extended, or whether refitting of the models will be necessary...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} rugged sheathless {{interface}} for capillary electrophoresis/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (CE/ESI-MS) was designed using common laboratory tools and chemicals. The interface uses a small platinum (Pt) wire that is {{inserted into the}} CE capillary through a small hole near the terminus. The position of the wire inside the CE capillary and within the buffer solution is analogous to standard CE separation operations where the terminus of the CE capillary is placed inside a buffer reservoir along with a grounded platinum electrode.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2011. Damage to {{reinforced}} concrete bridges due to carbonation and chloride induced corrosion is widespread in South Africa and prone in environments where {{carbon dioxide is}} at high levels {{as well as in}} marine environments where chlorides are present. Performance specifications are therefore essential in order that structural concrete can be designed and constructed to the required standards ensuring that the long term durability can be maintained. This dissertation includes a review of SANRAL‘s <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> specifications. The specifications are critiqued in terms of the testing methodology followed as well as strength and environmental exposure considerations, and recommendations are made for improving the specifications. The literature review, outlines the background to both carbonation and chloride induced corrosion to {{reinforced concrete}} bridges, considering the fundamental causes of deterioration of concrete caused by carbonation and chloride ingress and repair costs during their service life. The South African Durability Index tests are presented and reviewed, in particular the laboratory testing apparatus and procedures. In addition, the index tests are compared with durability test methods currently being used internationally. The background and previous durability specifications used in South Africa on road bridges as well as details of research into specifications to ensure durable concrete with specific emphasis on curing of concrete is summarised. The indications are that performance based specifications for concrete on bridge structures internationally follow similar criteria to the specifications currently being adopted by SANRAL. Both performance and prescriptive specifications used usually depend on the risk that a constructor needs to carry. Importantly both cement extenders to ensure long term durability and penalties are applied in performance based durability. SANRAL‘s <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> specifications are reviewed and both the negatives and positives are presented for the various sections. Amendments to the Committee of Land Transport Officials (COLTO) standard specifications are recommended address shortcomings. The latest project specifications used on SANRAL contracts incorporating target requirements for cover and oxygen permeability are evaluated. These impose penalties if targets are not achieved, while limits are placed on chloride conductivity values for various blended binders. Data is also included for the sorptivity index values on the five projects which may analysed and target values can be set and implemented in future. Descriptions of the five projects with regard to durability specifications, their environmental exposure condition and concrete mix designs are presented. Five projects in KwaZulu-Natal, are used as case studies for durability tests and specifications. The only distinct difference in the specifications is that the three projects commencing in 2006 and early in 2007 had the target values for water sorptivity whereas for the project, sorptivity values are only reported on. Durability index testing results at each of the sites from the trial panels, additional test cubes (cast for coring and testing of durability indexes) as well as coring and testing from the bridge structures are presented. A major change is coring and testing of samples from trial panels and additional test cubes on the site instead of coring of the structure. The information is drawn together and relationships are determined between the various durability indexes as well as to strength. It is evident that the quality of concrete as constructed in the structure which is reflected by the durability index results is different to that produced in the test cubes and trial panels. It is deduced that while more care is being taken to produce quality concrete on the sites, certain aspects of the specifications need revision in order to remove confusion as well as to ensure that the concrete in the structure meets the target requirements. Finally it is noted that climate change is having an impact on design of bridge infrastructure, and while the surveys undertaken at Ethekwini and Msunduzi Municipalities shows that carbon dioxide levels being recorded are still average levels, worldwide there has been an increase in CO 2 levels and further modifications to specifications in future may be required...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a novel methodology {{for evaluation of}} in service loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions. It also {{presents a}} novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals {{as an alternative to}} the cycle counting methods. <b>Current</b> <b>durability</b> testing of automatic transmission output shafts uses 50 000 stall torque cycles from zero to wide open throttle. In the majority of cases, these requirements lead to an over design that can result in an unnecessarily bulky transmission system. As a solution to this problem a novel methodology for evaluation of loads applied to the output shafts of automatic transmissions was developed. The methodology is based on real world loading conditions and therefore leads to a more realistic estimation of the fatigue life of shafts. The methodology can be used as a tool for shaft optimisation in different drive conditions. Using the developed methodology the effects of different road conditions on the fatigue life of a transmission output shaft were compared. Four routes having differing driving conditions were investigated and of those routes, the route with most stop-start events resulted in the greatest reduction in fatigue life. A novel methodology of data reduction for shaft load signals was also developed. The methodology is based on knowledge of the bandwidth and dynamic range of the expected in-service load signal. This novel methodology allows significant reduction of the volume of data to be acquired. It preserves the time sequence of peaks and valleys of the signal, which is vital in the case of fatigue analysis. This is in contrast to current methods based on cycle counting. Cycle counting methods achieve high data reduction but do not preserve the time sequence of the signal. The developed novel methodology has been validated on the newly developed data acquisition system capable of real time data acquisition and compression of shaft torque signal. The performed tests show that the proposed one-channel low cost system equipped with 1 GB compact flash card can store well over 10 000 hrs of load history...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is {{preparing}} to initiate processing Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) in early FY 2009. In support of the upcoming processing, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) provided a recommendation to utilize Frit 418 as a transitional frit to initiate processing of SB 5. This recommendation {{was based on the}} results of assessments on the compositional projections for SB 5 available at that time from both the Liquid Waste Organization (LWO) and SRNL (using a model-based approach). To support qualification of the Frit 418 -SB 5 system, SRNL executed a variability study to assess the acceptability of the Frit 418 -SB 5 glasses with respect to durability and the applicability of the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models. Twenty one glasses were selected for the variability study based on the available SB 5 projections primarily spanning a waste loading (WL) range of 25 - 37 %. In order to account for the addition of caustic to Tank 40, which occurred in July 2008, 3 wt% Na 2 O was added to the original Tank 40 heel projections. The addition of the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) stream to the blend composition was also included. Two of the glasses were fabricated at 25 % and 28 % WL in order to challenge the homogeneity constraint of the Product Composition Control System (PCCS) for SB 5 coupled operations. These twenty one glasses were fabricated and characterized using chemical composition analysis, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and the Product Consistency Test (PCT). The results of this study indicate that Frit 418 is a viable option for sludge-only and coupled operations. The addition of ARP did not have any negative impacts on the acceptability and predictability of the variability study glasses. Based on the measured PCT response, all of the glasses were acceptable as compared to the Environmental Assessment (EA) reference glass regardless of the thermal history and were also predictable using the current PCCS model for durability. The homogeneity constraint can be ignored for SB 5 for coupled operations (based on the Appendix J compositional information), as both of the glasses targeting lower WLs (SB 5 VS- 18 and SB 5 VS- 19) had durabilities that were acceptable with respect to the reference EA glass...|$|E

All of the glasses studied were considerably more durable than the benchmark Environmental Assessment (EA) glass. The measured Product Consistency Test (PCT) responses were compared with the predicted values from the <b>current</b> DWPF <b>durability</b> model.

40|$|While several {{structural}} {{health monitoring}} methods {{are available for}} assessing the applied loads, displacements, stresses, and strains in a concrete structure, very few techniques are available to enable condition assessment from a material durability viewpoint. Material health monitoring provides a valuable tool in assessing the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> condition of a concrete structure (i. e., diagnosis), determining if and what preventative measures {{need to be taken}} to reduce future maintenance (i. e., prescription), and evaluating the remaining life and the future performance of the material (i. e., prognosis). ^ The objective of this research is development of a new material sensing system that is designed to measure several properties and state parameters of concrete necessary for evaluation of the material 2 ̆ 7 s performance. This sensing system is composed of three electrical conductivity-based sensors and a temperature sensor. The electrical sensors include a concrete conductivity (σ t) sensor (that monitors setting and hardening and measures microstructural and transport properties of concrete), a pore solution conductivity (σ o) sensor (that monitors changes in the internal chemistry of the system due to ion penetration or carbonation), and a conductivity-based relative humidity (RH) sensor (to monitor moisture transport and shrinkage of the material). The temperature (T) sensor enables determination of the rate of hydration and strength development of concrete while it provides information needed for temperature calibration of the electrical sensors. It is shown that the combined measurements of the three electrical sensors and the temperature sensor provide sufficient calibration information that enables determination of the desired material properties and state parameters of concrete. ^ This document provides a comprehensive description of several phases of the process used for development of the three conductivity-based sensors.

While the homogeneity constraint is typically an issue at lower waste loadings (WLs), it may impact the operating windows for DWPF operations, where the glass forming systems may be limited to lower waste loadings based on fissile or heat load limits. In the sludge batch 1 b (SB 1 b) variability study, application of the homogeneity constraint at the measurement acceptability region (MAR) limit eliminated much of the potential operating window for DWPF. As a result, Edwards and Brown developed criteria that allowed DWPF to relax the homogeneity constraint from the MAR to the property acceptance region (PAR) criterion, which opened up the operating window for DWPF operations. These criteria are defined as: (1) use the alumina constraint as currently implemented in PCCS (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } {ge} 3 wt%) and add a sum of alkali constraint with an upper limit of 19. 3 wt% ({Sigma}M{sub 2 }O < 19. 3 wt%), or (2) adjust the lower limit on the Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } constraint to 4 wt% (Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } {ge} 4 wt%). Herman et al. previously demonstrated that these criteria {{could be used to}} replace the homogeneity constraint for future sludge-only batches. The compositional region encompassing coupled operations flowsheets could not be bounded as these flowsheets were unknown at the time. With the initiation of coupled operations at DWPF in 2008, the need to revisit the homogeneity constraint was realized. This constraint was specifically addressed through the variability study for SB 5 where it was shown that the homogeneity constraint could be ignored if the alumina and alkali constraints were imposed. Additional benefit could be gained if the homogeneity constraint could be replaced by the Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } and sum of alkali constraint for future coupled operations processing based on projections from Revision 14 of the High Level Waste (HLW) System Plan. As with the first phase of testing for sludge-only operations, replacement of the homogeneity constraint with the alumina and sum of alkali constraints will ensure acceptable product durability over the compositional region evaluated. Although these study glasses only provide limited data in a large compositional region, the approach and results are consistent with previous studies that challenged the homogeneity constraint for sludge-only operations. That is, minimal benefit is gained by imposing the homogeneity constraint if the other PCCS constraints are satisfied. The normalized boron releases of all of the glasses are well below the Environmental Assessment (EA) glass results, regardless of thermal history. Although one of the glasses had a normalized boron release of approximately 10 g/L and was not predictable, the glass is still considered acceptable. This particular glass has a low Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } concentration, which may have attributed to the anomalous behavior. Given that poor durability has been previously observed in other glasses with low Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } and Fe{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } concentrations, including the sludge-only reduction of constraints study, further investigations appear to be warranted. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the homogeneity constraint (in its entirety with the associated low frit/high frit constraints) be eliminated for coupled operations as defined by Revision 14 of the HLW System Plan with up to 2 wt% TiO{sub 2 }. The use of the alumina and sum of alkali constraints should be continued along with the variability study to determine the predictability of the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models and/or that the glasses are acceptable with respect to durability. The use of a variability study for each batch is consistent with the glass product control program and it will help to assess new streams or compositional changes. It is also recommended that the influence of alumina and alkali on durability be studied in greater detail. Limited data suggests {{that there may be a}} need to adjust the lower Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } limit and/or the upper alkali limit in order to prevent the fabrication of unacceptable glasses. An in-depth evaluation of all previous data as well as any new data would help to better define an alumina and alkali combination that would avoid potential phase separation and ensure glass durability...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is {{preparing}} to initiate processing Sludge Batch 7 b (SB 7 b). In support of the upcoming processing, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) provided a recommendation to utilize Frits 418 with a 6 % Na{sub 2 }O addition (26 wt% Na{sub 2 }O in sludge) and 702 with a 4 % Na{sub 2 }O addition (24 wt% Na{sub 2 }O in sludge) to process SB 7 b. This recommendation was based on assessments of the compositional projections for SB 7 b {{available at the time}} from the Savannah River Remediation (SRR). To support qualification of SB 7 b, SRNL executed a variability study to assess the applicability of the <b>current</b> <b>durability</b> models for SB 7 b. The durability models were assessed over the expected composition range of SB 7 b, including potential caustic additions, combined with Frits 702 and 418 over a 32 - 40 % waste loading (WL) range. Thirty four glasses were selected based on Frits 418 and 702 coupled with the sludge projections with an additional 4 - 6 % Na{sub 2 }O to reflect the potential caustic addition. Six of these glasses, based on average nominal sludge compositions including the appropriate caustic addition, were developed for both Frit 418 and Frit 702 at 32, 36 and 40 % WL to provide coverage {{in the center of the}} anticipated SB 7 b glass region. All glasses were fabricated and characterized using chemical composition analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the Product Consistency Test (PCT). To comply with the DWPF Glass Product Control Program, a total of thirty four glasses were fabricated to assess the applicability of the current DWPF PCCS durability models. Based on the measured PCT response, all of the glasses were acceptable with respect to the Environmental Assessment (EA) benchmark glass regardless of thermal history. The NL[B] values of the SB 7 b variability study glasses were less than 1. 99 g/L as compared to 16. 695 g/L for EA. A small number of the D-optimally selected 'outer layer' extreme vertices (EV) glasses were not predictable using the current Product Composition Control System (PCCS) models for durability, but were acceptable compared to the EA glass when tested. These glasses fell outside of the lower 95 % confidence band, which demonstrates conservatism in the model. A few of the glasses fell outside of the upper 95 % confidence band; however, these particular glasses have normalized release values that were much lower than the values of EA and should be of no practical concern. Per the requirements of the DWPF Glass Product Control Program, the PCCS durability models have been shown to be applicable to the SB 7 b sludge system with a range of Na{sub 2 }O concentrations blended with Frits 418 or 702. PCT results from the glasses fabricated as part of the variability study were shown to be predictable by the current DWPF PCCS models and/or acceptable with respect to the EA benchmark glass regardless of thermal history or compositional view...|$|E

40|$|Concrete is {{considered}} to be a construction material with high durability and excellent fire resistance. However, degradation occurs, leading to structural safety problems and expensive maintenance costs. Currently, durability design and its concepts are provided in the concrete specifications and structural design codes in many countries, but they vary in terms of the design methodologies and users’ demands. Reinforced concrete (RC) structures based on a reasonable durability design with a quantitative procedure can prevent unnecessary maintenance expenses and reduce environmental loads. This paper presents the <b>current</b> trends of <b>durability</b> design in South Korea and government support for infrastructure. In this work, the two representative durability design philosophies (deterministic and probabilistic approaches) are briefly summarized, and the current guidelines and related requirements for durability design in several countries are investigated. Durability design is now changing from simple material requirement control to performance-based design with quantitative parameters considering various exposure classifications and evaluation processes. RC structures based on reasonable durability design can make a great contribution to reducing maintenance costs and environmental effects like CO 2 emissions...|$|R

In this paper, we report a synthesis of free-standing three-dimensional hierarchical MoS 2 /CoS 2 heterostructure arrays through a convenient process. The investigation of electrocatalytic HER performance suggests that the MoS 2 /CoS 2 hybrid catalyst exhibits significant enhancement in HER (onsetpotential and potential at a current density of 100 Â mAÂ cmâ 2 are 20 Â mV and 125 Â mV, respectively) and superior durability (no shift of current density is observed after a continuous scanning of 3000 times) compared with individual CoS 2 and MoS 2. The superior HER performance was attributed {{to the formation of}} the interface between CoS 2 and MoS 2 through the electrochemical characterization, Raman, XPS analysis, and the control experiment. The lower onsetpotential, higher <b>current</b> density, excellent <b>durability,</b> and the free-standing structure of the three-dimensional hierarchical MoS 2 /CoS 2 heterostructure array make it a promising cathode catalyst suitable for widespread application.

40|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} {{is the most}} widely used construction material in the world. Its durability determines its service life and is a serious concern that has been studied by material scientists for almost two hundred years. It is well known that the pore structure in concrete, which includes porosity {{and the way in which}} pores are connected and distributed, strongly influences the transport of fluids, and therefore <b>durability.</b> <b>Current</b> techniques all have some limitations on interpreting pore structure and its relationship to transport properties of concrete. The goal of our work is to examine the pore system and the relationship between porosity, pore size distribution and chloride permeability. Specifically, we measure pore structure using a new experimental technique- x-ray microtomography- which allows us to make internal measurements at micron resolution. X-ray microtomography is a nondestructive imaging technique that produces three-dimensional images of a specimen's x-ray attenuation. By using synchrotron x-ray and charge-coupled detector (CCD), the resolution of the image is very high, up to lpm, therefore pores as small as lPm 3 can be observed. The advantage of this technique is that it provides not only images that can indicate how pores are distributed in th...|$|R
40|$|Titanium and its alloys are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used fixation rod materials in spinal fusion surgery because of their biocompatibility, stability, and endurance. However, titanium {{may not be the best}} rod material for patients as it can cause adjacent segment degeneration (ASD), in which the spinal segments adjacent to the instrumented segment or segments experience increased force loading and begin to deteriorate. Through analysis of various studies, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), nitinol, and silicon nitride were found to be possible alternative spinal fusion fixation rod materials. To determine which of these materials is best suited for use as a spinal rod material, the osteointegration, <b>current</b> availability, stiffness, <b>durability,</b> corrosion resistance, and clinical efficacy of each material was analyzed. Although silicon nitride had strong osteointegrative properties, no testing could be found evaluating the material as a spinal fusion rod, indicating its current unavailability. Even though nitinol was determined to have better osteointegrative properties than PEEK, PEEK has an elastic modulus close to bone, a reinforcing material, carbon fiber, that allows for customization of the elastic modulus, no risk of corrosion, and strong clinical results. By implementing PEEK fixation rods in spinal fusion surgeries instead of titanium rods, the incidence of ASD may decrease as well as the risk of rod corrosion. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} stray <b>currents</b> on <b>durability</b> and reinforcement corrosion of underground concrete structures. Cathodic protection of underground pipelines are stationary sources of stray current interference with concrete, and rail traction systems are non-stationary sources. The soil is the electrolyte that conducts stray current to the concrete structure and absorbs current from it. The current passes through the concrete cover at entry points (cathodes), via the reinforcement and again through the cover at exit points (anodes). Polarization of steel occurs at these points. Anodic polarization can break down the normal passivation of steel in concrete and initiate corrosion. A quantitative model for this mechanism is proposed. An empirical relationship was derived from literature data relating the time to initiation of corrosion to the anodic current density and the chloride content of the concrete. At chloride contents below 0. 4 % by mass of cement, corrosion may be initiated {{in a year or}} less by exit currents of 1 A/m 2 or higher. At chloride contents of 0. 4 % or higher, the initiation time for 1 A/m 2 is short (days). For lower current densities, extrapolating from the experimental results is necessary. The distribution of current between concrete elements and soil can be calculated from geometrical considerations and their resistivities. Inside the concrete, the cathodic steel surface may be larger than the anodic surface. The cathode/anode ratio constitutes a concentration factor which may be between 1 and 100. If the soil contains chloride ions, migration of chloride into the concrete at anodic sites may further reduce the time to initiation of corrosion. The empirical model was applied to a bored tunnel lining segment. Critical (cathodic) stray current densities were calculated for a (mean) initiation time of 100 years, depending on the initial chloride content. The time between initiation of corrosion and cracking of concrete is relatively short (days). The time to complete dissolution of reinforcing bars may be as short as days for high stray current densities or as long as decades for low current densities. The results indicate that stray current interference is significant with regard to durability of underground concrete structures and should be further studie...|$|R
40|$|Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) is an {{ion beam}} {{analysis}} technique. In PIXE, {{atoms in the}} sample are excited when the sample is bombarded with protons, alpha particles, or heavy ions. X-rays are emitted when atoms in the sample de-excite. Each element has unique characteristic x-rays. In the spectrum, area of each peak {{is proportional to the}} elemental concentration in the sample. The existing PIXE set-up in the accelerator laboratory was upgraded to external beam PIXE to do in air measurements, because of need to analyse large amounts of archaeological samples. Different exit window set-ups were constructed and tested. The goal was to get maximum beam spot area with minimum beam energy loss in the exit window. The set-up enables the use of 100 nm thick Si 3 N 4 exit window membranes and 4 -mm-diameter beam spot area. For the measurements in the current work, a 500 nm thick Si 3 N 4 membrane was used due to its higher <b>durability.</b> <b>Current</b> measurement can be difficult when doing PIXE in air because of ionization of air molecules in the beam's path and charge collection differences at sample surface. The set-up utilizes a beam profile monitor (BPM), which measures the current in vacuum prior to the exit window, and therefore is not affected by the current measurement difficulties in air. Along with the BPM, a current integrator was also used in the current measurements. Current integrator was used to collect the charge from the sample holder. These two methods together provided reliable way of current measurement. With the developed set-up, 166 pottery pieces from the neolithic stone age from different parts of Finland, Sweden and Estonia, were measured to determine their elemental concentrations for provenance research.

40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} carbon-carbon nanotube (OMC-CNT) nanocomposites {{were prepared}} {{and used as}} catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte fuel cells. The OMC-CNT composites were synthesized via a nanocasting method that used ordered mesoporous silica as a template and Ni-phthalocyanine as a carbon source. For comparison, sucrose and phthalocyanine were used to generate two other OMCs, OMC(Suc) and OMC(Pc), respectively. All three carbons exhibited hexagonally ordered mesostructures and uniform mesopores. Among the three carbons the OMC-CNT nanocomposites showed the highest electrical conductivity, which {{was due to the}} nature of their graphitic framework as well as their lower interfacial resistance. The three carbons were then used as fuel cell catalyst supports. It was found that highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles (ca. similar to 1. 5 nm in size) could be dispersed on the OMCs via a simple impregnation-reduction method. The activity and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), measured by the rotating ring-disk electrode technique revealed that the ORR over the Pt/OMC catalysts followed a four-electron pathway. Among the three Pt/OMC catalysts, the Pt/OMC-CNT catalyst resulted in the highest ORR activity, and after an accelerated durability test the differences in the ORR activities of the three catalysts became more pronounced. In single cell tests, the Pt/OMC-CNTbased cathode showed a current density markedly greater than those of the other two cathodes after a high-voltage degradation test. These results were supported by the fact that the Pt/OMC-CNT-based cathode had the lowest resistance, which was probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results of the single cell tests as well as those of the EIS-based measurements indicate that the rigidly interconnected structure of the OMC-CNT as well as their highly conductive frameworks are concomitantly responsible for the OMC-CNT nanocomposites exhibiting higher <b>current</b> density and <b>durability</b> than the other two carbons. close 17...|$|R

The numerical modelling {{was introduced to}} identify issues in the physical trials and assess proposed site trial solutions and associated configurations. The laboratory trials concentrated on electrode development and chemical stabiliser combinations in conjunction with known practical issues such as electrode polarisation and current intermittence effects. English China Clay batches combined with predetermined chemical stabiliser mixes were cured for up to 540 days and tested for standard engineering indexes and electrodes were tested for durability in liquids and under electrolysis.

The methodology was developed from the laboratory trials where the optimum electrode type, chemical combination and current intermittence times were developed, and applied to a site trial near Watford, UK. Four trials were conducted consisting of: a control; a vertical electrode set‐up, a vertical electrode set‐up using current intermittence and a raked electrode set‐up.
