40|$|ABSTRACT Technical lignin, the {{byproduct}} from cellulosic ethanol production, is {{a potential}} feedstock for producing <b>coumaric</b> and ferulic <b>acids.</b> These biorenewable aromatic hydroxycinnamic acids can be upgraded to high value chemicals for the manufacture of cosmetics, flavoring agents, and sunscreens. We hypothesize that during the fast pyrolysis of lignin, aromatic acid esters can be recovered from coumaric, ferulic and other hydroxycinnamic acids using a methylation agent. In this study, technical lignin from cellulosic ethanol production was pyrolyzed in a micropyrolyzer with a methylation agent to produce gas chromatography (GC) detectable aromatic acid esters. Corn stover lignins from enzymatic hydrolysis and the organosolv processing were combined with different methylation agents to produce, identify and quantify the hydroxycinnamic acid esters. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a diode array detector (DAD) was used to separate and quantify the extracted hydroxycinnamic acids from lignin for determination of yield recoveries. To determine the actual total extractable yields of <b>coumaric</b> and ferulic <b>acid</b> in the lignin an alkaline extraction method was used. The yields on a mass basis of <b>coumaric</b> and ferulic <b>acid</b> in the enzymatic hydrolysis lignin was 5. 6 % and 1. 9 %, respectively. The yields on a mass basis of <b>coumaric</b> and ferulic <b>acid</b> in the organosolv lignin was 7. 7 % and 2. 9 %, respectively. The recovery of hydroxycinnamic acids from enzymatic hydrolysis and organosolv lignin with different loading of methylation agent were compared using a micropyrolyzer at 500 ÃÂÃÂ°C and the pyrolysis cup method. Using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) or tetra-methyl carbonate of pentaerythritol (PEMC) at concentrations of 1 ÃÂÃÂµL – 10 ÃÂÃÂµL produced high yields of <b>coumaric</b> and ferulic <b>acid</b> that can be recovered at concentrations up to 89 % and 97 %, respectively. The recovery of hydroxycinnamic acids from enzymatic hydrolysis and organosolv lignin with different loading of methylation agent were compared using a micropyrolyzer at 500 ÃÂÃÂ°C and the micro reaction method.

Several autohydrolysis conditions were assayed with the best results obtained at 210 °C (log R 0 4. 15), which enabled high removal of hemicelluloses, yielding an oligosaccharide-rich hydrolysate and a treated biomass with low content of hemicelluloses and enriched in cellulose and lignin.

The critical components for the formation of the compound were found to be hydroxycinnamic acids and glutathione, while ascorbic acid enabled the product to accumulate to higher concentrations. The presence of the wine components important in other wine oxidation mechanisms, (+) -catechin, ethanol and/or tartaric acid, was not essential for the formation of this new compound. Via LC-MS/MS, HR-MS and 1 H NMR (1 D and 2 D NMR) analyses, the major isomer of the compound formed from glutathione and caffeic acid was found to be 4 -[(E) - 2 &# 039;-(S) -glutathionyl ethenyl]-catechol (GEC). Equivalent products were also confirmed via LC-MS/MS for other hydroxycinnamic acids (i. e., ferulic and <b>coumaric</b> <b>acids).</b> Only trace amounts of GEC were formed with the quinic ester of caffeic acid (i. e., chlorogenic acid), and no equivalent product was found for cinnamic acid. GEC was detected in a variety of white wines supplemented with glutathione and caffeic acid. A radical mechanism for the formation of the styrene-glutathione derivatives is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the in vitro bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds and cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon beverage and formulations during simulated gastro-pancreatic digestion. Cinnamon polyphenol bioaccessibility was 79. 8 % {{at the end of}} the digestion. This decline in total polyphenols was found during the gastric step of the digestion and was caused by the precipitation of cinnamon proanthocyanidins by pepsin. The addition of sweeteners increased the polyphenol bioaccessibility to value near 90 % decreasing the interaction between pepsin and tannins. The addition of bovine milk gave rise to an immediate decrease in cinnamon polyphenol concentration and negatively affect their post-pancreatic bioaccessibility. Quercetin- 3 -rhamnoside, syringic and <b>coumaric</b> <b>acids</b> were find to be poor bioaccessible whereas kaempferol and cinnamaldehyde were stable during digestion. The addition of sweeteners did not affect the bioaccessibility of these compounds. Milk addition caused an immediate decrease in the concentration of monomeric phenolic compounds partially due to the interaction with milk protein as probed by fluorescence spectroscopy. The final bioaccessibility was affected by milk only for cinnamaldehyde. The present study demonstrates that cinnamon beverage provide a significant source of dietary bioaccessible polyphenols and that the modality of consuming cinnamon could represent a crucial factor since the addition of sweeteners improve their bioaccessibility whereas milk negatively affect it...|$|R
