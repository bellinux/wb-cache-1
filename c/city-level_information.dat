30|$|We use several {{data sets}} in the {{following}} analysis. The minimum-wage data is collected from various websites as every province publishes them once new minimum wages are determined. When a province publishes the minimum-wage policy, it declares the minimum-wage levels applicable to various regions or it allows the local government to choose appropriate levels. Different from other studies, we use the most detailed (disaggregated) minimum-wage data. Second, we collect <b>city-level</b> <b>information</b> from the China City Statistical Yearbook, including the average wages for the urban workers, GDP growth rate, GDP per capita, employment, unemployment, and actually utilized foreign direct investment (FDI). We use this information to construct explanatory variables to explain regional minimum wages (see below in Section  5).|$|E
40|$|Keyword】China, {{investment}} promotion agency, firm-level data, sample selection 【Abstract】This paper {{tries to}} verify how {{the establishment of}} investment promotion agencies (IPAs) affects the decisions of foreign firms regarding their subsequent investment by combining firm-level data from the World Bank’s Enterprise Survey with <b>city-level</b> <b>information</b> on (IPAs) in China. After correcting for potential endogeneity problems, the result confirms the IPAs ’ role in promoting incremental foreign direct investment (FDI) into China. Furthermore, it is shown that Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (HMT) firms are less sensitive to IPAs ’ efforts in making further investment than are non-HMT foreign firms. In addition, IPAs {{are found to be}} more successful in enhancing foreign firms ’ investment in high-tech than in low-tech industries. 【JEL Classification】F 21, F 2...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} long-run {{relationship}} between the size and age structure of a city s resident population {{and the price of}} local housing. For estimation purposes, we combine <b>city-level</b> demographic <b>information</b> with housing price data for 87 cities in Germany over 1995 - 2012. Employing a panel error correction framework that accounts for the evolution of city in-come and housing financing costs, we find that real urban house prices per-form stronger in cities that age less rapidly. A combination of the empirical estimates with current population projections suggests that population aging will exert considerable downward pressure on urban house prices in upcoming years...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates how {{changes to}} the age {{distribution}} of cities' resident popu-lations shape {{the growth rate of}} local house prices in different market segments. For estimation purposes, we combine <b>city-level</b> demographic <b>information</b> with de-tailed housing price data for 87 German cities over 1995 - 2014. We show that house prices and key demographic variables exhibit strong cross-section dependence but are panel stationary in first differences when this form of dependence is accounted for. Employing a mixed-regressive spatial panel model that incorporates spatial fixed effects as well as changes in city size, purchasing power and mortgage rates, we find that real urban house price appreciation tends to be substantially lower in cities that age more rapidly. Population aging has heterogeneous effects across housing segments: sales price growth of condominiums and single-family homes is negatively related to stronger growth of the old-age dependency ratio, while a posi-tive association is found for aging and real rent growth.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Sociology, Washington State UniversityThis study {{builds on}} {{research}} {{that explains why}} differences in drug arrest rates exist across space and by race, and sheds light on how these differences are produced. By identifying police organizational arrangements and practices associated with race-specific drug arrest rates, this research highlights the influence law enforcement agencies have on producing drug arrests, and identifies potential mechanisms that help to explain how disproportionate drug arrest rates across space and by race are produced. Using data gathered from the Law Enforcement Management and Administration Statistics: 2000 Sample Survey of Law Enforcement Agencies, the Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race 1999, 2000, and 2001, and the 2000 decennial Census for <b>city-level</b> demographic <b>information,</b> findings demonstrate that police organizational arrangements and practices influence drug arrest rates. Key {{findings from this study}} indicate that (1) the presence of specialized drug unit personnel and the practice of police agencies supplementing their budgets with drug asset forfeitures are significantly associated with higher drug arrest rates. The positive associations are twice as strong on the black population as the white population; (2) indicators of bureaucratic conditions of structural control, structural complexity and officer diversity are associated with drug arrest rates; and, (3) the practice of police agencies supplementing their budget with drug asset forfeitures is not significantly associated with black or white drug trafficking arrest rates, but is significantly and positively associated with black and white drug possession arrest rates. This indicates that drug asset forfeiture programs may not be achieving their originally intended goals of reducing drug crime by attacking the economic viability of the drug trade (i. e., drug trafficking), and provides preliminary evidence that drug asset forfeiture programs incentivize police agencies to target low level drug users, and minority drug users more specifically.
