40|$|This work {{deals with}} the natural {{degradation}} of leachate from an old reclaimed landfill {{by means of a}} biological pond. Hamra is a municipal waste landfill with a limited formation of leachate, which has already been reclaimed. Leachate in this location is disposed of using natural biogeochemical method, and it is subsequently discharged into a surface stream. The main issue dealt with here is the long-term effectiveness of natural degradation of leachate and the limits of its use. The solutions of these fundamental questions took advantage of a database of analytical assessments collected during a long-term monitoring of the landfill site. The primary degradation trends and the long-term development have been revealed and described {{on the basis of these}} assessments. The main benefit of the biological pond is the dilution of the dominant contaminants, especially of inorganic character. In the case of ammonium ions, they show nitrification caused by their transition from the reduction into oxidizing environment. From a long term point of view, the disadvantage of natural degradation of leachate can be seen in the gradual reduction in efficiency due to the concentration of the substances or an undesired growth of water plants, which can be successfully eliminated, for example, by means of targeted aeration and by maintaining vegetation in the pond and its surroundings. The biological potential of the locality is very favorable and, despite its anthropogenic load, it creates a location with suitable living conditions for many water animals and plants. That is why it can be concluded that the efficiency of the natural biochemical <b>cleaning</b> <b>elements</b> can be considered as sufficient, taking into account the nature of the deposited waste, the quantity and quality of leachate, as well as the climate character of the locality.

40|$|Over {{the past}} years {{formwork}} technique has trough the years {{become more and}} more advanced and demanding. The construction equipment companies have developed different systems of formwork and many different formwork systems exist today on the market that the construction companies can choose from. Epic Eco and its derivative Epic Eco Sky Speed are relatively new systems and are constantly developing and adding new elements, which make its use easier and speed up the process of making the formwork construction. If work rates, i. e. how many m 2 can be assembled in a unit of time, as known, we can see more clearly on which part of the work process we should focus our attention and develop new solutions. Form the work rates, we can plan our resources; we can specify the quantity of the formwork required for the construction of the actual facility, plan the logistics- the organization of transportation of the material, we determine the number and the positioning of the cranes on the construction field, and finally, we also determine the number of people needed for the execution of individual work phases. Determining the price for the construction work is also an important aspect for the companies who lend the formwork and also for the contractors who aim at the favorable price solution. Rates have also a part in controlling the amount of time and organization of individual jobs. In my diploma thesis I will develop a realistic model that will include the factors influencing the speed of form-working. I will also try to determine the time rates for typical individual works with formworks; the form-working of walls, ceiling, foundations, pillars [...] . Here, we have to account for the working conditions of working process. The work takes place outside and so the rate itself is relative as the conditions are never the same. As such, the rate will never be as important {{as it is in the}} industrial sectors, where it is easier to set and is less variable. But it is important that we limit ourselves and determine the frame within which the various disturbances will not have a significant influence on the process of work. While I was analyzing the sites, I found big differences between average values. This was the main reason why I increased the number of sites. System Epic Eco is very useful because the material is relatively light and this fact brings a lot of advantages. With system Epic Eco we can also do many repeats of formworking without maintenance costs. Big strength is nice final look of concrete surface. Through analysis I found that big disadvantage is <b>cleaning</b> <b>elements</b> after use. ...|$|E
40|$|Lavadores Venturi são largamente utilizados industrialmente na limpeza de gases. Nesses lavadores, os elementos limpadores são as gotas formadas a partir da injeção de um líquido no gás contendo contaminantes. Tais gotas possuem a função de incorporar o elemento a ser removido. A injeção de líquido se dá normalmente através de vários orifícios, que promovem uma distribuição das gotas no duto. São raros os estudos experimentais que estudam a formação de gotas no lavador Venturi, principalmente no que diz respeito à variação do tamanho da gota com o número de orifícios de injeção de líquido. Dessa forma, o presente trabalhou realizou a investigação {{experimental}} dos efeitos que a injeção de líquido em múltiplos jatos exerce sobre a formação e distribuição de gotas num lavador Venturi. Utilizou-se no estudo um Venturi retangular em escala de laboratório, com uma garganta de 27 por 40 mm de secção transversal, situado horizontalmente. Para a medição de tamanho de gotas foi utilizado o equipamento Malvern Spraytec, que possibilita a medida in situ através da passagem de um laser pela garganta do lavador. Analisou-se o tamanho da gota variando o número de orifícios de injeção do líquido de 1 a 4, a vazão do líquido entre 300 e 1200 mL/min. e as velocidades do gás na garganta de 59, 64, 69 e 74 m/s (razões L/G de 0, 07 a 0, 3 L/m 3). As posições axiais de medidas ao longo do lavador foram variadas entre 120 e 240 mm. Também se analisou o efeito destas variáveis operacionais na formação de filme líquido nas paredes do lavador. Os resultados experimentais mostraram que o aumento da vazão de líquido fez com que o líquido ficasse melhor distribuído no interior da garganta e também ocasionou a maior interação entre os jatos. O número de orifícios de injeção do líquido mostrou influência significativa no tamanho da gota medida na garganta do equipamento, ocorrendo o aumento do tamanho da gota com o aumento do número de orifícios em funcionamento. A interação entre jatos mostrou exercer influência no tamanho final da gota medida, já que os tamanhos das gotas foram maiores em jatos com maiores interações. Os aumentos na velocidade do jato líquido e do gás favoreceram o processo de atomização, fazendo com que os tamanhos das gotas diminuíssem. A fração de filme líquido depositada nas paredes do lavador Venturi também variou significativamente com o número de orifícios em funcionamento e conseqüentemente com as diferentes penetrações dos jatos. Em geral, jatos com penetrações excessivas geraram uma maior fração de filme depositada nas paredes do lavador e um menor tamanho de gotas. Através da análise de parâmetros adimensionais foi possível quantificar a influência de cada condição operacional nos tamanhos das gotas geradas no interior do lavador Venturi em estudo. Venturi scrubbers {{are widely}} used in industrial plants in the cleaning of gases. In these scrubbers, the <b>cleaning</b> <b>elements</b> are the droplets formed at the injection of a liquid in the gas containing pollutants. The droplets act as collectors, incorporating the element to be removed. The liquid is usually injected through several orifices that promote a distribution of the droplets in the gas duct. The number of experimental studies {{in the formation of}} droplets in the Venturi scrubber is scarce, especially those concerned with the variation of the droplet size with the number of orifices of liquid injection. Therefore, the present work focused on the experimental investigation {{of the effects of the}} liquid injection in multiple jets in the formation and distribution of droplets in a Venturi scrubber. A laboratory scale scrubber, with a throat of 27 by 40 mm of cross-sectional, horizontally placed, was investigated. The data on droplet size was obtained with the Malvern Spraytec analyser, that makes possible in situ measurements by the passing a laser beam through the throat of the scrubber. The droplet size was analyzed varying the number of orifices of injection of the liquid from 1 to 4, the liquid flow rate between 300 and 1200 mL/min and the gas velocity in the throat of 59, 64, 69 and 74 m/s (L/G between 0. 07 and 0. 3 L/m 3). The axial positions for measurements along the scrubber were varied between 120 and 240 mm. The effect of the formation of liquid film in scrubber walls was also analyzed. The experimental results showed that the increase of the liquid flow rate allowed a better distribution of the liquid inside the throat and also caused a stronger interaction among the jets. The number of injection orifices showed significant influence in the measured droplet size inside the throat, with the increase of the drop size with the increase of the number of orifices in operation. The interaction between jets and their droplets showed to have influence in the final size of the measured drop, since these sizes were larger in jets with larger interactions. The increases in the liquid jet and in the gas velocities favored the atomization process, causing decrease in the droplet sizes. The fraction of liquid film deposited in the walls of the scrubber varied significantly with the number of orifices in operation and consequently with the different penetrations of the jets. In general, jets with excessive penetrations generated a larger film fraction deposited in the walls of the scrubber and a smaller size of droplets. Through the analysis of dimensionless parameters, it was possible to quantify the influence of each operational condition in the size of the droplets generated inside of the studied Venturi scrubber...|$|E

Metallic filters with their high strength and toughness and good heat conduction ability have showed good thermal shock resistance, 310 S and FeAl intermetallic filter elements have exhibited additionally good chemical corrosion resistance in oxidizing and sulfidizing atmosphere(Sawada 1999 and Sunil et al. 1999). The behavior of metallic filter elements at high temperature was investigated and the filtration efficiency of the filter units for hot gas from a coal gasifier unit was tested. Pulse-jet <b>cleaning</b> of filter <b>elements</b> is a key component {{in the operation of}} the filtration unit. The pulse-jet is introduced into the filter element cavities from the clean side, and the dust cakes on the outer surfaces of the filter elements are detached and fall into the filter vessel.

Groundwater samples were collected via drainage holes in alleys, and then filtered into pre-cleaned and sterilized polyethylene bottles that had been cleaned following trace <b>element</b> <b>cleaning</b> procedures through a 0.45 -μm membrane. All groundwater samples were analyzed for major ions and trace elements. Four samples were also analyzed for δD and δ 18 O concentrations. Major ions were determined in the analysis testing laboratory of the Department of Coal Geology, Anhui Province, China. The K++Na+, SO 4 2 − and Cl−, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and alkaline concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry, ion chromatography, EDTA titration, and acid-based titration, respectively. After liquid–liquid extraction, trace element concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (POEMS III) in the State Key Laboratory of Geological Processes and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). The analytical precision for all trace elements was 10  % of the relative standard deviation or better. The isotopic compositions were determined in the laboratory of the Institute of Karst Geology of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences.

40|$|The coals, {{associated}} sediments and combustion products, {{from the}} Tertiary, Mae Moh Lignite Mine Lampang, Thailand, {{have been investigated}} using XRD, XRF, NAA and SEM/EDS. The investigation is primary aimed at documenting the overall mineralogy and geochemistry of the coal and combustion products, {{in an attempt to}} briefly describe the local environmental impacts of resource utilization.;Ash content in composite run of mine samples in three important (J, K and Q) coal zones averages 44 %. Ash in the power plant feed coal averages 41 %. Dominant mineral phases in the zones include: detrital quartz, illite and kaolinite along with authigenic calcite and pyrite. The detrital minerals plus pyrite dominate the lignite horizons while calcite dominates the intra-seam partings.;The highest ash content and major element (Si, Al, Ca, Fe, K and S) concentrations in coal is reported in samples from J zone. There is an overall decrease in ash and major element concentration from J to Q zones. These coals are particularly high in S ranging from 0. 3 to 14 %, with an average of 8 %.;As with the major elements, the trace elements are enriched in J zone, particularly in the upper portion, and show an overall concentration decrease from J to Q zone. The As content of these coals, which ranges from 3 to 488 ppm with an overall average of 60 ppm, is significantly higher than the reported global average.;The minerals identified in the combustion products include quartz, magnetite, hematite, anhydrite, mullite, gehelenite, anorthite and clinopyroxene. Silicon, Al, Fe and Ca, which account for more than 90 % of the major elements in the ash, show little partitioning between samples of bottom ash (BA) and electrostatic precipitator ash (ESP). Arsenic, Co, Cr, Mo, Sb, Se, U and Zn, which are all enriched in samples of ESP ash relative to BA, show a distinct concentration increase with decreasing particle size.;Based on an annual coal consumption of approximately 16 million tons, 6. 5 million tons of ash, which contain significant proportions of potentially toxic trace elements, are produced annually. Calculations show that for most trace elements selective mining would result in an annual emission reduction of 20 to 50 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to improve our {{understanding}} of the natural sources and processes of the dissolved manganese associated with the Southern Ocean and the Tropical North-Eastern (NE) Atlantic Ocean. A flow injection analyser (FIA) with chemiluminescence (CL) detection was first set up for the determination of dissolved manganese (DMn, ? 0. 2 ?m). Extension work was undertaken to solve problems relating to our limited level of understanding of the CL reaction, and the behaviour of the resins used to either preconcentrate the manganese (i. e. Toyopearl AF-Chelate 650 M) or to remove the interfering <b>elements</b> (<b>cleaning</b> resin, i. e. NTA Superflow and 8 -Hydroxyquinoline). Using the system built in our laboratory, the determination of the interference of other dissolved trace metals (e. g. Fe, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn and Cd) were possible with dissolved manganese measurement in order to obtain a good measurable CL peak for dissolved manganese. The distribution of manganese around the Crozet Islands was examined and was used to provide a conceptual framework for future studies. Dissolved manganese concentrations were measured in samples collected from nine vertical profiles taken across the Crozet Plateau (80 - ~ 4500 m water depth) that show evidence of a range of processes influencing the manganese distributions. Dissolved manganese varied between 0. 1 and 2. 44 nM, and the resulting detailed section showed evidence of an island souce is identified which suggests that the plateau and the associated sediments are a source of manganese. Waters further north also appear to be affected by this input of both coastal and shelf origin, although dissolved manganese decrease as a function of distance to the north of the plateau with a gradient of 0. 096 nM/km as a result of dispersion and mixing. This gradient was then combined with short-lived Radium isotopes profiles, allowing the determination of a lateral advective flux of manganese (up to 538 nmol/m 2 /d). Estimates of atmosphere and vertical fluxes of manganese to surface waters were also calculated. It was then possible to estimate a pre-bloom concentration of ~ 0. 4 nM. A set of surface samples were collected from the Tropical NE Atlantic Ocean, and were analysed for dissolved manganese. Results suggest the land-sources of manganese near to the Canary Islands, the Cape Verde Islands and the African Continent, where high dissolved manganese concentrations were determined, with the highest is ~ 3. 90 nM. The lateral advective flux of manganese was higher (47 ?mol/m 2 /d) than the atmospheric flux of manganese (0. 17 ?mol/m 2 /d), thus making the shelf+sediment as the most prominent sources of dissolved manganese in the seawater close to the islands. From this atmospheric flux of manganese, it was then possible to estimate the manganese enrichment around the further offshore dust event regions of 0. 73 nM/yr and consistent with the dissolved manganese background concentrations. This support the low residence time calculated in dust event regions of around 1 year...|$|R
