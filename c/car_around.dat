The recording car is numbered TRC666, and was converted from a 1973-built trailer car.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Rare. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) by Nintendo for North America in March 1988, {{and then in}} Europe on April 15 of the same year. Presented in an overhead isometric perspective, a single player races a radio-controlled <b>car</b> <b>around</b> a series of tracks. The objective of each track is {{to qualify for the}} next race by placing in the top three racers. Players collect items to improve performance, and they must avoid a variety of hazards such as rain puddles and oil slicks. It {{is an example of a}} racing game which features vehicular combat, in which racers can use missiles and bombs to temporarily disable opposing vehicles. Originally titled Pro Am Racing, R.C. Pro-Am was also ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992 as Championship Pro-Am, an enhanced remake with enhanced graphics and additional features. R.C. Pro-Am was followed by two sequels: Super R.C. Pro-Am in 1991, and R.C. Pro-Am II in 1992.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Ware {{set to work}} {{in earnest}} on {{organizing}} farmers and farm-workers in America. In the company of Lem Harris, another Communist Party agricultural expert, he made a year-long survey of American agriculture, echoing his research of 1921. The pair travelled by <b>car</b> <b>around</b> the United States, visiting nearly {{every state in the}} union, studying the sometimes desperate conditions which resulted from the collapse of agricultural prices associated with the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|A classic race {{followed}} in 1912, when Ralph DePalma lost a five lap lead with five laps {{to go after}} his car broke down. As DePalma pushed his <b>car</b> <b>around</b> the circuit, Joe Dawson made up the deficit to win. Three of the next four winners were European, with DePalma being the exception as an American national, though originally Italian born. These races gave Indy a worldwide reputation and international drivers began to enter. The 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps, {{for a number of}} reasons including a lack of entries from Europe (there were so few entries that the speedway itself entered several cars), a lack of oil, and out of respect for the war in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Preparations for {{the race}} began on 19 June, when the teams began testing at Silverstone. During the first day's testing Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time, {{focusing}} on his race setup for the Grand Prix. In contrast the two top constructors, McLaren and Ferrari, set about testing new parts and developments on their cars. This testing was undertaken by their respective test drivers, Pedro de la Rosa and Luca Badoer. Spyker brought a new chassis to the test and raced {{it for the first}} time, with Adrián Vallés and Giedo van der Garde taking the <b>car</b> <b>around</b> the track for 64 laps. Nick Heidfeld ended his test session early after complaining of back problems.|$|E
25|$|Drifting {{competitions}} {{are judged}} based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, {{which is usually}} announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such {{as the amount of}} smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd's reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course. The rate-to-angle is how quickly during initiation or Furidashi (振り出し:starting point) and transitions or Furikaeshi (振替し:transfer) a car gets to its sliding angle. Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their <b>car</b> <b>around</b> the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through the turn(s), and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next. Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. That is the quicker the driver is able to come to angle, the more speed and angle they can carry through the course, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher the style score.|$|E

500|$|After Pearson had a {{successful}} test run, he qualified {{the car with the}} third fastest time behind Richard Petty and Joe Weatherly. Pearson raced his way into the lead early in the event and was the leader after the first round of pit stops. Pearson and Petty were the only two cars on the lead lap by a restart on the 311th lap (of 400). Petty made up six seconds on Pearson in 20 laps before Petty had to retire with a blown engine. Pearson held a three lap lead over Fireball Roberts and was leading late in the race until he ran over some debris on the backstretch and blew a tire with only two laps remaining. Pearson drove the <b>car</b> <b>around</b> the track slowly for the final lap at approximately [...] to take the victory.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Kulwicki hired Paul Andrews as {{his crew}} chief after Andrews was {{recommended}} by Rusty Wallace at the 1987 NASCAR Awards banquet.

Kulwicki led 41laps and won by 18.5seconds. After the race finished, he turned his <b>car</b> <b>around</b> and made, what he called, a [...] "Polish victory lap" [...] by driving the opposite way (clockwise) on the track, with the driver's {{side of the car}} facing the fans. [...] "This gave me the opportunity to wave to the crowd from the driver's side", Kulwicki explained. Andrews recalled, [...] "He had wanted to do something special and something different for his first win and only his first." [...] He finished the 1988 season with fourpole positions in 29events, nine top10 finishes including twosecond-place finishes, twelve DNFs, and an average finish of 19.2. Kulwicki finished 14th in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{throughout}} May 2008. The helicopter {{shots of the}} city were filmed before principal photography of the seventh series started. Almost all scenes where shot during the day, including the scenes set during the night. The {{second day of the}} shoot for the episode took place at a house not belonging to the crew, used as the home of Connie James. The Blue Fin building in London provided several locations for the episode, mostly the stock exchange room. Real life traders were used to film scenes set in the floor. Swinden noted that the traders were [...] "interesting guys" [...] to work with, and told the producers the story was [...] "very close to home." [...] The producers borrowed two expensive cars, more prominently an Aston Martin DB9 convertible, which were driven by Armitage and Norris. Armitage was asked to drive the car for only 10 yards, but the actor ended up getting carried away by wheel-spinning and driving the <b>car</b> <b>around</b> a city block. Another car was a Bentley used for Denham's suicide. Because it was on loan, Firth's options on acting as if he was trying to save Denham was very limited without having to damage the car.|$|E

500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the <b>car</b> <b>around,</b> the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Since García Márquez was eighteen, he {{had wanted}} to write a novel based on his grandparents' house where he grew up. However, he {{struggled}} with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea until one day the answer hit him while driving his family to Acapulco. [...] He turned the <b>car</b> <b>around</b> and the family returned home so he could begin writing. [...] He sold his car so his family would have money to live on while he wrote, but writing the novel took far longer than he expected, and he wrote every day for eighteen months. His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and their baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord. During the eighteen months of writing, García Márquez met with two couples, Eran Carmen and Álvaro Mutis, and María Luisa Elío and Jomí García Ascot, every night and discussed the progress of the novel, trying out different versions. Fortunately, when the book was finally published in 1967 it became his most commercially successful novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, which sold more than 30 million copies (Cien años de soledad) (1967; English translation by Gregory Rabassa 1970) and was dedicated “Para (to) Jomí García Ascot y María Luisa Elío”. The story chronicles several generations of the Buendía family from the time they founded the fictional South American village of Macondo, through their trials and tribulations, instances of incest, births and deaths. The history of Macondo is often generalized by critics to represent rural towns throughout Latin America or at least near García Márquez's native Aracataca.|$|E
