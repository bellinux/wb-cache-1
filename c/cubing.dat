25|$|In {{some regions}} of India, fasts of {{religious}} nature are {{an occasion for}} a change in normal diet, and a total absence from cooking or eating is held as elective while a normal diet for a fasting day is a light feast consisting of different foods from usual, amongst which sweet potato is one of the prime sources of sustenance. Sweet potato– shakarkand, शक्करकंद– is eaten otherwise, too, and a popular variety of preparation in most parts is roasted slow over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing—primarily salt, possibly yogurt—while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or pressure cooking before peeling, <b>cubing</b> and seasoning for a vegetable dish as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into chapattis (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in India as cattle fodder.|$|E

5000|$|The Void <b>Cube</b> is {{slightly}} {{more difficult than}} a regular Rubik's <b>Cube</b> due to parity. The lack of center <b>cubes</b> alters the parity considerations. A 90˚ rotation of a face either on the regular Rubik's <b>Cube</b> or on the Void <b>Cube</b> swaps the positions of eight <b>cubes</b> in two, odd parity, four cycles. Overall, a face turn is an even permutation. On the regular <b>cube</b> a 90˚ rotation of the whole <b>cube</b> about a principal axis swaps the positions of 24 <b>cubes</b> in six, odd parity, four cycles. On the regular <b>cube</b> a whole <b>cube</b> rotation is an even permutation. On the other hand, lacking center <b>cubes,</b> a 90˚ whole <b>cube</b> rotation on the Void <b>Cube</b> swaps 20 <b>cubes</b> in five, odd parity, four cycles. Thus, a whole <b>cube</b> rotation on the Void <b>Cube</b> is an odd permutation. In consequence, on the Void <b>Cube</b> turning {{the faces of the}} <b>cube</b> together with whole <b>cube</b> rotations can produce an arrangement where two <b>cubes</b> are swapped and the rest are in their original positions. This and other odd parity arrangements are not possible on the regular Rubik's <b>Cube</b> and afford the solver an additional challenge. These permutations are solvable with a number of simple algorithms. To see the relationship between parity on the regular <b>cube</b> and the void <b>cube</b> consider the regular <b>cube.</b> A regular <b>cube</b> solution takes a scrambled <b>cube</b> to the identity <b>cube</b> where the color of all the edge and corner facelets match the center facelets. A void <b>cube</b> solution takes a scrambled <b>cube</b> to an arrangement where the color of the edge and corner facelets match each other regardless of the color of the center facelet. These [...] "cat's eye" [...] arrangements are formed by rotating the edge and corner <b>cubes</b> as a whole with respect to the center cubies. This may be done in 24 different ways but because of parity only 12 may be formed by turning the faces of the <b>cube.</b> Odd parity void <b>cube</b> positions are formed on odd parity [...] "cat's eye" [...] regular <b>cube</b> positions.|$|R
