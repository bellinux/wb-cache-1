5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the height of a distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jacob's staff: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{scholar and}} {{politician}} Shen Kuo (1031–1095), an antiquarian who pursued studies of archaeological finds, unearthed an ancient crossbow-like mechanism from a garden in Jiangsu which had on its stock a graduated sighting scale in minute measurements. He wrote that while viewing {{the whole of}} a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing {{a small part of}} the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated.</b> Shen wrote that this was similar to mathematicians who used right-angled triangles to measure height. Joseph Needham writes that what Shen had discovered was Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which was not known in Europe until the medieval French Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) described it in 1321.|$|E

25|$|The {{magnetic}} field was varied until the magnetic and electric deflections were the same, when Θ = φ and Fel/mv2= Hel/mv. This can be simplified to give m/e = H2l/FΘ. The electric deflection was measured separately to give Θ and H, F and l were known, so m/e <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated.</b>|$|E

25|$|To {{find the}} wire's torsion coefficient, the torque exerted by the wire {{for a given}} angle of twist, Cavendish timed the natural {{oscillation}} period of the balance rod as it rotated slowly clockwise and counterclockwise against the twisting of the wire. The period was about 20 minutes. The torsion coefficient <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> from this and the mass and dimensions of the balance. Actually, the rod was never at rest; Cavendish had to measure the deflection angle of the rod while it was oscillating.|$|E

A third extension is adding other sources of uncertainty, such as the production costs and capacities.

25|$|The {{difference}} between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums {{is that to}} measure gravity, the pendulum's length {{as well as its}} period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, g <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> from equation (1).|$|E
25|$|After the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT), which limited {{underground}} explosions to 150 kilotons or less, warheads {{like the}} half-megaton W88 {{had to be}} tested at less than full yield. Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary, the reduction in yield had {{to come from the}} secondary. Replacing much of the lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel with lithium-7 hydride limited the tritium available for fusion, and thus the overall yield, without changing the dynamics of the implosion. The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes, other sensing devices, and analysis of trapped weapon debris. The full yield of the stockpiled weapon <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> by extrapolation.|$|E
25|$|One of Cassini's first {{projects}} {{at his new}} post in Paris was to send Frenchman Jean Picard {{to the site of}} Tycho Brahe's old observatory at Uraniborg, on the island of Hven near Copenhagen. Picard was to observe and time the eclipses of Jupiter's moons from Uraniborg while Cassini recorded the times they were seen in Paris. If Picard recorded the end of an eclipse at 9hours 43minutes 54seconds after midday in Uraniborg, while Cassini recorded the end of the same eclipse at 9hours 1minute 44seconds after midday in Paris – a difference of 42minutes 10seconds – the difference in longitude <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> to be 10°32'30". Picard was helped in his observations by a young Dane who had recently completed his studies at the University of Copenhagen – Ole Rømer – and he must have been impressed by his assistant's skills, as he arranged for the young man to come to Paris to work at the Royal Observatory there.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} methods used by astronomers to {{calculate}} the distance to a star is to record the difference in angle between two measurements {{of the position of}} the star in the sky. The first measurement is taken from the Earth {{on one side of the}} Sun, and the second is taken approximately half a year later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. The distance between the two positions of the Earth when the two measurements were taken is twice the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The difference in angle between the two measurements is twice the parallax angle, which is formed by lines from the Sun and Earth to the star at the distant vertex. Then the distance to the star <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> using trigonometry. The first successful published direct measurements of an object at interstellar distances were undertaken by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel in 1838, who used this approach to calculate the 3.5-parsec distance of 61 Cygni.|$|E
25|$|Persian and Arab astronomers {{produced}} an improved {{version of the}} Greek armillary sphere in the 8th century, and wrote {{about it in the}} treatise of Dhat al-Halaq or The instrument with the rings by the Persian astronomer Fazari (d.c. 777). Abbas Ibn Firnas (d.887) is thought to have {{produced an}}other instrument with rings (armillary sphere) in the 9th century which he gave to Caliph Muhammad I (ruled 852-886). The spherical astrolabe, a variation of both the astrolabe and the armillary sphere, was invented during the Middle Ages in the Islamic world. The earliest description of the spherical astrolabe dates back to the Persian astronomer Nayrizi (fl. 892-902). Muslim astronomers also independently invented the celestial globe, which were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy. Today, 126 such instruments remain worldwide, the oldest from the 11th century. The altitude of the sun, or the Right Ascension and Declination of stars <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> with these by inputting the location of the observer on the meridian ring of the globe.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed of}} sound was first {{accurately}} calculated by the Reverend William Derham, Rector of Upminster, thus improving on Newton's estimates. [...] Derham used a telescope from the tower {{of the church of}} St Laurence, Upminster to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including North Ockendon church. The distance was known by triangulation, and thus the speed that the sound had travelled <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>calculated.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since the {{diffusion}} theory calculations overpredict the critical dimensions, an extrapolation distance δ must be subtracted {{to obtain an}} estimate of actual values. The buckling <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> using actual dimensions and extrapolated distances using the following table.|$|R
5|$|However, as the Earth {{gravity assist}} approached, astronomers {{were unable to}} locate Comet Boethin, which may have broken up into pieces too faint to be observed. Consequently, its orbit <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>calculated</b> with {{sufficient}} precision to permit a flyby.|$|R

2500|$|Invented by Padmanābha, a nocturnal polar {{rotation}} instrument {{consisted of}} a rectangular board with a slit {{and a set of}} pointers with concentric graduated circles.

Ōhashi (2008) further explains that: [...] "Its backside was made as a quadrant with a plumb and an index arm. Thirty parallel lines were drawn inside the quadrant, and trigonometrical calculations were done graphically. After determining the sun's altitude {{with the help of the}} plumb, time was calculated graphically with the help of the index arm." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, 2007, Commissioner Gail Heriot testified {{about the}} agency's {{value on the}} 50th anniversary of {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1957.

My back-of-the-envelope calculation is that the Commission now accounts for less than 1/2000th of 1 percent of the federal budget; back in the late 1950s its size would have been roughly similar. And yet its impact has been dramatic." ...|$|E

A year later Collins dismissed the entire RTÉ Authority over a report of an interview with Seán Mac Stíofáin, {{the chief of staff}} of the Provisional IRA. RTÉ reporter Kevin O'Kelly, who reported the Mac Stiofáin interview, was jailed briefly for contempt in a court case arising out of the interview.
