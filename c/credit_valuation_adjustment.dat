50|$|The Financial Competitive Act of 2013 would {{direct the}} Financial Stability Oversight Council {{to study and}} report to Congress on the likely effects that {{differences}} between the United States and other jurisdictions in implementing the derivatives <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> capital requirement would have on: (1) U.S. financial institutions that conduct derivatives transactions and participate in derivatives markets, (2) end users of derivatives, and (3) international derivatives markets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) is the {{difference}} between the risk-free portfolio value and the true portfolio value that takes into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default. In other words, CVA is the market value of counterparty credit risk. This price depends on counterparty credit spreads {{as well as on the}} market risk factors that drive derivatives’ values and, therefore, exposure. Various related adjustments, collectively xVA, are discussed under Financial economics#Extensions.|$|E
40|$|The market {{practice}} of extrapolating different term structures from different instruments lacks a rigorous justification {{in terms of}} cash flows structure and market observables. In this paper, we integrate our previous consistent theory for pricing under credit, collateral and funding risks into term structure modelling, integrating the origination of different term structures with such effects. Under a number of assumptions on collateralization, wrong-way risk, gap risk, <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> and funding effects, including the treasury operational model, and via an immersion hypothesis, {{we are able to}} derive a synthetic master equation for the multiple term structure dynamics that integrates multiple curves with credit/funding adjustments...|$|R

Separation of variables in spherical coordinates leads to an eigenvalue problem for the resulting boundary value problem in the two angular components. The main theoretical result is {{a solution to the}} original problem expressed as an expansion into special functions and an eigenvalue which has to be chosen to allow a matching of the boundary condition. We discuss and test several computational methods to solve a finite-dimensional approximation to this nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Finally, we apply our results to the computation of default probabilities and <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> in a structural credit model with mutual liabilities...|$|R
30|$|Within the {{framework}} of a linear model of credit risk, the issue of market completeness and various methods for replication were studied in several works (see, in particular, Bielecki et al. (2004, 2006, 2008). In contrast, only a few papers devoted to nonlinear models of credit risk are available. More recently, Crépey (2015 a, b), Dumitrescu et al. (2017) and Bichuch et al. (2018) used BSDEs with jumps to solve the valuation and hedging problems for derivative contracts exposed to the counterparty credit risk. In Bichuch et al. (2018) and Dumitrescu et al. (2017), the authors focus on valuation of the full contract, whereas Crépey (2015 a, b) examines the problem of the approximate additivity for the <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{approach}} to these calculations in overview: When {{the deal is}} collateralized then the [...] "fair-value" [...] is computed as before, but using the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) curve for discounting. (The OIS is chosen here as it reflects the rate for overnight unsecured lending between banks, and is thus considered a good indicator of the interbank credit markets.) When the deal is not collateralized then a CVA - <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> - is added to this value; [...] essentially, the risk-neutral expectation of the discounted loss due to the counterparty not performing.|$|E
5000|$|As above, (OTC) {{derivative}} pricing {{has relied}} on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate {{and the ability to}} perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment. Post the financial crisis of 2008, therefore, issues such as counterparty credit risk, funding costs and costs of capital are additionally considered, and a <b>Credit</b> <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustment,</b> or CVA—and potentially other valuation adjustments, collectively xVA—is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value. Swap pricing is relatedly and further modified. Previously, swaps were valued off a single [...] "self discounting" [...] interest rate curve; while post crisis, to accommodate credit risk, valuation is now under a [...] "multi-curve" [...] framework; see [...]|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{counterparty risk}} for Credit Default Swaps (CDS) in presence of correlation between default of the counterparty and default of the CDS reference credit. Our approach is innovative in that, besides default correlation, which {{was taken into}} account in earlier approaches, we also model credit spread volatility. Stochastic intensity models are adopted for the default events, and defaults are connected through a copula function. We find that both default correlation and credit spread volatility have a relevant impact on the positive counterparty-risk <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> to be subtracted from the counterparty-risk free price. We analyze the pattern of such impacts as correlation and volatility change through some fundamental numerical examples, analyzing wrong-way risk in particular. Given the theoretical equivalence of the <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> with a contingent CDS, we are also proposing a methodology for valuation of contingent CDS on CDS.

40|$|Counterparty) <b>Credit</b> <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustments</b> (CVA) {{has become}} a {{prevailing}} form of pricing default risk on over-the-counter (OTC) contracts. Due to the large size of portfolios included in the CVA calculation and its computational complexity, large computing grids are needed for the evaluation. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate an even more computationally demanding problem, namely computing the sensitivities of CVA to the market and model parameters, a topic which was hardly addressed in the literature so far. We show that the pathwise sensitivities method can be applied for CVA and that it gives significant speed improvement over the conventional finite-differencing techniques. Additionally, we {{take advantage of the}} GPU technology to obtain the Greeks fast enough for daily hedging and risk management activities...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of the {{financial}} crisis in <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (CVA's). Following the arbitrage-free valuation framework presented in Brigo et al. (2009), we consider a model with stochastic Gaussian interest rates and CIR++ default intensities. Departing from previous literature, we are able to calibrate default intensities profiting from Gaussian mapping techniques presented in Brigo and Alfonsi (2004), and reproduce the historically observed instantaneous covariances of CDS prices. To test the calibration procedure, we track the Spanish financial sector, who has behaved in a singular manner through the crisis, regarded among the safest in Europe at the beginning, and in need of a partial bailout a few years later. We calculate adjustments involving the two major Spanish banks and a generic European counterpart in these two situations for both interest rate and credit derivatives...|$|R
5000|$|While the CVA {{reflects}} {{the market value}} of counterparty <b>credit</b> risk, additional <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustments</b> for Debit, Funding, regulatory capital and margin may similarly be added.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introducing}} rigorous methods and formulas for bilateral counterparty risk <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) on interest-rate portfolios. In doing so, we summarize the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty risk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including the default of the investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the adjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a call option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net present value of the contract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the default times of the investor and counterparty, and for correlation of each with the underlying risk factor, namely interest rates. We also analyze the often neglected impact of credit spread volatility. We include close-out netting rules in our examples, although other agreements, such as periodic margining or collateral posting, are left for future work.

30|$|A <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) is {{commonly}} {{defined as the}} difference between the price of an instrument including credit risk and the price of the same instrument where both parties are credit risk free (Green, 2016). In essence, it represents the price of counterparty credit risk.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{counterparty}} risk embedded in CDS contracts, in {{presence of a}} bilateral margin agreement. First, we investigate the pricing of collateralized counterparty risk and we derive the bilateral <b>Credit</b> <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (CVA), unilateral <b>Credit</b> <b>Valuation</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (UCVA) and Debt Valuation Adjustment (DVA). We propose {{a model for the}} collateral by incorporating all related factors such as the thresholds, haircuts and margin period of risk. We derive the dynamics of the bilateral CVA in a general form with related jump martingales. We also introduce the Spread Value Adjustment (SVA) indicating the counterparty risk adjusted spread. Counterparty risky and the counterparty risk-free spread dynamics are derived and the dynamics of the SVA is found as a consequence. We finally employ a Markovian copula model for default intensities and illustrate our findings with numerical results. ...|$|E
50|$|Collateral <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) or {{appraisal}} subordination entitlement reduction (ASER) are commercial mortgage-backed security structuring innovations {{designed to}} improve overall transaction <b>credit</b> quality. Collateral <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> were created in response to rating agency concerns that, without such an adjustment, cash flow from mortgage loans likely to default would {{be paid to the}} first-loss class. The rationale behind appraisal reductions is to support proactively the credit rating of senior CMBS tranches by reducing cash-flow payments to the subordinate tranches.|$|R
40|$|The {{credit risk}} of a {{portfolio}} is often managed via measures of counter-party exposure, such as potential future exposure (PFE) and expected exposure (EE), with these measures playing {{an important role in}} setting economic and regulatory capital levels. For the sake of risk measurement and risk management these exposure measures should be computed under the real-world probability measure. However, due to the similarity of these exposure calculations to those used in calculating <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments,</b> some have begun to compute them under the risk-neutral measure instead. This is problematic, as the magnitudes of PFEs and EEs differ under different equivalent martingale measures and their associated numéraires. Working with the Hull-White (HW) model of the short rate, the effect of a change of measure on the PFE and EE profiles of vanilla interest rate swaps and European swaptions is shown under three common measures: the money-market account measure, the T-forward measure and the Linear Gaussian Markovian (LGM) measure. A modified Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm, which allows for substantial computational savings, is then introduced in order to approximate contract level exposures under each of the aforementioned probability measures. Finally, a change of measure is implemented within the modified LSM algorithm in order to approximate exposure profiles under the real-world measure. The modified LSM algorithm is particularly useful for computing exposure profiles of contracts without closed-form valuation formulae, which would otherwise take significantly longer to compute via a standard Monte Carlo approach...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an innovative}} theoretical {{framework for the}} valuation and replication of derivative transactions between defaultable entities {{based on the principle}} of arbitrage freedom. Our framework extends the traditional formulations based on <b>credit</b> and debit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (CVA and DVA). Depending on how the default contingency is accounted for, we list a total of ten different structuring styles. These include bi-partite structures between a bank and a counterparty, tri-partite structures with one margin lender in addition, quadripartite structures with two margin lenders and, most importantly, configurations where all derivative transactions are cleared through a central counterparty (CCP). We compare the various structuring styles under a number of criteria including consistency from an accounting standpoint, counterparty risk hedgeability, numerical complexity, transaction portability upon default, induced behaviour and macro-economic impact of the implied wealth allocation...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} {{crisis and the}} bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008 lead to harder regulations for the banking industry which included larger capital reserves for the banks. One of the parts that contributed to this increased capital reserve was the the <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> capital charge which can be explained as {{the market value of}} the counterparty default risk. The purpose of the <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> capital charge is to capitalize the risk of future changes in the market value of the counterparty default risk. One financial contract that had {{a key role in the}} {{financial crisis}} was the credit default swap. A credit default swap involves three different parts, a contract seller, a contract buyer and a reference entity. The credit default swap can be seen as an insurance against a credit event, a default for example of the reference entity. This thesis focuses on the study and calculation of the <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> of credit default swaps. The <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> on a credit default swap can be implemented with two different assumptions. In the first case, the seller (buyer) of the contract is assumed to be default risk free and then only the buyer (seller) contributes to the default risk. In the second case, both the seller and the buyer of the contract is assumed to be default risky and therefore, both parts contributes to the default risk. Finanskrisen och Lehman Brothers konkurs 2008 ledde till hårdare regleringar för banksektorn som bland annat innefattade krav på större kapitalreserver för bankerna. En del som bidrog till denna ökning av kapitalreserverna var kreditvärdighetsjusteringens kapitalkrav som kan förklaras som marknadsvärdet av motpartsrisken. Syftet med kreditvärdighetsjusteringens kapitalkrav är att kapitalisera risken för framtida förändringar i marknadsvärdet av motpartsrisken. Ett derivat som hade en nyckelroll under finanskrisen var kreditswappen. En kreditswap innefattar tre parter, en säljare, en köpare och ett referensföretag. Kreditswappen kan ses som en försäkring mot en kredithändelse, till exempel en konkurs på referensföretaget. Detta arbete fokuserar på studier och beräkningar av kreditvärdesjusteringen på kreditswappar. Kreditvärdesjusteringen på en kreditswap kan implementeras med två olika antaganden. I det första fallet antas säljaren (köparen) vara riskfri och då bidrar bara köparen (säljaren) till konkursrisken. I det andra fallet antas både säljaren och köparen bidra till konkursrisken...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to address the {{implications}} of Basel III regulation on counterparty credit risk. We analysed the development of OTC market, we addressed systemic risk and the way how central counterparties could mitigate or spread the contagion among banks. We used simulated data to develop a stress test model {{to find out the}} impact of counterparty credit risk on banks' capital requirements, in case the interest rate increased extensively. Six pos- sible scenarios of interest rate levels were developed with ascending order of the IR level. From these scenarios we computed the exposure levels and <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (CVA) as the market value of counterparty credit risk. We came to the following conclusions: (1) Czech banks have enough capital to withstand any interest rate increase in any scenario. (2) Banks with high expo- sure to derivatives like Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan would face severe problems if the interest rate increased. (3) There is no direct correlation between <b>credit</b> <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> and interest rate, the CVA increases faster with the increase of the interest rate...|$|E

40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is a collateralized {{counterparty}} valuation adjusted pricing equation, which allows to price a deal while taking into account <b>credit</b> and debit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (CVA, DVA) along with margining and funding costs, all in a consistent way. Funding risk breaks the bilateral nature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive form, making the introduction of a purely additive funding <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustment</b> (FVA) difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of iterative relationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square Monte Carlo techniques. As a consequence, we find that identifying funding costs and debit <b>valuation</b> <b>adjustments</b> is not tenable in general, contrary to what has been suggested in the literature in simple cases. The assumptions under which funding costs vanish are a very special case of the more general theory. We define a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on funding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is {{more than the sum of}} such special cases. We derive the general pricing equation by resorting to a risk-neutral approach where the new types of risks are included by modifying the payout cash flows. We consider realistic settings and include in our models the common market practices suggested by ISDA documentation, without assuming restrictive constraints on margining procedures and close-out netting rules. In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, and exogenous liquidity policies and hedging strategies. Re-hypothecation liquidity risk and close-out amount evaluation issues are also covered.
