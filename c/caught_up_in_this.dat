With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was confused by the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E

500|$|In {{the case}} of Hurricane Sandy, two major factors {{contributing}} to the size and strength of the storm were unusually warm ocean surface temperatures {{and an increase in}} blocking patterns, both of which are expected to occur more frequently due to global warming. As they drift north, Atlantic hurricanes are typically moved to the east and out to sea by the jet stream's prevailing winds. This typical pattern was blocked by a ridge of high pressure over Greenland, resulting in a negative Arctic oscillation, forming a kink in the jet stream and causing it to double back on itself off the East Coast; Sandy was <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> northwesterly flow. The blocking pattern over Greenland also stalled an arctic front, which combined with the cyclone. Mark Fischetti of Scientific American argued that the jet stream's unusual shape was caused by the melting of Arctic ice. Noting that these blocking patterns are unusual in the fall but have been increasing, meteorologist Jeff Masters said that three studies in 2011 found [...] "that the recent record decline in Arctic sea ice could be responsible, since this heats up the pole, altering the Equator-to-pole temperature difference, forcing the jet stream to slow down, meander, and get stuck in large loops." [...] Trenberth said that while a negative Arctic Oscillation and a blocking anticyclone were in place, the null hypothesis remained that this was just the natural variability of weather.|$|E

2500|$|News of an {{alliance}} between the Samnites and the Vestini (Sabellians who lived by the Adriatic coast, to the north-east of Samnium) reached Rome. In 325 BC the consul Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva ravaged their territory, forced them into a pitched battle and took the towns of Cutina and Cingilia. The dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor, who {{had taken over the}} command of the other consul, who had fallen ill, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Samnites in an unspecified location in 324 BC. The Samnites sued for peace and the dictator withdrew from Samnium. However, the Samnites rejected Rome’s peace terms and agreed only a one-year truce, which they broke when they heard that Papirius intended to continue the fight. Livy also said that in that year the Apulians became enemies of Rome. Unfortunately, this information is very vague as the region of Apulia was populated by three separate ethnic groups, the Messapii in the south, the Iapyges in the centre and the Dauni in the north. We know that only Daunia (Land of the Dauni) was <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> war. However, this was a collection of independent city-states. Therefore, we do not know who in this area became enemies of Rome. The consuls for 323 BC fought on the two fronts, with C. Sulpicius Longus going to Samnium and Quintus Aemilius Cerretanus to Apulia. There were no battles, but areas were laid waste on both fronts. In 322 BC there were rumours that the Samnites had hired mercenaries and Aulus Cornelius Cossus Arvina was appointed as Dictator. The Samnites attacked his camp in Samnium, which he had to leave. A fierce battle followed and eventually the Samnites were routed. The Samnites offered to surrender, but this was rejected by Rome ...|$|E
2500|$|The limited series Watchmen, {{begun in}} 1986 and {{collected}} as a trade paperback in 1987, cemented Moore's reputation. Imagining {{what the world}} would be like if costumed heroes had really existed since the 1940s, Moore and artist Dave Gibbons created a Cold War mystery in which the shadow of nuclear war threatens the world. The heroes who are <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> escalating crisis either work for the US government or are outlawed, and are motivated to heroism by their various psychological hang-ups. Watchmen is non-linear and told from multiple points of view, and includes highly sophisticated self-references, ironies, and formal experiments such as the symmetrical design of issue 5, [...] "Fearful Symmetry", where the last page is a near mirror-image of the first, the second-last of the second, and so on, and in this manner is an early example of Moore's interest in the human perception of time and its implications for free will. It is the only comic to win the Hugo Award, in a one-time category ("Best Other Form"). It is widely seen as Moore's best work, and has been regularly described as the greatest comic book ever written. Alongside roughly contemporary works such as Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Art Spiegelman's Maus, and Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez's Love and Rockets, Watchmen was part of a late 1980s trend in American comics towards more adult sensibilities. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Watchmen [...] "called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated". DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that [...] "As with The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim... and would continue to be {{regarded as one of the}} most important literary works the field ever produced." [...] Moore briefly became a media celebrity, and the resulting attention led to him withdrawing from fandom and no longer attending comics conventions (at one UKCAC in London he is said to have been followed into the toilet by eager autograph hunters).|$|E

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{understanding}} the stories behind domestic violence and HIV/AIDS in women. Many research studies focus on the interaction between domestic violence and risky behaviours for HIV/AIDS infection and have ignored the experiences of women who are <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> these situations. <b>This</b> study aims at exploring the experiences of HIV-positive women who are victims of domestic violence and tries to understand their feelings regarding their HIV status and the violence. Factors that contribute to the spread of HIV in women are also explored. It is argued that domestic violence and other socio-cultural factors are the driving forces behind the high incidence of HIV/AIDS in women. These factors also contribute to the continuation of dominant themes of domestic violence. The emerging stories further indicate that cultural factors situate women in positions that limit their ability to make decisions in the relationship, including sexual decisions. In the context of domestic violence, it not only becomes difficult for women to cope with their HIV diagnosis, but their positive HIV status also leads to the continuation of domestic violence.

More than that I did not dare to ask myself! I should have believed in her, even if her uncle were {{proved to be a}} criminal of the most dangerous type.

To be alone in a big hotel, without maid or chaperon, herself <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> web of mystery which Louis and those others seemed to have woven around her, was in itself undesirable and unnatural. Whatever was transpiring, I was quite certain that her share in it was a passive one. She had been told to be silent, and she was silent. Nothing would ever make me believe that she was a party to any wrong-doing. And yet the more I thought of Delora the less I trusted him. At Charing Cross Station, for instance, his had not been the anxiety of a man intrusted with a difficult mission. His agitation had been due to fear,--fear abject and absolute. I had seen the symptoms more than once in my life, and there was no mistaking them. I told myself that no man could be so shaken who was engaged in honest dealings. Even now he was in hiding,--it could not be called anything else,--and the one person with whom I had come in touch who was searching for him was, without a doubt, on the side of law and justice, with at least some settled position behind him. Delora's deportment was more the deportment of a fugitive from justice than of a man in the confidence of his government.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> article, it will {{be argued}} that defense counsel 2 ̆ 7 s {{function}} in negotiating plea bargains is identical {{to that of a}} mediator, seeking to reconcile the positions of the defendant and the prosecution. Within this framework, the plea bargain should be seen as part of the broad conception of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) which first made its appearance {{at the end of the}} 1970 s. An analysis of plea bargains in the Western world as part of the broader concept of ADR actually shows that it is the defense attorney, rather than the court or the other parties to the issue, who functions as mediator, assessing the interests of the parties <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the dispute. <b>This</b> also gives expression to the philosophy of privatization upon which mediation is based. The tactics of influence and use of an impression of force employed by the defense attorney in plea bargains are identical in every way to those used by mediators. The methods of persuasion, use of pressure, delineation of the debate, manipulations, and numerous other parameters are identical to those employed by the mediator. As a result, if indeed the mediation function of the defense attorney in plea bargaining may be recognized, {{it will be}} argued that this has implications rooted in applying the accumulated experience of the mediator in private litigation to plea bargains in criminal cases...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{supported}} facilitation {{is a form}} {{of third}} party intervention that uses advanced information technology to deliver non-authoritative intervention on organizational decision making. The goal of this type of intervention is to create communication events where decision making and decision outcomes are collaboratively produced by those who have a stake in the decision. The facilitator's role is to assure decision making progress without taking sides or rendering a final decision. The obligations of facilitation form competing injunctions for practicing facilitation. Facilitative intervention must be performed so that it influences decision activity without influencing decision outcomes, facilitators must participate in decision making without becoming a party to the decision, and facilitators must enforce decision procedures without coercing participant acceptance of the procedures. The evolution of the field is marked by innovations in practice and role definitions that seek more effective means to reconcile the competing demands of the role and the changing circumstances of the intervention context. Computer supported facilitation is a technologically advanced form of intervention that combine skills of facilitators with the capacities of collaborative computing technology to more efficiently and effectively deliver decisions for organizations facing a choice. The facilitator designs and carries out interventions by using group decision support systems that enable anonymous participation, simultaneous communication of ideas, geographic and chronological distribution of participation, and the electronic storage of contributions. This investigation finds that while technical advances help facilitators overcome the numerous barriers to decision making communication, the advances in technique and technology are prescriptions for decision making communication built on inadequate descriptive assumptions about the nature of communication. The community of facilitation practice and its technologies operate on the dubious assumption that communication process and content are in fact distinct. The community of practice, however, is <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> preserving <b>this</b> distinction as its solution to the paradoxes of doing non-authoritative intervention. The dissertation demonstrates this state of affairs by showing the set of premises for facilitative action embodied in the process management view of the practice, the methods of transparency work which uphold intervention neutrality, and the way the community treats an innovation on practice...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{takes as}} its {{point of departure}} the spatial turn in law {{and the notion of}} spatial justice. It traces the term ‘spatial justice’ as introduced through the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act and it looks at the underlying view of space that has influenced the spatial turn in law. It furthermore investigates {{the ways in which the}} spatial turn in law has been influenced by the thinking of Henri Lefebvre, who relies on a Leibnizian conception of space. Lastly the link between Leibniz and legal positivism is considered in order to reach the final conclusion in the form of a caution against merely adding the language of spatial justice to an approach to space that remains <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> abstract space. <b>This</b> will only further entrench existing fault lines <b>in</b> society. For <b>this</b> conclusion the work of Roger Berkowitz is central. Berkowitz argues convincingly that the work of Leibniz was central in the development of legal positivism, despite Leibniz in general being considered as a natural law thinker. The same applies to spatial justice theory, where the work of Leibniz is central: it may present the possibilities of another law – the law as it ought to be. The law conceptualised as ‘ought’ instead of ‘is’ would promote reconciliation. Alternatively, spatial justice can simply present the law as it ‘is’ and reconfirm and deepen the chasms <b>in</b> our world. <b>This</b> article is part of the Special Collection titled ‘Spatial Justice and Reconciliation’, sub-edited by Stephan de Beer, of the Department of Practical Theology and the Centre for Contextual Ministry, University of Pretoria.

Alongside structural and material interventions, emotional engagements are central to processes of social change and the making of selves for those <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> development's slipstream. Intimate Economies of Development: Mobility, Sexuality and Health <b>in</b> Asia elaborates <b>this</b> proposition by showing that culture, sexuality and health are inevitably and inseparably linked within specific trajectories of modernization in the Greater Mekong Sub-region. As mobility and migration increase and opportunities proliferate throughout Asia, different cultural groups increasingly interact as a result of both targeted interventions and all-consuming trends of socio-economic change; but they do so with different capabilities and expectations. This book engages with issues of moral frameworks and sexual rights discourses but uniquely grounds its arguments in interlocking details of people's everyday lives and aspirations in developing Asia. Part and parcel of this widening landscape of mobility and contingent intimacy is the ever-present threats of infectious disease, most prominently HIV/AIDS, and people-trafficking. Thus, impact assessment and targeted interventions aiming to address negative consequences frequently accompany infrastructure development. This path-breaking book, drawn on more than 20 years of ethnographic research in the Mekon region, shows clearly how current models of mitigation are inadequate as subjective experiences and aspirations are profoundly enmeshed in strategies of livelihood improvement.
