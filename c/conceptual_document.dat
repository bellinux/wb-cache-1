40|$|Purpose - In {{this paper}} the authors aimto examine the {{dominance}} of machine and organism metaphors in organisational studies. They argue that these metaphors impede progress towards sustainable development because they perpetuate a story that dehumanises and de-prioritises humans {{at the expense of}} the organisation which in turn becomes a rarefied and prioritised subject. This result is not consistent with the whole of humanity narrative that is entwined within sustainable development. To develop these arguments, the authors discuss sustainable development, highlighting how the concept implicates the central role of humans. They then discuss the limitations of the machine and organism metaphors relative to sustainable development. The paper then offers a different view of metaphors and suggests a more holistic understanding that is compatible with the achievement of sustainable development. Design/methodology/approach - As a conceptual paper, this article reviews existing literature and offers critique of the use of the dominant metaphors of machine and organism. Findings - Machine and organism metaphors perpetuate a language and understanding that dehumanises work and organisations. The implication of this is that organisational practice and research needs to adopt new metaphors to facilitate sustainable development. Research limitations/implications - As a <b>conceptual</b> <b>document,</b> this manuscript offers new avenues for future research and practice. Practical implications - The arguments presented challenge scholars', educators' and practitioners' use of machine and organism metaphors when discussing organisations. Originality/value - The originality/value of this paper lies in reflecting upon the metaphors of organism and machine relative to sustainable development and in turn reflecting upon the metaphors associated with and the central role of humans within the sustainable development concept.

40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} the premise that by {{challenging}} preconceptions about narrative and story as concepts that are in some way already determined, it becomes possible to open a space in which alternative understandings {{of them can be}} proposed. Such a space is considered necessary in order to account for the ways in which contemporary creative practices such as transmedia storytelling, in which the storytelling experience is distributed across multiple mediums and environments, may be said to require such alternatives in order to explain how they operate as fiction. Fiction, in this thesis, is considered a particular condition a work attempts to establish in which its own reality and organisation takes precedent over, or reduces, the “ultimate” reality of the real world. It is proposed that creative practices such as transmedia storytelling are consistent with the conditions of the current historical moment, identified in this thesis as a convergence culture, or a culture which emerges at the nexus of various social, cultural, technological, political and economic forces without being reducible to any one of these. The chief characteristic of such a culture is the flow of content across its various instantiations; specifically, it is a culture in which the interlocutor, as someone engaged with the work, relates to mediums and the intentional objects held within them according to a contingent logic, which is conceptualised in this thesis as precariousness. This concept forms the basis for a model of relational aesthetics that could be located within the paradigm of convergence culture to explain how practices such as transmedia storytelling rely on the subjectivities of those engaged in them to resolve the precariousness inherent in their formation. Within this space, narrative and story are reconceptualised respectively as the formational and aesthetic planes of a fictional work, which are mediated by a process of intersubjective exchange. The aim of this thesis is therefore the formulation of a continuum of these three core concepts within the broad category of fiction which may be used to examine transmedia storytelling specifically, and fictional works in general. It is this continuum which forms the heart of the thesis, an examination of the fundamental concepts of narrative, story and intersubjectivity and their interdependence as a way to reconsider how we think about the possible richness and diversity the storytelling experience may bring. The thesis takes up each of these concepts in turn before turning to an examination of transmedia storytelling directly. In applying the continuum to this creative practice, the model of a narrative arcology, or superstructure of possible linkages between mediums and nodes in transmedia work, is developed. Following this is a presentation of a substantial creative project which attempts to apply the theoretical concepts developed to a practical environment. The project {{takes the form of a}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>document</b> for a transmedia adaptation of William Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and is discussed from the perspective of a creator or project manager...|$|E

40|$|In {{contemporary}} nursing education, {{the conceptual}} framework is the keystone and foundation upon which nursing curricula are built. This study used a content analysis approach to review <b>conceptual</b> framework <b>documents</b> within nursing curricula to identify the extent to how the four major concepts of "Man", "Environment", "Health", and "Nursing" are defined and used. Data {{used in this study}} were gathered from twenty-one <b>conceptual</b> framework <b>documents</b> as well as six program philosophy documents in instances where formal conceptual frameworks had not been developed. This sample included eight Baccalaureate Degree, fifteen Associate Degree, and four diploma programs. The content analysis consisted of identifying subconcepts and themes provided in the documents which were then categorized as falling into one of the major concepts of "Man", "Environment", "Health" or "Nursing". For example, the subconcept of illness was categorized under the concept of "Health". From an examination of the <b>conceptual</b> framework <b>documents,</b> the following conclusions emerged: 1. Content analysis was an effective way to identify the extent to which subconcepts fall into the identified major concepts. 2. The three levels of nursing programs similarly defined and used common subconcepts to describe the four major concepts. 3. There were discernible differences in emphasis found between the three levels. For example, the baccalaureate models emphasized "Man" as an adaptive behavioral system who has freedom of choice and "Nursing" in which research and leadership nursing roles were addressed. On the other hand, associate degree and diploma documents emphasized the needs of "Man" and stressed the provider role of nursing care. In light of the current controversy over differentiating between the three levels of entry into practice, these findings support the idea that similar subconcepts are used by all three levels of nursing curricula. This study found that baccalaureate, associate degree, and diploma programs borrow from the same theoretical concepts and use these concepts similarly in their <b>conceptual</b> framework <b>documents.</b> Subconcepts and themes identified in this study could be further examined to more clearly specify and define the essential attributes of each concept for theory development and clinical practice...|$|R
