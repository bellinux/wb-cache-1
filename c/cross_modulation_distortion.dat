Although suppression of this tendency is integral to tasks of daily living, its exploitation may prove to be critical in the rehabilitation of acquired hemiplegias. In general, however, the task-related factors that determine the degree of coupling between the upper limbs and the mechanisms that mediate bilateral interactions between neural pathways projecting to the muscles of the arm and hand are not yet well understood. We present evidence that the postural context in which human participants perform upper limb movements determines the relative stability of patterns of bimanual coordination. Manipulation of the axes of rotation of forearm movements reversed the relative stability of simultaneous and alternating patterns of bimanual coordination.
