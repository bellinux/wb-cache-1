500|$|Allmusic's Clayton Bolger {{described}} Young Modern as {{an improvement}} by the band, praising [...] "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements". He claimed {{the album was}} the pinnacle of the band's development. PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that [...] "nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where you <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band XTC.|$|E

500|$|For {{the second}} and third season a {{variation}} of this theme, titled simply [...] "Lassie Main & End Title", was used for the opening and ending theme. Raoul Kraushaar, the music director for the series, is the listed composer for the theme; however the changes he made to the original are so slight that only a trained ear <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference.</b> The third theme used for the series is an orchestral rendition of the aria, [...] "Dio Possente" [...] (Even Bravest Hearts May Swell) from Charles Gounod's opera, Faust.

500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference,</b> {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E

[...] Cattle <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between familiar and unfamiliar animals {{of the same species}} (conspecifics). [...] Studies show they behave less aggressively toward familiar individuals when they are forming a new group. [...] Calves can also discriminate between humans based on previous experience, as shown by approaching those who handled them positively and avoiding those who handled them aversively. Although cattle can discriminate between humans by their faces alone, they also use other cues such as the color of clothes when these are available.|$|E
2500|$|Cats have {{a visual}} {{field of view}} of [...] 200° {{compared}} with 180° in humans, but a binocular field (overlap in the images from each eye) narrower than that of humans. As with most predators, their eyes face forward, affording depth perception {{at the expense of}} field of view. Field of view is largely dependent upon the placement of the eyes, but may also be related to the eye's construction. Instead of the fovea, which gives humans sharp central vision, cats have a central band known as the visual streak. Cats can see some colors, and <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between red, blue and yellow lights, as well as between red and green lights. Cats are able to distinguish between blues and violets better than between colors near the red end of the spectrum. A 2014 study found that, along with several other mammals, cats lenses transmit significant amounts of ultraviolet (UVA 315–400nm) light, which suggests that they possess sensitivity to this part of the spectrum.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a distance-based {{framework}} for DL-Lite based {{on the notion of}} features. Within this framework, we propose a distance-based paraconsistent semantics for DL-Lite where meaningful conclusions can be rationally drawn even from an inconsistent knowledge base and we develop a distance-based inconsistency measurement for DL-Lite to provide more informative metrics which <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between axioms causing inconsistency and among inconsistent knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate several important logical properties (e. g., consistency preservation, closure consistency, splitting property etc.) of the entailment relation based on the new semantics and show its advantages in non-monotonic reasoning for DL-Lite. Finally, we show that our two distance-based inconsistency measures are basic inconsistency measures where some good properties hold such as Free Axiom Independence and Dominance of inconsistency etc...|$|R

Perhaps, after all, this scheme of Mr. Crawley's,--or rather the mode of defence on which he had resolved without any scheme,--might be the best of which the case admitted.

40|$|Inconsistency and incoherency are two {{sorts of}} {{erroneous}} {{information in a}} DL ontology which have been widely discussed in ontology-based applications. For example, they {{have been used to}} detect modeling errors during ontology construction. To provide more informative metrics which <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> between inconsistent ontologies and between incoherent terminologies, there has been some work on measuring inconsistency of an ontology and on measuring incoherency of a terminology. However, most of them merely focus either on measuring inconsistency or on measuring incoherency and no clear ideas of how to extend them to allow for the other. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measure DL ontologies, named distance-based measures. It has the merits that both inconsistency and incoherency can be measured in a unified framework. Moreover, only classical DL interpretations are used such that there is no restriction on the DL languages used...|$|R
