25|$|A diet {{deficient}} in vitamin D {{in conjunction with}} inadequate sun exposure causes osteomalacia (or rickets when it occurs in children), which is a softening of the bones. In the developed world, this is a rare disease. However, vitamin D deficiency has become a worldwide problem in the elderly and remains common in children and adults. Low blood <b>calcifediol</b> (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) can result from avoiding the sun.

Both an excess and a deficiency in vitamin D appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging. The relationship between serum <b>calcifediol</b> level and all-cause mortality is parabolic. Harm from vitamin D appears to occur at a lower vitamin D level in the black population than in the white population.|$|E
