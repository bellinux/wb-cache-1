5000|$|The {{earliest}} bridge {{known to}} incorporate {{some of the}} features of an extradosed design is the Ganter Bridge, constructed in Switzerland in 1980. Designed by Christian Menn of Zurich, it preceded by several years the 1988 publication on the design philosophy of such bridges by Jacques Mathivat, who is credited with inventing the extradosed terminology and its design concepts. The Ganter Bridge is a modified prestressed concrete <b>cantilever</b> <b>girder</b> design, where the longitudinal [...] "continuity" [...] tendons are raised significantly above the deck height at the ends of each main span and supported on short towers.

5000|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{increase}} the safety of bridges with pin and hanger assemblies by adding some form of redundancy to the assembly. Retrofits that add redundancy to pin and hanger assemblies include adding a [...] "catcher's mitt"a short steel beam attached {{to the bottom of the}} <b>cantilevered</b> <b>girder</b> that extends out beneath the suspended girder to [...] "catch" [...] the suspended girder should the pin and hanger assembly fail. Another redundancy is connecting the <b>cantilevered</b> and suspended <b>girders</b> at the pin and hanger assembly with welded blocks and tie rods. Finally, a bridge may be retrofitted by eliminating the expansion joint, replacing the pin and hanger assembly with a pair of gusset plates on each girder.|$|R

5000|$|The Columbushaus {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "little skyscraper". It was a horizontally detailed steel-frame building, the alternating bands of windows and spandrels on the upper floors prefigured by a conceptual sketch of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. (Mendelsohn later claimed that he had to include masonry courses to allow for neon signs, and would otherwise have used only metal and glass.) The client required the façade to curve to follow the line of Friedrich-Ebert-Straße and also specified that the floor plans be flexible to allow for future use as a department store; Erich Mendelsohn's solution was to have the window frames of the outer walls bear much of the load on the upper floors in order to greatly limit the number of internal supports and enable configuration of spaces at will by means of partitions. On the lower floors, with their continuous glazing for retail use, the load was shifted to interior supports using cross <b>girders</b> and <b>cantilever</b> <b>girders.</b> It was the most advanced office building in Europe, and the first building in Germany to have ventilation equipment.|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{method for}} solving the shear lag effect of <b>cantilever</b> box <b>girder</b> is applicable through exerting {{the principle of}} minimum potential energy and combining the variation method, from which the computation expressions of longitudinal displacement function and maximum angle displacement difference function are deduced. The computational formulas of the shear lag coefficient, additional bending moment and deflection are also deduced under condition that the <b>cantilever</b> box <b>girder</b> is acting both on the concentrated force load and uniformly distributed load. The simulated analysis model is built using a finite element method. The analysis indicates that if the external load produces a constant shear flow within {{the section of the}} cantilever beam, only the positive shear lag effect will be produced;but if such load produces a varying or reverse shear flow within the section of the cantilever beam, the negative shear lag effect will be produced. As the magnitude of the shear lag coefficient is proportional to the wide-span ratio, the structural deflection will be increased either by a positive or negative shear lag effect.. The theoretical analysis is consistent with the analysis conclusion of the finite element method...|$|R
50|$|A {{steel plate}} shear element {{consists}} of steel infill plates bounded by a column-beam system.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{theoretical}} study of wind induced dynamic response of line-like structures has been performed, followed up by calculations {{of the dynamic}} response of Dolmsundet Bridge in its critical construction stage. Dolmsundet Bridge is constructed by the balanced cantilever method, which implies that until the <b>cantilevered</b> <b>girders</b> are connected to an adjacent cantilever or supports on shore all forces on the girder must be obtained by the pillar as moment and torsional stress. Thus is the construction particularly vulnerable against wind. The theoretical study focuses on a frequency domain approach of the calculation of buffeting and vortex shedding induced dynamic response of line-like structures. Some statistical principles and a stochastic description of the turbulent wind must be presented before expressions of the loads and thereafter the response due to vortex shedding and buffeting wind can be derived. A section showing how the cross sectional forces {{can be divided into}} a resonant and a background part in order to reduce inaccuracy is also included. A MATLAB program is composed to perform the calculations of the wind induced dynamic response of Dolmsundet Bridge in the construction stage. The response due to the first two modes is calculated, and time domain simulations of the displacements {{at the tip of the}} longest cantilever are created in order to find the maximum values. The calculations show that vortex shedding would be the most important phenomenon for the mode in the vertical direction. Several assumptions and simplifications are made, possibly introducing inaccuracy. It is discussed possible sources of errors and to what extent selected parameters will affect the result. It was found that the structural damping had less influence on the calculated response. The vortex shedding parameters, and especially the nondimensional root mean square lift coefficient, could represent a source of error, and must be chosen with care. It was also discovered that galloping might be an issue due to negative lift derivatives. There should be performed investigations towards ensuring that the aerodynamic damping does not significantly reduce the total damping. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} three decades, steel shear walls {{have been used in}} {{numerous}} tall buildings to resist lateral forces induced by wind and earthquakes. Shear wall systems usually consist of a series of plane walls, often surrounding an interior service area, to form a central core. The perceived advantages of such shear walls, in seismic resistant structures, are enhanced stiffness, strength and ductility, stable hysteretic characteristics and a large capacity for plastic energy absorption. They are also much lighter than equivalent reinforced concrete shear walls, which reduces the dynamic forces and loads on the foundations. Since this system is usually used to resist dynamic loads (e. g., from earthquake etc), a dynamic analysis should be carried out to study the behaviour of these systems. In previous studies steel plate shear wall has been idealised as a vertical <b>cantilever</b> plate <b>girder</b> and the governing differential equations of motion have been derived. The governing equations have been solved for discrete systems in which the mass of the shear wall and associated storey masses as well as the distributed dynamic loading are assumed to be concentrated at each storey level. In the present study a new approach is presented for solution of the the governing equations where the shear wall is considered as a continuous system. The results are compared with those of the discrete system approach...|$|R
50|$|A pin and hanger {{assembly}} {{is used to}} connect two plate girders of a bridge. These assemblies are used to provide an expansion joint in the bridge. One beam (the anchor span) is set on a pier with a short section cantilevered out toward the next pier. The other (the suspended span) begins underneath the anchor span, and has its far end resting on the next pier. The beams have holes directly above each other. The two holes are connected using hangers, a pair of connecting plates sandwiching the bridge girders. A pair of large steel pins through the plates and girder webbing provide the hinges, holding up the suspended span while allowing it to move longitudinally. Large washers are bolted to {{each end of the}} pin to retain the hangers. Exceptionally long spans may have two sets of <b>girders</b> <b>cantilevered</b> from opposite bridge piers with a third set of girders suspended by pin and hanger assemblies from both cantilevers.|$|R
50|$|In 1979 {{a tender}} {{was called by}} the Queensland Main Roads Department for a new bridge {{crossing}} of the Brisbane River.The conforming design main span {{was designed as a}} balanced cantilever with two raised post tensioned concrete compression stays located on the median & over each of the two main piers to support the 260 metre span. Due to the proximity of the Brisbane Airport, an overall structural height constraint was provided due to aircraft flight path & clearances. This constraint ruled out the possibility of a conventional Cable Stay Bridge due to the height of the pylons that would be required.Due to cost considerations an alternative design concept was proposed by Bruce Ramsay (Manager Engineering) of VSL. This alternative design required a world record main span of 260m for a free <b>cantilever</b> concrete box <b>girder</b> bridge. The concept was adopted by one of the tenderers - Transfield Queensland Pty.Ltd. who were subsequently awarded the project {{on the basis of this}} alternative. It held the record span of 260m for over 15 years. The box girder is still the largest prestressed concrete, single box in the world, measuring 15m deep at the pier, with a box width of 12m and an overall deck width for the six lanes of 22m.|$|R
