However, the uncertainties in the optimal <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> were rarely considered. The uncertainties commonly exist in the measurements of real plants.

40|$|In a DC grid, {{contingencies}} such as converter outages {{give rise}} to a current imbalance that is reflected in the DC node voltages in the grid. This imbalance has to be accounted for by changing the currents flowing {{in and out of the}} DC system. These DC node voltages can be directly influenced by controlling the DC current of the HVDC converter at that node. Different <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> can be applied to balance the currents in a DC grid after a contingency. In this paper, the different converter <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> are introduced systematically, thereby aiming to provide a framework for classifying the different converter <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> available in literature. It is discussed how all converter <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> theoretically can be regarded as limiting cases of a voltage droop control. It is also explained how the different converter control concepts can be combined, leading to more advanced converter control schemes such as voltage margin control, dead-band droop control and undead-band droop control.

40|$|<b>Control</b> <b>strategies</b> {{enforced}} by health agencies {{are a major}} type of practice to contain influenza outbreaks. Another type of practice is the voluntary preventive behavior of individuals, such as receiving vaccination, taking antiviral drugs, and wearing face masks. These two types of practices take effects concurrently in influenza containment, but {{little attention has been}} paid to their combined effectiveness. This article estimates this combined effectiveness using established simulation models in the urbanized area of Buffalo, NY, USA. Three <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> are investigated, including: Targeted Antiviral Prophylaxis (TAP), workplace/school closure, community travel restriction, as well as the combination of the three. All <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> are simulated with and without regard to individual preventive behavior, and the resulting effectiveness are compared. The simulation outcomes suggest that weaker <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> could suffice to contain influenza epidemics, because individuals voluntarily adopt preventive behavior, rendering these weaker strategies more effective than would otherwise have been expected. The preventive behavior of individuals could save medical resources for <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> and avoid unnecessary socio-economic interruptions.

25|$|Glare-free {{high beam}} is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} <b>control</b> <b>strategy</b> that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} high beam pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at high beam intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the control of switched reluctance machines for both motoring and generating applications. There are different control objectives in each case. For motoring operation, there are two possible control objectives. If the SRM is being employed in a servo-type application, the desire is for a constant output torque. However, for low performance applications where some amount of torque ripple is acceptable, the aim is to achieve efficient and accurate speed regulation. When the SRM is employed for generating purposes, the goal is to maintain the dc bus voltage at the required value while achieving maximum efficiency. Preliminary investigative work on switched reluctance machine control in both motoring and generating modes is performed. This includes the implementation and testing through simulation of two <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> described in the literature. In addition, an experimental system is built for the development and testing of new <b>control</b> <b>strategies.</b> The inherent nonlinearity of the switched reluctance machine results in ripple in the torque profile. This adversely affects motoring performance for servo-type applications. Hence, three neuro-fuzzy <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> for torque ripple minimisation in switched reluctance motors are developed. For all three <b>control</b> <b>strategies,</b> the training of a neurofuzzy compensator and the incorporation of the trained compensator into the overall switched reluctance drive are described. The performance of the <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> in reducing the torque ripple is examined with simulations and through experimental testing. While the torque ripple is troublesome for servo-type applications, there are some applications where a certain amount of torque ripple is acceptable. Therefore, four simple motor <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> for torque ripple-tolerant applications are described and tested experimentally. Three of the <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> are for low speed motoring operation while the fourth is aimed at high speed motoring operation. Finally, three closed-loop generator <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> aimed at high speed operation in single pulse mode are developed. The three <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> are examined by testing on the experimental system. A comparison of the performance of the <b>control</b> <b>strategies</b> in terms of efficiency and peak current produced by each is presented...|$|R
25|$|Controllability and {{observability}} are main {{issues in}} the analysis of a system before deciding the best <b>control</b> <b>strategy</b> to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. Observability instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
