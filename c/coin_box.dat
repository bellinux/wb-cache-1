50|$|Lock: Quality {{machines}} {{almost always}} come with quality locks such as Chicago Lock Co.'s Ace Locks. The Vendesign 4in1 Carousel is unique {{insofar as it}} has two separate locking <b>coin</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Payphone 23 {{consists}} of two basic units, the equipment part including all the necessary for the operation modules (BG) and the secured below the growing payphone cassettes with the <b>coin</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{simulators}} {{come with}} equipment {{for use of}} a western saddle, a TV screen to simulate the ride and even a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> operation. They even use a soundtrack to simulate horse sounds during the ride.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common type}} of kiddie ride is the {{miniature}} carousel type. These rides are usually {{in the form of}} a small-sized carousel and newer models have the coin-box on the main pillar whereas older units have the <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> on a pole sticking out of the side of the ride.|$|E
5000|$|The 10 Thai baht coin, first minted in 1988, {{which is}} of similar shape and size to a €2 coin but worth around one-eighth of the value has {{recently}} been appearing in the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> of vending machines throughout Europe and being given back as change in some smaller establishments.|$|R
50|$|On September 24, 2008, Vennes' Shorewood, Minnesota {{home was}} raided by federal agents in {{connection}} with an investigation of Minnesota businessman Tom Petters' $3.5 billion Ponzi scheme. In a basement vault, agents discovered stacks of $100 bills, buckets and boxes of gold and silver <b>coins,</b> <b>boxes</b> of gem stones, trays of jewelry and Rolex watches.|$|R
2500|$|... 1976 – Drop-in <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{installed}} on trams. A coin-box was fitted {{at the front}} exit, near the driver. Passengers had to drop in the exact fare on leaving the tram. Rotating turnstiles were fitted at the entrance, which {{is located at the}} rear of a tram. Conductors were no longer needed and most of them retrained to become motormen.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{numerous}} {{tray and lid}} compartments in Victorian trunks, ranging from basic to complex. A basic tray system comprised a hat box, a shirt compartment, a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> and a document box. A complex tray system, however, could consist two hat boxes, several other shirt compartments, a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> several document boxes and even secret compartments strategically placed so that people of unwanted access would pass up if not wary. Beautiful lithographs would be placed over the lids or dome of the trunk and truly capture the Victorian aesthetic of that day. There {{were numerous}} chromolithographs that a trunk maker could use, {{and they could be}} indicative of who the trunk was intended for, such as ladies or men. A bride's chest usually had a lot of floral pictures or lithographs of other ladies, while men's had pictures of [...] "village" [...] or country scenes. It was up to the malletier what to put on the lids and trays.|$|E
50|$|The {{establishment}} of Digital Library is in process. It has the Open Access System {{and also the}} OPAC System which will surely help to render more effective service to the students and staff.A special provision is made to help poor, deserving, SC and ST students by providing one set of books for one complete year. The library is provided with audio, video, Internet. Xerox and <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> telephone facilities.|$|E
50|$|Used {{to collect}} offerings, a saisen box is in essence a {{standard}} <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> {{except that the}} top cover is a grate. This design allows coins to be tossed in, while still preventing the money to be retrieved easily. Those with better designs typically have grates made of round bars, or have their top surfaces act as a slope, allowing the money to slide into the box easily.|$|E

[...] "And he has brought into New Orleans no <b>coins,</b> <b>boxes,</b> or clocks against your Excellency's orders with the image and superscription of the Goddess in whose name all things are done. He has not sung 'Ca Ira' at the theatres, and he detests the tricolored cockades {{as much as you}} do." ...|$|R
50|$|Tubular {{pin tumbler}} locks are {{generally}} considered to be safer and more resistant to picking than standard locks. This is primarily because they are often seen on <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> for vending machines and coin-operated machines, such as those used in a laundromat. However, the primary reason the locks are used in these applications is their lack of the depth requirement that most other locks require.|$|R
5000|$|... 1976 {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) enabling local subscribers to dial direct to over 250 million telephones in 26 countries. However, ISD was not available from <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> until July 1982 when POA boxes were replaced with Post Office CT22B type electronic payphones. In 1979 the Board introduced a Motorola single channel radio paging system, which was upgraded to a two channel system. It is now operated by the Jersey Airport Department of Electronics.|$|R
50|$|Dated {{from the}} distant 1920s, {{it was the}} {{installation}} of the first public access telephones in Brazil. The population of the country then reached, back then, 30,635,605 inhabitants. Equipped with a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> adapted to a common apparatus, these semi-public telephones were found in commercial establishments that signed a contract with Companhia Telefônica Brasileira, a Canadian-owned company that was then responsible for telephony in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cabinets}} {{are constructed}} entirely by hobbyists to mimic an arcade cabinet using emulators such as MAME and a PC {{to replace the}} game hardware. These home built cabinets have many {{of the features of}} real arcade cabinets (such as a <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> marquees etc.). MAME arcade units can combine several arcade controls (such as two types of joysticks and a trackball) in one unit to enable play of many different games.|$|E
50|$|Phone tokens {{started in}} Chicago, where public phones would accept only tokens. These {{were used in}} the U.S. until 1944 when they were {{eliminated}} and most of the tokens were melted down to make shell casings. The earliest-known telephone token dates from 1885, when it was produced for the PAN Telephone Company in Saint Louis, Missouri. Rather than being deposited in the phone, the token was given to an attendant or placed in a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> {{to gain access to the}} phone booth.|$|E
50|$|As this {{decision}} was issued prior to a final disposition in the case, the facts presented here were still in dispute and the Court summarized the testimony given before the Grand Jury. On December 22, 1984, four young black men (Troy Canty, Darryl Cabey, James Ramseur, and Barry Allen) boarded a subway car in the Bronx. Two {{of the men were}} carrying screwdrivers in their coats, which they later admitted were planned to be used to break into arcade game <b>coin</b> <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Redemption games such as Skee Ball {{have been}} around {{since the days of the}} {{carnival}} game - well earlier than the development of the electronic game, however with modern advances many of these games have been re-worked to employ electronic scoring and other game mechanics. The use of electronic scoring mechanisms has allowed carnival or arcade attendants to take a more passive role, simply exchanging prizes for electronically dispensed coupons and occasionally emptying out the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> or banknote acceptors of the more popular games.|$|R
50|$|From {{that time}} all {{machines}} {{in use in}} the UK were of the electro-mechanical type. This used a standard mechanical coin-weigher unit and mechanical stacking for booklets, but had an electronic arm on a rotating cam for dispensing the booklets. They were manufactured by Hillday Automation of Attleborough, Norfolk and designated Type B52. Two versions were built with either long or short <b>coin</b> <b>boxes,</b> easily recognised from {{the length of the}} case. Initially set to dispense 4 x 25p stamps in a folded booklet in exchange for a £1 coin, different combinations were later employed as postage rates in the UK continued to rise.|$|R
50|$|The {{payphone}} model 23, {{introduced at}} Deutsche Bundespost Telekom in 1992, is an electronic software controlled payphone for analog connections. It {{is equipped with}} coin, (Münzspeicherwagen), and integrated test program setting. It has a remote maintenance, the independent reports of a background system {{by means of an}} integrated modem error (for example, defects in components, lack of listeners), operating states (for example, full <b>coin</b> <b>box)</b> or departures (for example standing open the cartridge mounting door, missing coin) to the all public pay telephones of Deutsche Telekom AG are turned on.|$|E
5000|$|On Saturday 20 January 1973 at 15:08, a male caller with an English accent {{rang the}} {{telephone}} exchange in Exchequer Street, Dublin, {{with the following}} bomb warning: [...] "Listen love, there is a bomb in O'Connell Street at the Bridge". Although the call was placed from a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> in the Dublin area, the exact location was never determined. The telephonist immediately contacted the Garda Síochána. The streets of central Dublin were more crowded than usual as Ireland was playing the All Blacks at an international rugby match being held that afternoon in Lansdowne Road.|$|E
5000|$|At {{exactly the}} same time the carbomb detonated in Eden Quay, the Belfast Newsletter {{received}} a telephone call from a man using a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> speaking with a [...] "Belfast/English" [...] type of accent. He issued a warning that two bombs would explode in Dublin. He gave the locations as Liberty Hall and Abbey Street behind Clerys department store. The newspaper immediately phoned the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), who in turn relayed the warnings to the Garda Control Room Dublin Castle at 20:08. A team of Gardaí were sent to investigate the area around Sackville Place and Earl Street.|$|E
50|$|The 1950s and 1960s was the {{pinnacle}} of the motel industry in the United States and Canada. As older mom-and-pop motor hotels began adding newer amenities such as swimming pools or color TV (a luxury in the 1960s), motels were built in wild and impressive designs. In-room gimmicks such as the coin-operated Magic Fingers vibrating bed were briefly popular; introduced in 1958, these were largely removed in the 1970s due to vandalism of the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes.</b> The American Hotel Association (which had briefly offered a Universal Credit Card in 1953 as forerunner to the modern American Express card) became the American Hotel & Motel Association in 1963.|$|R
50|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois to Sicilian parents,after {{serving in}} the U.S Navy he {{returned}} to Chicago and started committing small-time crimes such as breaking open pay telephone <b>coin</b> <b>boxes,</b> he joined Dean O'Banion's North Side Gang, which {{had taken over the}} formerly legal breweries and distilleries {{in that part of the}} city giving them massive profits from illicit production of alcohol, in addition to shakedowns and other rackets. Often described as mainly Irish-American, after O'Banion's death the North Side Gang was successively headed by Hymie Weiss, Drucci and Bugs Moran who were respectively of Polish, Italian and French descent, while the most influential members who never became leader were Louis Alterie, of Spanish parentage, Samuel Morton who was from a Jewish background, and the German Albert Kachellek.|$|R
5000|$|More moves, items, and {{interactivity}} between {{characters and}} the environment are also possible in the Game Gear game. Upon defeating an enemy, the player can choose to have Ristar use an enemy's hat as a weapon, or use its leftover spear as a stepping point when plunged into a wall, allowing Ristar to reach previously out-of-reach higher areas. A [...] "red star" [...] item gives Ristar temporary invincibility, speeds up his movement, increases his jump speed, and allows him to damage enemy upon contact. Colored square boxes, similar to the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> in the Super Mario series, are also only present in this version, and like with enemies, they are eliminated by using the [...] "headbutt" [...] attack rather than by jumping into them.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a painted}} {{concrete}} menagerie {{in the garden}} of one of the houses in the village. The sculptures were made, starting in 1962, by James Beveridge to designs by retired joiner John Fairnington (d. 1981) to amuse his disabled son, Edwin. As well as animals, there are statues of Winston Churchill, T. E. Lawrence and Robert Burns, and many texts set into the plinths and pathways. It has been a popular tourist attraction, with its own tea room, and may still be accessible by the public for free (although with a <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> for voluntary donations).|$|E
5000|$|The 1894-S Barber dime is a dime {{produced}} in the United States Barber coinage. It {{is one of the}} rarest and most highly prized United States coins for collectors, along with the 1804 dollar and the 1913 Liberty Head nickel. One was sold in 2005 for 1.3 million dollars. [...] Another was sold in 2007 for 1.9 million dollars. [...] Only 24 were minted, and of those, only nine are known to survive; seven are uncirculated, while two are heavily worn. In 1957, one of the latter was found in a junk <b>coin</b> <b>box</b> at Gimbels Department Store, and purchased for $2.40.|$|E
50|$|Coin slots, coin {{returns and}} the <b>coin</b> <b>box,</b> which {{allow for the}} {{exchange}} of money or tokens. They are usually below the control panel. Very often, translucent red plastic buttons are placed in between the coin return and the coin slot. When they are pressed, a coin or token that has become jammed in the coin mechanism is returned to the player. See coin acceptor. Early coin slots could be defeated using a piezo-electric gas fire or gas oven igniter held against the steel bodywork of the cabinet, thus enabling free credits to be obtained. In some arcades, the coin slot is replaced with a card reader that reads data from a game card bought from the arcade operator.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of several}} probability puzzles {{related to the}} Monty Hall problem is Bertrand's box paradox, posed by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités (Barbeau 1993). In this puzzle there are three boxes: a box containing two gold <b>coins,</b> a <b>box</b> with two silver <b>coins,</b> and a <b>box</b> with one of each. After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random {{that happens to be}} a gold coin, the question is what is the probability that the other coin is gold. As in the Monty Hall problem the intuitive answer is , but the probability is actually [...]|$|R
50|$|By {{the last}} half of the 1970s, more than a million Magic Fingers units had been {{installed}} in American and European hotels and houses. The devices started to seem out of date and somewhat sleazy, because of the bed's association with seedy motels, and their popularity declined starting in the 1980s as other in-room entertainment options became available and theft of money from the <b>coin</b> <b>boxes</b> started to become more common. Houghtaling sold the rights to the Magic Fingers name after he retired in the 1980s, with the new owner manufacturing units for home use at the time of his death in 2009. Though the devices are rarely seen in the 21st century, they were still available in motels in the Western United States at the time of his death.|$|R
