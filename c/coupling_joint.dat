The prosthesis has modular components that are {{connected by a}} conical <b>coupling</b> <b>joint.</b> One of the dog’s hind legs was immobilized and suspended for three weeks using an external fixator to minimize loading and prevent weight-bearing, while the contralateral leg was allowed to bear weight freely, simulating an over-loading situation. Five dogs reached the final study pe-nod of twelve weeks without complication. There {{were no significant differences}} between the non-weight-bear-ing and weight-bearing sides on radiographic assess-ments. However, the immobilized side had significantly higher stem-push-out strength and energy to failure...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering"July 2005. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 160 - 166) This research {{involved the}} design of a position control system, based on a new method of observer-adaptive friction compensation, for a fuel valve that controls the flow of gas in large turbines. This fuel valve is operated by a Permanent Magnet Synchronous (PMS) motor, which is attached to the gear box and <b>coupling</b> <b>joint.</b> These unsatisfactory position response problems that occur at start-up and during operation when the pressure difference (p) across the valve, and consequently the friction, is the greatest includes the following: high overshoots, high steady-state error, and limit-cycle exhibition during steady-state conditions. The deficiency of the linear-based control system of the PMS motor to compensate for the nonlinearity of the system, such as friction effect and flexibility of the <b>coupling</b> <b>joint,</b> is the major source of problems with this fuel valve. This research developed the fundamental concept of a new observer-based adaptive friction compensation for multibody actuation systems (n degrees of freedom) for both deterministic and stochastic systems, and presents the mathematical equations for molding the nonlinear system, including modeling of the PMS motor, nonlinear actuator, and gear box with friction and flexible coupling joints. Two new methods of compensating for friction, including friction compensation gain and observer-based adaptive friction compensation for a multibody system, are proposed, and the application of the latter is used for improving the position control system of the fuel valve. The initial results of using the new position control system based on observer-adaptive friction compensation have shown improvement to the response of the fuel valve system, both in steady-state and transient operations...|$|E

The research {{showed that the}} critical load of a system scaffold structure without diagonal braces {{is similar to that}} of a door-shaped steel scaffold structure. Joint stiffness between vertical props in system scaffolds can be defined based on a comparison between analytical and experimental results. When the number of scaffold stories increases, the critical loads of system scaffolds decrease. Diagonal braces markedly enhance the critical load of system scaffolds. The <b>coupling</b> <b>joint</b> position between vertical props should be kept away from story-to-story joints to prevent a reduction in critical loads. The critical load of a system scaffold decreases as the quantity of extended vertical props at the bottom of the structure increases.

40|$|Abstract. Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging group studies rely {{on the ability to}} establish correspondence across individuals. This enables location specific comparison of functional brain characteristics. Regis-tration is often based on morphology and does not take variability of functional localization into account. This can lead to a loss of speci-ficity, or confounds when studying diseases. In this paper we propose multi-subject functional registration by manifold alignment via <b>coupled</b> <b>joint</b> diagonalization. The functional network structure of each subject is encoded in a diffusion map, where functional relationships are decou-pled from spatial position. Two-step manifold alignment estimates initial correspondences between functionally equivalent regions. Then, <b>coupled</b> <b>joint</b> diagonalization establishes common eigenbases across all individ-uals, and refines the functional correspondences. We evaluate our ap-proach on fMRI data acquired during a language paradigm. Experiments demonstrate the benefits in matching accuracy achieved by <b>coupled</b> <b>joint</b> diagonalization compared to previously proposed functional alignment approaches, or alignment based on structural correspondences. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Usually {{the legs}} of humanoids capable of {{omnidirectional}} walking are not underactuated. In other words {{each one of the}} six de-grees of freedom of the torso can be commanded independently from the leg joint angles. However the NAO humanoid robot has a <b>coupled</b> <b>joint</b> at the hips, which makes 11 degrees of freedom instead of 12 for the locomotor apparatus. As a consequence the trunk of the robot has only 5 independent degrees of freedom when the positions of both feet are fixed, and each leg cannot be commanded independently to execute walk-ing steps. Up to now only bypass solutions have been proposed, where the <b>coupled</b> <b>joint</b> angles are not calculated exactly. This paper describes an analytical solution to determine the exact angle to be applied to the <b>coupled</b> <b>joint.</b> The method uses the positions of both foot ankles in the trunk reference frame and the angle between footprints as inputs, and calculates the yaw angle of the trunk. The solution was demonstrated in a dynamics simulator using the NAO model. ...|$|R

Capabilities and attitudes of agents were captured by actions, and formulas in DDL respectively. Thus representation components in our framework were conferred with well-defined semantics by relating them to some domain ontologies. We could employ reasoning on actions in DDL to help agents to find proper colleagues when collaboration is necessary, and the philosophy underlying Joint Intention to bind their actions to achieve their overall goal. The main strengths of our framework include: i) finding probably helpful agents in a semantically accurate way due to the employment of semantic information; ii) going much closer to industrial implementations while retaining the main express power of classical joint intention model...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley gust tunnel with two identical airplane models approximating 1 / 40 -scale models of the B- 29, coupled in tandem with a boom so that the individual centers of gravity were equidistant from the single <b>coupling</b> <b>joint</b> at the tail of the lead airplane. Time histories of the boom joint load were obtained as the models were flown through a gust. The results indicate that on a similar configuration involving airplanes the size of B- 29 airplanes a load on the boom joint of 10, 000 to 14, 000 pounds could be induced by encountering a gust of 50 feet per second and having a gradient distance of 17 chords, at a forward speed of 380 feet per second and that the total load is extremely sensitive to the steadiness of flight that can be maintained with or without a gust. It is felt that the results are probably satisfactory to show order of magnitude, but it does not appear possible that a precise determination of the joint load that would be applicable to the full-scale airplanes can be obtained by gust-tunnel tests...|$|E
40|$|The Energy Finite Element Analysis (EFEA) is {{a finite}} element based {{computational}} method for high frequency vibration and acoustic analysis. The EFEA solves with finite elements governing differential equations for energy variables. These equations are developed from wave equations. Recently, an EFEA method for computing high frequency vibration of structures either in vacuum or {{in contact with}} a dense fluid has been presented. The presence of fluid loading has been considered through added mass and radiation damping. The EFEA developments were validated by comparing EFEA results to solutions obtained by very dense conventional finite element models and solutions from classical techniques such as statistical energy analysis (SEA) and the modal decomposition method for bodies of revolution. EFEA results have also been compared favorably with test data for the vibration and the radiated noise generated by a large scale submersible vehicle. The primary variable in EFEA {{is defined as the}} time averaged over a period and space averaged over a wavelength energy density. A joint matrix computed from the power transmission coefficients is utilized for coupling the energy density variables across any discontinuities, such as change of plate thickness, plate/stiffener junctions etc. When considering the high frequency vibration of a periodically stiffened plate or cylinder, the flexural wavelength is smaller than the interval length between two periodic stiffeners, therefore the stiffener stiffness can not be smeared by computing an equivalent rigidity for the plate or cylinder. The periodic stiffeners must be regarded as coupling components between periodic units. In this paper, Periodic Structure (PS) theory is utilized for computing the <b>coupling</b> <b>joint</b> matrix and for accounting for the periodicity characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the modeling, {{identification}} and control of a flexible joint robot developed for medical applications at the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

Therefore, a regulation MIMO state feedback controller based on modal analysis is developed for each <b>coupled</b> <b>joint</b> pair, which consists of full state feedback (motor position, link side torque, as well as their derivatives). Furthermore, in order to improve position accuracy and simultaneously keep good dynamic behavior of the MIMO state feedback controller, a cascaded tracking control scheme is proposed, based on the MIMO state feedback controller with additional feedforward terms (desired motor velocity, desired motor acceleration, derivative of the desired torque), which are computed in a computed torque controller and take the whole rigid body dynamics into account. Stability analysis is shown for the complete controlled robot. Finally, experimental results with the DLR medical robot are presented to validate the practical efficiency of the approaches...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is based on the damage {{analysis}} by fretting wearing occurred on the composite steel sheets reinforced with TiB 2 ceramic particles. There is a real lack to find a reliable data and detail research in literature that makes the purpose of this manuscript. Design/methodology/approach: Fretting is a surface degradation process in which removal of material is induced by small amplitude oscillatory movement between contacting components, such as flexible <b>coupling</b> <b>joint</b> structures etc. The main parameters affecting fretting wear are reported to be normal load, slip amplitude, frequency of the oscillatory movement, contact geometry, surface roughness and material properties. In this study, a finite element-based method is presented for simulating the contact of a rigid cylinder on flat fretting wear for the composite steel sheets reinforced with TiB 2 ceramic particles. Findings: The general purpose commercial code ABAQUS was employed; this model can be used to facilitate generalization of the present approach to more complex applications. In this study a particular mesh technique was used to optimize the computation time, especially when dynamic analysis is used. In fact, two-dimensional, four-node, plane strain (linear) elements are employed throughout. The mesh (element size) in the contact area is very fine to capture the complicated variation of the surface and subsurface stresses and relative slip. The contact surface is constituted with a rigid hard steel cylinder material and a flat plate of composite steel sheets reinforced with TiB 2 ceramic particles. Practical implications: This manuscript concerns a typical contact with the cylindrical plan geometry as it models the major problems and also stress distribution due to the contact was well defined. Our assembly is then, composed with a cylindrical contact with a plan substrate. An elastic - plastic analysis of fretting stress using a finite element ABAQUS is enhanced. The cylindrical pad is made of a rigid material and a flat plate the composite steel sheets reinforced with TiB 2 ceramic particles. A bilinear elastic - plastic isotropic hardening model with a von Mises yield surface is employed to characterize the material behaviour of these composite steel sheets reinforced with TiB 2 ceramic particles. This manuscript give a real and practical usage as a friendship notice concerning this subject. Originality/value: is very well shown that this model is firstly verified through comparison with an analytical elastic solution. Various parameters, such as friction coefficient, the normal force applied {{on the top of the}} pad, tangential force applied to the left side of the pad, and bulk tension applied on the right edge of the substrate are adopted to study the influences of these parameters on fretting stresses to understand the implication and importance of elastic-plastic analysis in fretting fatigue experiments...|$|E
40|$|Netball {{requires}} direction changes whilst sprinting, which predisposes netballers to risk of injury. The {{main question}} this thesis addressed was “What {{is the role}} of <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability and <b>joint</b> stiffness during change of direction sprints and the association with lower limb injury?”. Specifically, differences in <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability and <b>joint</b> stiffness between elite and non-elite netballers, between male and female netballers, between dominant and non-dominant lower limbs and between injured and non-injured netballers post six months of prospective monitoring were ascertained. Before these study aims could be addressed the reliability of <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability and <b>joint</b> stiffness measures during unanticipated straight run and unanticipated 180 ° turning tasks performed by netballers required examination. Twelve elite female netballers, 12 male non-elite netballers and 12 non elite female netballers performed unanticipated straight sprints and sprints with a 180 ° turn on their dominant and non-dominant legs in a motion analysis laboratory from a 10 m approach. Measurement reliability and measurement variability of <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> and <b>joint</b> stiffness were measured within players across testing sessions. <b>Joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability for rearfoot and knee motion were most reliable for most unanticipated tasks whereas ankle frontal plane stiffness was most reliable for all four unanticipated tasks. Consequently, these measures were used throughout the thesis research for comparisons between groups. Female netballers, in particular at the elite level, that demonstrated low levels of lower extremity <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability (JCV) in their dominant leg during unanticipated straight sprint tasks were susceptible to injury (r = 0. 66). Conversly, male netballers that demonstrated high <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability in their dominant leg during unanticipated sprint tasks were likely to sustain injury (Rearfoot(eversion/inversion) Knee(flexion/extension) injury r = - 0. 46 : Rearfoot(eversion/inversion) –Knee(rotation) injury r = - 0. 35 : Tibial(rotation) –Knee(flexion/extension) injury r = - 0. 54). Associations with injury occurrence were not as prevalent or strong for joint stiffness (JS) as those found with <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability (JCV 7 out of 12, r = - 0. 54 to 0. 66; JS 7 out of 12, r = - 0. 55 to 0. 33). During ground contact for an unanticipated turn, injury was more likely for elite level female netballers if they had low levels of ankle joint stiffness (r = 0. 33), and for non-elite female netballers if they had high knee joint stiffness (r = - 0. 51). In contrast male netballers with high levels of ankle joint stiffness during ground contact of an unanticipated straight sprint were likely to be injured (r = - 0. 55). Therefore, the role of <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability and <b>joint</b> stiffness during change of direction sprints and the association with lower limb injury was gender and movement specific. The thesis findings support low <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability associations with injury and injury occurrence associations with both high and low joint stiffness theories proposed in the literature. Further investigations related to context specificity of <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability or <b>joint</b> stiffness between genders, limbs and other athletic populations is required. Additionally research involving training interventions to optimise <b>joint</b> <b>coupling</b> variability and <b>joint</b> stiffness may benefit the performance and welfare of netballers...|$|R

40|$|Walking in {{insects and}} most six-legged robots {{requires}} simultaneous control {{of up to}} 18 joints. Moreover, the number of joints that are mechanically coupled via body and ground varies from one moment to the next, and external conditions such as friction, compliance and slope of the substrate are often unpredictable. Thus, walking behaviour requires adaptive, context-dependent control of many degrees of freedom. As a consequence, modelling legged locomotion addresses many aspects of any motor behaviour in general. Based on results from behavioural experiments on arthropods, we describe a kinematic model of hexapod walking: the distributed artificial neural network controller WALKNET. Conceptually, the model addresses three basic problems in legged locomotion. (I) First, coordination of several legs requires coupling between the step cycles of adjacent legs, optimising synergistic propulsion, but ensuring stability through flexible adjustment to external disturbances. A set of behaviourally derived leg coordination rules can account for decentralised generation of different gaits, and allows stable walking of the insect model {{as well as of}} a number of legged robots. (II) Second, a wide range of different leg movements must be possible, e. g. to search for foothold, grasp for objects or groom the body surface. We present a simple neural network controller that can simulate targeted swing trajectories, obstacle avoidance reflexes and cyclic searching-movements. (III) Third, control of mechanically <b>coupled</b> <b>joints</b> of the legs in stance is achieved by exploiting the physical interactions between body, legs and substrate.

The wife’s retirement significantly increases both her separate leisure time and the <b>couple’s</b> <b>joint</b> leisure time. Because the wife is typically the last to retire, her retirement often coincides with partners’ joint retirement.
