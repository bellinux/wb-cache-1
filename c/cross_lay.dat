But he made no idle threat as to the sacrifices, for from that night forward they were doubled {{throughout}} the land. Already the shadow of the <b>Cross</b> <b>lay</b> deep upon the altars of Anahuac, but still the smoke of their offerings went up to heaven and the cry of the captives rang round the teocallis. The hour of the demon gods was upon them indeed, but now they reaped their last red harvest, and it was rich.|$|E
60|$|The {{morning after}} my arrival, I rose {{at an early}} hour. The {{daylight}} was peering brightly between the window curtains, and drawing them apart, I gazed through the Gothic casement upon a scene that accorded in character with {{the interior of the}} ancient mansion. It was the old Abbey garden, but altered to suit the tastes of different times and occupants. In one direction were shady walls and alleys, broad terraces and lofty groves; in another, beneath a gray monastic-looking angle of the edifice, overrun with ivy and surmounted by a <b>cross,</b> <b>lay</b> a small French garden, with formal flower-pots, gravel walks, and stately stone balustrades.|$|E

60|$|The monk shuddered, {{but making}} {{the sign of}} the cross, he bowed his pale face, in signification of his {{readiness}} to discharge the duty. At that moment the bearers lifted the body, and the procession issued upon the great square. First marched the usual lay underlings of the cathedral, who were followed by those who chanted the offices of the occasion. Among the latter the Carmelite hastened to take his station. Next came the corpse, without a coffin, for that is a luxury of the grave even now unknown to the Italians of old Antonio's degree. The body was clad in the holiday vestments of a fisherman, the hands and feet being naked. A <b>cross</b> <b>lay</b> on the breast; the grey hairs were blowing about in the air, and, in frightful adornment of the ghastliness of death, a bouquet of flowers was placed upon the mouth. The bier was rich in gilding and carving, another melancholy evidence of the lingering wishes and false direction of human vanity.|$|E

50|$|In the {{so-called}} <b>cross</b> <b>lay</b> strands, the wires {{of the different}} layers cross each other. In the mostly used parallel lay strands, the lay length of all the wire layers is equal and the wires of any two superimposed layers are parallel, resulting in linear contact. The wire of the outer layer is supported by two wires of the inner layer. These wires are neighbours along the whole length of the strand. Parallel lay strands are made in one operation. The endurance of wire ropes {{with this kind of}} strand is always much greater than of those (seldom used) with <b>cross</b> <b>lay</b> strands. Parallel lay strands with two wire layers have the construction Filler, Seale or Warrington.|$|E
5000|$|Architecturally, {{the station}} resembles North Wootton station, {{with a small}} main station {{building}} on the up platform and a small waiting room provided on the down platform; both had Great Eastern-style canopies. A small goods yard adjoined the main station building, and a standard Great Eastern gabled signal box was sited on {{the southern end of}} the down platform. A level <b>crossing</b> <b>lay</b> at the northern end of the station and, in common with other stations on the line, convenient lodging accommodation, a solidly built Carstone inn known as [...] "The Alexandra Hotel", was to be found opposite the station approach.|$|R
50|$|Sedgeford {{railway station}} {{was the first}} station after Heacham on the {{single-track}} West Norfolk Junction Railway. It was a small station located in a rural area, equipped with a single platform on the down side, built to smaller dimensions to other stations on the Lynn and Hunstanton Railway, and without a stationmaster's residence. Very basic goods facilities were provided {{in the shape of}} a single carriage siding on the down side. The station's staff amounted to two persons, reduced to one in the final years. Traffic on the line was largely agricultural, consisting of corn, sugar beet, cattle and agricultural machinery. A level <b>crossing</b> <b>lay</b> to the east of the platform.|$|R

50|$|Stanhoe {{station was}} {{actually}} situated {{more than a}} mile from the village from which it took its name; its remote rural location was accentuated {{by the fact that it}} lay at a height of around 200 ft above sea level. With no goods facilities provided, the station had one of the simplest layouts on the line; a single platform on the up side on which was built a signal box and single storey station building out of Norfolk flint rather than the usual Great Eastern Carstone. A level <b>crossing</b> <b>lay</b> to the west while the line climbed to the west, running parallel with a minor road before crossing it on a level about a mile from Docking.|$|R

50|$|In {{the medieval}} period the River Parrett {{was used to}} {{transport}} Hamstone from the quarry at Ham Hill {{for the construction of}} churches throughout the county. The nearest bridge to the river's mouth was established at Bridgwater in 1200 AD. A ford, usable only at low tide, and later a ferry operated across the mouth of the river at Combwich, it is thought, since Roman times. The <b>crossing</b> <b>lay</b> on the route of a Saxon herepath; and in the 15th century was regarded as part of the King's Highway. The White House Inn, a licensed victualler, on the Pawlett bank traded from 1655 to 1897 but the ferry has since fallen out of use, and the former White House Inn was demolished round about 1930.|$|R
5000|$|As in all Protestant {{places of}} worship, the {{interior}} is very restrained. The space is organized in a semicircle centered on a monumental pulpit in walnut wood, fixed on a wall opposite the main entrance.

5000|$|In September 1885, {{while working}} as a court stenographer and {{freelance}} reporter, Small covered a revival meeting of evangelist Sam Jones in Cartersville, Georgia. There Small was so [...] "overwhelmed by conviction of sin" [...] that on arriving back in Atlanta, he immediately started drinking. Nevertheless, four days after visiting Cartersville, Small [...] "pleaded with Christ that he would let me cling to his <b>cross,</b> <b>lay</b> down all my burdens and sins there, and be rescued and saved by his compassion." [...] Small's family at first feared he was slipping into madness. Small soon began testifying to his deliverance from alcohol, and Sam Jones now came to hear him preach in Atlanta. [...] "Small's fame and newspaper connections ensured that his conversion would garner publicity," [...] and Jones invited Small to be his associate.|$|E
5000|$|As Bristol prospered, {{the cross}} became an {{obstruction}} to traffic. In 1733 a nearby silversmith {{complained that the}} cross threatened his life and property whenever there was a high wind and so persuaded the magistrates to have the cross taken down. The parts were stored in the guildhall until Alderman Price and other citizens arranged {{for it to be}} erected again on College Green by the cathedral. It was there admired as a quaint antiquity but it only took thirty years for it once again to be thought an obstruction. This time, the complaints came from the visitors who had come to the spa of Hotwells. They were wont to promenade on the green in line abreast and the cross impeded the great numbers so inclined — lines of eight or more. A fund was collected to improve the green as a promenade but this was exhausted in raising the green and the pieces of the <b>cross</b> <b>lay</b> disassembled by the cathedral for some years. In 1780, Dean Barton then gave it to Henry [...] "the Magnificent" [...] Hoare to adorn his grand estate of Stourhead in Wiltshire. [...] It remains there now in the care of the National Trust.|$|E

The pleasure of treasure was devised {{as a response to}} Richard Wentworth's exhibition An area of outstanding unnatural beauty, November 2002. Richard Wentworth sought to explore the character of King's Cross by creating an exhibition space that would provide somewhere both where the overlooked and hidden histories of King's Cross could be gathered together and also where people from the King's Cross area could engage with activities that had been lost or overlooked. Similarly, The pleasure of treasure sought to take people around the area with a view to exploring its histories and oddities. More than this, it hoped to open up the area to fresh eyes, capable of seeing the secret treasures that lay there. In keeping with Wentworth's project, the beauty of King's <b>Cross</b> <b>lay</b> not only in the process of exploration but also in the chance encounters (of various kinds) that sometimes surprise and sometimes disappoint...|$|E

Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching dog. There were more decisive details to a fairly well-trained eye. The man was clad in coarse and ragged clothes, but they were something more than merely coarse and ragged. They were so ill-fitting as to be quite grotesque; even as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise, the coat-collar in which his head was buried {{made him look like}} a hunchback, and the long loose sleeves {{looked as if he had}} no hands. It at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change his convict clothes for some confederate's clothes which did not fit him. Second, there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running; so that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair, if the hair had not been very short. Then I remembered that beyond these ploughed fields he was <b>crossing</b> <b>lay</b> Pilgrim's Pond, for which (you will remember) the convict was keeping his bullet; and I sent my walking-stick flying." ...|$|R
