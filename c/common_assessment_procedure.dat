40|$|This study {{undertakes}} a cross-linguistic {{comparison of}} reading and spelling acquisition in French, Portuguese and Spanish languages. It aims to examine several explanatory factors for the well-documented effect of language on the speed {{of reading and}} spelling development: differences in orthographic depth and complexity of syllabic structures. A longitudinal study was carried out with first graders in the three languages and with a <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Children were tested in October, February and May on letter knowledge, familiar word and simple pseudoword reading and spelling. Results show that all children were accurate in reading and spelling {{at the end of}} the first school year. Differences between languages are highlighted when rate of acquisition and linguistic variables such as lexicality, items length, or complexity of grapheme-phoneme correspondences and of the syllabic structure are considered. These differences will be discussed in the light of the explanatory factors mentioned. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Assessment of {{research}} products {{is a crucial}} issue for universities and research institutions faced with internationalization and competition. Disciplines are reacting differently to this challenge, and planning, in its various forms – from urban design to process­oriented sectors – is under strain because the increasingly <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> {{based on the number}} of articles published in ranked journals and on citation data are not generally accepted. The reputation of journals, the impact of publications, and the profiles of scholars are increasingly defined by means of indexes such as impact factor and citations counts, but these metrics are questioned because they do not take account of all journals and magazines – in particular those published in languages other than English – and they do not consider teaching and other activities typical of academics and which have a real impact on planning practices at the local level. In Italy the discussion is particularly heated because <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> are recent, the disciplinary community is not used to publishing in ranked international journals, and the Italian literature is not attuned to the international quality criteria. The paper reviews the recent debate on planning journals and research assessment. It focuses on the Italian case from the perspective of improving current practices. <br /...|$|R
40|$|University, a {{four-year}} IHE, have joined {{together to create}} a model to ensure that aspiring teachers have the same opportunities for a quality education no matter where they complete their first 2 years. The institutions have developed a workable system for helping students meet the requirements for becoming effective beginning teachers. This model includes an articulated, standards-based curriculum for both campuses; <b>common</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> that center around the performance of candidates; resident faculty members from the four-year campus working on the two-year campus; and cooperative implementation of professional development sites in the service region of the two-year institution. One of the most important factors in the success of this partnership is the open communication between the two parties. Administrators and faculty from both institutions meet on a regular basis. Students from the community college are viewed as equal to students on the home campus. The dean, other administrators, advisors, faculty, and others make regular visits to the community college to help develop a sense of community with the students.

This <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is built out of four different components: a well-designed written knowledge test, a structure oral exam, a large scale OSCE type exam and a structure report from the trainers. A pass-fail standard is defined for each separate module using appropriate procedures. A final pass-fail decision is based on a combination of the socres obtained from the different modules. This presentation discusses the different approaches that can be used to combine the different component socres. From a pure reliabilty perspective the reliability analysis of composite scores can be computed using a multivariate reliability analysis. The discussion is illustrated with data collected form the final <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> in 1997 - 2005. The impact of using different approaches and computation methods is simulated and discussed.

40|$|The EDA (European Defence Agency) project PoMM (Protection of Marine Mammals) {{is based}} on an {{agreement}} between the Ministries of Defence for Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The project, running for 3 years since August 2010, aims to protect marine mammals against the impact of active sonar and maintain the ability to operate active sonar at the same time. Within this project a comprehensive common marine mammal database, being essential for risk mitigation tools, was established. The database, built on an extensive data set collection with the focus on areas of operational interest for European Navies, consists of four parts: random and systematic sightings, annual and seasonal distribution and density maps, audio information including numerous examples of various vocalizations and an encyclopaedia providing knowledge on the characteristics of 126 marine mammal species. Special investigations on marine mammal acoustics were carried out to improve the detection and classification capabilities. Based on the available audio data an algorithm was developed, trained and tested to classify selected groups of marine mammals including beaked whales, the species mostly affected by active sonars. A follow-on EDA project PoMM 2 is planned to upgrade the common marine mammal database, to improve detection, classification and localization performances and to establish a <b>common</b> risk <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> to avoid negative impact on marine mammals by military active sonars...|$|R

The procedure of LOOP delivers a 3 D-model generated from the data of a commercial in-line inspection tools (ultrasonic, magnetic flux). This {{makes it possible to}} use the full functionalities of the relevant finite element software like evaluation of wall-thinning (LOOP 1) and fracture mechanics analysis to evaluate cracks in the wall (LOOP 2). In this paper is given the basic ideas of the LOOP concept, where the main focus is directed to the LOOP 1 <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Based on a real example of a corroded pipeline is demonstrated the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is based on an elastic-plastic analysis of a real inner contour of the corroded surface transferred in the finite element geometry model. The unique element is that the surface data of the UT-pigging is used directly to generate the geometry model in the FE-software ANSYS. The <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is validated by a burst pressure test of a corroded pipeline. The result of the burst pressure test is compared with the calculated limit load from an elastic-plastic analysis based on measured material properties. Additionally, the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with the results of a limit load analysis based on DIN EN 13445 - 3 and with the results of the standard <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> At the end the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with the procedure given in API 579 - 1 standard...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} teacher {{professional development and}} learning may be improved by using formative <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures.</b> This thesis focuses on a specific form of formative assessment, negotiated assessment, which is characterised by the exchange of views between assessor and assessee and the extensive involvement of the participants (assessees) in their own <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> The participants negotiate with their assessor about several aspects of the negotiated <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure.</b> Assumptions in negotiated teacher assessment are that the opportunities for negotiation might promote {{the development of a}} sense of agency in terms of teachers feeling in control of their learning and assessment processes and feeling able to pursue their learning objectives. This thesis covers four studies in which different aspects of negotiated assessment were examined. Its aim was to gain more knowledge about a negotiated <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> to promote teacher learning in the area of stimulating students’ reflections. The results show that very little negotiation took place during the dialogues. Despite the lack of negotiation during the assessment meetings, the teachers reported a strong sense of agency. Overall, the teachers’ opinions indicated that the elements of the negotiated <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure</b> facilitated their professional learning. The contribution was particularly seen in change in their knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and practice.

40|$|Abstract: The next {{generation}} seismic design and <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> for buildings within the performancebased framework are {{a radical departure}} from traditional seismic design practice and performance assessment. The uncertainty and randomness in the building performance and seismic hazard will be captured and quantified in each steps in design and <b>assessment</b> <b>procedure,</b> finally the performance will be measured in terms of direct and indirect economic losses and casualties. The quantification and propagation of uncertainty in every step in the procedure requires robust probabilistic methods that have been developed over the last two decades. This paper summarises the research undertaken to develop the probabilistic performance-based seismic design and <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> for buildings. The analysis methods, fragility functions and seismic hazard qualification, which are key elements in procedures, are defined and discussed...|$|R

40|$|The correct {{evaluation}} of seismic {{vulnerability of the}} existing building stock is a key issue for every earthquake prone Country; the need for reliable decision making tools for the assessment and retrofitting of the existing building stock is widely recognized. Still, the applicability, effectiveness, accuracy of currently codified seismic <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> strongly vary, depending on {{the features of the}} assessed structures, and often also on the engineering judgement and knowledge of the applicator. Moreover, time and costs constraints, to which the <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> are necessarily bound, pose further issues as to the details and immediateness of the implementation of such analyses. In the paper, a critical review of the most widespread currently codified seismic <b>assessment</b> <b>procedures</b> is carried out, with reference to the case study of a plan-wise irregular r. c. frame structure which underwent extensive pseudodynamic testing, both in the ¿as-built¿ and in retrofitted configurations, in the framework of the activity of the ELSA Laboratory of the JRC.
