40|$|Creases are marks {{that are}} created {{and left in}} a fabric during gament wear. Pressing is a process to flatten garment panels and sharpen garment edges and pleats. To {{minimize}} crease, the fabric should recover after pressing without creating a creased edge. Whereas, good pressing performance means the creased edge stays sharp after pressing. Good <b>crease</b> <b>recovery</b> and pressing performance appear contradictory.

40|$|Waterflooding is a {{commonly}} used {{operation in the}} oil industry. It is used to in- <b>crease</b> oil <b>recovery</b> from the reservoir, and is considered as a secondary recovery technique. In short, the reservoir is flooded with water to increase pressure, and to displace oil from pore spaces. This thesis has explored three general methods for optimizing this operation, with special attention paid to treatment of constraints. As means of background theory, a brief introduction to petroleum engineering is provided, the concept of dynamic optimization is stated, and reservoir simulation is presented. The three methods of interest are gradient-based control optimization, reactive control, and techniques based on simulator-embedded constraints. The popularity of gradient-based control optimization has grown during the last decade, {{and there has been}} conducted a vast amount of research on the topic during this period. Such optimization is usually referred to as adjont-based optimization, as efficient com- putation of gradients serves as a prerequisite for the method to remain tractable for reservoir optimization. Next, reactive control is widely used in the industry, and its popularity is among others due to simplicity, robustness, and model-independence. The last method considered is based on simulator-embedded constraints, which of today is a relatively unexplored area. A new heuristic has however been developed during this work, which combines output unconstrained control optimization and simulator-embedded constraints. The three general approaches are implemented using the Matlab Reservoir Simu- lation Toolbox. A series of four case studies are employed to assess the merits of the methods. In short, if geological uncertainty is put aside, gradient-based op- timization appeared as the preferred method. Furthermore, the popularity of the reactive control approach can be understood, as the method performed adequately - keeping its simplicity in mind. The heuristic that was developed showed some potential, but there are three issues at the current stage that must be addressed and resolved...|$|R

40|$|In {{continuation}} of the preceeding report the present paper deals with the method of 	"Pre-heating and Quenching" of crepe marocain. 	The samples that were specially prepared were pre-heated respectively at 110 °， 120 ° 	and 130 ℃ for various minutes， (1 ， 1. 5 ， 2 ， 2. 5 ， and 3 minutes，) and was quenched into 	the resin solution immediately after each pre-heating. The shrinkage of the cloth 	which attended on dipping was simultaneously measured， and which {{proved to be a}} good 	measure of the penetration of the resin solution into the interstices of the fiber. The 	samples were then cured at 130 ℃ for 10 minutes after intervened drying. 	The samples were then tested by running crease tester under 500 g and 2000 g loads， 	and the resin contents and the mode of distribution was studied. 	The optimum temperature of "Pre-heating" was found to be 120 ℃， and the time of 	heating 1. 5 minutes， folIowed by the dipping for 10 minutes in order to assure a good 	result. 	The dipping duration of an ordinary padding or mangling， usually within 60 seconds 	at best， was obviously suspected to be too short for such fabrics from the shrinkage 	curves obtained; and it was actually found that even 2 minutes' dipping was insufficient， 	causing the resin to deposit {{on the surface of the}} fibers and/or yarns， and accordingly 	giving an exceedingly poor <b>crease</b> <b>recovery</b> for the heavier load， a 1 though it showed a 	pretty high crease resistance for the lighter load.

40|$|In this study, a novel {{functionalization}} {{approach has}} been addressed by using sodium alginate (Na-Alg) assisted green silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on traditional “Rajshahi silk” fabric via an exhaustive method. The synthesized nanoparticles and coated silk fabrics were characterized by different techniques, including ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis spectra), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), which demonstrated that AgNPs with an average size of 6 – 10 nm were consistently deposited in the fabric surface under optimized conditions (i. e., pH 4, temperature 40 °C, and time 40 min). The silk fabrics treated with AgNPs showed improved colorimetric values and color fastness properties. Moreover, the UV-protection ability and antibacterial activity, {{as well as other}} physical properties—including tensile properties, the <b>crease</b> <b>recovery</b> angle, bending behavior, the yellowness index, and wettability (surface contact angle) of the AgNPs-coated silk were distinctly augmented. Therefore, green AgNPs-coated traditional silk with multifunctional properties has high potential in the textile industry...|$|E
