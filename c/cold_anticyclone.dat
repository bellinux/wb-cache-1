5000|$|The {{climate of}} the area is {{affected}} by easterly-moving cyclonic depressions of the Southern Ocean. These depressions make the weather relatively mild; bring strong northerly winds and a heavy cloud cover to the region. The climate is also characterized by continental north to northwesterly flow of <b>cold</b> <b>anticyclone</b> air from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This flow brings clear, cold and stable conditions, relatively light winds from the south, and negative temperatures. The mean summer temperature recorded in the early 1970s was estimated as just below 0°C (32°F). The mean annual temperature was estimated at around -9°C (16°F) {{in the same time}} period. There is also a little snow falling in summer. The area is mostly free of snow by the end of summer.|$|E

With the NCEP reanalysis {{data and}} L-band radar data {{to analyze the}} {{circulation}} situation and the vertical structure of temperature, humidity and wind speed of radiation fog and rainy fog in Chongqing by compositely analysis method. The result shows that: When radiation fog takes place, the 500 hPa areas of Central Asia and Qinghai-Tibet plateau become high pressure ridge, and the cold front have reached the South China. When rainy fog takes place, the 500 hPa area of Qinghai-Tibet plateau {{is controlled by the}} low pressure trough and the center of ground <b>cold</b> <b>anticyclone</b> will be in the northern area of China. Temperature inversion in the surface layer is obviously stronger when it’s radiation fog than rainy fog; And the moisture vertical structure are reflected as being dry in the upper layer, being moist in the lower layer when radiation fog occurs, and the moisture layer being deep and thick when rainy fog takes place. However in regard to wind speed, it’s slow in the surface layer during the formation of each fog. ...|$|E
40|$|Surface observations, lake {{evaporation}} {{data and}} upper-air soundings {{were collected in}} a special data-collection effort during the months of August and September of 2004 and 2005 on {{an island in the}} middle of Great Bear Lake, Northwest Territories. For this period of the year, the late summer, when increasing variability in surface pressure starts occurring, the effect of different synoptic-scale regimes on the lake-atmosphere interface is investigated to understand the regional specificities, with comparisons to nearby stations and a high spatial and temporal resolution reanalysis model (North American Regional Reanalysis). The planetary boundary layer over the lake systematically shows typical surface and mixed layer structures but with varying depths depending on the mean lower tropospheric temperature. Inversions in the surface layer, linked with warm regimes, support deep mixed layers. Within the surface layer, during warm regimes, a superadiabatic lapse rate can support (or not) a higher-stability sublayer on top of it, in which case the mixed layer happens to be much deeper. The first mechanism for lake evaporation includes the occasional passage of synoptic-scale storm systems with both warm and cold frontal features creating strong, short-lived latent heat interactions between the lake and the atmosphere, but relatively low total amounts of evaporation. The main mechanism for extensive evaporation is a <b>cold</b> <b>anticyclone</b> allowing for significant daytime insolation. A lake-breeze circulation can then develop and provide strong-enough mesoscale winds for diurnal upward latent heat exchanges, with wind channelling into Keith Arm of the lake for strong lake-breeze onshore winds...|$|E

40|$|Through of {{the three}} case studies, the effects and causes of the {{exchange}} of air masses between tropics and extratropics, were analyzed on some detail. The November 29, 1996 case showed that the Chaco Low favored the entrance of tropical air to higher latitudes, helping to increment the atmospheric instability which was later released by {{the passage of a}} frontal system. The June 30, 1996 event indicated that the freezing conditions in southern and southeastern Brazil were associated with the advance of a <b>cold</b> core <b>anticyclone</b> that moved rapidly to the north forced by a baroclinic wave of large amplitude and helped by the channeling effect of the Andes. Finally, incursions of frontal systems that reach subtropical latitudes in summer increment the convergence (divergence) in the lower (upper) levels on the region where SACZ is located. That was the case related to the storms and flooding in Ouro Preto, Brazil at the beginning of 1997. Pages:...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{mean values}} of heights and {{temperatures}} at the selected pressure surfaces are computed, using the aerological data obtained during the 4 th (1960) and the 5 th (1961) wintering observations at the Syowa Base, Antarctica. Main {{characteristics of the}} seasonal and yearly variations both in the antarctic troposphere and the stratosphere are investigated by means of these limited data. Four vertical time sections (from the surface to 30 mb) of Feb. May. Aug. Oct. -Nov., representing each season respectively, are made based on these data, and some notable features of seasonal circulation patterns in 1961 over the Syowa Base are briefly described. In addition, in supplementing this single station data analysis, IAAC 2 ̆ 7 s synoptic weather charts in microfilm are used to locate relative pressure systems, {{and at the same}} time, for rough estimation of circulation intensity, meridional temperature gradients between the Syowa Base and Marion Island in the middle latitude, together with difference in their annual variations, are utilized. Characteristics of the seasonal circulations in 1961 are summarized as follows : Summer : In the troposphere, weak anticyclonic systems predominate over the east continent and weak circulations of E-ly with slightly N and S components are seen. However, in the location and movement of these systems, W-ly wind circulation is also seen. Cyclonic activities are such that most of lows move on toward the east within the low pressure belt off the base, and, except at the surface, N or NE-ly winds by these systems are very weak in the upper layer, so there was little influence to the air over the base. For the layer from the lower to middle stratosphere, weak W-ly wind generally prevails but variation of the wind direction is also seen upon appearance of anabatic and katabatic fields. In the upper stratosphere, weak E-ly wind with N component can be seen. Autumn : For the layer from the middle troposphere to the lower stratosphere, S or SW-ly strong jets come to be observed due to the sharp southward extension of the middle latitude ridge which brings about a temperature rise in the air over the base. At the same time, in the lower layer near the surface, a shallow cold film of the polar anticyclone is formed and weak surface inversion develops up to about 500 m; subsequently weak anticyclonic circulation at the surface is maintained. On the other hand, cyclonic activities are intensified from the middle autumn and replacement of the air masses becomes more active. In case a moderate cyclone approaches, a strong NE-ly wind circulation is observed throughout the troposphere. In the upper stratosphere, with advancement of cooling process, a strong W-ly jet predominates following the formation of the polar vortex. Winter : Near the surface, weak SE-ly circulation predominates due to the control of the polar <b>cold</b> <b>anticyclone</b> with moderate surface inversion. In the polar night period, weak circulation of nearly E-ly wind prevails generally for the most part of the troposphere, but even in this period, the base region is attacked by an intensive cyclone of winter. Cyclone activities with strong NE-ly wind are further intensified especially in early and late winter. In some cases this NE-ly wind may persist for several days afterward, with a gradual decrease in its speed only, due to stagnation and filling of the low in the north of the base. There is also found a much more intensified influence of sharp ridge extension southward from the middle latitude anticyclone than autumn, and stronger SW-ly with circulation with a temperature rise is observed. Such an alternative appearance of the NE-ly and SW-ly wind circulation verifies that the antarctic atmosphere is markedly baroclinic in winter time. In the stratosphere, as the polar night cold vortex {{is in the midst of}} maximum development, strong W-ly jet more than 100 knots prevails continuously. Spring : Rapid spring-time stratospheric warming which begins with the uppermost layer is found for the period from late October to early November, followed by weakening of the circulation. The NE-ly wind by various-scaled cyclonic turbulence of short period nature is seen in the troposphere. On the other hand, strong SW-ly wind caused by the pressure pattern similar to those in autumn and winter also appears in both the troposphere and the stratosphere. Active replacement of the air masses takes place throughout the whole atmosphere, which is in process of a rapid transition into summer season...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Five typical north Adriatic bora storms are {{presented}} {{from the period}} 1957 - 1986. lt is shown that severe bora {{is caused by a}} very cold air outbreak in a deep upper tropospheric trough which usually develops into a cut-off low in the Mediterranean. This process is often accompanied by a cut-off high in the norheastern Atlantic. Such a blocking type circulation prevents the warmer air from the Atlantic to invade the European continent which is occupied by a broad <b>cold</b> surface <b>anticyclone.</b> The latter builds up a large pressure gradient toward the Mediterranean cyclone which is particularly strong at the northern Adriatic coast. This pressure difference is calculated from the mountain drag according to Smith 2 ̆ 7 s (1985) hydraulic model and the results are mainly in good agreement with the observations. Fast upper level development causes changes in the wind direction above the bora layer. Strongest bora occurs with the reversed upper air flow regardless of the wind intensity, whereas bora ceases under strong unidirectional (NE) current, unless there is a strong temperature inversion in the lower troposphere...|$|R

One {{of these cases}} is discussed in detail to illustrate the common synoptic patterns associated with these rare occurrences. Since 1895, {{there have been only}} seven snowfall events in Tallahassee when measurable snowfall (i. e., accumulations of 0. 1 inches or more) were reported. Most of these occurred in February. These snow events shared several common characteristics: (1) long wave ridging over the western Continental United States, (2) a deep trough and/or polar vortex over the Great Lakes, northeast United States, or southeast Canada, (3) a 500 -mb short wave trough propagating eastward from the southwest United States across the Gulf Coast, (4) freezing temperatures over Tallahassee and a trough oriented northeast to southwest at the 850 -mb level, (5) a <b>cold</b> surface <b>anticyclone</b> over much of the United States, (6) a weak wave of low pressure propagating eastward along a quasi-stationary surface front over the southern Gulf of Mexico, and (7) a classic snow sounding with freezing temperatures throughout most of the troposphere...|$|R
40|$|A midlatitude {{mesoscale}} convective complex (MCC), {{which occurred}} over the central United States on 23 – 24 June 1985, was simulated using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS). The multiply nested-grid simulation agreed reasonably well with surface, upper-air, and satellite observations and ground-based radar plots. The simulated MCC had a typical structure consisting of a leading line of vigorous convection and a trailing region of less intense stratiform rainfall. Several other characteristic MCC circulations were also sim-ulated: a divergent cold pool in the lower troposphere, midlevel convergence coupled with a relatively cool descending rear-inflow jet, and relatively warm updraft structure, and a <b>cold</b> divergent <b>anticyclone</b> in the tro-popause region. Early in the MCC simulation, a mesoscale convectively induced vortex (MCV) formed on {{the eastern edge of}} the convective line. While frequently associated with MCCs and other mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), MCVs are more typically reported in the mature and decaying stages of the life cycle. Several hours later, a second MCV formed near the opposite end of the convective line, and by the mature phase of the MCC, these MCVs were embedded within a more complex system-wide vortical flow in the lower troposphere. Analysis of the first MCV during its incipient phase indicates that the vortex initially formed near the surface by convergence/stretching of the large low-level ambient vertical vorticity in this region.

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved southeastward from the East Coast of the United States on December 23, 1954, and passed over Bermuda two days later. A strong {{anticyclone}} developed behind the cold front, and on December 26 a trough extended southward from the <b>cold</b> front. The <b>anticyclone</b> moved southeastward as the trough and cold front moved eastward. The trough gradually decelerated as high pressures altered {{the upper level}} flow to that of an easterly flow. Convection increased over the trough as it moved over relatively warm waters, about 1 °C above normal, and began undergoing tropical cyclogenesis after a circulation began to develop along the northern portion of the trough. The system continued to organize as it moved to the west, and based on three ship reports confirming a closed circulation, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression on December 31 while located 770miles (1245km) east-northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles.|$|R
40|$|Inactive ice wedges {{are still}} present today at Yituli'he {{in the middle}} Da Xing'anling (Greater Hinggan) Mountains in northeastern China, which is the southernmost known site (50 ° 37 ′N) with ice wedges in the Northern Hemisphere. However, it is {{uncertain}} whether the ice-wedge isotope composition, characterized by low δ 18 O, δD and low deuterium excess values, {{is representative of the}} isotope signature of a broader region. In this paper, the ice-wedge isotope compositions were examined {{in the context of the}} stable isotopes of precipitation from the nearby Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) stations. In addition, the pollen spectra from the host sediments were analysed to provide additional information on local vegetation in order to better understand the climate conditions favouring ice-wedge formation. The pollen spectra suggest that the Yituli'he ice wedges developed during the colder and wetter period after 6000 cal. a BP. The isotopes in the Yituli'he ice wedges are consistent with the isotope background recorded in atmospheric precipitation collected at the nearby GNIP stations. When the snow-melt froze into ice veinlets, the isotope signals did not change substantially because of the strong, <b>cold,</b> continental <b>anticyclones</b> in winter as well as a strong temperature inversion that prevail in the Da Xing'anling Mountains. As the climate pattern did not change substantially, the neoglacial cold period is unlikely to have allowed for strong secondary fractionation of isotope records during ice-wedge formation. Thus, the annual isotope signature can be interpreted as a valid archive of climate data...|$|R
40|$|The terral de Vicua is a {{warm and}} dry wind that flows down the Elqui Valley in north-central Chile {{typically}} at dawn and early morning. Given that most terral episodes occur in austral winter when chill accumulation by deciduous fruit trees proceeds, negative effects on agriculture may be expected. During 11 (2004 - 14) winters a meteorological characterization of terral winds and the assessment of their impact on chill accumulation, by the modified Utah Model and the Dynamic Model, were performed. Within this period, 67 terral days (TD) were identified as those in which nighttime to early morning wind direction and speed, air temperature, and relative humidity reached defined thresholds on an hourly basis (terral hours). Most frequent TD featured 6 - 9 consecutive terral hours; duration is considered here {{as a proxy for}} their intensity. Synoptic-scale meteorological analysis shows that 65 % of moderate and strong terral events develop as a <b>cold,</b> migratory <b>anticyclone</b> drifts poleward of the study area, coinciding with the onset of a midtropospheric ridge over central Chile, bringing southwest winds on top of the Andes (approximately 500 -hPa level). The remaining 35 % are either associated with 500 -hPa easterlies (foehn like), with prefrontal conditions ahead of a trough driving northwest 500 -hPa winds, or with transitional 500 -hPa westerlies. Assessments of chill accumulation during TD show that, although present average and cold winter conditions do not represent a major TD hazard to local agriculture, lower chill accumulation associated with anomalously high nocturnal temperatures could be significantly more important during present and future warmer winters...|$|R

The synoptic patterns are generated by applying the self-organizing map weather classification method to the daily National Centers for Environmental Protection mean sea level pressure records from the North American Regional Reanalysis. It reveals that the large-scale synoptic circulations can strongly influence the regional cloud formation, and thereby have impact on the consistency of cloud retrievals from the radiosonde and ground-based cloud product. The total cloud cover at the SGP site {{is characterized by the}} least in AC and the most in CF. The minimum and maximum differences between the two cloud methods are 10. 3 % for CC and 13. 3 % for WP. Compared to the synoptic patterns characterized by scattered cloudy and clear skies (AE and AC), the agreement of collocated cloud boundaries between the two cloud approaches tends to be better under the synoptic patterns dominated by overcast and cloudy skies (CC, WP and CB). The rainy and windy weather conditions in CF synoptic pattern influence the consistency of the two cloud retrieval methods associated with the limited capabilities inherent to the instruments. The cloud thickness distribution from the two cloud datasets compares favorably with each other in all synoptic patterns, with relative discrepancy of ≤ 0. 3 km...|$|R
40|$|In this PhD Thesis {{the main}} types of the {{atmospheric}} circulation {{evolution in the}} lower and middle troposphere are being defined, that favor 5 kinds of extreme weather episodes in Greece (warm episodes, cold episodes, episodes of extreme rainfall, snowfall episodes and fog episodes). For this purpose two data sets are used a) daily values of meteorological parameters at 16 meteorological stations in Greece, for the period 1 / 9 / 1957 to 31 / 8 / 2002. b) values of meteorological parameters describing the atmospheric circulation in the lower and middle troposphere in Europe and the Mediterranean one day before the initiation, {{the day of the}} initiation and one day {{after the end of the}} episodes. For each of the 5 kinds of episodes, from the first data set the episodes dates are located. On the second data set a methodology scheme is applied that comprises of the multivariate methods of Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis in order to define the main types of the atmospheric circulation, favoring each kind of episodes. For the warm episodes, the cold episodes, the extreme rain episodes, the snow episodes and the fog episodes, 7, 6, 16, 13 and 10 main types of the atmospheric circulation are defined, respectively. The main cause of warm episodes in Greece is the anticyclonic circulation over Greece, due to the expansion of the Azores <b>Anticyclone.</b> <b>Cold</b> episodes are favored by the combination of an anticyclone in Europe and cyclonic circulation in the eastern Mediterranean. The main cause of extreme rain episodes is a depression in the Mediterranean and a trough in the 500 hPa level west of Greece. Snow episodes are favored mainly by the combination of anticyclonic circulation in Europe and a deep depression in the Mediterranean, which contribute to the advection of cold air masses and to an intense baroclinicity over Greece. The formation of radiation fogs is being favored by anticyclonic circulation and a constant pressure value over Greece. A weak southerly flow of humid air masses can cause advection fogs mainly in the coastal regions and in the islands. ...|$|R
