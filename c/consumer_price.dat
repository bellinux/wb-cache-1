5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.

5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and the neck of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the role of prices in determining demand for roasted coffee in Sweden. This is of interest because many believe that <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> are high relative to green coffee-bean prices, and that lower <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> would increase demand for coffee beans. Coffee demand is estimated on data for the period 1968 - 2002. In the long run, changing preferences appear to determine demand for roasted coffee, and a reduction in <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> would only have a temporary impact on consumption. Hence a permanent decrease in <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> would only increase exports of coffee beans to Sweden for a couple of years.

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the effect of exchange rate changes on <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> in Nigeria using recursive vector autoregression (VAR) model. It uses data from first quarter 2000 to fourth quarter 2013. The results of the investigation show that exchange rate fluctuation has a positive and insignificant effect on <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> and the increase in <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> are mainly due to its own shocks and the increase in money supply in the long run. A stable monetary policy with a low inflationary environment will lessen the pressure of exchange rate changes on <b>consumer</b> <b>prices.</b> So, the Central Bank of Nigeria should be less concern with the inflation impact of exchange rate shocks and focus fully on other objectives such as growth and export competitiveness in designing exchange rate policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the exchange rate}} pass-through (ERPT) into <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> for 12 EA countries within a CVAR framework. Using the Johansen cointegration procedure, results indicate the existence of one cointegrating vectors at least for each EA country of our sample. When measuring the long-run effect of exchange rate changes on <b>consumer</b> <b>prices,</b> we found a wide dispersion of ERPT elasticities, especially between “peripheral” and “core EA” economies. For instance, <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> rise by 84 % in Portugal following one percent depreciation of exchange rate, while for the German economy the extent of pass-through is not exceeding 0. 20 %. Besides, the loading factors point out a very slow adjustment of <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> towards their long-run equilibrium across EA countries. This would explain the weakness of ERPT estimates in the short-run. ...|$|R
25|$|A {{shift in}} {{preferences}} at the microeconomic level, {{caused by an}} income effect can change the make-up of the <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> index to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the <b>consumer</b> <b>price</b> index, and might make the non-trade sector look relatively less productive {{than it had been}} when demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows diminishing returns to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of price stickiness {{remains one of}} the most important in macroeconomics, as price flexibility partly determines how long it takes for inflation and real economic variables to return to their potential levels after a shock. To get a better understanding of price change frequency and size, the empirical work on price stickiness based on microdata from surveys on prices of individual products from individual outlets is needed. The main goal of this study is to provide descriptive evidence on the degree of nominal rigidity of <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> in Latvia at aggregate and disaggregate levels. To achieve this goal, we use the micro database on <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> provided by the CSB. The main finding of the paper is that during 2003 – 2009 Latvia's <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> were flexible.

40|$|World {{coffee bean}} prices have shown large {{fluctuations}} {{during the past}} years, whereas <b>consumer</b> <b>prices</b> for roasted coffee have varied considerably less. In this paper, the authors seek to explain the weak relationship between coffee bean and <b>consumer</b> <b>prices.</b> The authors adopt and estimate an aggregate model of oligopolistic interaction. It is shown that the relatively large share of costs other than bean costs accounts for {{the most important part}} of the weak relationship between bean and <b>consumer</b> <b>prices.</b> The remaining part follows from markup absorption, but is less important since oligopolistic interdependence is relatively competitive. The estimates are used to simulate the model under alternative behavioral assumptions: duopoly and monopoly.
