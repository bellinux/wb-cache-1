40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis presents {{an investigation into the}} various alternative sources of oil for biodiesel production that are considered not to compete with sources of oil for food. <b>Croton</b> megalocarpus <b>seeds,</b> an oil seed from a tree commonly found in eastern Africa has been selected for this study. Currently, Croton megalocarpus tree is used for timber and building poles and as barriers among farmlands. The tree is large and grows to about 30 to 40 m high and the seeds produced oil (30 - 35 %) but are not consumed because of its cathartic property. The tree grows on marginal lands where no agronomic practices are required. It also serves as a mulching tree that helps to restore the forest vegetation. Field work was undertaken to Kenya for this study. The <b>Croton</b> megalocarpus <b>seeds</b> were studied for their physical and mechanical properties. The size, shape, surface area, angle of repose, coefficient of friction, moisture content and the compression behaviour of the seeds were studied and reported on. The oil from <b>Croton</b> <b>seeds</b> was studied and reported upon for its properties and constituents such as density, gross calorific value, ash content, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen at the fuel oil bunker and analysis services (FOBAS), Llyods Register London. The oil was converted to biodiesel following the method outlined in BS 14105 method. The Croton oil was found to have a calorific value of 40, 280 kJlkg. The biodiesel properties were analysed on a GC machine to find out the compositions of its methyl ester. The biodiesel was then tested according to BS 8186 -C on a Perkins D 3142, 3 cylinder, 4 stroke, DI marine engine to determine the performance and exhaust emissions as compared to a no 2 diesel. The performance of the biodiesel {{has been found to be}} comparable to the normal hydrocarbon diesel and the exhaust emissions has shown a significant drop in the regulated exhaust gases (CO, PM, Smoke, HC), with a slight increment in the exhaust of NO x at some speed and load range. The results of the research presented the Croton properties that lead to a conclusion that Croton oil is a viable and alternative source of biodiesel. Recommendations were made as to ways of improving the oil yields and better agronomic practices to shorten the maturity period of the tree.

50|$|Croton trees play an {{important}} role in local ecosystems for shade, wind protection, and soil conservation. The wood from the trees makes good fuelwood and charcoal. The wood is also known for its termite resistance and is used for fence posts and poles in construction. Given their high nitrogen content, the leaves are often used for mulch. Traditional medical uses for croton include the bark, seeds, roots and leaves being used for medicinal purposes such as stomach ailments, malaria, wound clotting, and pneumonia. Recently, croton nuts are being used as a commercial product in local communities in East Africa. Previously a wasted resource, croton has been promoted as a local, more sustainable avenue to biofuel production in place of failed jatropha projects. The nut itself has multiple uses but most well-known is the oil, used to make biofuel or biodiesel. <b>Croton</b> <b>seeds</b> contain approximately 30% oil and a high protein content of 30%. Byproducts from the oil include croton seedcake that can be used in animal feeds due its high protein content. The husks of the nut are processed into fertilizer or as a biomass.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the molluscicidal activities of different solvent extracts of two (spaceing) Eritrean local plants, Croton macrostachyus and Cissus quadrangularis identified using ethno-botanical, pharmacological information and also traditional use gathered from traditional healers. Methods: Various solvent extract concentrations of leaves of Croton macrostachyus and Cissus quadrangularis leaves and seeds were tested for their molluscicidal activity against adult Biomphalaria species, the intermediate host of S. mansoni and Bulinus species, the intermediate host of S. haematobium and S. intercalates. The LC 50 and LC 90 were determined at 24 hours of exposure. Comparison of molluscicidal activity of the different solvent extracts within and among the plants was also done. The effect {{of the increase in}} exposure time (36 and 48 hrs) on molluscicidal activity of the plants with respect to each solvent extract was then assessed. Results and Discussion: Screening test results indicated that a significant molluscicidal activity ranging from 15. 558 ppm to 289. 689 ppm was found. Comparison of the solvent extracts also revealed that a significant difference was shown in all the three plant materials, with p-value less than 0. 05. Half (50 %) of the plant extracts were found to have a significant difference in their molluscicidal activity upon increase in exposure time (p< 0. 05). In general, comparison of the plant material extracts showed that <b>Croton</b> marostachyus <b>seed</b> has the highest molluscicidal activity. Conculision: From the observations, it is concluded that plants, <b>Croton</b> macrostachyus leaf, <b>seed</b> and Cissus quadrangularis leaf were found to have molluscicidal effect against Bulinus species and Biomphalaria species of snails. Crude extracts of these plants caused death of the snails at varying concentrations. The best results in terms of toxicity to the intermediate host snail were exhibited by <b>Croton</b> macrostachyus <b>seed,</b> followed by <b>Croton</b> macrostachyus leaf. Prolonging the time of exposure was also found to increase the killing ability on half of the plant extracts...|$|R

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>Croton</b> tiglium <b>seed</b> is {{very effective in}} the eradication {{of most of the}} aquatic fauna except a few species of hard shelled crustaceans such as crabs and prawns which are resistant to even very high concentrations of it. Its toxicity ranged between 0. 4 and 2. 2 p. p. m. for different species of fishes. Application of homogenized C. tiglium seed at the rate of 10 kg/ha (0. 5 m depth) is found effective for the eradication of aquatic pests and predators of fish farms. While its toxicity lasts for 5 - 8 days in still water ponds, it is only for 1 - 3 days in tidal ponds with frequent replenishment of water. This method is thus most useful for the initial preparation of the ponds for pisciculture...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} dietary Sesamum indicum (beniseed) and <b>Croton</b> zambesicus <b>seed</b> powder on growth and {{reproductive}} indices of female catfish, Clarias gariepinus broodstocks were investigated in two experiments.

40|$|Unani {{system of}} {{medicine}} offers {{a very effective}} treatment for skin diseases and its appendages. <b>Croton</b> tiglum (<b>seeds)</b> and Zingiber officianalis (extract of rhizome) has been used locally in equal ratio {{in the form of}} paste since thousands of years in treatment of Safa (Alopecia Areata). Modern researches have proved the presence of crotonol in Croton tiglum, as a potent irritant. Phytochemical screening of ethanolic and methanolic plant extract of Zingiber officianalis showed the presence of an alkaloid, phlobotannins, flavanoids, glycosides, saponins, tannin and terpenoids and absence of steroids. Alopecia areata is a type of non scaring alopecia that affects males and females equally and occurs in both children and adults. The disease may progress from limited patchy hair loss to loss of all scalp hair (Alopecia totalis) or all body hair (Alopecia universalis) with significant onychodystrophy. According to Ibn-e-Sina, a legendary Unani physician, the disease can occur in any part of body but scalp, face and eyebrows are the commonest sites. Despite the effective therapeutic regimes currently available for Alopecia in western medicine, there remain many patients who fail to respond adequately or develop side effects.

40|$|Objective: <b>Croton</b> tiglium <b>seeds,</b> {{known as}} Jamālgoṭa in Hindi, Marathi, and Urdu is {{well-known}} for its toxicity (severe purgative action). In Ayurvedic texts, {{the plant is}} known as Kumbhinî 0 and {{is used for the}} treatment of constipation after Śodhana (detoxification process) of the seeds with Godugdha (cow milk). Material and Methods: In the present study, C. tiglium seeds were purified with cow milk as reported in Ayurvedic classics. Phorbol esters equivalent to phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate (PMA) and crotonic acid contents were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography method in the seeds of C. tiglium before and after the purification process. Results: The content of the phorbol ester equivalent to PMA in unpurified and purified sample was found to be 5. 2 mg/ 100 g and 1. 8 mg/ 100 g of dried seeds of C. tiglium, respectively. The quantity of crotonic acid in unpurified seeds of C. tiglium was found to be 0. 102 mg/ 100 g of dried seeds while it was absent in the purified seed extract of C. tiglium. Conclusion: The toxicity of C. tiglium seeds {{may be due to the}} presence of phorbol esters and crotonic acid along with other constituents. These constituents are oil soluble and may be removed by cow milk during the process of Śodhana. Reduction in the level of these constituents after the purification decreases the toxicity of C. tiglium seeds. Reduction in the oily content from the seeds of C. tiglium during the purification process is also supported by the results obtained from the physiochemical parameters...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite current {{advances}} in diagnostics and medicines, {{the incidence of}} lung cancer is increasing and effective treatment is very challenging. Traditional herbal formulae {{as well as many}} herbal plant extracts have been recognized as attractive sources for novel multi-targeted therapy of cancer with minimal side effects. Methods: The ethanol extract of Kilkyung-baeksan (EE-KKBS) and its component herbs were tested for their ability to inhibit cancer growth in several lung cancer cell lines. The effects of EE-KKBS and ethanol extract of <b>Croton</b> tiglium Linné <b>seed</b> (EE-CT) on cell cycle progression were measured by flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide staining. Western blot analyses were performed to measure the expression profiles of proteins regulating cell cycle checkpoints. Results: EE-KKBS inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells after 24 – 72  hours treatment. Lung cancer cells treated with either EE-KKBS or EE-CT showed strong G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest. The expressions of p 21 and p 27, two key regulators of G 1 cell cycle checkpoint, were significantly upregulated upon treatment with EE-KKBS and EE-CT. Conclusion: EE-KKBS exerted its cytostatic activity through regulating G 1 cell cycle checkpoint in lung cancer cells, and this activity is mainly mediated by one of its component herbs, <b>seeds</b> of <b>Croton</b> tiglium. Collectively, our data suggest that EE-KKBS could be a novel candidate for adjuvant therapy for lung cancer...|$|R
