50|$|Oyster {{harnesses}} {{the energy}} of near-shore ocean waves; {{it was designed to}} operate in water 10 to 12 metres deep. The Oyster is made up of a Power Connector Frame (PCF) and a Power <b>Capture</b> <b>Unit</b> (PCU). The 36-ton PCF is bolted to the seabed by 1-by-4 meter concrete piles that are drilled 14 metres deep into the seabed. The PCF requires careful and accurate positioning and leveling to compensate for the uneven, rocky seabed. The PCU is a 200-ton, 18-by-12-by-4 metre buoyant flap that is hinged to the PCF. In order to lower the PCU into the water to hinge it to the PCF, 120 tons of seawater must be pumped into ballast tanks within the PCU to provide sufficient negative buoyancy to aid its descent into the water. The PCU is almost entirely submerged underwater; only 2 metres of the device poke above the water. The PCU sways back and forth with the movement of the waves, and this movement of the flap drives two hydraulic pistons that pump high-pressured water through three sub-sea pipeline to an onshore hydro-electric water turbine. The turbine then drives a 315 kW electrical generator, which converts the wave energy into electricity.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an {{important}} part of a carbon-constrained energy scenario to reduce global emissions. Most of the present works in literature related to CO 2 capture assumes exhaust stream from power plants, as they represent large CO 2 volume sources, and consider steady flow of exhaust stream to the capture units. However, the feed stream to the CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> from these sources will typically vary over time. As these fluctuations in the exhaust gas profile lead to lower utilization rate of the <b>capture</b> <b>unit,</b> building the CO 2 capture plant for a full capture might not be optimal. Therefore this work evaluates the optimum CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> capacity taking into consideration the trade-off between the cost of capturing CO 2 and paying the emissions cost (q uota or tax) for given fluctuating exhaust gas profiles. Costs functions of an amine-based post combustion <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> for a coal power plant exhaust gas are modelled to represent the cost of capturing CO 2. A Mixed Integer Lin ear program is formulated and implemented in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) to calculate the econ omic optimum CO 2 capture plant capacity. The model when applied to a typical fluctuating exh ust gas profile show results indicating significant economic gains in optimizing the installed CO 2 capture capacity. Therefore, in addition to significantly decreasing the cost of CCS on power plants, being able to forecast the fluctuating lo ad on the CO 2 <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> can also avoid investment delays compared to cases in which only full capacity capture is considered...|$|E

40|$|In the Paris Agreement in 2015, it {{was stated}} that the {{temperature}} increase should be kept well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. As {{a response to the}} Paris Agreement, the Swedish government in February 2017 presented a climate reform to make Sweden CO 2 neutral by 2045, and even CO 2 negative beyond 2045. This requires extensive actions. One of the most required technical solutions is carbon capture and storage (CCS). One way of implementing CCS in a cost-efficient manner is in form of partial CO 2 capture, where {{only a fraction of the}} emissions are captured. An important aspect of the Swedish energy system is the extensive use of waste incineration in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. This work evaluates the possibilities of making the Swedish waste fired CHP plants CO 2 neutral by applying partial capture in order to capture the fossil share of the CO 2 emissions. This work investigates the implementation of carbon capture through a post-combustion absorption process with monoethanolamine (MEA) as absorbent. Two design alternatives are evaluated for partial CO 2 capture, based on either a high absorption rate for a fraction of the flue gas flow, or a low absorption rate for 100 % of the flue gas flow. The two designs are evaluated for a generic CHP plant, based on the average size of a Swedish waste fired CHP plant. Also, a specific case of Lillesjöverket is analyzed. Since seasonal variations in the heat load occur, both a constant annual operation and a seasonally optimized operation are considered for the design of the partial <b>capture</b> <b>unit.</b> The results show that the generic plant, which have fossil CO 2 emissions of 64 200 ton per year, have a specific cost of 94 - 98 EUR/ton CO 2 for a constant annual operation of the <b>capture</b> <b>unit,</b> but that the specific cost may be decreased to 86 EUR/ton CO 2 if a seasonal operation is applied. Due to the small size of the <b>capture</b> <b>unit,</b> the capital cost is dominating and stands for more than 80 % of the specific cost. The <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> should, thus, be designed to minimize the capture cost. The effect of implementing carbon capture on the other product streams of the CHP plant is significant, especially for Lillesjöverket that besides heat and electricity also produces pellets. In case waste incineration should be made CO 2 -neutral, the other products have to be prioritized based on price and season in order to maximize the revenue, and it can be concluded that the addition of a <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> requires a system perspective analysis already in the planning and design phase...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrently the {{low carbon}} prices, low Spreads and {{regulatory}} uncertainties hampers the business cases for {{coal-fired power plants}} with post-combustion capture (PCC) in Europe. Improvement of the business case of coal-fired power plants with post combustion capture requires a different approach in terms of operational dispatch {{and in terms of}} investment planning. Both items have been assessed using a comprehensive power plant valuation model developed by TNO. To change the typical base-load production profile of a coal-fired power plant into a more flexible production profile, a Flexible Operating Mechanisms (FOMs) has been developed for PCC. Based on the results of the techno-economic modeling, FOMs improve the business case. Next to this, FOMs present coal fuelled power plants with additional flexibility. This added flexibility could allow coal plants to provide auxiliary services to the grid and remain competitive in relation to cleaner gas-fired plants. The increase of operational flexibility with FOMs created a significant improvement of the NPV value and, therefore, it is justified to look in much more detail how the operational flexibility of a coal-fired power plant with Carbon Capture can be improved. Running a power plant with a 100 % <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> at base load will require significant amount financial support to close the gap. Starting with a smaller <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> reduce the financial risk and could improve the business case of the coal-fired power plant without PCC from a marginal cost point of view. The main reason for this is the increase of flexibility, by switching on/off the <b>capture</b> <b>unit.</b> Next to this, the decision to invest is always affected by the opportunity costs of making a commitment now, and thereby, giving up the option of waiting for improved market condition.

40|$|Coal-fired power {{generation}} with {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) is projected as a cost-effective technology to decarbonize the power sector. Intermittent renewables could reduce its load factor and revenues, so flexible <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> operation strategies (flexible CCS) {{have been suggested}} to increase profits: CO 2 venting and lean- and rich-solvent storage. In this study we quantify the benefits of flexible CCS for both the power plant operator and the total Dutch power system. We use a unit commitment and dispatch model of the northwest European electricity system to simulate the hourly operation of two coal-fired power plants with flexible CCS in 2020 and 2030. We find that flexible <b>capture</b> <b>unit</b> operation hardly affects electricity generation (revenues) because the flexible operation capabilities are not often utilized. CO 2 venting is hardly used due to high CO 2 prices (43 €/tCO 2 in 2020 and 112 €/tCO 2 in 2030). The impact of rich-solvent storage is limited because of regeneration constraints of the base-load power plant. The main benefit of flexible CCS is an increase in reserve capacity provision by the power plant of 20 - 300 % compared to non-flexible operation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
