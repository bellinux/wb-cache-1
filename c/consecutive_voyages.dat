50|$|In 1993 Lunni {{made three}} <b>consecutive</b> <b>voyages</b> from Arkhangelsk to the Yana River in Siberia along the Northern Sea Route. The tanker was {{assisted}} by nuclear-powered icebreakers in the Vilkitsky Strait, but was under constant escort by Russian icebreakers only from Dikson Island to the Khatanga River.|$|E
50|$|The case {{involved}} {{the charter of}} a ship for two yearsâ€™ <b>consecutive</b> <b>voyages</b> between US and Europe. The ship was to be loaded at a specified rate. The owners were to be paid according {{to the number of}} voyages made during the two-year period. If the time taken for loading and unloading was longer than required, the charterers were to pay $1000 per day by way of demurrage. The charterers were taking many extra days in loading and unloading but were allowed to continue to have the use of the ship {{for the remainder of the}} two years. Eight round trips were made. However, the owners alleged that the charterers delay in loading and unloading had made a further six trips impossible and sued for damages. The owners claimed that they were not bound by that clause because the charterers by their extraordinary delays had committed a fundamental breach of the contract.|$|E
