In this study we describe an unusual right-biased asymmetry in the forceps of male earwigs Anisolabis maritima, and investigate the relative importance of forceps asymmetry and curvature in contests between males over food. The ability to dominate contests with other males translated into a tangible benefit, as winning earwigs fed longer on the resource. We found that in contests between large males, small differences in pronotum width were sufficient to influence the outcome of fights, with larger earwigs winning. In contests between small males, individuals with more asymmetric forceps and a more <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> won more fights.

40|$|Before you start, have ready the following:** - Sterilize 2 {{pairs of}} <b>curved</b> <b>forceps,</b> 1 pair of iris {{scissors}} and 2 pairs of fine watchmaker forceps. - 6 ml syringe filled with DMEM with HEPES, with an 18 gauge needle attached. To the needle attach a 20 cm length of clear vinyl tube {{and into the}} end of this tubing insert a sharp flusher. At 2. 5 days p. c. (post coitus) the morulae are present in the oviducts. For this reason, it is only necessary to remove the oviducts from the mouse. ### Method: 1. Kill the 2. 5 day pregnant mouse and lay on its back on benchcloth or absorbent paper. - Swab belly with ethanol (70 %) and nick the skin with a pair of scissors. - Pull the skin back over the head and towards with tail. - Cut and pull back the body wall to expose the contents of the abdomen. - Push aside the guts to expose the reproductive tract. Using a pair of <b>curved</b> <b>forceps,</b> grasp the uterus just below the oviduct and carefully separate the oviduct from the ovary using the iris scissors. - Cut through the uterus just below the uterotubal junction and place the oviduct in a petri dish. - Transfer the dish to the stage of a stereo dissecting microscope. Using the watchmaker forceps, manipulate the oviduct so that you have the end of the oviduct (close as possible to the uterotubal junction) between the forceps and insert the flusher so that it points away from the uterotubal junction. Be careful not to pierce through both sides of the oviduct tube. Keeping the flusher inserted into the oviduct, pick up the syringe in the other hand and give a couple of short, sharp squeezes on the plunger. This should flush all morulae from the oviduct. Sometimes, if no morulae are flushed through, it is hard to tell whether the oviduct has been correctly flushed. If there is much debris floating around, then the oviduct has been properly flushed. The morulae are then collected using a mouth pipette and deposited into a petri dish in microdrops of M 16 medium. These drops are covered with fluid 200 (Dow Corning, viscosity 50 CS) and placed in a 37 °C incubator buffered with 5 % CO 2. ### Recipes: 1.

40|$|Antrochoanal polyp (ACP) is {{a benign}} lesion which {{arises from the}} mucosa of maxillary sinus, fills it and expands through natural ostium towards choana {{protruding}} in the epipharynx. Objective: to present our experience in endoscopic surgery of ACP. Material and methods: prospective study included 24 patients operated at the Institute of Otorinolaryngology and Maxillofacial surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, in the period 2002 - 2004. Subjective symptoms, endoscopic and CT findings were evaluated postoperatively, following up the patients in the period 12 - 20 months. Subjective difficulties of patients were tested by 100 mm-analogue scale, while endoscopic and CT findings were demonstrated by three-stage scale from 0 to 2. Applying the technique of ACP extraction in Trendelenburg’s position and approaching the part which protrudes in the epipharynx, we successfully removed the endonasal part by means of <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> for epipharyngeal biopsy. By endoscopic middle meatotomy, the natural ostium of maxillary sinus was expanded and pathological process from the very sinus was successfully removed. Results: only one female patient had the majority of symptoms after the operation, while all others had no complaints. Endoscopic and CT findings were normal in all patients at the latest control, without any signs of ACP recurrence. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Conclusion: minimal damage to sinus mucosa due to forceps is lesser problem than complications developed upon creating even the miniature opening in the canine fossa. Using this technique, a dexterous surgeon may successfully extract pathological process with minimal incidence of recurrence, and, more important, with no complications and maximally fast recovery of patients. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{organisms that}} live in groups, the spatial {{distribution}} of individuals according to size and sex can provide insight into social interactions, including aggression (intrasexual selection for armaments) and mating preferences (intersexual selection for ornaments). To gain insight into how group dynamics may influence the mating system, we investigated the relationship of density and morphology in the maritime earwig, Anisolabis maritima, an insect found in high densities beneath pieces of driftwood above the high-tide line in coastal ecosystems throughout the world. There are fundamental differences in the behavior and morphology between the sexes. Males and females differ fundamentally in their aggression during agonistic encounters with conspecifics; males more readily cohabitate with conspecifics and resolve their disputes non-lethally whereas females often kill conspecifics in close proximity as they vigorously guard their offspring. Males also differ markedly from females in both body size (males are more variable in size, and sometimes substantially larger, than females) and weaponry (males possess asymmetrical, <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> whereas females have straight forceps). Given previously observed variation in both body size and forceps asymmetry, we investigated the possible correlation between population density and morphology of individuals in two populations on San Juan Island, WA to determine whether these parameters affect group dynamics and social interactions. Specifically, we lifted 10 - 15 logs at two sites (False Bay and Cattle Point) at two different times during the breeding season (June and July) and determined the overall density, average body size and average forceps asymmetry for individuals under each log. Comparing the area occupied to the body size and forceps asymmetry of individuals, {{we found that the}} relationship between body size and population density varied both by site and by the period in the breeding cycle. Additionally, we found a greater, more morphologically diverse population of males at False Bay, a site with lower tidal action and more predictable habitat availability. We posit, therefore, that the breeding cycle varies from site to site based on the stability of the environment, and that a more turbulent environment can disrupt the population and delay the breeding cycle, leading to a less diverse, more unstable population. Our results also suggest that larger individuals are more likely to live in higher densities before the breeding cycle, possibly due to their increased fighting ability and willingness to compete with others for mates, and at lower densities early in the breeding cycle due to their increased conspecific aggression during courtship and nesting. This research lays the foundation for future studies regarding the social dynamics of this species where we can monitor individual interactions and group distributions in a more controlled laboratory setting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract 1 -cell embryo {{transfer}} is best performed after allowing injected embryos a little recovery time in culture. This allows better {{evaluation of the}} cells' survival - {{those that have been}} damaged during the injection process will undergo cytoplasmic condensation, causing the cellular material to become less glossy and darker in color as the cytoplasm shrinks away from the zona pellucida. This should be balanced against the increased survival rate with decreased in vitro exposure. ### The Recipient Careful selection of the recipient is most important as the pups are the end result of a lot of hard work. I personally use Swiss Webster mice, as they are quiet and make excellent mothers, although do become overweight quickly and exhibit bad planes of anesthesia when heavy. This is also a very inexpensive mouse to use. As an alternate, another strain I have used with considerable success is B 6 D 2 F 1. These mice are hardy and display hybrid vigor. ### The Equipment For surgery, I clean (with 70 % alcohol) the following (all Roboz instruments) : 1. 5 pairs of forceps - 1 pair Pattern 3 c - 2 pairs Pattern 55 superfine - 1 pair straight serrated, 3. 5 " - 1 pair curved serrated, 3. 5 " - 1 pair of 3. 5 " sharp / sharp scissors (Surecut) - Autoclip metal wound clipper - 1 serafin clip - 1 mouth pipetter and hand-pulled transfer pipette ### The Anesthetic Avertin (2, 2, 2 tribromoethanol) is found to be quite effective. For method of preparation, see "Manipulating the Mouse Embryo", CSHL Press, ISBN 0 - 87969 - 384 - 3. Store wrapped in tin foil at 4 oC as this reagent is light sensitive. Test after making a new batch. Shake well before use. ### The Transfer 1. Select a mouse that has been plugged by a vasectomized male where the plug has been visualized in the early morning of the injection day. Do not use an mouse that appears lighter than 25 g, as underweight mice tend to re-absorb the embryos as they are not physically ready to support a pregnancy. Overweight mice can make surgery difficult by the absorption of anaesthetic into the fat reducing the potency of the anesthetic; also, the presence of fat means the presence of blood vessels, and cutting through all the extra fat causes a lot of unnecessary bleeding. This makes it difficult to see what you are doing and may also clog up the tip of your transfer pipette. - Anesthetise mouse with Avertin, administered intraperitoneally. After administering the anesthetic, put the mouse back into the cage from which it came. The mouse will be more relaxed when placed in a familiar environment and the anesthetic will act more quickly than it would on a distressed mouse. - To check that the mouse is fully anesthetised, press or squeeze the pads of the feet. If the mouse can feel this it will try to withdraw its leg from your grasp (Pedal reflex). Do not commence surgery until there is no reflex reaction to this test. - Take the anesthetised mouse and lay it on it's belly on a petri dish lid, taking care to keep the airway clear by resting the teeth {{on the edge of the}} petri dish. This makes it easier to move the mouse around without having to actually touch it. Swab the incision area with 70 % ethanol. ### The Surgery 1. Incision site Use the pair of Surecut scissors and one pair of serrated, <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> for cutting the skin. The incision should be made approximately 0. 5 cm away from the midline and between the natural hump of the back and the point where the rear leg joins the abdomen. Using a (lint-free) tissue dampened with 70 % ethanol, carefully wipe the incision site, sweeping away the cut hair. Wipe the scissors with a 70 % ethanol dampened tisue to remove any hair. Grasping one side of the incision at a time, carefully introduce the blades of the scissors (while closed) between the inside of the pelt and the body wall for approximately 1 cm. Open and close the blades to clear the connective tissue in this area. Move the skin around until the nerve (a white line, usually seen with associated capillary) can be seen running across the body wall. The light color of the ovarian fat pad can be seen under the body wall in this area. Using a pair of pattern 3 c forceps, pinch the body wall and nick to give an incision 0. 5 cm across. Reach in with the straight serrated forceps (while holding the body wall with another pair of <b>curved</b> <b>forceps)</b> and grasp the ovarian fat pad, and remove to the exterior where it can be anchored using a serafin clip. - Rest the serafin clip across the mouse's back to hold the uterus in place. If the uterus or uterine horn continually slip back into the cavity it may be necessary to gently lie the mouse on the side being careful not to block the airway. The transfer pipette should now be loaded. A minimum of 12 embryos total must be transferred, any less than this and the chances of a pregnancy resulting are severely reduced. Embryos may be implanted in both oviducts or unilaterally. The transfer pipette can be loaded a number of different ways; the following is one popular method. Take up an amount of Hepes buffered medium in the tip of the transfer pipette, then make a small bubble by taking up a little air. Then take up some more medium - roughly the same volume as the air bubble, then another air bubble, same size as before. Then take up about 2 - 3 cm of buffered media and then a tiny air bubble once more. Take your embryos in the smallest possible volume of medium, lining them up side by side in the transfer pipette. Introduce another tiny air bubble when all the eggs are loaded. Some people use mineral oil instead of or in conjunction with air bubbles for pressure control. This is a perfectly acceptable practice; however care must be taken to avoid introducing mineral oil into the oviducts as this can dramatically reduce litter size by interfering with the ciliary-driven egg transport in this structure, as well as predisposing the animal to uterine infection. - Bursa siteOnce the pipette is loaded and the uterus positioned, move the petri dish lid supporting the mouse to the microscope and turn on the overhead light source. Once the lights and focus have been adjusted and the mouse positioned to suit yourself, use the pattern 55 superfine forceps to gently tear open a small hole in the transparent bursa membrane at the point btween the ovary and oviduct where the infundibulum is located. Take care to avoid rupturing the small capillaries that run across the bursa as these will obscure your view of the infundibulum. You may drop some epinephrine on the ovary / oviduct / bursa before tearing the hole to reduce any bleeding that may occur. Once there is a hole of sufficient size to reach the infundibulum, grasp it at the end with one pair of pattern 55 forceps while inserting one blade of the other set into the tube itself. This will ensure that the mouth of the infundibulum will be open and accessible to your transfer pipette. Introduce the transfer pipette into the infundibulum as far as possible (until the tube's natural curve allows no more forward progress without risk of damage) and expel the eggs into the structure, chasing them with the air bubbles used for pressure regulation. These bubbles will prevent the eggs from flowing backwards easily and drive them forward into the ampulla region of the oviduct. - Wound clip With the transfer complete, the serafin clip can now be removed and the uterus gently eased back into the body. Do not touch the uterus, but ease it back by the edges of the incision in the body wall and allowing the uterus to fall back in, without actually handling it. This procedure is then repeated on the other uterine horn if doing a bilateral transfer. The incision in the body wall is not sutured. The skin is closed with Autoclips - two per incision is usually sufficient. Autoclip wound clips are used on the skin instead of suture as the mice frequently will chew at the suture thread and effectively open their wounds. - Once surgery is complete, the mouse is placed in a box of clean autoclaved sawdust. Under anesthetic, mammals are unable to retain heat as effectively as when conscious. For this reason, the mouse should be wrapped in a tissue to help keep it warm. Use of a heating pad or even indirect heat from a slide warmer can be used to care for the animal post-operatively until it regains conciousness. All animals should have recovered sufficiently from anesthetic before being returned to the animal room and left unattended. Recipient mice should be handled with care as pregnant mice become easily stressed, sometimes leading to abortion, or even cannibalism of pups. If all goes well and a pregnancy results, the pups should be born approximately 19 - 21 days after the transfer, dependent upon strain...|$|E
40|$|Method: Blastocyst {{transfer}} is usually performed 24 hours after aggregation when the morulae have become expanded blastocysts {{and on the}} same day as injection. A little time is given between injection and transfer to allow blastocysts to re-expand. **The Recipient** Careful selection of the recipient is most important as the pups are the end result of a lot of hard work. Two strains of mice are used:RB Swiss and (CBA*C 57 BL 6 /J) f 1. RB Swiss are quiet and make excellent mothers but they become overweight quickly and do exhibit bad planes of anaesthesia. CBA*C 57 mice are hardy and display hybrid vigour. They do not carry excess weight and go under anaesthetic well. This strain can be very nervous when housed separately which could be dangerous to their young. They are most suitable if a young RB Swiss is placed into the cage as a companion which can be removed as soon as the pups are seven days old. By this age destruction of the litter is very unlikely. If the CBA mother is to be housed alone she must not be disturbed for ten days. **Prior to surgery, sterilise the following:** - 3 pairs of <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> - 2 pairs of iris scissors - 1 pair suture clamps - 1 serafin clip - sterile suture with needle attached (small - for mouse surgery) - Michelle clips (small size) - Michelle clip applicators - 1 mouth pipette and flame-polished transfer pipette - You will also need an anaesthetic. Rompun / Ketavet is found to be quite effective. To make up 10 ml: - 0. 5 ml 2 % Rompun (20 mg/ml Xylazine) - 0. 5 ml 100 mg/ml Ketavet 100 - Delta Veterinary Lab, 8 Rosemead Rd Hornsby NSW 2077 - Make up to 10 ml with PBS - The dosage is 0. 02 ml/g body weight - Store wrapped in tin foil at 4 °C. - Shake well before use as it tends to separate in the fridge. **The Transfer** 1. Select a mouse that is 2. 5 days pseudo pregnant and weigh. Do not use anything lighter and 25 g or anything heavier than 30 g. Underweight mice tend to re-absorb the embryos as they are not physically ready to support a pregnancy. Overweight mice make surgery difficult in the absorption of anaesthetic into the fat reduces the potency of the anaesthetic. Also, the presence of fat means the presence of blood vessels, and cutting through all the extra fat causes a lot of unnecessary bleeding. This makes it difficult to see what you are doing and may also clog up the tip of your transfer pipette. - Anaesthetise mouse with Rompun / Ketavet, administered intraperitoneally. After administering the anaesthetic, put the mouse back into the box from which it came. The mouse will be more relaxed when placed in a familiar environment and the anaesthetic will act more quickly than it would on a distressed mouse. - To check that the mouse is fully anaesthetised, press or squeeze the pads of the feet. If the mouse can feel this it will try to withdraw its leg from your grasp. Do not commence surgery until there is no reflex reaction to this test. - Take the anaesthetised mouse and shave its lower back. Lay mouse on belly on a petri dish lid taking care to keep the airway clear by resting the teeth {{on the edge of the}} petri dish. This makes it easier to move the mouse around without having to actually touch it. Swab the shaven area with hibitane or 70 % ethanol. - Instruments should have been laid out. Use one pair of iris scissors and one pair of forceps for cutting the skin - call these "outside" instruments. Use one pair of iris scissors and two pair of forceps for working inside the mouse - called the "inside" instruments. - Using the outside forceps and scissors, make a small cut (about 1 cm long) along the dorsal midline of the lower back. Through the shaven, moistened skin it is fairly easy to see blood vessels. Try to avoid these vessels when making the incision (see below). - Using a pair of outside forceps and inside forceps, pick up the skin and separate skin from the body wall and cut the body wall as indicated about 5 mm long, avoiding blood vessels. - If the cut has been made in the right place, the ovarian fat pad is easily visible. If not, the fat pad can be located by lifting the edge of he body wall and scouting around with the other pair of inside forceps. Once you have located the fat pad attach serafin clip to it, taking care not to clip ovary. It is important not to damage the ovary as it is responsible for hormone production throughout pregnancy. Gently ease the ovary, oviduct and part of the uterus out through the incision in the body wall. DO NOT PULL. A traumatised uterus will contract and move quite violently, making surgery difficult and may cause expulsion of the transferred blastocysts. When the tip of the uterus is visible, rest the serafin clip across the mouse's back to hold the uterus in place. If the uterus or uterine horn continually slip back into the cavity it may be necessary to gently lie the mouse on the side being careful not to block the airway. - The transfer pipette should now be loaded. Five or six embryos must be transferred to each horn, any less than this and the chances of a pregnancy resulting are serverely reduced. It may be loaded to suit yourself but this is a method that is popular. Take up a minute amount of DMEM with Hepes in the very tip of the transfer pipette, then make a small bubble by taking up a little air. Then take up some more medium - roughly the same volume as you hope to transfer the blastocysts in. Take up another bubble, same size as before. Then take up your blastocysts in the smallest possible volume of medium, lining them up side by side in the transfer pipette. This is how your transfer pipette should look when loaded. - This will take some practise. Make sure that you are competent at loading a transfer pipette before any attempt at a blastocysts transfer. During surgery is not the time to learn how to load a pipette. If it is likely to take you more than a few minutes to load the transfer pipette, then do not expose the uterus until the pipette has been loaded. This prevents drying out and further trauma tot he uterus. Alternatively, the uterus, ovary, etc. may be moistened repeatedly with a sterile cotton bud and saline. - Once the pipette is loaded and the uterus positioned, move the petri dish lid supporting the mouse to the microscope and turn on the overhead light source. Once the lights and focus have been adjusted and the mouse positioned to suit yourself, gently grasp the top of the uterine horn with a pair of inside forceps. Whilst still holding the horn with one hand, use the other hand to gently insert a 26 gauge hypodermic needle through the uterine wall (close to the oviduct) and into the lumen. Choose an area of the uterus that is relatively devoid of blood vessels as blood will clot in the tip of your pipette and block it. Remove the needle and carefully (so as not to lose the site of the hole), without averting your eyes, pick up the loaded transfer pipette. Gently insert the transfer pipette about 3 mm into the uterine lumen. Gently blow the blastocysts into the uterus, using the air bubbles in your transfer pipette to monitor the transfer. Be careful not to blow any air into the uterus. Once {{transfer is}} complete, quickly rinse out transfer pipette in some HEPES buffer medium (M 2) and check to see if there were any blastocysts stuck in the transfer pipette. If there were, transfer these blastocysts again. - With the transfer complete, the serafin clip can now be removed and the uterus gently eased back into the body. Do not touch the uterus, but ease it back by the edges of the incision in the body wall and allowing the uterus to fall back in, without actually handling it. This procedure is then repeated on the other uterine horn. The incision in the body wall is not sutured. The skin is closed with Michelle clips - two per incision is usually sufficient. Michelle clips are used on the skin instead of suture as the mice will chew at the suture thread and effectively open their wounds up. - Once surgery is complete, the mouse is placed in a box of clean autoclaved sawdust. Under anaesthetic, mammals are unable to retain heat as effectively as when conscious. For this reason, and also because the animal has been shaven, the mouse should be wrapped in a tissue to help keep it warm. This will also be used as bedding until the fur has grown back. It is also very important that the mouse by house alone as anaesthetised animals are often buried by cage mates who think they are dead. All animals should have recovered sufficiently from anaesthetic before being returned to the animal room and left unattended. The cage should be placed on a shelf away from male mice, as strange male pheromones will often cause females to abort. Recipient mice should be handled with care and tiptoed around as pregnant mice are easily upset, sometimes leading to abortion, or even cannibalism of pups. If all goes well and a pregnancy results, the pups should be born sixteen days after the transfer...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Greenfield Sluder, Joshua J. Nordberg, Frederick J. Miller and Edward H. Hinchcliffe This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “A Sealed Preparation for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells,” Chapter 18, in *Live Cell Imaging* (eds. Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The continuous long-term observation of cultured cells on the microscope {{has always been a}} technically demanding undertaking. This protocol describes a sealed preparation that allows the continuous long-term observation of cultured mammalian cells on upright or inverted microscopes without environmental CO 2 control. The preparation allows for optical conditions consistent with high-quality imaging and good cell viability for at least 100 hours. The preparation is an aluminum support slide with a square aperture cut in its center. The coverslip bearing the cells is attached {{to the top of the}} slide with a thin layer of silicone grease, and the bottom of the slide is similarly covered with a clean coverslip of the same size. The thickness of the slide is intended to coordinately maximize the volume of the medium while maintaining optical properties that allow Koehler illumination with standard condensers. The chamber is filled in equal parts with HEPES-buffered media containing fetal calf serum and a low-viscosity fluorocarbon oil. These oils have a high solubility for atmospheric gases. The inclusion of the oil in the preparations is intended to provide a source of oxygen and perhaps a sink for some of the CO 2 produced by the cells. Although the inclusion of fluorocarbon oil in the preparation may not be necessary for short-term (~ 24 hr) observations, particularly with cells that are sparsely plated, long-term cell viability is ensured when the oil is present. ### RELATED INFORMATION Support slides should be prepared as described in [A Sealed Preparation for Long-Term Observations of Cultured Cells: Details of Support Slide Construction]([URL] ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Cells for analysis - *This protocol has been used extensively for BSC- 1, CV- 1, COS- 7, CHO, mouse embryo fibroblasts, and hTERT RPE 1 cells. The FC 47, FC 40, FC 43, and FC 77 oils (see below) all work well for these cells. Most cells appear viable and have normal interphase morphology at 250 hours. Normally, observations of cells stop after 70 - 120 hours because by that time the cells have become confluent. Over the course of 100 hours, all of the cell types show constant motility, and mitoses continue for the duration of the observations with no noticeable prolongation of the cell cycle at later times. Note, however, that at later times, cells often develop small spherical inclusions that are phase-bright. The identity of these inclusions remains obscure, but they may be large pinocytotic vesicles. In any case, they do not appear to have an adverse impact on cell motility, mitosis, or gross morphology*. - Culture medium - *This protocol uses culture medium appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO (catalog no. 15240 - 062) *. - Ethanol (70 %, 95 %) - Fluorocarbon oil - *The oils we use are manufactured by 3 M Corp. and are part of its Fluorinert series of performance liquids ([3 M Fluorinert product guide, 1997]([URL] These are short (primarily eight-carbon) hydrocarbons that are fully substituted with fluorine. They are extremely inert and immiscible with water, and they do not present any recognized significant health hazards. However, it is recommended that all users consult the Material Safety Data Sheets provided by 3 M Corp. for potential health hazards before using these oils. These oils are available from three manufacturers’ representatives in three-quarter gallon (or 11 pound) amounts. 3 M Corp. does not directly sell anything but truckload quantities of these oils. Small sample quantities are available from Acuity Technical Sales (New Hampshire), AMS Materials (Florida), and Semitorr (Oregon) *. - Vaseline:lanolin:paraffin, melted and combined 1 : 1 : 1 (VALAP) ### Equipment 1. Alcohol burner - Aluminum support slide - Beaker, 1 liter - Controlled-temperature environment - *Since this preparation is sealed, control of environmental CO 2 is not needed. However, the cells under observation need to be maintained at 37 °C. This can be achieved by enclosing the entire microscope in a box and using a proportional feedback control apparatus to blow warmed air into the enclosure. Cardboard boxes work well when configured so that the video camera and the mercury arc lamp (when present) are external to the enclosure. The oculars should project from the top edge of the box. A more elegant and user-friendly setup is a Plexiglas enclosure with sliding doors custom-fabricated for the particular microscope. Again, the oculars, camera, and arc lamp housing should be located outside of the box. Three alternative heating strategies include placing the microscope in a 37 °C room, enclosing the volume around the stage with a custom-built Plexiglas box, and warming the preparation alone with a temperature-controlled support apparatus on the stage. This last strategy suffers because there will be a temperature gradient from the margins of the preparation to the cells under observation. The gradient is particularly severe when a water or oil immersion objective is used, unless the objective is equipped with a heated collar or other heating device*. - Coverslip jars - Coverslips, size 1. 5 - Culture dish, 100 × 20 mm - Forceps - Pipettes, 1 ml - Silicone vacuum grease (High Vacuum Grease; Dow Corning) - Spatula - Squirt bottle containing distilled H 2 O - Tissue culture hood - UV light source - Water bath, preset to 37 °C ### METHOD 1. Clean the coverslips used in the construction of this preparation prior to use by sonicating them in distilled H 2 O containing a small amount of detergent and then rinsing the coverslips several times in distilled H 2 O. Store cleaned coverslips in jars containing 95 % ethanol. - *Although the utility of these preparations is not sensitive to coverslip thickness, use number 1. 5 (i. e., 0. 17 mm thick) coverslips, because microscope objectives (without coverslip correction collars) are designed for this thickness of glass. Use of number 1 or number 2 coverslips introduces spherical aberration that degrades image quality*. - To prepare the coverslips for use in growing cells, pass each coverslip through the flame of an alcohol burner to burn off excess ethanol. - To ensure a uniform and lasting seal, do not apply silicone grease to the margins of wet coverslips coming out of a tissue culture dish. Instead, grease the margins of the coverslips before the cells are grown on them by applying a thin and uniform coating of silicone vacuum grease to the margins of the coverslip with a small spatula. - Place the coverslips in a 100 × 20 -mm tissue culture dish. To ensure sterility, place the dish with coverslips in a tissue culture hood, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes. - Following sterilization, plate the cells onto coverslips and culture them in ~ 10 ml of media. - *For our applications, we use the media appropriate for each cell type supplemented with 12. 5 mM HEPES, 10 % fetal calf serum, and a 1 : 100 dilution of the antibiotic/antifungal reagent sold by GIBCO*. - Wipe the aluminum support slide with a tissue soaked with 70 % ethanol, and then briefly pass the slide through a flame to remove residual alcohol. - Use a small spatula to apply a thin rim of silicone grease around the top and bottom margins of the opening. - Use a thin, even layer of silicone grease. Thicker layers, although they may work well, can lead to dimensional instability as the preparation “settles” at 37 °C. This can lead to a constantly changing focus for the first few hours, even though the microscope may have a stable focus mechanism. - Flame a cleaned blank coverslip (from Step 1) to remove the alcohol, and attach the coverslip to the bottom of the support slide. Use the back of a pair of <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> to gently tamp the coverslip to ensure a good seal. - Place the prepared slide in a plastic culture dish, and expose it to UV light for 10 minutes in a tissue culture hood. - Warm the media and fluorocarbon oil to 37 °C in a water bath. - Use a sterile 1 -ml pipette to fill the chamber halfway with oil (~ 350 μl). - Use a fresh sterile 1 -ml pipette to add medium until the oil at the margins of the opening just barely overflows from the chamber (again, ~ 350 μl). - Remove a coverslip with cells from the culture dish, and aspirate off excess medium. Quickly place the coverslip, silicone-grease-side down, on the chamber. Tamp the coverslip with forceps to ensure a good seal. Aspirate off any excess media and oil that may have flowed over onto the top of the coverslip. - Wash the top of the preparation prior to use to prevent salts from the medium forming crystals on the coverslips once they air dry. - Fill a 1 -liter beaker with 37 °C water, and place a squirt bottle of distilled H 2 O in it to warm. - When the water is warm, take the assembled chamber out of the incubator. Use a small spatula to apply a small amount of melted 1 : 1 : 1 vaseline:lanolin:paraffin (VALAP) to the edges of the top coverslip to provide an extra seal. Use the squirt bottle to gently wash the top coverslip, and aspirate off any excess water. - *Keep the amount of VALAP used to a minimum to reduce the chance that any will catch on the objective when the preparation is in use. This soft, waxy material is difficult to remove from optical surfaces*. - Proceed with microscopy [...] the culture preparation is now ready for observation. *See Movie 1, which illustrates BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy*. ![Movie 1]([URL] "Movie 1 ") **Movie 1. ** BSC- 1 (monkey kidney epithelial) cells imaged by time-lapse video microscopy.

Through the use of specific firing parameters, it has become possible to control the behavior of freely moving animals. Here we have established a system to control projection pathway-specific neurons from a particular brain region through the combined use of a Cre-dependent ChR 2 and a transceullar, retrograde, Cre virus. ### Introduction There is an urgent need for more effective treatment strategies for major depressive disorder (MDD). The efficacy of novel depression treatment with deep brain stimulation implicates MDD as a neural circuit disorder. Therefore, {{a better understanding of}} the neural circuit mechanisms underling MDD is crucial for the development of neural circuit-oriented treatment strategies. Studies have implicated the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, specifically DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and its projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in the pathophysiology of depression. Through the combined use of optogenetics and viral mediated gene transfer technology, we manipulated the firing patterns of these pathways in order to elucidate the functional role of these circuits in the regulation of behavioral abnormalities. To selectively target VTA-NAc or VTA-mPFC neurons for the optogenetic experiments we injected a transcellular, retrograde, Cre virus into the NAc or mPFC and the conditional AAV-DIO-ChR 2 virus into the VTA. We found that selective induction of phasic firing in VTA-NAc neurons generated a susceptible phenotype, whereas the inhibition of VTA-mPFC neuron activity induced the same susceptible phenotype. These types of manipulations can provide highly useful information for a target-oriented treatment of depression, as well as many other illnesses. ### Reagents **Surgery**: 1. Anesthetic (Ketamine (100 mg/kg) / Xylaxine (10 mg/kg)) - Milli Q water - Sterile phosphate-buffered saline - 70 % ethanol - Acetone - Betadine - Alcohol wipes - Puralube vet ointment - Neosporin - AAV-DIO-ChR 2 -EYFP (UNC Vector Core) - PRV-Cre (Jeffrey Friedman’s laboratory – Rockefeller University) ### Equipment **Surgery**: 1. 1 mL syringes - 30 gauge needles - Sterile cotton swabs - Reflex 7 clip applier and 7 mm clips - Forceps - Scissors - Hamilton syringes and 26 gauge needles - Ideal micro-drill and bits (Roboz Surgical Instrument) - Stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments) - Heating pad - Timer - Permanent implantable optic fibers (see Sparta, D. R. et al) - Screws - Screw Driver - Dental Cement (Grip cement; Dentsply) - Transfer Pipettes **Subthreshold social defeat**: 1. Perforated plexiglass divider - Timer **Stimulation and Social Interaction**: 1. Optical Fibers (Thor Labs, BFL 37 - 200) - Blue light Crystal Laser (BCL- 473 - 050 M) - Yellow light Crystal Laser (CL 561 - 050 -L) - Stimulator (Agilent Technologies, # 33220 A) - Square shaped arena (44 × 44 cm) - Wire mesh cage (10 × 6 cm) - Ethovision 3. 0, Noldus ### Procedure **Injection of AAV-DIO-ChR 2 into VTA**: 1. One hour prior to surgery, give the mice a subcutaneous injection of penicillin and atropine. - Anesthetize mice with ketamine (100 mg/kg) /xylaxine (10 mg/kg) mixture. Make sure animals are fully anesthetized by gently squeezing the footpad to ensure no reflex response. - Shave the top portion of the head. - Place the head of the mouse securely in the stereotaxic apparatus by positioning the front teeth in the nose holder, followed by securing the ear bars in place. Make sure that the nose holder and ear bars are set a zero. - Apply ocular lubricant to the eyes of the mouse. - Disinfect the dissection area using cotton swabs with betadine. Make sure to start in the center of the head, moving the swab in circular motions outward to minimize contamination. - Using sterilized forceps and scissors expose the skull by making a sagittal incision along the midline. Make sure to peel the periosteum off using a cotton swab. - Roughly make the skull of the mouse as flat as possible by eye. - Attach both Hamilton syringes with 26 gauge needles to the stereotaxic apparatus and set the syringe on the right side to zero degrees. Set the other syringe to 7 ° for VTA injection. - Perform the flat test by placing the Hamilton syringe that is set to zero degrees on bregma and measure the dorsal/ventral coordinate. - Following this measurement, move the syringe posterior to lambda and again measure the dorsal/ventral coordinate. If the two measurements are more than 0. 2 mm out of alignment, adjust accordingly. - Then move the syringe back to bregma and take the two measurements that are lateral to bregma. Again make sure there is not more than a 0. 2 mm difference. - Once the flat test has been performed, adjust both syringes to be at 7 ° for the AAV-DIO-ChR 2 injection. - Place both needles at bregma and take the anterior/posterior (A/P), medial/lateral (M/L), and dorsal/ventral (D/V) measurements. - Once these measurements have been taken, move the syringes to the VTA coordinates (AP - 3. 3 mm; LM + 1. 05 mm; DV - 4. 6 mm). - Using a micro-drill, make burr holes at the new coordinates. - Fill the entire syringe with PBS and then push out the solution until 1. 5 μl of the syringe is full. - Pull up to 2. 0 μl with air. - Fill the syringe with 1. 0 μl of AAV-DIO-ChR 2 (total volume of syringe is now 3. 0 μl). - Lower syringe to 0. 1 mm below the newly calculated dorsal/ventral coordinates to create a pocket in the tissue and then immediately pull up to the calculated coordinate. - Inject 0. 1 μl of virus per minute to avoid tissue damage. - Keep syringe in place for 5 minutes after all of the virus has been injected. - Remove the Hamilton syringes by slowly pulling up and remove mouse from stereotaxic apparatus. - Apply neosporin to the skull using a cotton swab. - Close incision using sutures holding the two sides of the tissue with forceps. - Place mouse on heating pad in its cage until it wakes up. **Injection of retrograde travelling pseudorabies virus expressing Cre (PRV-Cre) into NAc or mPFC followed by implantation of permanent optical fibers (see Sparta et al Nature Protocols for details on how to make fibers) **: 1. Two weeks following the DIO-ChR 2 surgery, perform the second surgery. The protocol is the same as above for the virus injection with a few alterations. - a. After step (8), choose a location for the skull screw that is not near bregma, the viral injection location or the ferrule location and then proceed to drill a small burr hole. Screw the skull screw into the small hole using <b>curved</b> <b>forceps</b> to hold the screw and screwdriver to fit into the hole. Only screw until it has tightly gripped the skull. Proceed with flat test. - b. Inject PRV-Cre into the NAc at 10 ° (AP + 1. 6 mm; LM + 1. 5 mm; DV - 4. 4 mm) and at 15 ° mPFC (AP + 1. 7 mm; LM + 0. 75 mm; DV - 2. 5 mm), and use a 0. 5 μl volume of the virus to inject bilaterally. - Remove Hamilton syringes and replace with ferrule holders with implantable fibers attached and change the angle to 7 °. - Determine the location for ferrule placement from bregma for VTA (AP - 3. 3 mm; LM + 1. 05 mm; DV - 4. 6 mm). - Secure the ferrules in place with white dental cement. - Do not remove the ferrule holders until the cement is completely dry (~ 10 - 15 minutes). - Remove the mouse and allow it to recover on the heating pad. **Subthreshold social defeat**: 1. Place a c 57 test mouse (intruder) into the home cage of a larger, CD 1 retired breeder mouse for 2 minutes during which the test mouse is physically attacked by the CD 1 aggressive mouse. - After 2 minutes of physical contact, place a perforated plexiglass partition in the middle of the CD 1 mouse home cage and separate the test mouse from the CD 1 mouse for 10 minutes to allow for sensory stress or optical stimulation (see below). - Following the 10 minutes of sensory stress or optical stimulation, place the test mouse back into its home cage for 5 minutes. - Repeat steps 1 and 2. - Return the test mouse to its home cage. **Optical stimulation and social interaction**: 1. Optical stimulation can be performed during subthresold social defeat as stated above or during social interaction test (see below). - Connect optical fibers via a FC/PC adaptor to a 473 nm blue or 561 nm yellow laser diode and stimulator to generate blue or yellow light pulses. - Attach the other end of the optical fibers, with a ferrule attached, to the two implanted optical fibers in the test mouse using ferrule sleeves. - For low frequency, tonic light stimulation set the stimulator to 0. 5 Hz and 15 ms. - For high frequency, phasic light stimulation set the stimulator to 20 Hz and 40 ms. - For both tonic and phasic stimulation protocols, expose projection-specific VTA neurons to 5 spikes over each 10 second period. - Set the stimulator to the desired parameters and turn the laser on during the two-stages of the social interaction test. - To measure social avoidance behavior towards a novel CD 1 mouse, perform a two-stage social interaction test. - During the first 2. 5 minutes of the test, allow the test mouse to freely explore a square shaped arena (44 × 44 cm) containing a wire mesh cage (10 × 6 cm) placed on one side of the area with the target CD 1 mouse absent. Ensure that the laser is on during these 2. 5 minutes. - Turn the laser off, remove the test mouse from the arena and place it back into its home cage. - Place an unfamiliar CD 1 mouse into the wire mesh cage and place it into the arena. - Turn the laser back on and place the test mouse into the arena, allowing it to freely explore. - Use video tracking software to measure the amount of time the experimental mouse spent in the “Interaction Zone” (14 × 26 cm), “Corner Zone” (10 × 10 cm) and “Total Travel” within the arena. - To segregate mice as susceptible or resilient, calculate the interaction ratio as (interaction time with target present) /(interaction time with target absent) normalized to 100. - Mice with scores less than 100 are defined as “susceptible” and those with scores greater than or equal to 100 are defined as “unsusceptible” or resilient. ### Timing - Injections: 10 min for each injection 0. 5 μl of virus - Microdefeat: 30 min - Stimulation and Social Interaction: ~ 7 min per animal ### Troubleshooting 1. One of the most common problems is the Hamilton syringe needle gets clogged. First try clearing the needle using acetone, ethanol and water. If this does not work, replace the needle and recalculate the coordinates. - The permanent implantable fiber breaks. Replace the fiber with a new one. - The implantable fibers come out when trying to remove it from the holder. There is not much that can be done at this point. Make sure that the cement is completely hardened to try to prevent this from happening. ### References 1. Berton, O. et al.
