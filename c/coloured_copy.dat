50|$|The chronicles {{mention that}} in 1363 {{a part of}} the church was painted, but presumably the frescoes in rest of the {{interior}} were created later, around 1380. The whole interior of the church was covered by frescoes, which was common for that time, but almost all fully painted churches were eventually destroyed or lost the original frescoes, and so far the only intact church with the fully painted interior is preserved in the Ferapontov Monastery. The Volotovo frescoes were extensively studied, and black and white photographs of every detail, as well as <b>coloured</b> <b>copies,</b> survived and considerably simplified the restoration. In 1977, the frescoes became the subject of a book of Mikhail Alpatov.|$|R
50|$|After {{having been}} {{preserved}} for centuries at the Hohenburg Abbey, the manuscript of Hortus Deliciarum {{passed into the}} municipal Library of Strasbourg {{about the time of}} the French Revolution. There the miniatures were copied by Christian Moritz (Maurice in French) Engelhardt and published by Cotta in Stuttgart in 1818. The text was copied and published by Straub and Keller between 1879 and 1899 including some <b>coloured</b> <b>copies</b> from Herrad's illustrations made by Wilhelm Stengel. Thus, although the original perished in the burning of the libraries of the Protestant seminary and the City of Strasbourg during the siege of 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War, we can still form an estimate of the artistic and literary value of Herrad's work.|$|R

5000|$|Eginton was {{a partner}} with Boulton in the {{production}} of [...] "mechanical paintings" [...] or [...] "polygraphs" [...] The idea for these was in all probability taken by Boulton from a process modified by Robert Laurie (1755?-1836) from Jean-Baptiste Le Prince's 'aquatint' engravings. Eginton perfected the method and applied it to the production of <b>coloured</b> <b>copies</b> of paintings. More plates than one were required for each picture, and after leaving the printing-press Eginton finished them by hand. They were copied from the works of Philip James de Loutherbourg, Angelica Kauffman and other artists, and varied in price from £1. 10s. to £21. The largest were 40 inches by 50. They were sometimes mistaken for original paintings, although these old [...] "polygraphs" [...] were in fact nearly identical to the varnished coloured oleographs which later became prevalent, the main difference being that the latter were printed lithographically.|$|R
5000|$|The poem, {{which was}} {{produced}} between 1804 and 1820, consists of 100 etched and illustrated plates, thus making it Blake's longest single work. The illustrated plates were made using Blake's self-devised technique of [...] "illuminated printing", which required each copy to be individually coloured and produced, plate by plate. Blake was not averse to changing {{the text of}} some plates between printings or changing the colouring, {{as a result of}} which no two original copies of the poem are the same. Six copies (A-F) were printed between 1820 and 1827. Four copies (G-J) are posthumous (1832). Copy B is incomplete and includes only the First Chapter (25 plates). The arrangement of the Second chapter is different in early (A & C) and late (D & E) copies. Copy F that was collated later in 1827 by John Linnell is arranged like early copy C. There are only two <b>coloured</b> <b>copies</b> (B & E). The sole extant colour edition of this work is {{in the collection of the}} Yale Center for British Art in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|R

40|$|Unknown Plans by Ybl in the Bequest of Theophil Hansen in Vienna In Theophil Hansen’s bequest in Vienna, {{a series}} {{consisting}} of three previously unknown {{sheets of paper}} is stored at the Akademie der bildenden Künste Kupferstichkabinett. These are contempo-raneous, partly <b>coloured</b> photographic <b>copies</b> of Miklós Ybl’s drawings of the Palace of Customs in Pest. The drawings are from the early planning stage of the Palace of Customs (mid-June to mid-July 1870), on which the Budapest City Archives’ Ybl Bequest holds very little data. In addition to their documentary value, these sheets are also important because of the precise information they pro vide regarding the various modiﬁcations that {{took place during the}} planning, including the exact chronology of these modiﬁcations. These documents also enable us to tie a perspec- tive view previ ously known from reproductions to this series and thereby date it more precisely. These three copies were made in Budapest and wound up in Vienna presumably because their au- thor asked his Viennese colleague and great authority Theophil Hansen to give an expert opinion on the plans. There are several examples of these kinds of professional connections in Ybl’s oeuvre (see the plans for the Basilica in Budapest) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced {{coloured}} glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with <b>coloured</b> lithographic prints <b>copying</b> famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. Reverse glass painting was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame.|$|R
500|$|In the 1830s George Baxter repopularised colour relief printing, {{known as}} chromoxylography, {{by using a}} [...] "background detail plate printed in {{aquatint}} intaglio, followed by colours printed in oil inks from relief plates—usually wood blocks". [...] Evans followed the Baxter process, with the modification of using relief wood blocks only. For The Poems of Oliver Goldsmith, Evans created a facsimile of a watercolour, by superimposing colours {{with the use of}} separate colour blocks, one by one, to achieve the graduated colours of the original. First, Foster drew the illustration directly on the woodblocks that were to be cut, and he then recreated a <b>coloured</b> paper <b>copy</b> of the drawing. Evans, using the same pigments as Foster, grinding them himself, produced inks to match Foster's colours. The printing was done using a hand-press, with nine or ten print runs required for each illustration. For A Chronicle of England, Evans engraved prints dropped into the text at six-page intervals. Doyle drew the illustrations directly onto the wood blocks and created coloured proofs. Nine or ten wood blocks (colour blocks) were used for each of the 80illustrations, which Evans again printed on a hand-press. The use of colour and the ability to create subtle tones are characteristic of Evans' skill as a colourist. His work was distinctive because of the characteristic quality of the wood engraving (carving) and his manner of limiting the use of ink to create a more striking result.|$|R
50|$|Although {{his later}} {{publication}} Views in Australia suggests Lycett also visited Tasmania, {{there is no}} evidence of his actually travelling there. He returned to England in September 1822, having been granted an absolute pardon. With publisher John Souter, between July 1824 and June 1825 he issued Views in Australia, or New South Wales and Van Diemens Land in 12 parts published monthly, each with two aquatint views of New South Wales and two of Van Diemen's Land, with descriptive letterpress, and a supplement with maps of both colonies. By permission the series was dedicated to Bathurst. The parts began to appear in July 1824 at 7s. plain and 10s. 6d. coloured. With its complicated publishing history, the extent of Lycett's involvement in the entire production is unclear, and it does seem that the book was not successful. These views were reissued in a volume in 1825. The 50 plates are <b>coloured</b> in some <b>copies</b> and plain in others.|$|R

40|$|Phillip, the Governor-elect {{of the new}} colony, sailed from England to {{establish}} a penal settlement at Botany Bay, which had been visited by Cook only eighteen years before. This was to relieve the crowded gaols and prison hulks of the convicts who, but for the recent revolt of the American colonies, would have been sent there to slave in the plantations. The fleet, with 756 convicts and 258 soldiers and marines aboard, made the long voyage of 250 days, of which about a quarter was spent in ports on the way. The settlement was founded at Port Jackson on 26 January 1788, and for some years the weakened community, beset by disease and food shortage, struggled for subsistence. -A group of some six contemporary accounts of this formative period, by officials and officers of the new colony, was published in London {{before the turn of}} the century. They have been called the incunabula of Australiana. These substantial works are all of prime importance to the medical-as well as the general history-of the period. For they give the background to medical practice, in addition to incidental references of medical interest. SURGEON-GENERAL WHITE S JOURNAL, 1790 The third of this notable series, A Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, published in London in 1790, has special medical interest, for it was written by John White, R. N., Surgeon-General to the First Fleet and the new settlement. It is the earliest Australian medical work. A reprint, edited by A. H. Chisholm, was published in Sydney by Angus and Robertson, in association with the Royal Australian Historical Society, in 1962. White's book is a handsome quarto of 300 pages, which bears a dedication to its editor, Thomas Wilson, from Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, dated 18 November 1788. It is finely illustrated with sixty-five copper engravings, hand <b>coloured</b> in some <b>copies,</b> mainly of the strange flora and fauna of the new land. The title bears a pleasing vignette of a Port Jackson scene, from a drawing by White. A long appendix contains descriptions of zoological and botanical specimens, including the kangaroo. This part of the book was undertaken by distinguished scientists (including John Hunter), working from specimens, drawings and notes sent by White...|$|R
