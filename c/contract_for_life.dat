Her style of acting was simply described as versatile; she was an artist that, according to the critics of the time, could play most parts splendidly, and excelled both as a [...] "spoilt young girl", and in [...] "Mistress" [...] and [...] "heroine"-parts, {{as well as in}} tragedy. She played Ophelia, Juliet (1872), Desdemona (1858), Mary Stuart (1868) and Cleopatra (1881) with success, but her most acclaimed roles were as characters in popular novels, such as Jane Eyre (1854). She managed to play Nora convincingly in Ibsen's A Doll's House as late as 1881, when she had reached the age of fifty, and she was also considered as the perhaps most notable Ibsen-actor. She was also popular in so called breeches roles; her voice was described as very deep and suitable for such parts.|$|E
60|$|Every human {{contract}} {{may be said}} {{to possess}} its distinctive character. Thus, marriage is to be distinguished from a partnership in trade, without recurrence to any particular form of words. Marriage, contracted by any ceremony whatever, is held to be a <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>life.</b> The same is true of governments: in their nature they are intended to be indissoluble. We doubt if there be an instance on record of a government that ever existed, under conditions, expressed or implied, that the parts of its territory might separate at will. There are so many controlling and obvious reasons why such a privilege should not remain in the hands of sections or districts, that it is unnecessary to advert to them. But after a country has rounded its territory, constructed its lines of defence, established its system of custom-houses, and made all the other provisions for security, convenience, and concentration, that are necessary to the affairs of a great nation, it would seem to be very presumptuous to impute to any particular district the right to destroy or mutilate a system regulated with so much care.|$|E

Initial deliveries of suits {{did not perform}} well in tests and NASA initially cancelled its contract with ILC and Hamilton Standard. NASA relaunched the program to develop a spacesuit for the Apollo program experimenting at first with hard suits. ILC and Hamilton Standard submitted competing designs this time with ILC winning the sole contract based on its flexible, close-fitting design which featured water cooled undergarment, a blue inner pressurized layer, and covered in a white nylon layer to protect the suits from rocks. Hamilton received a separate <b>contract</b> <b>for</b> the <b>life</b> support backpack unit. ILC was further challenged after the Apollo 1 fire to remove all flammable material from space suits.

5000|$|Of {{the three}} owners of Pix, {{one was a}} silent partner, Alfred Eisenstaedt, the famous {{photographer}} who had left the Associated Press in Germany to join the new Life magazine staff in New York City. Eisenstaedt closely observed Morse's photographing while encouraging Wilson Hicks, the picture editor of Life, to meet the young upstart at Pix. After weeks of Eisenstaedt's nagging, Hicks relented and asked to meet Morse. [...] At their initial encounter, Hicks gave Morse his first assignment. Not at all sure how he would actually {{meet the demands of}} the most important picture editor in the United States, Morse covered up his fear with gratitude. Between his own and Capa's equipment, Morse was able to cover the author Thornton Wilder's acting on Broadway in his own show Our Town. The success of this assignment earned him a second—capturing on film women buying hats for their husbands in the basement of Gimbels department store—which turned out to be Morse's first photo story published by Life.

40|$|This study {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} counselling adolescents on HIV/AIDS and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases. The study presents {{an overview of the}} dreaded disease-AIDS, which is a condition that is associated with infection of the immune system. Adolescents are the target group of this paper because they are the most vulnerable. It is evidenced that sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are on the increase and so is unplanned pregnancy among adolescents. The problem affects all aspects of life of the adolescents (i. e. social, economic, religious and educational). Also, the spread of the disease is very rapid among adolescents and hence, they {{are at the center of}} the epidemic. It is highly incontrovertible that prevention is better than cure.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 60 years, {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} on the use of alcohol by college students and its impact on their college experience (Straus and Bacon, 1953; Wechsler, Lee, Nelson, 2 ̆ 6 Kuo, 2002). These studies show alcohol impacts many areas of the college experience including academic and social. Binge drinking and secondhand effects from alcohol have become major concerns (Wechsler, et al., 2002). Consequently, prevention programs are gaining in importance on campus, and administrators are looking for any assistance selecting prevention programs they can find to be successful (Schulenberg, 2 ̆ 6 Maggs, 2002). ^ One such program, which has shown success albeit at the secondary level, is Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD). This qualitative study investigated the perceptions of a select number of freshmen that were of SADD while in high school. Specifically, the study looked at how the affiliation with SADD has influenced the behaviors surrounding alcohol use by first year college students. It assessed the perceived influence of the peer-to-peer education program SADD (Hunter, 2004). ^ Initially, 500 freshmen students from a private four-year institution of higher education were canvassed to identify freshmen that participated in SADD in high school. Seven students identified themselves as willing to participate. The researcher interpreted the data and the resulting themes were used to assess the perceptions of the sample. Notable findings include: Five of seven sample students had not heard of the SADD No Use policy or the SADD <b>Contract</b> <b>for</b> <b>Life.</b> All sample students had used alcohol since high school. ^ The study is important in that it will address the behaviors and attitudes use regarding alcohol among first year college students who affiliated with Students Against Destructive Decision in high school. This study provides administrators, parents, and educators insight regarding the value of peer-to-peer prevention programs such as SADD, {{from the perspective of the}} participants themselves when addressing alcohol issues on college campuses. This could prove to be useful for leaders creating or evaluating prevention programs. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} with title Evaluation of life {{insurance}} is to choose the most convenient insurance product for a specific client. Since we choose insurance {{on the basis of}} several criteria and it is not obvious at first sight which product is the most advantageous, it is suitable to use methods of multiple criteria decision making. In theoretical part basic notions concerning insurance industry and multiple criteria decision making are explained. Next, all methods which are used to determine weights of criteria and to choose the best variant are described in detail. For purposes of the thesis there were gathered drafts <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> investment <b>life</b> insurance and risk life insurance from seven insurance companies, which means altogether fourteen contracts. In practical part evaluation criteria are determined in collaboration with client and their weights are calculated. Next, order of particular variants was determined. All process was in person consulted with a specialist from the area of insurance industry. On the basis of used methods of multicriterial evaluation of variants we can say that for the specific client the insurance product Bella Vita from the Insurance Company Generali is the best choice. In comparison with other alternatives it´s advantage is insurance payment already from the fifteenth day in case of incapacity for work, which arose as a consequence of injury and high insurance payment in case of hospitalization. If the client will choose investment variant or risk variant depends only on his decision, because their results are comparable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Many {{transportation}} {{agencies have}} discovered that traditional highway contract administration procedures and project delivery methods do not meet current demands. In response, they are turning to alternative contracting. Four trends are perceived in road management. First, with respect to project delivery, more and more projects are <b>contracted</b> <b>for</b> the whole <b>life</b> cycle of the road. Second, contractors are given increasingly more freedom or design space, as the indicators used for monitoring their work become less operational and more performance based. Third, governments follow a dual track strategy; managing a portfolio of directly and indirectly financed projects; dependent on the project characteristics. Fourth, <b>contracts</b> are granted <b>for</b> longer term. These innovative forms of contracting are expected to yield more flexibility in the road sector; more innovation, higher performance and consequently lower costs while keeping up service levels on public values. This paper presents how by {{using a combination of}} institutional economics theory and engineering design theory, our aim is to build a systems dynamics model that can capture the institutional context and is able to indicate what contracting practices are likely to occur and which ones are likely to succeed in view of the meeting the public values and demands...|$|R
