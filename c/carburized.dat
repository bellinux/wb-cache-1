40|$|<b>Carburizing</b> {{is one of}} {{the leading}} surface-hardening {{processes}} for improving wear and fatigue resistance while still maintaining tough and shock resistant cores through surface carbon enrichment of low-carbon steel parts.

In previous studies, we have shown the viability of treatments such as nitriding, nitrocarburizing and <b>carburizing,</b> when applied with suitable parameters to Ni, Mo and Mn alloyed P/M steels of sinter-hardening capability. In the present work, the effects of gaseous and plasma <b>carburizing</b> treatments performed in industrial furnaces on carbon free samples have been studied in order to establish the most suitable treatment cycles and to verify the depth of the carbon penetration.

Also the advantages of <b>carburizing</b> over carbonitriding are greater case depth (case depths of greater than 0.3 inch are possible), less distortion, and better impact strength.

50|$|The initial {{manufacturing}} of Krupp armour {{was very}} similar to Harveyized armour; however, while the Harvey process generally used nickel-steel, the Krupp process added as much as 1% chromium to the alloy for additional hardness. Also, while Harveyized armour was <b>carburized</b> by heating the steel and placing charcoal on its surface for long periods (often several weeks), Krupp armour went a step further. Instead of inefficiently introducing carbon at the surface with coal, Krupp armour achieved greater depth of carbon cementation by applying carbon-bearing gases to the heated steel. Once the carburization process was complete, the metal was then transformed into face hardened steel by rapidly heating the cemented face, allowing the high heat to penetrate 30% to 40% of the steel's depth, then quickly quenching first the superheated then {{both sides of the}} steel with powerful jets of either water or oil.|$|E

The test specimen tempering material (QT material) and vacuum <b>carburizing</b> material (VC material) has been used. The fatigue-crack progress was examined by subjecting the samples to four-point bending. The loading-capacity fixed experiment was done using a maximum load of Pmax = 4000 – 7000 N.

40|$|The <b>carburizing</b> {{atmosphere}} {{during the}} case hardening process contains {{a large proportion}} of hydrogen. Due to the rapid diffusion of hydrogen a high amount of hydrogen can be absorbed by the <b>carburizing</b> component. The amount of absorbed hydrogen is dependent on some factors such as for example the <b>carburizing</b> time and component dimensions. Hydrogen diffused in material can then cause hydrogen embrittlement and in some cases cause cracking under a static load. This hydrogen must therefore be removed. High amounts of hydrogen diffuse out spontaneously at room temperature. Tempering accelerates the process. The aim {{of this study was to}} experimentally measure the amount of absorbed hydrogen after case hardening and hydrogen content after storage at room temperature and also after tempering. The effect of the enriching gas in <b>carburizing</b> furnace on hydrogen absorption was investigated in this study. Three steel grades with different content of alloying elements were used in this investigation. Steel samples were case hardened by gas <b>carburizing</b> and tempering. The hydrogen content analyses included the measurement of hydrogen content before case hardening, after case hardening and after tempering using Leco-RHEN 602. Based on the results in this study it was concluded that all steel grades used in this investigation absorb hydrogen during case hardening by gas <b>carburizing.</b> A major part of the absorbed hydrogen is then released by effusion after being stored at room temperature and during tempering. Around 50 % of the absorbed hydrogen content during gas <b>carburizing</b> is due to the presence of the enriching gas in the <b>carburizing</b> atmosphere. Around 50 % of hydrogen diffuses out of the steel specimens after one day.
