5|$|The <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not {{recognise}} divorce as {{ending a}} valid marriage and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
5|$|The <b>church</b> <b>does</b> {{not require}} that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E

5|$|According to the church, its {{membership}} as of 2016 was 63,392, which represented approximately 60 percent of Tonga's population. The church also reported 166 congregations, one mission, and one temple. However, {{according to the}} 2011 Tongan census, 18,554 people self-identify as Mormon, making it the second-largest religion in the country, ahead of Catholicism and behind Methodism. LDS Church membership statistics are different from self-reported statistics, mainly because the LDS <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> not remove an individual's name from {{its membership}} rolls based on disengagement from the church.|$|E
5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that requires no merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|The stay of Cardinal Ottobono Fieschi (later Pope Adrian V) in England from 29 October 1265, until July 1268, {{led to a}} {{great deal}} of {{diplomatic}} activity in the Scottish church, in which Albin was perhaps involved. Cardinal Ottobono imposed a general tax on the English church, which he extended to Scotland. King Alexander III forbade the payment of this money, and appealed to the papacy; but in 1267 the Scottish clergy persuaded Alexander to abandon his appeal, while they made their own reduced payments. Meanwhile, Cardinal Ottobono's legatine council, to which the Scottish church had sent four delegates, promulgated canons for the English church which he expected the Scottish church to incorporate; the Scottish <b>church</b> <b>does</b> not appear to have done so, however.|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> not {{recognize}} as dogma any ecumenical councils other than these seven.

25|$|Civil Partnerships {{have been}} {{permitted}} for clergy since 2005. Regarding such civil unions, “The Church in Wales has no formal view on whether people in civil partnerships {{who are in}} a sexual relationship can serve as clergy.

25|$|The <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> {{not approve}} {{of the use of}} {{abortion}} as a means of birth control or family planning, but recognizes a woman's right to receive one. Abortion is condoned only in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when a mother's physical or mental health is at risk. The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining abortions or information about abortions.|$|E
50|$|Some members owned slaves—the {{most famous}} of whom was Sojourner Truth—and the <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not support abolitionism. In rural areas, ministers preached in Dutch until about 1830 - 1850, then {{switched}} to English, {{at the same time}} finally dropping the use of many traditional Dutch clothing and customs. Although some ministers favored revivals, generally the <b>church</b> <b>did</b> not support either the First or the Second Great Awakenings, which created much evangelical fervor.|$|R

25|$|In September 2016, Bishop Thomas J. Olmsted of the Diocese of Phoenix {{issued the}} fourth {{edition of his}} guide, Catholics in the Public Square. In it, he {{suggested}} to politicians supporting abortion that {{they would need to}} repent and go to Confession before receiving Holy Communion, dissenting from most other bishops including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Cardinal Donald Wuerl who said the <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> not deny communion over issues of legislation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> not {{consider}} at all illicit {{the use of}} those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result therefrom, {{so long as the}} contraceptive effect is not directly intended for any motive whatsoever. For example, the use of hormonal contraception as treatment for endometriosis rather than with contraceptive intent is {{not consider}}ed to conflict in any way with Catholic teaching.|$|E
25|$|While the Russian Orthodox <b>Church</b> <b>does</b> {{recognize}} {{the first seven}} ecumenical councils as valid, some Russian Orthodox theologians believe that the infallibility of these councils' statements derived from their acceptance by the faithful (and thus from the infallibility of all believers), and not from the acts of the councils themselves. This differs from the Greek Orthodox view, which accepts that an ecumenical council is itself infallible when pronouncing on a specific matter.|$|E
50|$|The Orthodox <b>Churches</b> <b>do</b> not {{acknowledge}} the Apostolic succession within the Catholic Church. Some Orthodox <b>Churches</b> <b>do</b> not require baptism {{in the case}} of a convert already baptized in the Catholic Church. Most Orthodox Churches allow marriages between members of the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. For example, the Church of Greece would allow an Orthodox man to marry a Catholic bride in its church, providing the wife vows the children will be baptized Orthodox.|$|R
