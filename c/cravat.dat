5|$|The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Croatia is {{tasked with}} {{preserving}} the nation's cultural and natural heritage and overseeing its development. Further activities supporting development of culture are undertaken at local government level. The UNESCO's World Heritage List includes seven sites in Croatia. The country is also rich with Intangible culture and holds ten of UNESCO's World's intangible culture masterpieces, surpassing all countries in Europe except Spain which possesses {{an equal number}} of the listed items. A global cultural contribution from Croatia is the necktie, derived from the <b>cravat</b> originally worn by the 17th-century Croatian mercenaries in France.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} to mid-1650s, a rather small falling collar was in fashion. This {{increased}} in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. Cravats and jabots around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the <b>cravat</b> remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red {{was the most common}} color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of <b>cravat</b> made its appearance in the 1690s, the Steinkerk (named after the Battle of Steenkerque in 1692). Before, the <b>cravat</b> was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk <b>cravat</b> looped through a buttonhole of the coat.|$|E

25|$|The Colour (bandiera di guerra) for army units (other than cavalry) is {{a square}} {{version of the}} {{national}} tricolour in silk, 99cm × 99cm. It is mounted on a pike 2.2 m long, made of wood covered with green velvet and decorated with ornate brass nails arranged in a spiral. The pike is topped by a 35cm high finial consisting of an ornate gilt brass spearhead chased with a five pointed star and the monogram RI (for Repubblica Italiana), which is in turn mounted atop a gilt brass ball on which is the name and date of establishment of the unit. The pike is adorned with two silver cords 67cm long, each with a 10cm long silver tassel and a blue silk <b>cravat</b> 8cm × 66cm with an 8cm silver fringe at each end, to which the unit's decorations are pinned, the ribbons of the decorations overlapping so that the medals hang down the <b>cravat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Shirt sleeves were full, {{gathered}} at the wrist and dropped shoulder. Full-dress shirts had ruffles of fine fabric or lace, while undress shirts ended in plain wrist bands. A small turnover collar returned to fashion, worn with the stock. In England, clean, white linen shirts were considered important in Men's attire.

25|$|In 1666, Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland, {{following}} the earlier example of Louis XIV of France, decreed that at court, men were {{to wear a}} long coat, a vest or waistcoat (originally called a petticoat, a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a <b>cravat,</b> a periwig or wig, and breeches gathered at the knee, {{as well as a}} hat for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.|$|E

25|$|Moro {{was wearing}} the same grey clothes he had during the kidnapping. The <b>cravat</b> had several blood stains, traces of sand {{were found in the}} pockets and socks, and traces of {{vegetables}} were also found. Eventually the terrorists declared that they had intentionally added those traces in order to sidetrack the investigators. In the trunk there were also some of Moro's personal effects, a bracelet and his watch, and some spent cartridges. Moro had also a wound at the thigh, likely suffered during the initial assault in via Fani.|$|E
25|$|The {{accessories}} {{for the two}} styles {{depended on}} the intended use of the coat: for more formal settings, the outfit might still have striped trousers and demand a top hat and white gloves; for business, {{by the turn of}} the century, the morning coat was used (again, this referred to a single breasted frock coat then, not the modern morning coat). This last was accompanied by a business collar (such as winged collar, not a standing Imperial collar); a four in hand tie (as opposed to the formal <b>cravat</b> and puff), and a soft Derby or Homburg.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian {{military}} units also carry the national flag as a National Colour. This {{is in the}} dimensions 90 × 128cm. It is mounted on the same size staff and with the same finial as the Army standard, but the <b>cravat</b> is divided lengthwise yellow and green, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Cruzeiro do Sul in white stars, yellow, and green. The staff is covered in green velvet with a yellow spiral strip. The colour belt is 10cm in width, covered with green velvet with yellow velvet stripes of width and number varying with the rank of the organization's commander.|$|E

25|$|In Article 3 of the Law on the National Arms, Flag and Anthem (Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales) also {{describes}} {{that the}} national flag can be decorated with a special tie called a corbata (<b>cravat).</b> The corbata is composed of a bow, two ribbons of different length and both ribbons are attached with a golden tassel called fringe. The corbata {{is placed on the}} top of the flag at the point where the truck is, and the colours of the corbata match that of the national flag. Organizations and political parties can adopt their own corbatas, such as the National Action Party (PAN), which uses a white corbata with blue fringes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first thing}} many people notice when {{entering}} {{the gates of}} Oakland is the mausoleum of Jasper Newton Smith, on which sits a striking life-size statue of Smith himself. Jasper Smith was a real estate investor who financed two buildings downtown. One, known as The House that Jack Built, was constructed with the stipulation that its cornerstone be left even after the building was torn down. That cornerstone still stands {{at the entrance of}} the Peachtree Center MARTA station on Carnegie Way. Smith was well known for refusing to wear a necktie due to a bad experience as a child. Therefore, one story describing the creation of his statue notes that when the artist sculpted him wearing a <b>cravat,</b> Smith refused to pay until the offending item had been chiseled off.|$|E
25|$|Police {{uniforms and}} {{equipment}} in the United Kingdom have varied considerably from the inception {{of what was to}} become the earliest recognisable mainstream police force in the country with the Glasgow Police Act 1800 forming the City of Glasgow Police and then the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829, allowing the formation of the Metropolitan Police Service. With the various County Police Acts, policing became a more standardised practice in the United Kingdom throughout the late nineteenth century, the uniforms and equipment became equally standardised. From a variety of home grown uniforms, bicycles, swords and pistols the British police force evolved in look and equipment through the long coats and top hat, to the recognisable modern uniform of a white shirt, black tie (or <b>cravat</b> for women in many forces), reflective jackets, body armour, and the panda car.|$|E

25|$|Units of the Chilean Army carry {{one main}} Colour, {{known as the}} estandarte de combate (combat standard). This {{is the same as}} the {{national}} flag, but with an embroidered star and with the unit designation, honorific title, founding date and place, and, depending on the unit, other historic information and honours embroidered diagonally across the fly in gold. The flag is also trimmed with gold fringe. It is mounted on a staff with a gilt condor finial; below the finial is a <b>cravat</b> in the national colours with decorations attached. In addition to the military Colour, particularly distinguished units, and long serving units may carry a second Colour known as a bandera coronela (colonel's colour). This is a red field with a large white five-pointed star. In the angles of the star are the names and dates of battle honours surrounded by laurel wreaths, all in gold, while in an arc above the star is the designation of the unit, also in gold. The flag is also surrounded by gold fringe.|$|E
25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short sleeved shirts may be worn open-necked. Long sleeved shirts must always be worn with a tie or <b>cravat,</b> worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short sleeved shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black wicking T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use combat trousers (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost never wear a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear reflective waterproof jackets, which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a type of body armour, when on duty.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} of the Army measures 80 × 120cm, white with the Army {{coat of arms}} in the centre, trimmed with gold fringe. The name of the service is inscribed in gold letters on a green scroll beneath the shield. Above the shield is a knight's helmet with red and sky blue mantling. The staff is topped by a nickel-plated lance-head finial, 32cm high. Below the lance-head, there is a <b>cravat</b> (laço militar) divided lengthwise, sky blue and red, with a gold fringe at the end, tied in a bow and fastened with a cockade of blue with the Southern Cross in white stars, red, and blue. Ten red streamers with campaign honours inscribed in sky blue letters are also attached below the lance-head. The staff is 212cm long, not including the lance-head, and 3.5cm in diameter. It is covered in sky blue velvet with a red spiral strip. The colour belt is 10cm in width, covered with sky blue velvet with red velvet stripes. The Navy's flag uses dark blue colours, the Air Force flag ultramarine blue.|$|E
