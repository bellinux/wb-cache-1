5000|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that since this model used lookup tables in memory that simply changing {{the contents of}} these tables allowed the programmer to do arithmetic in any base from 2 to 10. This is only partially true as the hardware included a ten's <b>complementer</b> for subtraction (and addition of oppositely signed numbers). Therefore, only addition of unsigned numbers could be correctly performed in bases 5 to 9. To do fully signed addition and subtraction in bases 2 to 4 required detailed understanding of the hardware to create a [...] "folded" [...] addition table that would fake out the <b>complementer</b> and carry logic. Also the addition table {{would have to be}} reloaded for normal base 10 operation every time address calculations were required in the program, then reloaded again for the alternate base. This made the [...] "trick" [...] somewhat less than useful for any practical application.|$|E

One of the remarkable properties of the Lovász number is that it lies sandwiched between the stability number and the <b>complementer</b> chromatic number. This fact is called the sandwich theorem. In this paper, using new descriptions of the Lovász number and linear algebraic lemmas we give three proofs for a weaker version of the sandwich theorem...|$|E

Process of reconstucting social piety can be traced from the intersection from both material and spiritual aspect. Spiritual is a holy effort to pray God and material can be analyzed as a <b>complementer</b> factor in spirtual effort. To become pious man is the main thing however the most intention are both recognition and representation from others.

40|$|A {{generalized}} defect {{of complex}} IV (cytochrome C oxidase, COX) is frequently found in subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy (Leigh's syndrome), {{the most common}} mitochondrial disorder in infancy. We previously demonstrated the nuclear origin of the COX defect in one case, by fusing nuclear DNA-less cytoplasts derived from normal fibroblasts with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) -less transformant fibroblasts derived from a patient with COX-defective [COX(-) ] Leigh's syndrome. The resulting cybrid line showed a specific and serve COX(-) phenotype. Conversely, in the present study, we demonstrated that a COX(+) phenotype could be restored in hybrids obtained by fusing COX(-) transformant fibroblasts of seven additional Leigh's syndrome patients with mtDNA-less, COX(-) tumor-derived rho degree cells. Both these results are explained {{by the presence of}} a mutation in a nuclear gene. In a second set of experiments, in order to demonstrate whether COX(-) Leigh's syndrome is due to a defect in the same gene, or in different genes, we tested several hybrids derived by fusing our original COX(-) cell line with each of the remaining seven cell lines. COX activity was evaluated in situ by histochemical techniques and in cell extracts by a spectrophotometric assay. No COX <b>complementers</b> were found among the resulting hybrid lines. This result demonstrates that all our cases were genetically homogeneous, and suggests that a major nuclear disease locus is associated with several, perhaps most, of the cases of infantile COX(-) Leigh's syndrome. This information should make it easier to identify the gene responsible...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{role of the}} System Integrators (Slers) is {{to provide}} customized IT systems or services that satisfy the unique requirements of each customer by integrating the various products and services that many IT companies produce. Originally, the IT companies in the different business segments such as the consulting business, hardware business, and software product business have complemented each other, and Slers played the roles of coordinators between these various IT companies and the customers. However, the business model of IT companies is rapidly changing. The firewalls separating business segments in the industry are becoming obsolete, and the Japanese Slers are now getting involved in the intense new competition. This thesis identifies key elements that influence the future business of Japanese Slers. It also proposes sound strategies that will enable Japanese Slers to grow solidly {{from the viewpoint of}} top management. From the technological viewpoint, my research finds that the commoditization and openness of technologies have made hardware and software product companies shift their business focuses from products to services. On the other hand, from the market viewpoint, customers are implementing the strategies that select and focus on core businesses. (cont.) Customers are actively trying to find outsourcing opportunities. The enterprise IT systems are no exception. Customers are trying to maximize business value using IT by distinguishing strategic systems that should be customized and owned by themselves from commodity systems that should reduce costs by adopting outsourcing services. Under these changing environments, Slers will be unable to maintain the sustainability of their business simply by improving their current core competency: system integration. I argue that Slers should create new relationships with <b>complementers.</b> Developing open-application platforms and sharing them with IT service providers widely will allow Slers to create a new software ecosystem that will provide mutually beneficial relationships with their current competitors. The Slers should not focus on cost reduction in offshore development; rather, global sourcing and global business expansion should be the center of the strategies for offshoring. I also show that the development of consulting services and the hybrid services that combine outsourcing and system integration services will be the keys to further growth. by Masahiro Kashibe.

40|$|Widely {{known as}} Asian rice {{producer}} in the past, Indonesia {{is still struggling}} {{with the issue of}} malnutrition until recent times. Growth and development of toddler are not maximal because their nutrition are not properly fulfilled since their early age. This research tries to explain mother 2 ̆ 7 s parenting pattern for toddler under the red line (bawah garis merah/BGM). The research was conducted in Kenjeran, District of Bulak, Surabaya, by interviewing and observing five informants. Data were analyzed by interview and observation, later to be interpreted. The research found that mother 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about parenting and child 2 ̆ 7 s health are still influenced by belief that do not solve problem properly. Giving solid food to baby is a common thing and believed to resulted better than giving breast milk before their minimum age. This action is not medically recommended because baby has a minimum age to be able to digest solid food as <b>complementer</b> to breast milk...|$|E
40|$|The his 1 gene (chromosome V) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{specifies}} phosphoribosyl transferase (E. C. 2. 4. 2. 17), {{the first}} enzyme of histidine biosynthesis. This hexameric enzyme has both catalytic and regulatory functions. —The spontaneous reversion rates of seven his 1 mutations were studied. The reversion {{rates of the}} alleles at the proximal end of the locus (relative to the centromere) were about 50 -fold higher than distal alleles. —Spontaneous reversion to prototrophy was studied in diploids homoallelic {{for each of the}} seven his 1 mutations. Based on tetrad analysis, the prototrophy revertants could be assigned to three classes: (1) revertant tetrads that carried a prototrophic allele indistinguishable from wild type; (2) revertant tetrads that carried a prototrophic allele characterized by histidine excretion and feedback resistance; and (3) revertant tetrads that did not contain a prototrophic spore, but rather a newly derived allele that complemented the original allele intragenically. Four of the seven his 1 mutations produced the excretor revertant class, and two mutations produced the <b>complementer</b> revertant class. The significance of these findings to our understanding of gene organization and the catalytic and regulatory functions of gene products are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} on media impact {{has already been}} numerous and some theories of media impact overcome its doubt. Research on the media impact of socialization, however is rarely conducted since {{it is difficult to}} determine the parameters. The socializations itself is a time consuming process. The research is intended to describe behaviour pattern related to the programmes in the media namely news programme, that is to find out the response, to describe students behaviour in using the information from television, to know studens responses in waching news programme through socialization, to find out involvement (impact) of gender variable toward the habis in waching news programme. The research shows that: news programme plays a role as <b>complementer</b> information source for student to know politic about government board, like executive, legislative or yudicative board; students try to find information not only from one channel but also from other private –owned channels as alternative to get information; based on this research, parent friends and school environment will play important role on the level of knowledge realization about credible politic. The analisys shows that gender can influence response from students in waching news. Through students socialization, the impact of news programme, impact more to men than women. Before probing this research further, it should be noted that socialization values mentioned here are not a real political participation (for example by participating in one of the political party). The socialization is meant as an attempt to shape thought, attitude and behaviour orientations on certain values which later develop as internalization process...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{surge of}} {{interest}} in web services has {{called attention to the}} increasingly intense competition between owners of the platforms on which these services run. Given that widely adopted operating systems and middleware platforms have yielded sizable economic returns for their owners, many web services platform owners are aggressively pursuing strategies that can give them a competitive advantage and, it is hoped, similarly sizable returns. A review of the broader literature on software platform competition reveals widespread acceptance of network effect theory as an explanatory framework. Network effect theory posits that the value of a software platform to a potential user is associated positively with the number of existing users of the platform (who generate direct network effects) and the number of developers of complementary software applications (who generate indirect network effects) (see, e. g., Katz and Shapiro, 1986; Zhu et al., 2006). Users realize direct network effects when, for example, they share compatible files with other users (Gao and Iyer, 2006; Lin and Kulatilaka, 2006) or participate in ???trading communities??? (Zhu et al., 2006). Indirect network effects are realized through the availability of useful, innovative and compatible software applications (Lin and Kulatilaka, 2006). Users of widely adopted software platforms also gain value from the reduced likelihood of being ???stranded with a failed and unsupported platform??? and consequent switching costs (Gallaugher and Wang, 2002, p. 306). In the presence of network effects, then, software platform owners pursue strategies that will secure them an ???installed base??? of users and complementers that is sufficiently large to attract more and more new users (Shapiro and Varian, 1998; Suarez, 2005). While one set of strategies is aimed at promoting adoption by new users, another set emphasizes the value generated for users by indirect network effects and aims instead at promoting adoption by complementers. (This distinction reflects the idea that platform markets are two-sided, with (end) users populating one side and complementers populating the other.) There appears to be considerably more research on strategies for increasing user adoption (see Gallaugher and Wang (2002), von Westarp (2003) and Zhu and Iansiti (2007) for reviews) than on <b>complementer</b> adoption strategies. Nonetheless, three studies of the latter merit mentioning here. First, in their study of the U. S. video game industry from 1976 to 2002, Venkatraman and Lee (2003) find that platform dominance (i. e., largest installed base), together with complementers??? path dependency and level of experience with platform architecture, largely determine platform adoption by complementers. Second, in his investigation of how software platform owners maintain a balance between ???adoption and appropriation,??? West (2003) concludes that software platform owners who disclose some proprietary code will attract more complements (thereby fostering innovation), but cautions against disclosing any code that confers a competitive advantage. Finally, Cusumano and Gawer???s (2002) landmark study of Intel???s platform management strategies culminated in the endorsement of four ???levers??? for platform leadership, with one of these levers aimed at managing relations with ???external complementers???. Specific strategies include building a consensus on technical specifications and standards, handling potential conflicts of interest and letting complementers keep any intellectual property they develop on the platform. Both West (2003) and Cusumano and Gawer (2002) also underscore the importance of providing complementers with an interface to connect to the platform. Beyond West???s (2003, p. 1260) suggestion that software platform owners ???create and evolve application programming interfaces (APIs),??? though, the varied ways in which these APIs might influence a complementer???s choice to adopt have not been sufficiently explored by these or other authors. The research-in-progress described in the following section aims to bolster the somewhat scant literature on software platform adoption by complementers. More specifically, the proceeding research design outlines a proposed investigation of the determinants of <b>complementer</b> adoption of geo-mapping web services platforms. The reasons for including independent variables are discussed, and some methodological details are introduced. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of anticipated outcomes of the study...|$|E
