50|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> uses a {{flexible}} metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread {{evenly over the}} belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators lift the belt and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers. After the treated soil exits the <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace,</b> it is sprayed with water for cooling and dust control. As of February 1993, only one <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> system was currently in use for the remediation of petroleum contaminated soil. This system is mobile and can treat 5 to 10 tons of soil per hour.|$|R
