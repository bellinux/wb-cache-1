The amount of aluminum dross used varied between 50 and 90 wt %, while bentonite added to the dross varied from 10 - 50 wt % with a fixed amount of water. Using dross particle sizes of 106 µm and 184 µm, 10 samples are produced from each particle size. The bricks are dried in still air for 24 hrs at 31 o C, oven drying at 110 ºC for 24 hrs and sintered at 450 ºC for 8 hrs. The bricks characteristics {{in terms of volume}} shrinkage, apparent porosity, bulk density, <b>cold</b> <b>crush</b> <b>strengths</b> and permeability are then evaluated. The results show that the 106 µm particle size dross brick has the highest volume shrinkage of 24 %, apparent porosity of 15 % and peak bulk density of 1. 9 g/c. c. However, the dross brick exhibits relatively low <b>cold</b> <b>crush</b> <b>strength</b> of 940 KN/m. The 106 µm size bricks demonstrate a minimum of 85 % permeability compared with 70 wt % of 184 µm bricks which may be due to variation in dross particles agglomeration.

This slag {{is formed as a}} liquid at 1700 °C and its main components are SiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and MgO. Additionally it consists of chrome, ferrous/ferric oxides and CaO. Present work outlines a novel approach in formulating castables with this industrial waste.

Effects of varying 0 – 10 wt. % microsilica as a micro-fine additive in these castables were investigated in this work. Pore filling properties of microsilica improved apparent porosity and bulk density.
