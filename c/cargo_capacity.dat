5|$|Integrity {{was laid}} down in September 1802 at the newly opened King's Dockyard in the colony of New South Wales. Governor Philip Gidley King ordered that {{construction}} proceed as swiftly as possible, {{in order to test}} the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months. During construction shipwright Thomas Moore tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks. Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the forecastle bulkhead to vary her <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the RAAF's prime {{transport}} aircraft was the twin-engined Douglas C-47 Dakota. In 1946, C-47 operations were concentrated under No.86 Wing and its three flying squadrons, Nos.36, 37, and 38, based initially at RAAF Station Schofields, New South Wales. Despite the robustness and versatility of the Dakota, by the early 1950s the Air Force {{was looking for a}} replacement with greater <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity</b> and longer range, to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces. In 1954, the RAAF embarked on a major re-equipment drive, following a shift in defence funding that favoured the Air Force. The Air Officer Commanding Home Command, Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch, led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated {{it would take a}} year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity</b> to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrediction of <b>cargo</b> {{carrying}} <b>capacity</b> {{provides a}} base for planning railway networks, decision-making about the operations of railway freight companies, and development of transport scheme. The application of system dynamics assists in the predication of railway <b>cargo</b> carrying <b>capacity.</b> Through {{the analysis of the}} key factors that influence <b>cargo</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> in the railway freight system, the boundary for railway <b>cargo</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> system is determined; the system cause-effect relationship containing six feedback loops is determined; the system flow and simulation formula is constructed; the model for the development of system dynamics-based railway <b>cargo</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> is constructed. With the statistical data about railway freight in China from 1900 to 2009, simulation tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the application of system dynamics model in the prediction of railway freight. The railway <b>cargo</b> carrying <b>capacity</b> is predicted from the time from 2011 to 2015. In 2015, it is predicted to reach 5. 40486 billion tons. The error analyses indicate that the maximum error of system prediction is 2. 66 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to study the evaluation method of berth <b>capacity</b> for general <b>cargo</b> in port. Specially, this study discussed the evaluation formula for general <b>cargo</b> berth <b>capacity.</b> It described the traditional evaluation method and new evaluation method with a sample case using real data of the general cargo berth. The results of the study revealed some problems for traditional evaluation method of general <b>cargo</b> handling <b>capacity.</b> Traditional calculation method does not reflect real situation for the general <b>cargo</b> berth <b>capacity.</b> Also, it does not reflect individual circumstances in terms of input parameter like berth occupancy rate, an annual working day and daily working hour. Finally, this study recommended the applicable and effective formula to reflect real situation on ports which can give direction for developing evaluation of formula for general <b>cargo</b> port <b>capacity...</b>|$|R
5|$|Swissair {{placed the}} first order for the 747-300 on June 11, 1980. The variant revived the 747-300 designation, which had been {{previously}} used on a design study that did not reach production. The 747-300 first flew on October 5, 1982, and the type's first delivery went to Swissair on March 23, 1983. Besides the passenger model, two other versions (-300M, -300SR) were produced. The 747-300M features <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity</b> on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the -200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers. The 747-300SR, a short range, high-capacity domestic model, was produced for Japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584. No production freighter version of the 747-300 was built, but Boeing began modifications of used passenger -300 models into freighters in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The 757-200SF, a {{conversion}} of passenger 757-200s for cargo use, entered service with DHL Aviation in 2001. Modifications by Boeing Wichita in Kansas included {{the removal of}} passenger amenities, main deck structural reinforcement, and the installation of a 757-200PF forward fuselage section with a port-side cargo door. The forward two entry doors are retained, resulting in a main deck <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity</b> of 14 pallets, which is one less than the 757-200PF. Environmental controls can be fitted for animal cargo, and rear exits and window pairs are retained on some aircraft. Besides Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, Precision Conversions, and ST Aerospace Services have also handled 757-200SF conversions. In September 2006, FedEx Express announced a US$2.6billion plan to acquire over 80 converted 757 freighters to replace its 727 fleet.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity</b> than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

These ships carried massive {{numbers of}} {{passengers}}: 400 passengers in First and Second Class, and over 2,000 in Third Class. In addition, they had extremely large <b>cargo</b> <b>capacities,</b> up to 17,000 tons of general cargo.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Army {{developed}} its own landing craft. Development of an Australian {{version of}} the Landing Craft Assault, the ALCV (Australian Landing Craft, Vehicle), {{was carried out by}} Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company. Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River. The initial version, known as the ALCV I was found to be too small, so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed. An Australian {{version of the}} Landing Craft Mechanized, the ALCM, was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong. Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing craft, so the ALCV III, an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity,</b> was produced. The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs, a type of similar capacity to an American Landing Craft Tank, with five Ford V8 engines. Only four were delivered {{before the end of the}} war, but they arrived in time to see service in New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|The Panama Canal had {{a limited}} {{capacity}} determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels, {{and the need for}} permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal, which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway. On the other hand, demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade. Also, many users require a guarantee of certain level of service. Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks. Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, which have a greater <b>cargo</b> <b>capacity</b> than the current locks are capable of handling.|$|E
