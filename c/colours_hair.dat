40|$|While {{reflective}} spectrophotometry is {{an established}} method for measuring macroscopic <b>hair</b> <b>colour,</b> {{it can be}} cumbersome to use on {{a large number of}} individuals and not all reflective spectrophotometry instruments are easily portable. This study investigates the use of digital photographs to measure <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> and compares its use to reflective spectrophotometry. An understanding of the accuracy of colour determination by these methods is of relevance when undertaking specific investigations, such as those on the genetics of <b>hair</b> <b>colour.</b> Measurements of <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> may also be of assistance in cases where a photograph is the only evidence of <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> available (e. g. surveillance). Using the CIE L*a*b* <b>colour</b> space, the <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> of 134 individuals of European ancestry was measured by both reflective spectrophotometry and by digital image analysis (in V++). A moderate correlation was found along all three colour axes, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0. 625, 0. 593 and 0. 513 for L*, a* and b* respectively (p-values = 0. 000), with means being significantly overestimated by digital image analysis for all three colour components (by an average of 33. 42, 3. 38 and 8. 00 for L*, a* and b* respectively).

40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>colour</b> {{modifications}} comprise lightening/graying, darkening, or even {{a complete}} <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> change, which may involve the scalp and/or all body hair. Systemic medications may cause hair loss or hypertrichosis, while <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> change is an uncommon adverse effect. The rapidly increasing use of new target therapies will make the observation of these side effects more frequent. A clear relationship between drug intake and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> modification {{may be difficult to}} demonstrate and the underlying mechanisms of hair changes are often unknown. To assess whether a side effect is determined by a specific drug, different algorithms or scores (e. g. Naranjo, Karch, Kramer, and Begaud) have been developed. The knowledge of previous similar reports on drug reactions is a key point of most algorithms, therefore all adverse events should be recognised and reported to the scientific community. Furthermore, even if <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> change is not a life-threatening side effect, it is of deep concern for patient's quality of life and adherence to treatment. We performed {{a review of the literature}} on systemic drugs which may induce changes in <b>hair</b> <b>colour...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} the {{development}} and use of cosmetics has been reviewed (Zviak, 1986 a,b). The dyeing of human hair can be traced back at least 4000 years: evidence from Egytian tombs indicates the use ofhenna, from Lawsonia inermis, for dyeing hair, nails and skin, and there is evidence in other early eastern Mediterranean cultures of the use ofhenna and indigo for dyeing hair. During the time of the Roman civilization, a number of methods were used for colouring hair; one was the use of lead combs dipped in vinegar (presumably producing lead acetate), and another was the use of walnut stain. Pliny cited more than 100 recipes for <b>colouring</b> <b>hair</b> with vegetable and minerai materials. ln England, the Elizabethans treated hair with potash alum (aluminium potassium sulfate) followed by a concoction of rhubarb in order to produce a red tone, which was popular because of the colour of the Queen's hair. At the time of the French Revolution, 24 milion pounds (11 000 tonnes J of starch were sold each year in France for use in <b>colouring</b> <b>hair.</b> ln this technique, starch, a binder and, possibly, small amounts of colouring material were applied to the hair.

40|$|Abstract Background DNA {{analysis}} of ancient skeletal remains is invaluable in evolutionary biology {{for exploring the}} history of species, including humans. Contemporary human bones and teeth, however, are relevant in forensic DNA analyses that deal with the identification of perpetrators, missing persons, disaster victims or family relationships. They may also provide useful information towards unravelling controversies that surround famous historical individuals. Retrieving information about a deceased person’s externally visible characteristics can be informative in both types of DNA analyses. Recently, we demonstrated that human eye and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> can be reliably predicted from DNA using the HIrisPlex system. Here we test the feasibility of the novel HIrisPlex system at establishing eye and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> of deceased individuals from skeletal remains of various post-mortem time ranges and storage conditions. Methods Twenty-one teeth between 1 and approximately 800 {{years of age and}} 5 contemporary bones were subjected to DNA extraction using standard organic protocol followed by analysis using the HIrisPlex system. Results Twenty-three out of 26 bone DNA extracts yielded the full 24 SNP HIrisPlex profile, therefore successfully allowing model-based eye and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> prediction. HIrisPlex {{analysis of}} a tooth from the Polish general Władysław Sikorski (1881 to 1943) revealed blue eye <b>colour</b> and blond <b>hair</b> <b>colour,</b> which was positively verified from reliable documentation. The partial profiles collected in the remaining three cases (two contemporary samples and a 14 th century sample) were sufficient for eye colour prediction. Conclusions Overall, we demonstrate that the HIrisPlex system is suitable, sufficiently sensitive and robust to successfully predict eye and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> from ancient and contemporary skeletal remains. Our findings, therefore, highlight the HIrisPlex system as a promising tool in future routine forensic casework involving skeletal remains, including ancient DNA studies, for the prediction of eye and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> of deceased individuals. </p...|$|R
