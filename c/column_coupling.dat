Chromatography columns and other peripheral {{components of the}} chromatography systems were all in situ microfabricated using deep reactive ion etching on the same microchip. This thesis describes the architectural design, fabrication, and evaluation of their performance. ^ These microfabricated chromatography columns are based on collocated monolith support structures (COMOSS). COMOSS-based chromatography columns allow {{a great deal of}} freedom in design and selection of channel size, shape, and spatial distribution. The performance of COMOSS-based columns was clearly demonstrated with a 18 nL column made of 5 x 5 x 10 μm COMOSS separated by rectangular channels 1. 5 μm wide and 10 μm deep. ^ A collocated monolith distributor (COMOD) and collocated monolith collector (COMOC) for COMOSS column were also fabricated together with the column in the same microchip. Discontinuity of mobile phase flow velocity and stagnant pools of mobile phase were effectively controlled in these modules. The COMOD and COMOC were about 150 μm longitudinal length and 60 pL in volume. Several <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> structures, fluid turning connectors (FTC), serial <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> structures (SCCS) and parallel <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> structures (PCCS), are also described.

These short retention times were also noticed in the methods described earlier by others (Murali Krishna et al. 2012; Valluru Rajani et al. 2013).

This is an extension of a previous three-layer snow and ice model to include two-way coupling between the ice and the water column. The process-based {{ice formation}} is suitable for application to mid-latitude regions and includes: snowmelt due to rain; formation of white ice; and variability in snow density, snow conductivity, and ice and snow albedo. The model was validated against published observations from Harmon lake, British Columbia, and new observations from Eagle lake, Ontario. The ice thickness and water column temperature profile beneath the ice were predicted with Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) of 1 cm and 0. 38 °C, respectively, during the winter of 1990 - 91 in Harmon lake.

The capillary isotachophoresis (CITP) stage provided an on-line sample pretreatment (elimination of interfering matrix constituents, preseparation and preconcentration of the analyte) before the capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) separ-ation. Due to the large volume (30 mL) sample injection and CITP sample preconcentration, a simple absorbance photometric detection was sufficient for obtaining very low concentration limits of detection (∼ 8. 6 ng/mL). The combination of the different separation mechan-isms (CITP and CZE) resulted in enhanced separation selectivity. This enabled us to obtain a pure analyte zone in the directly injected real samples suitable for qualitative and quantitative evaluation. The spec-tral DAD allowed (i) characterization of the purity (i. e., spectral homo-geneity) of the analyte zone; and (ii) preliminary indication of structurally related compounds (i. e., potential biodegradation products of quinine), via characteristic spectra recorded in intervals of 200 – 800 nm. The CITP–CZE–DAD method was characterized by favorable performance parameters that are suitable for its routine biomedical use.

40|$|Background: The {{involvement}} of the storage mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae in allergies has been increasingly reported in many countries. Molecular analysis has shown that group 3 mite allergens are homologous to trypsin. Similar allergens have not been identified in T. putrescentiae. Our aims were to characterize group 3 allergens in T. putrescentiae and to investigate their significance in allergenicity. Methods: cDNAs of PreTyr p 3 and rTyr p 3 from T. putrescentiae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Native Tyr p 3 (nTyr p 3) was purified from spent growth medium with an affinity <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> of antibody. Biological activities of rTyr p 3 were compared with nTyr p 3 in terms of IgE activity, enzymatic activity and histamine release. Results: Full-length cDNA of PreTyr p 3 encodes a 285 -amino acid trypsin-like protease and acquires enzymatic activity after removing the pre- and pro-sequences. rTyr p 3 is a 26 -kDa protein with equivalent IgE reactivity but weaker enzymatic activity than that of nTyr p 3. A limited level of cross-reactivity has been found between rTyr p 3, Der p 3 and Blomia. Eight of 10 T. putrescentiae-sensitized individuals showed > 50 % histamine release after triggering with rTyr p 3. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that Tyr p 3 is a frequent allergen (58 %) in T. putrescentiae-sensitized patients. Since rTyr p 3 displays equivalent biological activities as nTyr p 3, the role of group 3 allergens can be studied using rTyr p 3 to elucidate the pathogenic effects and diagnostic applications of Tyr p 3.

However, still few examples have been presented, which fully exploit combining multiple functionalities. We demonstrate here that the measurement of alkali metals in a drop of whole blood can be performed on a capillary electrophoresis (CE) chip with defined sample loading applying the principles of <b>column</b> <b>coupling.</b> Using this approach specifically the analysis of lithium in whole blood was examined. Methods: Whole blood collected from a finger prick was mixed with anticoagulant and transferred directly onto the chip without diluting, extracting or removal of components. The electrokinetic transport of red blood cells inside the channels was studied to find sample loading conditions suitable for analysis of lithium, but that did not inject cells into the separation channel. Both bare glass chips and CE chips coated with polyacrylamide were used showing the behaviour of the cells under different electroosmotic flow conditions. Results: Lithium could be determined in whole blood diluted only with anticoagulant and spiked with lithium. In a matrix of 150 mmol/L sodium the detection limit for lithium is with 0. 4 mmol/L on the high side as a quantitation limit of 0. 2 mmol/L is desirable for clinical use. Chips with untreated surfaces quickly fouled with proteins, but devices with coating gave reproducible electropherograms. In addition potassium and sodium can also be detected in the same separation run.

40|$|Background: Porphyromonas gulae are black-pigmented {{anaerobic}} bacteria {{isolated from}} the gingival sulcus of various animal hosts and are distinct from Porphyromonas gingivalis originating in humans. We previously reported the antigenic similarities of 41 -kDa fimbriae between P. gulae ATCC 51700 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. In this study, to clarify the presence of another type of fimbriae of P. gulae, we have purified and characterized the secondary fimbrial protein from P. gulae ATCC 51700. Methods: The secondary fimbrial protein was purified from P. gulae ATCC 51700 using an immunoaffinity <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> with antibodies against the 41 -kDa fimbrial protein. The expression of fimbriae on the cell surface of P. gulae ATCC 51700 was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined by an amino acid sequencer system. Results: The molecular mass of this protein was approximately 53 -kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE. The polyclonal antibodies against the 53 -kDa protein did not react with the 41 -kDa fimbrial protein of P. gulae ATCC 51700. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed that anti- 53 -kDa fimbrial serum bound to fimbria on the cell surface of P. gulae ATCC 51700. The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal 15 residues of the 53 -kDa fimbrial protein showed only 1 of 15 residues identical to the 41 -kDa fimbrial protein. Conclusion: The 53 -kDa fimbriae are different in molecular weight and antigenicity from the 41 -kDa fimbrial protein of P. gulae ATCC 51700. These results clearly suggest that the 41 -kDa and the 53 -kDa fimbriae are distinct types of fimbriae expressed simultaneously by this organism...|$|E
40|$|When {{analyzing}} natural products, such as steviol glycosides, {{one must}} always {{be aware of the}} fact that the analytical method used might not reveal every compound that is actually present in the sample. For instance, a chromatogram representing the separation of steviol glycosides on two 20 cm C 18 columns in series (dp= 5. 0 μm) indicates the presence of 12 compounds; four of them not being identified yet. Some compounds may be “invisible” to the instrument, because they are hidden under larger peaks, or because they elute very late and the band broadening renders them undetectable. The van Deemter equation predicts a dramatic increase in column performance(and hence: resolution) by using much smaller particle diameters to pack the column. However, these columns will generate a substantially larger back pressure in the system, so a pump is needed that can deliver this pressure. Hence the name of the technique: Ultra-High Performance (or: Pressure) Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC). Moreover, a high inlet pressure allows the use of longer column lengths,further increasing the resolution of the separation. An automatic <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> device, installed on an Agilent Infinity UHPLC system with a maximum inlet pressure of 1200 bar, was used to couple several Acquity BEH C 18 columns (particle size: 1. 7 μm) in series. This set-up was used to evaluate the separation of a steviol glycosides sample on different column lengths, ranging between 5 cm and 25 cm. Various gradients of aqueous formic acid (0. 1 %) – acetonitrile were first run on the shortest column length (5 cm), allowing selection of the best gradient conditions in the shortest possible time. The gradient conditions resulting in the best separation were subsequently repeated on a 10, 15, and 20 cm support. A total of 26 peaks could be separated on the longest column length (20 cm), obtained by coupling two 2. 1 x 100 mm columns.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in chromatographic supports and instrumentation for liquid chromatography are enabling rapid and highly efficient separations. Various analytical strategies have been recently proposed, {{for example the}} use of monolithic supports, elevated mobile phase temperatures, columns packed with sub- 2 μm fully porous particles for use in ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and superficially porous particles (fused core). All these approaches {{could be used to}} enhance the efficiency and shorten the analysis time. In the presented work, a high efficiency HPLC method was proposed based on coupling three columns packed with fully porous sub- 2 µm particles and operating them at high temperature to reduce the solvent viscosity, thus reducing the column backpressure. The developed method could increase the number of theoretical plates compared to a single column at 30 ºC. The approach of <b>column</b> <b>coupling</b> was applicable for both isocratic and gradient mode of separation. Also, fast analysis methods were proposed based on using either a column packed with fully porous sub- 2 μm particles and operated at high temperature or a column packed with superficially porous particles as a tool to increase the analysis speed. An ultra-fast green method was also proposed by using a short narrow bore column packed with fully porous particles. In addition, the chromatographic performance of columns packed with fused-core particles was investigated and compared to that of fully porous particles (sub- 2 µm) at elevated temperature and extended column lengths. The study involved a comparison of chromatographic parameters such as retention, selectivity, resolution, efficiency and pressure drop. This study demonstrated that the fused-core particles can produce key advantages over the sub- 2 µm particle columns in terms of separation speed, resolution and efficiency.

A total of 373 strains of E. coli were tested by this method using materials obtained by treating the cells with polymyxin B and rabbit antiserum against cholera enterotoxin, purified by affinity gel <b>column</b> <b>coupled</b> with purified cholera enterotoxin, in N-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'- 2 -ethanesulfonic acid buffer (pH 6. 7). The results correlated {{very well with}} those obtained in an assay with Chinese hamster ovary cells. It is concluded that passive immune hemolysis is useful as a routine clinical method for identifying E. coli strains that produce heat-labile enterotoxin...|$|R
40|$|Single short, i. e. ca 2 -cm long, high-pressure-packed <b>columns</b> <b>coupled</b> {{with mass}} spectrometric (MS) or tandem MS {{detection}} enable rapid trace-level determination and identification of environmental pollutants in water samples. In this study an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) interface {{has been used}} and the overall set-up was tested {{with a mixture of}} seventeen pesticides, including organophosphates, carbamates, phenylureas and triazines. For the majority of the test analytes, the most prominent peaks in the positive-ion APCI-MS spectra resulted from protonated molecules. For fifteen out of the seventeen pesticides short-column liquid chromatography (LC) -APCI-MS of water samples as small as 15 mL resulted in detection limits between 0. 03 and 5 μg...|$|R
40|$|Micro-high-performance liquid {{chromatography}} is a miniaturized, economic and ecological chromatographic system allowing {{the use of}} reduced size chromatographic <b>columns.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, this technique {{can be used to}} detect and quantify low concentrations of peptides. In this study, hepcidin was used as the model compound and analysed using octadecylsilica stationary phase by means of a gradient elution mode at a flow rate of 4 muL/min. Several parameters were studied to optimize peak focusing. Using the methodology of experimental design, the mobile-phase gradient conditions and the sample composition were optimized in order to maximize the sensitivity and minimize retention time. Stability of the target peptide in solution was also demonstrated. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{recovery}} and fractionation of whey proteins from a {{whey protein concentrate}} (80 %, w/w) by hydrophobic interaction chromatography is proposed. Standard proteins and WPC 80 dissolved in phosphate buffer with ammonium sulfate 1 M were loaded in a HiPrep Octyl Sepharose FF <b>column</b> <b>coupled</b> to a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system and eluted by decreasing the ionic strength of the buffer using a salt gradient. The {{results showed that the}} most hydrophobic protein from whey is -lactalbumin and the less hydrophobic is lactoferrin. It was possible to recover 45. 2 % of -lactoglobulin using the HiPrep Octyl Sepharose FF column from the whey protein concentrate mixture with 99. 6 % purity on total protein basi...|$|R
30|$|The final culture broth was acidified with 1.5  M H 2 SO 4 to {{neutralize}} excess CaCO 3. Next, the post-culture broth was sterilized at 100  °C for 10  min. Then {{samples were collected}} and centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm for 10  min. The supernatant was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Fumaric acid and carbohydrates were determined and quantified by HPLC using Aminex HPX 87 H organic acid <b>column</b> <b>coupled</b> to UV–Vis diode array (Gilson, Middleton, USA) at 210  nm and a refractive index detector (Knauer, Berlin, Germany). The column was eluted at 65  °C with 5  mM H 2 SO 4, at a flow rate of 0.5  ml/min. Fumaric acid and carbohydrate standard solutions of known concentrations were used for calibration.|$|R
