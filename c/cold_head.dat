40|$|A {{comprehensive}} methodology {{to physically}} and numerically model upsetting in <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> was developed. The physical model was a Drop Weight Test with a guided pocket-die set capable of approximating industrial <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> conditions. The {{results show that}} the test is sensitive to the critical parameters for <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> These include surface quality, residual element level, nitrogen content, microstructure, decarburization, and specimen geometry. The test is capable of assessing the fracture behavior of <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> materials. One goal {{of the study was to}} reveal differences in fracture behavior with varying steel sources. Accordingly, the matrix of test materials consisted of grade 1038 steels from three different steel sources. Material preparation and conditioning of test materials approximated industrial procedures for <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> materials. These procedures included hot rolling, controlled rod cooling, descaling, straightening, lime coating and lubricating, and wire drawing. Spheroidization of test specimens was performed in an industrial batch furnace using an industrial heat treatment cycle.

50|$|Gifford-McMahon (GM) coolers {{have found}} {{widespread}} application in many low-temperature systems; e.g., in MRI and cryopumps. Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram. Helium at pressures in the 10 to 30 bar range is the working fluid. The <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> contains a compression and expansion space, a regenerator, and a displacer. Usually the regenerator and the displacer are combined in one body. The pressure {{variations in the}} <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> are obtained by connecting it periodically to the high- and low-pressure sides of a compressor by a rotating valve. Its position is synchronized with {{the motion of the}} displacer. During the opening and closing of the valves irreversible processes take place, so GM-coolers have intrinsic losses. This is a clear disadvantage of this type of cooler. The advantage is that the cycle frequencies of the compressor and the displacer are uncoupled so that the compressor can run at power-line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) while the cycle of the <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> is 1 Hz. In this way the swept volume of the compressor can be 50 (60) times smaller than of the cooler. Basically (cheap) compressors of domestic refrigerators can be used, but one must prevent overheating of the compressor as it is not designed for helium. One must also prevent oil vapor from entering the regenerator by high-quality purification traps.|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{mechanism}} of void and microcrack formation along the adiabatic shear bands (ASB) was studied for processing dual phase steel by <b>cold</b> <b>heading.</b> Experimental investigation along with finite element simulation has confirmed that this mechanism depends on two types of instabilities, namely geometrical and thermal instabilities. The geometric instability occurs {{in the presence of}} second phase particles (inclusions) and in relation to the material flow orientation, whilst the thermal softening arises due to the localized plastic deformation inside the ASB. Progressive deformation was observed to cause the elongation of voids in the direction of shearing that formed microcracks in the ASB of the <b>cold</b> <b>headed</b> specimen.

50|$|Liquid helium {{is used as}} a coolant {{for most}} superconductive windings, even those with {{critical}} temperatures far above its boiling point of 4.2 K.

The magnet and coolant are contained in a thermally insulated container (dewar) called a cryostat. To keep the helium from boiling away, the cryostat is usually constructed with an outer jacket containing (significantly cheaper) liquid nitrogen at 77 K.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} cold forging processes is <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> of steel wire or rod to produce screws, bolts, nuts and rivets.

The current work aims at examining effects of pre-drawing on formability during <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> through numerical simulations.

The new model is implemented into ABAQUS/Explicit v 6. 4 by a user subroutine VUMAT, which is verified by one-element numerical tests under tension, compression and reverse loading conditions. In addition, for the purpose of comparison, the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model is also applied for the materials. The Cockroft and Latham criterion is employed to predict surface fracture. Although considerable discrepancies between the experimental and simulation results are observed, the proposed combined hardening model is more accurate in predicting material behavior in the reverse loading than the Johnson-Cook isotropic hardening model. In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed combined hardening material model has the potential to correctly predict the material behavior in the reverse loading process...|$|R
5000|$|This {{remarkable}} {{little boat}} {{has a history}} which does not reach very far back into the present century. With the assistance of Mr. William Errickson of Barnegat, and Dr. William P. Haywood of West Creek, Ocean County, New Jersey, I {{have been able to}} rescue from oblivion and bring to the light of day a correct history of the Barnegat sneak-box.Captain Hazelton Seaman, of West Creek village, New Jersey, a boat-builder and an expert shooter of wild-fowl, about the year 1836, conceived the idea of constructing for his own use a low-decked boat, or gunning-punt, in which, when its deck was covered with sedge, he could secrete himself from the wild-fowl while gunning in Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor bays.It was important that the boat should be sufficiently light to enable a single sportsman to pull her from the water on to the low points of the bay shores. During the winter months, when the great marshes were at times incrusted with snow, and the shallow creeks covered with ice,--obstacles which must be crossed to reach the open waters of the sound,--it would be necessary to use her as a sled, to effect which end a pair of light oaken strips were screwed {{to the bottom of the}} sneak-box, when she could be easily pushed by the gunner, and the transportation of the oars, sail, blankets, guns, ammunition, and provisions (all of which stowed under the hatch and locked up as snugly as if in a strong chest) became a very simple matter. While secreted in his boat, on the watch for fowl, with his craft hidden by a covering of grass or sedge, the gunner could approach within shooting-distance of a flock of unsuspicious ducks; and this being done in a sneaking manner (though Mr. Seaman named the result of his first effort the [...] "Devil's Coffin" [...] the bay-men gave her the sobriquet of [...] "SNEAK-BOX"; and this name she has retained to the present day).Since Captain Seaman built his [...] "Devil's Coffin," [...] forty years ago, the model has been improved by various builders, until it is believed that it has almost attained perfection. The boat has no sheer, and sets low in the water. This lack of sheer is supplied by a light canvas apron which is tacked to the deck, and presents, when stretched upward by a stick two feet long, a convex surface to a head sea. The water which breaks upon the deck, forward of the cockpit, is turned off at the sides of the boat in almost the same manner as a snow-plough clears a railroad track of snow. The apron also protects the head and shoulders of the rower from <b>cold</b> <b>head</b> winds.The first sneak-box built by Captain Seaman had a piece of canvas stretched upon an oaken hoop, so fastened to the deck that when a head sea struck the bow, the hoop and canvas were forced upward so as to throw the water off its sides, thus effectually preventing its ingress into the hold of the craft. The improved apron originated with Mr. John Crammer, Jr., a short time after Captain Seaman built the first sneak-box. The second sneak-box was constructed by Mr. Crammer; and afterwards Mr. Samuel Perine, an old and much respected bay-man, of Barnegat, built the third one. The last two men have finished their voyage of life, but [...] "Uncle Haze,"--as he is familiarly called by his many admirers,--the originator of the tiny craft which may well be called multum in parvo, and which carried me, its single occupant, safely and comfortably twenty-six hundred miles, from Pittsburgh to Cedar Keys, still lives at West Creek, builds yachts as well as he does sneak-boxes, and puts to the blush younger gunners by the energy displayed and success attained in the vigorous pursuit of wildfowl shooting in the bays which fringe the coast of Ocean County, New Jersey.A few years since, this ingenious man invented an improvement on the marine life-saving car, which has been adopted by the United States government; and during the year 1875 he constructed a new ducking-punt with a low paddle-wheel at its stern, for the purpose of more easily and secretly approaching flocks of wild-fowl.The peculiar advantages of the sneak-box were known to but few of the hunting and shooting fraternity, and, with the exception of an occasional visitor, were used only by the oystermen, fishermen, and wild-fowl shooters of Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor bays, until the New Jersey Southern Railroad and its connecting branches penetrated to the eastern shores of New Jersey, when educated amateur sportsmen from the cities quickly recognized in the little gunning-punt all they had long desired to combine in one small boat.Mr. Charles Hallock, in his paper the [...] "Forest and Stream," [...] of April 23, 1874, gave drawings and a description of the sneak-box, and fairly presented its claims to public favor.The sneak-box is not a monopoly of any particular builder, but it requires peculiar talent to build one,--the kind of talent which enables one man to cut out a perfect axe-handle, while the master-carpenter finds it difficult to accomplish the same thing. The best yacht-builders in Ocean County generally fail in modelling a sneak-box, while many second-rate mechanics along the shore, who could not possibly construct a yacht that would sail well, can make a perfect sneak-box, or gunning-skiff. All this may be accounted for by recognizing the fact that the water-lines of the sneak-box are peculiar, and differ materially from those of row-boats, sailboats, and yachts. Having a spoon-shaped bottom and bow, the sneak-box moves rather over the water than through it, and this peculiarity, together with its broad beam, gives the boat such stiffness that two persons may stand upright in her while she is moving through the water, and troll their lines while fishing, or discharge their guns, without careening the boat; a valuable advantage not possessed by our best cruising canoes.The boat sails well on the wind, though hard to pull against a strong head sea. A fin-shaped centre-board takes the place of a keel. It can be quickly removed from the trunk, or centre-board well, and stored under the deck. The flatness of her floor permits the sneak-box to run in very shallow water while being rowed or when sailing before the wind without the centre-board. Some of these boats, carrying a weight of three hundred pounds, will float in four to six inches of water.The favorite material for boat-building in the United States is white cedar (Cupressus thyoides), which grows in dense forests in the swamps along the coast of New Jersey, as well as in other parts of North America. The wood is both white and brown, soft, fine-grained, and very light and durable. No wood used in boat-building can compare with the white cedar in resisting the changes from a wet to a dry state, and vice versa. The tree grows tall and straight. The lower part of the trunk with the diverging roots furnish knee timbers and carlines for the sneak-box. The ribs or timbers, and the carlines, are usually 1 × 1 inches in dimension, and are placed about ten inches apart. The frame above and below is covered with half-inch cedar sheathing, which is not less than six inches wide. The boat is strong enough to support a heavy man upon its deck, and when well built will rank next to the seamless paper boats of Mr. Waters of Troy, and the seamless wooden canoes of Messrs. Herald, Gordon & Stephenson, of the province of Ontario, Canada, in freedom from leakage.During a cruise of twenty-six hundred miles not one drop of water leaked through the seams of the Centennial Republic. Her under planking was nicely joined, and the seams calked with cotton wicking, and afterwards filled with white-lead paint and putty. The deck planks, of seven inches width, were not joined, but were tongued and grooved, the tongues and grooves being well covered with a thick coat of white-lead paint.The item of cost is another thing to be considered in regard to this boat. The usual cost of a first-class canoe of seventy pounds' weight, built after the model of the Rob Roy or Nautilus, with all its belongings, is about one hundred and twenty-five dollars; and these figures deter many a young man from enjoying the ennobling and healthful exercise of canoeing. A first-class sneak-box, with spars, sail, oars, anchor, &c., can be obtained for seventy-five dollars, and if several were ordered by a club they could probably be bought for sixty-five dollars each. The price of a sneak-box, as ordinarily built in Ocean County, New Jersey, is about forty dollars. The Centennial Republic cost about seventy-five dollars, and a city boat-builder would not duplicate her for less than one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The builders of the sneak-boxes have not yet acquired the art of overcharging their customers; they do not expect to receive more than one dollar and fifty cents or two dollars per day for their labor; and some of them are even so unwise as to risk their reputation by offering to furnish these boats for twenty-five dollars each. Such a craft, after a little hard usage, would leak as badly as most cedar canoes, and would be totally unfit for the trials of a long cruise.The diagram given of the Centennial Republic will enable the reader of aquatic proclivities to understand the general principles upon which these boats are built. As they should be rated as third-class freight on railroads, it is more economical for the amateur to purchase a first-class boat at Barnegat, Manahawken, or West Creek, in Ocean County, New Jersey, along the Tuckerton Railroad, than to have a workman elsewhere, and one unacquainted with this peculiar model, experiment upon its construction at the purchaser's cost, and perhaps loss.One bright morning, in the early part of the fall of 1875, I trudged on foot down one of the level roads which lead from the village of Manahawken through the swamps to the edge of the extensive salt marshes that fringe the shores of the bay. This road bore the euphonious name of Eel Street, - so named by the boys of the town. When about half-way from its end, I turned off to the right, and followed a wooded lane to the house of an honest surf-man, Captain George Bogart, who had recently left his old home on the beach, beside the restless waves of the Atlantic, and had resumed his avocation as a sneak-box builder.|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Cemented carbide hardmetals have been produced since 1910 and have gradually taken over from tool steels as the major material for high speed metal cutting and forming. One such forming operation is that of <b>cold</b> <b>heading</b> used {{in the production of}} nail and screw fasteners. This operation subjects a cemented carbide die to cyclic compressive and tensile stresses and may be considered as a fatigue process. <b>Cold</b> <b>heading</b> manufacturers have always been aware that some dies will produce millions of components and yet others will fail after a much smaller number and, in view of this, have reasoned that the surface finish of the die may be limiting factor in die life. This research has been carried out to investigate how the surface finish. affects die life and to find if there is any numerical correlation between surface finish and life. Commercially manufactured cemented carbides were subject to fatigue trials using standard miniature Wohler specimens. The grades of materials used were B, N and TT with a cobalt content of 6, 6 and 25...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{drawing is}} a process that sizes and smooths the surface of steel before it is <b>cold</b> <b>headed</b> to produce bolts. The effect of the changes in the {{mechanical}} properties due to cold drawing on the surface strain and ductility during the upsetting process was analysed showing that the stress and strain state can be more readily altered by changes in the process conditions (friction and height-to-diameter ratio) to cause greater increase in the failure strains than can be achieved by pre-drawing...|$|R
