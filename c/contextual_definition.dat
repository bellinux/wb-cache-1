Frege attempts to explain our grasp of numbers through a <b>contextual</b> <b>definition</b> of the cardinality operation ('the number of...', or [...] ). He attempts to construct the content of a judgment involving numerical identity by relying on Hume's principle (which states {{that the number of}} Fs equals the number of Gs if and only if F and G are equinumerous, i.e. in one-one correspondence). He rejects this definition because it doesn't fix the truth value of identity statements when a singular term not of the form 'the number of Fs' flanks the identity sign. Frege goes on to give an explicit definition of number in terms of extensions of concepts, but expresses some hesitation.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} the Bolognese Glossators {{developed}} the primitive notion of a right ex-pressed in the Latin phrase “ius suum”, as they {{found it in the}} classical definition of jus-tice in Justinian’s Institutes, into the richer conception of a claim-right correlative to someone else’s duty. They did so by taking the breach of a contract as a paradigmatic model for an injustice and by regarding pacta sunt servanda as a <b>contextual</b> <b>definition</b> of a right [ius suum].

In its last section, I suggest that the conception of justice in terms of claim-right/duty-relations developed by the Glossators was adopted by Thomas Aquinas and informed his understanding of justice in general and of the Decalogue in particular.

In terms of content, Worthington, et al. distinguish two emphases; the first includes techniques derived from Scripture and the spiritual guidance literature; the second involves focus on Christian topics or issues as an emphasis of therapy or counseling. Crabb (1978) and Kirwan (1984) are examples of persons who emphasize the goals as what is distinctive about Christian counseling.

40|$|The {{categories}} {{referred to}} in textual descriptions are often defined by their context {Roth & Shoben, 1983).

Building on the available literature, this study explored lay definitions of happiness across nations and cultural dimensions, analyzing their components and relationship with participants’ demographic features. Participants were 2799 adults (age range= 30 - 60, 50 % women) living in urban areas of Argentina, Brazil, Croatia, Hungary, India, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa and United States. They completed the Eudaimonic and Hedonic Happiness Investigation (EHHI), reporting, among other information, their own definition of happiness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a mental model of {{knowledge}} as a concept map as an input to knowledge management (KM) investigations. This article’s extended knowledge concept map can serve as a resource where the investigation, development, or application of knowledge would be served with a broad mental model of knowledge. Previously unrelated concepts are related; knowledge concepts can sometimes be expressed as a range, i. e., certainty related states: view, opinion, sentiment, persuasion, belief, and conviction. Extrathesis is identified as a potential skill level higher than synthesis, and associated with the concepts: discovery, institution, insight (the event), revelation, or illumination that precedes innovation. Qualitative methods were used to gather and document concepts. System engineering and object analysis methods were applied to define and relate concepts. However, the theoretical sampling and theoretical saturation methods applied do not guarantee all appropriate concepts have been identified. Given the breadth, depth, and dimensionality of concepts of knowledge, later researchers may add additional concepts. This article provides evidence of additional things people know, an alternative to psychology’s acquaintanceship, understanding and placement of newer categorizations of knowledge in relation to older ones, and suggests that ranges for knowledge terms exist. This article extends the 2015 paper on this topic by: 1) taking a deeper look into epistemological terms and relationships, 2) providing <b>contextual</b> <b>definitions,</b> 3) suggesting extrathesis as an idea beyond synthesis, 4) updating the concept map; and 5) providing new insight on the overloaded knows including adding an eleventh know.

40|$|This study {{extends the}} {{understanding}} of leadership emergence from a relational perspective (Hosking, 2011; Cunliffe & Eriksen, 2011; Uhl-Bien, 2006), specifically related to the forming of trusting relationships. The argument follows from the conceptual development of subjectification processes referred to as “care of the self” (Foucault M., 1988; Foucault M., 2005) {{and the implications of}} “regimes of practices" (Foucault M., 2010; Dean, 2010). The findings contribute {{to our understanding of the}} relation between patterns of differentiation and reciprocity (as <b>contextual</b> <b>definitions)</b> and the relational emergence of leadership. We conceive leadership formed by actions that have no instrumental purpose beyond constructing a subject able to form trusting relationships and judge this to be a phronetic practice. The research is based on a case study of the executive team of a large copper mining company implementing a sustainability strategy that has as its central purpose the construction of trusting relations within a complex net of stakeholders. Based on this case, my second contribution is to conceptualise the function of “parrhēsia practice” (Foucault M., 2010), a “truth game” about truth, truth-telling and action in the relation of the self and others, which is significant in the formation of the relational leadership of the “conscious pariah” (Arendt, 1978). The study examines how it is that “truth games” of examining the self and “reframing” interactional patterns can facilitate the relational emergence of phronetic forms of leadership. The research methodology, designed to deal from a non-dualistic perspective with the relational emergence of leadership, uses a narrative research approach to describe practices (Czarniawska, Narratives in Social Science Research, 2011). It is “uncovered” as representational and dualistic in the research relation, and a discussion of how a non-dualistic research approach could be developed is provided...|$|R

Forms of telemedicine are appearing in health-care delivery, and are often integral to transforming health-care information technology. Despite this, the appropriate role of telemedicine in the delivery process remains ambiguous, at least partly because of its uncertain impact on costs.

The objectives of this paper are to review the state of telemedicine cost research, to examine major issues affecting the yield from this research, and finally to recommend strategies for improving future research.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the use, experience, and appropriation of everyday urban public spaces by Turkish immigrant {{women living in}} Enschede, the Netherlands. Based on the two premises of conceptualizing the urban public space as a social construct and of valorizing users as social actors, the main objective of this thesis is to explore and analyze the spatial practices and variety of conceptions and interpretations of everyday urban public spaces, presenting the multi-facetedness of Turkish immigrant women’s connections, orientations, and involvement with the urban space and social life. This thesis advocates a relational approach to urban public space, acknowledging everyday urban public space {{as a place of}} reciprocal dynamic relations full of symbols and power, wherein differences, like gender, class, and ethnicity are imbued in their social constructions and spatial representations. Turkish immigrant women, whose relations with space, both locational and transnational, influence the social construction of urban public spaces, are portrayed as active social actors constructing and reconstructing urban public spaces based on their own realities and meanings, derived from the conflicts, contestations, and coalitions of appropriation of urban public space. This thesis presents an in-depth analysis of Turkish immigrant women and their relational contexts, which in turn constrain, shape, or frame their spatial behavior and patterns of use and experience of public spaces, and at the same time, elaborates how different characteristics and kinds of urban public spaces condition the use and users’ spatial interactions. Publicness and privateness are interwoven in these <b>contextual</b> <b>definitions</b> in which Turkish immigrant women position themselves and others in a variety of public spaces in the city.
