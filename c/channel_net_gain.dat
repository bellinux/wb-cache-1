40|$|Small {{indigenous}} species (SIS) added to carp polyculture ponds in Nepal have increased production, economic returns, and nutritional well being for farmers. However, {{there has been}} little research to determine an optimal stocking density of SIS. Thus, the main objective of this experiment was to identify an optimal stocking density to promote overall pond production and profits of a typical six-­‐species carp polyculture system in Nepal. This was accomplished by comparing the effects of three different stocking densities of punti (Puntius sophore) and dedhuwa (Esomus danricus) on carp production, SIS <b>net</b> <b>gain,</b> SIS harvest, water quality, and economic returns. As expected SIS stocking density had no significant effect on carp production or water quality. Stocking density negatively affected dedhuwa <b>net</b> <b>gain,</b> which was the product of reproduction, survival, and immigration or emigration from ponds, but did not affect harvest. Conversely, stocking density did not affect punti <b>net</b> <b>gain,</b> but did positively affect harvest. Although stocked ponds experienced variable <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> of punti, they had higher harvests than ponds with no stocking. For dedhuwa and carp, isolation and average size at stocking best predicted <b>net</b> <b>gain.</b> Budget analysis showed stocking of SIS could increase profit by an average of $ 536 /yr. Although farmers often reported higher <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> without stocking SIS, stocking could create a more reliable harvest of punti and thus a more reliable source for household consumption or sales...|$|R

40|$|Software {{inspection}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective methods to detect defects. Reinspection repeats the inspection process for software products that are suspected to contain a significant number of undetected defects after an initial inspection. As a reinspection is often believed to be less efficient than an inspection an important question is whether a reinspection justifies its cost. In this paper we propose a cost-benefit model for inspection and reinspection. We discuss the impact of cost and benefit parameters on the <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> of a reinspection with empirical data from an experiment in which 31 student teams inspected and reinspected a requirements document. Main findings of the experiment are: a) For reinspection benefits and <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> were significantly lower than for the initial inspection. Yet, the reinspection yielded a positive <b>net</b> <b>gain</b> for most teams with conservative cost-benefit assumptions. b) Both the estimated benefits and number of major defects are key factors for reinspection <b>net</b> <b>gain,</b> which emphasizes the need for appropriate estimation techniques...|$|R
