40|$|Due to {{the scale}} and the {{decentralized}} nature of the Semantic Web, heterogeneities among concepts used are the rule rather than the exception. To provide a meaningful basis for tasks like reasoning over or discovery of semantic web services, similarity relationships must be defined among them in a semi-automatic way. Similarity computation schemes with single hierarchical <b>concept</b> <b>relations</b> are heavily studied, while the investigation of similarity under multiple <b>concept</b> <b>relations</b> as required in many application scenarios for semantic web services is still missing. Therefore, a novel algorithm was devised computing similarity in semantic nets by considering multiple <b>concept</b> <b>relations,</b> especially the fuzzy similarity <b>relations</b> between <b>concepts.</b> Empirical results obtained with this algorithm are presented. 1...|$|R

Whereas DAMIART com-bines knowledge from multiple data sources and multiple class ontologies, the proposed extension should also explore available ontologies over at-tributes.

40|$|Motivation: A major {{challenge}} in modern biology {{is to link}} genome sequence information to organismal function. In many organisms this is being done by characterising phenotypes resulting from mutations. Efficiently expressing phenotypic information requires combinatorial use of ontologies. However tools are not currently available to visualise combinations of ontologies. Here we describe CRAVE (<b>Concept</b> <b>Relation</b> Assay Value Explorer), a package allowing storage, active updating and visualization of multiple ontologies. Results: CRAVE is a web-accessible JAVA application that accesses an underlying MySQL database of ontologies via a JAVA persistent middleware layer (Chameleon). This maps the database tables into discrete JAVA classes and creates memory resident, interlinked objects corresponding to the ontology data. These JAVA objects are accessed via calls through the middleware’s API. CRAVE allows simultaneous display and linking of multiple ontologies and searching using Boolean and advanced searches...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the research on linguistic patterns focusing on the subclassOf relation for the semi-automatic construction of ontologies. Taking as a starting point those ontological structures corresponding to consensual modelling solutions, which are known as Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs), we identified the linguistic patterns that convey the relation captured in ODPs as Lexico-Syntactic Patterns (LSPs) and included them in an LSP-ODP pattern repository. LSPs will permit novice users the conversion of the domain field they want to model into an ontological structure. In the present contribution, the language of classification in Spanish is studied in order to collect the most common ways of verbally expressing the subclassOf relation. Then, the topology of the most common classification patterns is analysed to discover the type of ontological knowledge provided, i. e. which <b>concept</b> <b>relation,</b> and the two essential features in ontology knowledge: exhaustiveness and disjointness...|$|E
40|$|An {{ontology}} is {{a structured}} semantic model, composed of <b>concepts,</b> <b>relations</b> and instances. Data {{is a more}} primitive but concrete assembly of instances described by their attributes. An example of topic ontology is Open Directory of Web documents used in Google organizing documents into topics and subtopics, such as “Science”, “Arts”, etc. However, many ontologies are originally manually developed without making an explicit connection to the data. We hereby introduce the concept of ontology grounding, where the <b>concepts</b> and <b>relations</b> from the ontology become associated with the data. This enables us both to explain concepts in more concrete terms and to recognize them in the data. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Knowledge Agent Mediation Language (KNAML) is {{designed}} for use in multi-agent reasoning systems. Like conceptual graphs, KNAML represents knowledge using <b>concepts,</b> <b>relations,</b> and graphs. <b>Concepts</b> and <b>relations</b> are linked to form graphs, and graphs may be nested within other graphs. Additional constructs are used to support distributed reasoning and ontological concision. KNAML treats ontologies as knowledge domains that happen {{to be of the}} ontology domain. It uses an ontology of ontologies to define the <b>concept</b> and <b>relation</b> types available in an ontology. KNAML knowledge resources are modular to facilitate rapid development and efficient inter-agent processing. KNAML supports ontological specification of an extensible set of knowledge modalities, such as workflows, decision trees, and graphs that reflect the processing specializations of various knowledge agents and supports multi-modal knowledge authoring. Implemented in Java, KNAML supports subsumption, unification, and binding operations required by the host multi-agent system to carry out knowledge discovery and synthesis. ...|$|R

In this paper we present the PTree tool to test the accuracy of the automatic tagging and tree structure created by CRT from texts. The PTree tool is implemented from Java Universal Network / Graph Framework (JUNG) libraries.
