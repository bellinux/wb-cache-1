25|$|The holotype, JPM-0008, {{was found}} in the Sihedang {{locality}} of Jianchang County of northeastern China's Yixian Formation, which dates from the Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous (125–113 million years ago). The holotype specimen is represented by its sub-adult status, its nearly complete and articulated skeleton lacking only half of the tail, its well preserved skull and lower jaws, and its preservation of vaned feathers on the arms and tail. The fossil is compressed on its stone plate or slab. A <b>counterplate</b> is absent.|$|E
50|$|The holotype, BSP AS.I.745, was {{probably}} found at Mörnsheim near Daiting in {{a layer of}} the Malm Zeta 3, dating from the Tithonian. It consists of a partly articulated skeleton with skull, preserved on a plate and <b>counterplate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Douzhanopterus, a skeleton lacking the skull, is preserved {{on a plate}} and <b>counterplate.</b> The plate and <b>counterplate</b> are respectively catalogued as STM 19-35A and STM 19-35B, and they are stored at the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature in Shandong, China. This specimen was purchased from a local farmer, who claimed {{that it had been}} excavated at Toudaoyingzi, Jiangchang in Liaoning province. However, the rock encasing the specimen is characteristic of sediments found at another locality within Liaoning, Linglongta. The latter belongs to the fossil-rich units of the Tiaojishan Formation, which have been dated to 160.89 to 160.25 million years ago, or the Oxfordian stage of the Jurassic period.|$|E
50|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} for catapults, especially torsion devices, is rare. It {{is easy to}} see how stones from stone-throwers could survive, but organic sinews and wooden frames quickly deteriorate if left unattended. Usual remains include the all-important washers, as well as other metal supporting pieces, such as <b>counterplates</b> and trigger mechanisms. Still, the first major evidence of ancient or medieval catapults was found in 1912 in Ampurias. It was not until 1968-1969 that new catapult finds were discovered at Gornea and Orşova, then again in 1972 in Hatra, with more frequent discoveries thereafter.|$|R
5000|$|The holotype specimen, GMV-2129, {{was found}} {{near the village}} of Jianshangou in Liaoning province, in the Jianshangou Beds of the Hengdaozi Member of the Yixian Formation, at the time seen as a {{separate}} Chaomidianzi Formation. It consists of a plate and <b>counterplate,</b> GMV-2129a/b, showing a largely complete and articulated but compressed and somewhat damaged skeleton. Much of the feathering has been preserved in an excellent state of preservation.|$|E
50|$|Yi qi {{is known}} {{only from a}} single partial {{skeleton}} (holotype specimen STM 31-2) currently in the collections of the Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature. The fossil was compressed and is visible on a stone plate and a <b>counterplate.</b> It is largely articulated, including the skull, lower jaws, neck and limb bones but lacking most of the backbone, pelvis and tail. Yi was a relatively small animal, estimated to weigh about 380 g.|$|E
5000|$|The type species Shenqiornis mengi was in 2010 named and {{described}} by Wang Xuri, Jingmai Kathleen O'Connor, Zhao Bo, Luis María Chiappe, Gao Chunling and Cheng Xiaodong. The generic name combines {{a reference to}} Shenzhou 7 with a Greek ornis, [...] "bird". The specific name honours Meng Qingjin, {{the former director of}} the Dalian Natural History Museum. The holotype is DNHM D2950-2951, a plate and <b>counterplate</b> containing a largely complete skeleton of a subaldult.|$|E

5000|$|The holotype IVPP 10916 was in 1994 {{found in}} the Boluochi quarry by Zhou Zhonghe in a layer of the Jiufotang Formation dating from the late Aptian. It {{consists}} of the skull and {{the top half of}} the postcranial skeleton on a plate and <b>counterplate.</b> The bones have only been preserved as impressions. In 2002, Zhou named and described the type species Eocathayornis walkeri. The generic name combines a Greek ἠώς, eos, [...] "dawn", with Cathayormis, referring to the more basal build compared to the latter genus. The specific name honours Cyril Alexander Walker for his contributions to the study of the Enantiornithes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1855, in a {{sandstone}} quarry near Bückeburg on the Harrl, {{a fossil}} was found {{of a small}} dinosaur. Most of its bones were in a poor condition and removed on preparation, leaving two sets of hollow impressions on the plate and <b>counterplate.</b> The two plates do not overlap completely. The hollows, serving as a natural mold, have since been used to produce several casts in gypsum and latex to facilitate {{the study of the}} specimen. It was originally part of the collection of Max Ballerstedt preserved in the Bückeburg Gymnsasium Adolfinum but was in 1976 moved to the Georg-August-Universität Göttingen were it now resides {{in the collection of the}} Geowissenschaftliches Zentrum der Universität Göttingen.|$|E
5000|$|The fossil, holotype HG B016, was {{discovered}} by farmers near Xijianchang in the Early Cretaceous fossil deposits, the Yixian Formation, of the Jehol Biota, located in the Liaoning province of China. From 2012 it was studied by an international team of scientists led by Dr. Luis Chiappe, Director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The holotype consists of a rather complete skeleton with skull, compressed on a plate and <b>counterplate.</b> It shows extensive remains of the integument {{in the form of}} pennaceous feathers. In 2014, the specimen was described as the new genus and species Changyuraptor yangi. The generic name of the dinosaur combines the Chinese words for [...] "long feather", 長羽 (cháng yǔ), with Latin raptor ("robber", [...] "seizer"). The specific name honours researcher Professor Yang Yandong.|$|E
5000|$|The fossil of Docofossor brachydactylus, holotype BMNH 131735, {{along with}} that of Agilodocodon scansorius, was {{originally}} found by farmers near Nanshimen {{in the province of}} Hebei in a layer of the Chinese Tiaojishan Formation (Oxfordian) and acquired by the Beijing Museum of Natural History. The holotype consists of a compressed skeleton with skull and lower jaws, preserved on a plate and <b>counterplate,</b> along with soft-tissue remnants. The shoulder girdle area and the tail have been damaged. The type species Docofossor brachydactylus was named and described by Luo Zhexi, Meng Qingjin, Ji Qiang, Liu Di, Zhang Yuguang, and April I. Neander in the journal Science in 2015. The generic name refers to the membership of the Docodonta and a burrowing lifestyle, fossor meaning [...] "digger" [...] in Latin. The specific name is derived from Greek βραχύς, [...] "short", and δάκτυλος, [...] "finger", referring to the reduction of the finger phalanges.|$|E
50|$|The holotype of Aurorazhdarcho, NMB Sh 110, {{was found}} in the Upper Eichstätt Formation dating to the early Tithonian stage of the Late Jurassic, 150 million years ago. It {{consists}} of a nearly complete skeleton, three-dimensionally preserved on a single slab with the <b>counterplate</b> having been removed, lacking the skull and neck. However, the head and neck are present as impressions, movement of these elements {{on the bottom of the}} lagoon the carcass descended on leaving a natural mould covered by organic remains in the form of calcium phosphate flakes made visible by the UV-photography of Tischlinger. That the head and neck are now absent is explained by the animal being killed by a partially failed attack by a predator, almost ripping off these parts, after which the body quickly sank. Subsequent bloating would then have caused the head to drift away. The individual was probably subadult and, as indicated by the fusion of the ischiopubes in the pelvis, a male as it lacks a wide birth canal.|$|E
5000|$|The holotype {{skeleton}} of Sinornis, BPV 538a-b, {{consists of a}} plate and <b>counterplate</b> of fine-grained freshwater lake sediment as proven by numerous fish, insect, and plant remains. The skeleton {{was found in the}} Jiufotang Formation at Liaoning, People's Republic of China. The skeleton exhibits remarkable basal features shared with Archaeopteryx, a genus of early bird that is transitional between older feathered dinosaurs and modern birds. Until the discovery of Sinornis scientists did not know much about the evolution of flight that lead to modern birds because Archaeopteryx, which lived in the Late Jurassic period around 150 million years ago, lacks many of the modern flight and perching of modern birds. Some of the primitive features found in Sinornis include moderately recurved manual unguals, as opposed to the high-recurved one in Archaeopteryx. Sinornis shares a similar pelvis with the latter genus, but its pelvic girdle has free elements unlike the fused ones found in modern birds. The iliac blades are erect and the ischium is blade-shaped rather than strap-shaped. Analogous to Archaeopteryx and older theropod dinosaurs, its pubis appears to be directed more ventrally and terminates distally in a hook-shaped [...] "boot".|$|E
5000|$|The {{specimen}} preserved {{along with}} an egg (nicknamed [...] "Mrs T"), described by Lü and colleagues in 2011, offers insight into the reproductive strategies of Darwinopterus and pterosaurs in general. Like the eggs of later pterosaurs and modern reptiles, the eggs of Darwinopterus had a parchment-like, soft shell. In modern birds, the eggshell is hardened with calcium, completely shielding the embryo from the outside environment. Soft-shelled eggs are permeable, and allow significant amounts of water to be absorbed into the egg during development. Eggs of this type are more vulnerable to the elements and are typically buried in soil. The eggs of Darwinopterus would have weighed about 6 g when they were laid, but due to moisture intake, they may have doubled in weight {{by the time of}} hatching. The eggs were small compared {{to the size of the}} mother (the [...] "Mrs T" [...] specimen weighed between 110 g and 220 g), also more like modern reptiles than birds. David Unwin, a co-author of the paper, suggested that Darwinopterus probably laid many small eggs at a time and buried them, and that juveniles could fly upon hatching, requiring little to no parental care. These results imply that reproduction in pterosaurs was more like that in modern reptiles and significantly differed from reproduction in birds. However, in 2015, the <b>counterplate</b> of the specimen was reported, IVPP V18403, which showed a single additional egg present in the body, indicating that there were two active ovaries, producing a single egg at a time.|$|E
