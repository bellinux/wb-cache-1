5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to <b>confuse</b> a third organism. This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian. Both involve aposematic coloration, or warning signals, to avoid being attacked by a predator.|$|E

5|$|Operations Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{tactical}} military deceptions {{conducted on}} 6 June 1944 {{in support of}} the Allied landings in Normandy. The operations formed the naval component of Operation Bodyguard, a wider series of tactical and strategic deceptions surrounding the invasion. Small boats, along with aircraft from RAF Bomber Command, simulated invasion fleets approaching Cap d'Antifer, Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Glimmer and Taxable played on the German belief, amplified by Allied deception efforts over the preceding months, that the main invasion force would land in the Calais region. Big Drum was positioned on the western flank of the real invasion force to try to <b>confuse</b> German forces about the scale of the landings. These operations complemented Operation Titanic, which was intended to <b>confuse</b> the Germans about the D-Day airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{is a form}} {{of military}} deception in which a ship is painted in one or more colors in order to obscure or <b>confuse</b> an enemy's visual observation. Several types of marine camouflage have been used or prototyped: blending or crypsis, in which a paint scheme attempts to hide a ship from view; deception, in which a ship is made to look smaller or, as with the Q-ships, to mimic merchantmen; and dazzle, a chaotic paint scheme which tries to <b>confuse</b> any estimate of distance, direction, or heading. Counterillumination, to hide a darkened ship against the slightly brighter night sky, was trialled by the Royal Canadian Navy in diffused lighting camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} colour of {{the cap and}} pores {{make it hard to}} <b>confuse</b> {{with other}} species. Often found in similar habitats is S.variegatus, though this species has a granular cap and dark olive pores, which are smaller and not decurrent. It can also bruise blue.|$|E

In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes <b>confused</b> with Kéknyelű while {{on the island of}} Korčula, in Croatia, the grape has been <b>confused</b> with Pošip. The Romanian wine grape Grasă de Cotnari and the Bosnian wine grape Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often <b>confused</b> with the grape.|$|R
5|$|The easiest {{species to}} <b>confuse</b> with the Carolina wren is Bewick's wren, which differs in being smaller {{but with a}} longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the house wren in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their culmen has a notch behind the tip.|$|E
5|$|The sea-firefly {{is a small}} {{crustacean}} {{living in}} sediment. At rest it emits a dull glow but when disturbed it darts away leaving a cloud of shimmering blue light to <b>confuse</b> the predator.

5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to <b>confuse</b> them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E

Before the NFL Championship Game against the Washington Redskins, Shaughnessy devised a series of counter plays to <b>confuse</b> their opponent, which on game film had shown a tendency to shift linebackers {{in the direction of}} the motion man. His preparations helped Chicago rout Washington, 73–0.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to <b>confuse</b> onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback {{to keep in mind}} is that these methods can <b>confuse</b> long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{decomposition}} paradigm is entirely independent and {{different from that}} of model of computation, but the two are often <b>confused,</b> most often in the cases of the functional model of computation being <b>confused</b> with procedural decomposition, and of the actor model of computation being <b>confused</b> with object oriented decomposition.|$|R

5|$|Glimmer, Taxable and Big Drum were World War II {{deception}} operations. They {{were conducted}} {{as part of}} Operation Bodyguard, a broad strategic military deception intended to support the Allied invasion of German-occupied France in June 1944. Bodyguard was designed to <b>confuse</b> the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the invasion. The London Controlling Section (LCS) had spent some time convincing German commanders that the fictional First United States Army Group (FUSAG) represented {{the bulk of the}} Allied invasion force. FUSAG's existence was fabricated through Operation Fortitude South.|$|E
5|$|In January or February 1939, Metzger, now a {{scriptwriter}} for Terra Filmkunst, {{mentioned his}} idea to Wolfgang Ebbecke {{with whom he}} was working on the script for Central Rio. Ebbecke shot down the idea, raising a number of objections including the fact that Mendes had already done a film on the same topic in England and the concern that German audiences might <b>confuse</b> the proposed film with Feuchtwanger's novel which was not antisemitic.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} {{is done by}} {{a select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and <b>confuse</b> the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught one by one and killed.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{molluscs}} such as sea hares, cuttlefish, squid and octopuses {{give themselves}} a {{last chance to}} escape by distracting their attackers. To do this, they eject a mixture of chemicals, which may mimic food or otherwise <b>confuse</b> predators. In response to a predator, animals in these groups release ink, creating a cloud, and opaline, affecting the predator's feeding senses, causing it to attack the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at Cap Nègre to {{the west}} of the main invasion, a large group of French commandos {{destroyed}} German artillery emplacements as part of Operation Romeo. Their main effort was supported by diversionary flank landings by other commando teams. While the main mission succeeded, 67 French commandos were taken prisoner after they ran into a minefield. In addition to the commando operations, another operation was carried out, named Operation Span. This was a deception plan, aimed to <b>confuse</b> the German defenders with fake landings and paratroopers, to disperse them from the actual landing zones.|$|E
5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} <b>confuse</b> the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One {{of the key}} elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (although they had earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E
