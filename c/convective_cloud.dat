40|$|Abstract. Aerosols {{affect the}} climate system by {{changing}} cloud characteristics in many ways. They act as cloud condensation and ice nuclei and may have an influence on the hydrological cycle. Here we investigate aerosol effects on <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> by extending the double-moment cloud microphysics scheme developed for stratiform clouds, which is coupled to the HAM double-moment aerosol scheme, to <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> in the ECHAM 5 general circulation model. This enables us to investigate whether more, and smaller cloud droplets suppress the warm rain formation in the lower parts of <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> and thus release more latent heat upon freezing, which would then result in more vigorous convection and more precipitation. In ECHAM 5, including aerosol effects in large-scale and <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> (simulation ECHAM 5 -conv) reduces {{the sensitivity of the}} liquid water path increase with increasing aerosol optical depth in better agreement with observations and large-eddy simulation studies.

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year in the easternmost parts, while in the western parts most of the precipitation is concentrated during the summer months and winters are drier. In many places precipitation, which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms, is high during summer. These thunderstorms form when cold air from the south, caused by the pampero wind, meets humid tropical air masses from the north, and {{are some of the most}} intense storms in the world, with the most frequent lightning and the highest <b>convective</b> <b>cloud</b> tops. These severe thunderstorms produce intense amounts of precipitation [...] and hailstorms, and can cause both floods and flash floods. As well, the Pampas is the most consistently active tornado region outside the central and southeastern United States. Autumn and spring bring periods of very rainy weather followed by dry, mild stretches. Places in the east receive rainfall throughout autumn, whereas in the west it quickly becomes very dry. Winters are drier in most places due to weaker easterly winds, and stronger southerly winds, which prevent moist air from coming in. In winter, most of the precipitation occurs from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (sudestada), which bring long periods of precipitation, and cloudiness, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. As such, precipitation is more evenly distributed in the eastern parts than the western parts, which are further away from these frontal systems. Dull, grey, and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Snowfall is extremely rare; when it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{high-resolution}} numerical simulation (Large-Eddie Simulation, LES) {{has been used}} to study the characteristic factors causing and influencing the development of moist <b>convective</b> <b>clouds.</b> Through this work a 1 D cloud-model was derived from first principles to represent the vertical profile of individual <b>convective</b> <b>clouds.</b> A microphysics framework was implemented to ensure identical behaviour in LES and cloud-model integration where the microphysical processes represented are numerically integrated using a novel adaptive step microphysics integration which uses the physical speed at which a process takes place to adjust the integration step size (in space and time). This work also introduces a simple representation of cloud-droplet formation which allows for super-saturation to exist in-cloud and through this provide more physical representation of the in-cloud state. Together with high-resolution simulation of isolated individual and interacting multiple clouds in environmental conditions leading to shallow convection, the 1 D cloud-model was used to infer that the principal influence on moist <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> is the entrainment of air from a cloud’s immediate environment which is significantly different from the environmental mean state. This suggests that convection parameterisations must represent the influence of moist convective downdrafts to properly predict the vertical structure of <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> so as to correctly predict the cloud-top height and vertical transport. Finally it was found that cloud-base radius is not in itself adequate as a means of classification for defining cloud-types as clouds with the same cloud-base radius showed large variation (≈ 600 m) in cloud-top height. Based on simulations of individual <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> it was found that 3 D simulations are necessary to capture the full dynamic behaviour of <b>convective</b> <b>clouds</b> (2 D axisymmetric simulations have too little entrainment) and that agreement with the 1 D cloud-model could only be found when entrainment was diagnosed from simulation instead of being parameterised by the traditional Morton-Turner model and only for 2 D axisymmetric simulations, suggesting that the 1 D cloud-model will require further extension or the diagnosis of entrainment improved...|$|R
