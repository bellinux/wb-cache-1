5|$|Plinian eruptions (or Vesuvian) are {{a type of}} {{volcanic}} eruption, named for the historical eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD that buried the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum and, specifically, for its chronicler Pliny the Younger. The process powering Plinian eruptions starts in the magma chamber, where dissolved volatile gases are stored in the magma. The gases vesiculate and accumulate as they rise through the magma <b>conduit.</b> These bubbles agglutinate and once they reach a certain size (about 75% of the total volume of the magma <b>conduit)</b> they explode. The narrow confines of the <b>conduit</b> force the gases and associated magma up, forming an eruptive column. Eruption velocity {{is controlled by the}} gas contents of the column, and low-strength surface rocks commonly crack under the pressure of the eruption, forming a flared outgoing structure that pushes the gases even faster.|$|E
5|$|The spring {{still exists}} {{and is now}} the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in {{dissolved}} calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the <b>conduit.</b> This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter. Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the <b>conduit.</b> It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the <b>conduit</b> scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water <b>conduit</b> was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the <b>conduit</b> were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
40|$|We analyze asset-backed {{commercial}} paper <b>conduits</b> which {{played a central}} role in the early phase of the financial crisis of 2007 - 09. Using a novel data set, we document that commercial banks set up <b>conduits</b> to securitize assets without transferring risks to outside investors. We find that banks achieved this by providing credit and liquidity guarantees to <b>conduits.</b> Consistent with the implied lack of risk transfer, we show that investors in <b>conduits</b> have had almost no losses during the crisis in spite of deteriorating quality of the collateral backing <b>conduits.</b> The guarantees to <b>conduits</b> were designed to avoid capital requirements and banks facing more stringent capital requirements – commercial banks – were more likely to set up <b>conduits</b> and do so with full guarantees. Thus, we interpret <b>conduits</b> as a form of regulatory arbitrage that allowed banks to take on exposure to tail risks that were systemic in nature. Consistent with such a risk-taking motive, we find that banks with more exposure to <b>conduits</b> had lower stock returns and greater widening of credit default swap spreads around 9 August 2007, the date of freeze in the asset-backed {{commercial paper}} market and inception of the financial crisis...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>conduits</b> {{minimize}} {{their credit}} risk by holding a diversified portfolio {{of high quality}} assets.

5|$|An {{important}} {{landmark in}} Fleet Street {{during the late}} Middle Ages was a <b>conduit</b> {{that was the main}} water supply for the area. When Anne Boleyn was crowned Queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533, the <b>conduit</b> flowed wine instead of water. By the 16th century, Fleet Street, along with much of the City, was chronically overcrowded, and a Royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street. This had little effect, and construction continued, particularly timber. Prince Henry's Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of James I, who did not survive to succeed his father.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon III, {{who had a}} great {{admiration for}} all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close {{interest}} in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisné to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855–58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct.

40|$|We analyze asset-backed {{commercial}} paper <b>conduits,</b> which experienced a shadow-banking “run ” {{and played a}} central role in the early phase of the financial crisis of 2007 - 09. We document that commercial banks set up <b>conduits</b> to securitize assets worth $ 1. 3 trillion while insuring the newly securitized assets using explicit guarantees. We show that regulatory arbitrage was the main motive behind setting up conduits: the guarantees were structured so as to reduce regulatory capital requirements, more so by banks with less capital, and while still providing recourse to bank balance sheets for outside investors. Consistent with such recourse, we find that <b>conduits</b> provided little risk transfer during the “run”: losses from <b>conduits</b> remained with banks rather than outside investors and banks with more exposure to <b>conduits</b> had lower stock returns.

40|$|Abstract Background Nerve <b>conduits</b> {{provide a}} {{promising}} strategy for {{peripheral nerve injury}} repair. However, the efficiency of nerve <b>conduits</b> to enhance nerve regeneration and functional recovery is often inferior to that of autografts. Nerve <b>conduits</b> require additional factors such as cell adhesion molecules and neurotrophic factors {{to provide a more}} conducive microenvironment for nerve regeneration. Methods In the present study, poly{(lactic acid) - co -[(glycolic acid) - alt -(L-lysine) ]} (PLGL) was modified by grafting Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Gly (RGD peptide) and nerve growth factor (NGF) for fabricating new PLGL-RGD-NGF nerve <b>conduits</b> to promote nerve regeneration and functional recovery. PLGL-RGD-NGF nerve <b>conduits</b> were tested in the rat sciatic nerve transection model. Rat sciatic nerves were cut off to form a 10 mm defect and repaired with the nerve <b>conduits.</b> All of the 32 Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: group PLGL-RGD-NGF, group PLGL-RGD, group PLGL and group autograft. At 3 months after surgery, the regenerated rat sciatic nerve was evaluated by footprint analysis, electrophysiology, and histologic assessment. Experimental data were processed using the statistical software SPSS 10. 0. Results The sciatic function index value of groups PLGL-RGD-NGF and autograft was significantly higher than those of groups PLGL-RGD and PLGL. The nerve conduction velocities of groups PLGL-RGD-NGF and autograft were significantly faster than those of groups PLGL-RGD and PLGL. The regenerated nerves of groups PLGL-RGD-NGF and autograft were more mature than those of groups PLGL-RGD and PLGL. There {{was no significant difference between}} groups PLGL-RGD-NGF and autograft. Conclusions PLGL-RGD-NGF nerve <b>conduits</b> are more effective in regenerating nerves than both PLGL-RGD nerve <b>conduits</b> and PLGL nerve <b>conduits.</b> The effect is as good as that of an autograft. This work established the platform for further development of the use of PLGL-RGD-NGF nerve <b>conduits</b> for clinical nerve repair. </p...|$|R

5|$|As {{the city}} water supply from Aldershawe was {{diminishing}} {{in the early}} 19th century, money was spent diverting surface waters from 'Swan Moggs' into a common <b>conduit.</b> The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: Peripheral nerve {{injury is}} common in trauma {{patients}} and 4. 5 % of all soft-tissue injuries are accompanied by defects of peripheral nerve. Peripheral nerve injuries can lead to lifetime loss of function and permanent disfigurement. Designed <b>conduits</b> com-prised of natural and synthetic materials are now widely used {{in the construction of}} damaged tissues. The aim of this project was to prepare nanocomposite <b>conduits</b> from gelatin and bioglass for damaged peripheral nerve reconstruction. Materials & Methods: In this experimental study,compound water solution of gelatin and nano bioglass synthesized through sol gel method, was made. After preparing the solution, special mandrels were dipped in solution several times and freeze dried in order to be emptied of wa-ter via sublimation. The <b>conduits</b> had the following dimensions: internal diameter: 1. 6 mm, outside diameter: 2. 2 mm and length about 12 mm. In order to evaluate the biocompatibility of <b>conduits</b> we used cytotoxicity test by Chinese ovary cells and MTT assay by Miapaca- 2 (pancreatic cancer cell line). Results: The prepared nano bioglass and <b>conduits</b> were characterized using transmission elec-tron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction.
