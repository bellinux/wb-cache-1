25|$|In 1954, a columbarium was {{controversially}} {{built at}} the rear of the church. Columbariums, walls with niches for the ashes of the dead, became more common at churches and cemeteries, in response to the increased acceptance of cremation. Australia's first columbarium was built in Box Hill in Victoria in 1929. <b>Cremation</b> <b>services</b> first became available in Queensland in September 1934, when the Mount Thompson crematorium opened. The following year a columbarium was provided at Mount Thompson. By 1936, 13% of people interred in Brisbane were being cremated. The increased popularity of cremation led to requests for ashes to be deposited at Anglican churches. The Archbishop of the time, Dr William Wand, publicly opposed placing ashes in the main body of the church, preferring a designated annex such as a remodelled crypt or eastward extension. Queensland's first columbaria within churches were built at Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Woolloongabba and St Mark's Anglican Church, Warwick in 1938. The first external columbarium was incorporated into an outer wall of St Mary's Church at Kangaroo Point in 1949.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the cremation ceremony {{in the context}} of the life of the inhabitants of a Balinese community, tracing relationships between ritual itinerary and topography, and highlighting tensions and conflicts that have emerged between these ritual traditions and recent developments in tourism. The unique feature of the cremation ceremony is not only its procession, and particular architectural forms, but also the accompanying festival events that parade from the house of the deceased to the cemetery. In the investigation I will explore the historically important site of the Tabanan Palace that forms the geographical and symbolic focus of the ceremony and the route of the procession {{in the context of}} the <b>cremation</b> <b>service</b> with its community of participants/onlookers. The processions, and their related rituals, have long been recognised as an integral part of the civic life of the community, which is increasingly being jeopardised as a result of the impact of commercial use. The investigation asks if the preservation of these ceremonies can exist in harmony with these recent developments, without undermining the still vibrant traditional practices of Balinese society...|$|R

Irritated by their act, Suri Babu and Sathi Babu kidnap Malliswari. They tie her to a chair and then hatch another plan to make Achi Babu believe that Malliswari is dead. In that process, they dig a 'fresh' dead body from a crematorium, pack her in the car of Malliswari and throw that car into a valley. Police confirms that Malliswari is dead and Achi Babu's heart breaks again. Then appears Venkata Lakshmi (Anita Hassanandani), the childhood sweetheart of Achi Babu. Venkata Lakshmi has another flashback [...] As she was staying in her elder sisters house, her husband becomes attracted to her and one night when she was asleep,he comes to her bedroom and makes love with her.
