40|$|A bank {{holding company}} is holding an {{investment}} in perpetual preferred stocks for which the market value {{is less than the}} original cost. The company has historically accounted for the investment as long-term marketable securities under Statement 12 and deducted a valuation allowance from equity. The company entered into a redemption agreement with another party in which that party agrees to redeem at par in 26 years the preferred stock held by the company. During the term of the agreement, the company will pay the other party a fee each quarter, unless the agreement is terminated by the company by payment of a <b>cancellation</b> <b>penalty.</b> The company reversed the valuation allowance previously provided for the preferred stocks under the provisions of Statement 12 and recognized the fees to the other party as future yield adjustment on the preferred stock. The issue is how the redemption agreement should be recorded and what effect it has on the accounting for the preferred stock.

5000|$|Customers {{soon found}} there were {{drawbacks}} to the policies. The interest rates paid {{after the first}} year dropped dramatically. However, annuitants were discouraged from withdrawing their money by high <b>cancellation</b> <b>penalties</b> ($1,000 for a $10,000 investment).|$|R
50|$|Following {{the lead}} of the UK and Italy, the Canadian {{government}} placed a C$4.4 billion order in 1987 for 48 (later 42) EH101s to replace the Canadian Forces's Sikorsky CH-124 Sea Kings and Boeing Vertol CH-113 Labradors. These were to be assembled in Canada under the designations CH-148 Petrel (33 originally, reduced to 28) and CH-149 Chimo (15) in the anti-submarine warfare and air-sea rescue roles respectively. The replacement programme was cancelled, however, after a change of government in 1993, leading to the payment of $157.8 million in <b>cancellation</b> <b>penalties.</b>|$|R
50|$|In September 2008, {{consumers}} filed a {{class action}} lawsuit with the Los Angeles Superior Court to stop DirecTV's practice of charging early <b>cancellation</b> <b>penalties</b> to subscribers. The lawsuit claims that DirecTV fails to disclose the penalty to new customers or to existing customers who replace their equipment or add a new receiver, and that these practices are unlawful. In September 2009, a motion for a preliminary injunction was filed to block the company from automatically removing the fees from customers’ bank accounts or charging their credit card accounts without their prior knowledge and written consent until the lawsuit is resolved.|$|R
40|$|Incomplete {{and under}} {{revision}} – Please do not circulate† This paper examines {{a model in}} which individuals contract with one another along {{the branches of a}} fixed network and then select verifiable productive actions with ex-ternally enforced transfers. Special cases of the model include most settings of con-tracting with externalities that have been studied in the literature. The model allows for a type of externality that the previous literature has not explored fully—where a party is unable to contract directly with others whose actions affect his payoffs. The pa-per investigates the prospects for efficient outcomes under various contract-formation protocols (“contracting institutions”) and network structures. There are contracting institutions that always yield efficient equilibria for any connected network. A critical property is that the institutions allow for sequential contract formation or cancellation. The equilibrium construction features assurance contracts and <b>cancellation</b> <b>penalties.</b> ∗UC San Diego...|$|R
25|$|In 1992, it was {{announced}} that the Labradors were to be replaced by 15 new helicopters, a variant of the AgustaWestland EH101, designated CH-149 Chimo. The order was subsequently cancelled by the Jean Chrétien Liberal government in 1993, resulting in <b>cancellation</b> <b>penalties,</b> as well as extending the service life of the Labrador fleet. However, in 1998, a CH-113 from CFB Greenwood crashed on Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula while returning from a SAR mission, resulting in the deaths of all crewmembers on board. The crash placed pressure upon the government to procure a replacement, thus an order was placed with the manufacturers of the EH101 for 15 aircraft to perform the search-and-rescue mission, designated CH-149 Cormorant. CH-149 deliveries began in 2003, allowing the last CH-113 to be retired in 2004. In October 2005 Columbia Helicopters of Aurora, Oregon purchased eight of the retired CH-113 Labradors to add to their fleet of 15 Vertol 107-II helicopters.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This thesis {{presents}} an integrated passive self-interference mitigation (SIM) technique for FDD Radios. A new structure, Four Port Canceller (FPC) serves a dual {{function as a}} receiver (RX) input matching network, and provides an auxiliary path from transmitter (TX) to RX, used for leakage <b>cancellation,</b> with minimal <b>penalty</b> on the RX noise figure (NF), power consumption and silicon area. An example of this technique {{is applied to the}} design of WCDMA front-end including the FPC, a low noise amplifier (LNA) and an emulated power amplifier (PA) in a 40 nm, 6 -metal-layer TSMC CMOS process. A measured TX leakage suppression of more than 20 dB is achieved with TX power level from 5 dBm to 30 dBm, over a bandwidth of 5 MHz...|$|R
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Wallace's fondness for the colour pink. Shortly after being elected, while {{referring}} to Mary Mitchell O'Connor in Dáil Éireann, he said [...] "Miss Piggy has toned it down a bit today". He accepted full responsibility and later apologised, saying [...] "It was my fault. I passed the reference because of her handbag. I'm completely out of order. I don't have a leg to stand on [...] Clearly it was in bad taste." [...] He called Mitchell O'Connor to apologise and said he would write a letter of apology to her as well. In reference to his fondness for pink, Wallace dyed his hair that colour to raise awareness of cancer in February 2015. Since being elected to the Dáil {{together for the first time}} in 2011, Wallace and Dublin North TD Clare Daly have become friends and political allies, and have worked together on many campaigns, including opposition to austerity and revelations of various alleged Garda malpractices, including harassment, <b>cancellation</b> of <b>penalty</b> points in questionable circumstances and involvement of officers in the drug trade. In July 2014 they were both arrested at Shannon Airport while trying to inspect a military aircraft. Wallace said, [...] "All we wanted to do was confirm whether we are being told the truth." [...] Wallace was fined €2,000 for being in an airside area without permission, and chose not to pay. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in default, and in December 2015 was arrested for non-payment of the fine.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{behavioral changes}} in a large cohort of drivers to identify underlying causes {{of the decline in}} road casualties in France. In 2001 and 2004, 11240 participants used self-administered questionnaires to report attitudes toward road safety and driving behaviors. Injury road traffic collisions were recorded from 2001 to 2005 through the cohort's annual questionnaire. Between 2001 and 2004, speeding and cell phone use decreased concomitantly with a decrease in injury road traffic collision rates among participants. Reported driving while sleepy remained unchanged and driving while alcohol intoxicated was reported by a higher proportion in 2004 than in 2001. Decreases in speeding between 2001 and 2004 were strongly linked with positive attitudes toward road safety in 2001. In this cohort, speeding and using a cell phone while driving decreased over the 2001 to 2004 period concomitantly with increases in traffic law enforcement and a dramatic decline in road mortality in France. However, the deterrent effect of traffic enforcement policies may have been reduced by negative attitudes toward traffic safety and having had a history of traffic <b>penalty</b> <b>cancellations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The 1964 Labour {{government}} {{inherited a}} substantial balance-of-payments deficit. In {{an effort to}} deal with the attendant economic crisis, the government sought to cancel a number of costly, high-prestige projects, including the Franco-British supersonic airliner Concorde. When the possible ramifications of this were considered, however, it was discovered that the agreement covering the aircraft was not commercial but carried the full force of an international treaty. The clear implication of this was that a withdrawing party could be subject to heavy financial <b>penalties.</b> <b>Cancellation,</b> therefore, it was argued, was likely to cost even more than continuing with the project would. The question remains as to how such a remarkable situation had come about. This article analyses the negotiations between Britain and France concerning Concorde, particularly in the early 1960 s, which eventually led to the signing of the treaty in 1962. It examines the political, technological, and economic imperatives which underpinned the negotiations and the relationships between the two governments and their respective aviation industries. It also considers the motives of both the British and French governments in the process, and concludes that in each case that the technological and political motives overrode economic considerations...|$|R
5000|$|November/ December 2012 {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of some independent TD's alleging Gardai had unlawfully cancelled road traffic tickets and penalty points and naming individuals in the Dail who it was alleged had broken the law. Shatter stated that caution should be exercised in assuming all the allegations made were accurate pending the completion of an investigation , expressed concern about individuals being so named and promised to publish the investigation report. In December 2012 he also stated that if following completion of the investigation he had any remaining concerns he would refer the issue to the independent Garda Inspectorate. In May 2013 he published two Garda reports. They established that in approx 2.5% of cases examined there had been a failure to properly comply with Garda procedures and recommended the introduction of reforms. Shatter described some of the decisions made cancelling penalty points as [...] " [...] exotic" [...] and defying common sense, published a code of practice to apply in the future and requested an independent report from the Garda Inspectorate. It was published 9 months later, proposed further reforms and endorsed Shatter's code of practice. In March 2014 Shatter announced the governments agreement to implement all of the recommended reforms. When publishing the May 2013 Reports Shatter acknowledged the role played by a Garda whistle blower in identifying Garda failures while expressing concern about some inaccurate allegations made that had been widely publicised and fuelled some of the political and media controversy relating to the issue, including an inaccurate allegation that 7 individuals had died in traffic accidents because of the <b>cancellation</b> of <b>penalty</b> points. In the Dail in October 2013 he criticised a whistleblower for not co- operating with the original Garda investigation into his allegations. This generated further controversy and criticism of Shatter by his political opponents. Following publication of the Garda Inspectorates report he apologised to the whistleblower in the Dail , explaining he understood the whistleblower had co-operated with the Inspectorate and that he now believed the Gardai should have done more to engage with him prior to May 2013.|$|R
