The aim of the trial was to compare the acceptance of vitamin D(3) dissolved in alcohol or in medium-chain triglycerides among mothers of Swiss newborn infants. The acceptance was tested in 42 healthy newborn infants (20 girls and 22 boys) aged between 2 and 7 days. Their neonatal body weight ranged between 2. 225 and 4. 150 kg, and the gestational age between 36 1 / 7 and 41 3 / 7 weeks. The blinded mothers rated the facial reaction of their children by pointing on a facial hedonic scale. Thirty eight of the 41 mothers, who brought the comparison to completion, assigned a better score to the oily preparation with {{no difference in the}} remaining three cases (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001).

40|$|Introduction: Surgical site infections (SSIs) {{remain the}} most common health care {{associated}} infections in the surgical population. Preoperative surgical preparation solutions containing alcohol {{are believed to be}} best at eradicating skin microorganisms. The efficacy of alcohol is concentration dependant, with a concentration of greater than 60 % most bactericidal. Surgical antisepsis guidelines do not stipulate how long <b>alcoholic</b> <b>preparation</b> solutions can be left out prior to use. Method: 30 ml of Alcoholic Iodine (Iodine 1 % in Alcohol 70 % (v/v)) and Alcoholic Chlorhexidine (Chlorhex-idine 2 % in Alcohol 70 % (v/v)) were left to stand in gallipots in an operating theatre equipped with laminar flow. Sam-ples were taken at 0, 30, 60 and 120 minutes and the alcohol content was analyzed. The experiment was repeated 3 times for each time interval. Results: The Alcoholic Iodine group demonstrated significant decrease in alcohol concen-tration, from a mean of 76 % (SD 3. 6) to a mean of 37. 7 % (SD 2. 9) in only 30 minutes. This effect was sustained, reaching a mean concentration of 26 % (SD 2. 9) alcohol at 120 minutes. The Alcoholic Chlorhexidine group did not exhibit the same degree of concentration drop, the concentration dropped marginally to 71. 5 % (SD 2. 7) at 120 minutes from 83. 4 % (SD 0. 4). Conclusion: Alcoholic Iodine exhibits significant evaporation under operating room conditions after 30 minutes. Alcoholic Chlorhexidine does not appear to undergo similar losses in concentration. We recommend that <b>alcoholic</b> surgical <b>preparation</b> solutions must be poured immediately prior to use, and must be discarded if left un-covered {{for more than a few}} minutes...|$|R

40|$|Hazardous alcohol {{consumption}} is a worldwide problem with many locally distinctive features across cultures, but studies to guide policy {{in developing countries}} are notably lacking. This community study aimed to clarify local {{patterns of alcohol use}} in six villages of West Bengal, India. It considered the variety of local <b>alcoholic</b> <b>preparations,</b> who consumed them, when, and where. It sought to determine how social changes in the region influence changing patterns of acceptable and problem use of alcohol. Ethnographic methods included participant observation and focus group discussions. The qualitative data analysis of field notes and transcripts included a review of full texts and a computer-assisted analysis of thematically coded segments with reference to a structured agenda. We found that drinking is an integral feature of the cultural landscape. Locally brewed rice beer (handia), palm wine (tadi), distilled country liquor (chullu), and so-called Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) are consumed in these villages. Each is identified with particular segments of society and settings in these communities. Reported effects of problem drinking included social disturbances, family discord, and domestic violence. Increasing problem alcohol use was attributed by villagers to social changes resulting from development, which were otherwise valued, such as improved transportation and communications. In a field dominated by Western and urban studies, this research clarifies features of alcohol availability, use, and acceptance in a neglected rural area of India. It illustrates the limitations of western clinical models of dependence and the importance of clarifying sociocultural conditions that define locally acceptable and problem use.

40|$|Background: Several {{compounds}} {{obtained from}} plants have potential insecticidal, growth deterrent or repellent characteristics. The control of hard ticks by non-chemical substances was targeted in this study. Methods: The effect of 36 materials on in-vitro ticks was studied, including 2 absolute controls (water only or ab­solute ethyl alcohol only), 6 conventionally used spinosad preparations (aqueous solutions), 12 Nigella sativa (N. sativa) <b>preparations</b> (aqueous and <b>alcoholic</b> solutions), and 12 Thyme <b>preparations</b> (aqueous and <b>alcoholic</b> solutions). The engorged ticks were tested in-vitro for mortality and oviposition ability using the studied materials. Results: The final mortality after 48 hours of application in N. sativa aqueous preparations began from 10. 0 % con­centration, 1. 0 % to 100 % by concentration preparations ≥ 10 %. In addition, N. sativa <b>alcoholic</b> <b>preparations</b> began from 50. 0 % concentration, 2 % to 100 % by concentration ≥ 5 %. Meanwhile, Thyme aqueous and alcoholic prepa­rations began from 70. 0 % concentration, 5 % to 90 % by concentration 10 – 20 %. Additionally, spinosad aqueous preparations {{and both of}} control preparations (Water and Alcohol) resulted in no mortality. All differences were sta­tistically significant. The oviposition was stopped in N. sativa (aqueous ≥ 10 % and alcoholic ≥ 5 %) and in spinosad (aqueous≥ 25 %).

However, ethanol is generally consumed in form of alcoholic beverages which contain numerous non-alcoholic compounds. At least on gastric acid secretion it has been convincingly demonstrated that alcohol and alcoholic beverages have markedly different effects. In the present article, we provide an overview about the effect of different non-alcoholic constituents of alcoholic beverages on the pancreas and their possible interaction with molecular mechanisms leading to ‘alcoholic’ pancreatitis.

50|$|The {{laboratory}} {{has embarked}} on a recent initiative ("Archaeological Oncology: Digging for Drug Discovery") to discover herbal and tree resin <b>compounds</b> in ancient <b>alcoholic</b> beverages that have anti-cancer and other medicinal properties. Alcohol readily dissolves organic compounds in botanicals, and provides a ready means to administer them by drinking or applying to the skin. Ancient humans had a huge incentive in trying to find any cure they could, and over millennia might well have discovered empirical solutions, even if they couldn't explain them scientifically. Superstition might well creep in, but in certain periods, like the Neolithic, humans were remarkably innovative in the domestication and probably the discovery of medicinal plants. They have been lost to us when the cultures collapsed and disappeared, but can now be rediscovered using Biomolecular Archaeology.|$|R
