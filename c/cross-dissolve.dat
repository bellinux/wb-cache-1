30|$|In soccer live broadcasting, hard-cuts {{are used}} during the game while cross-dissolves may be used {{before or after the}} game or during the half time. In this context, the {{approach}} presented in this paper consists in employing two types of shot boundary detectors, one for hard cuts and the other for cross dissolves. The abrupt shot detector is employed during the action of the game and the dissolve detector, along with a whistle detector algorithm, in the beginning and final parts of the game. The chosen <b>cross-dissolve</b> boundary detector has been proposed by Abd-Almageed in (2008) and is based on the rank analysis of a matrix composed by n-histogram frames though a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorization. On the other side the hard-cut shot boundary detector consists on a traditional histogram frame-by-frame comparison through the Chi Square distance. These shot boundary detection algorithms have been applied to the grountruth soccer video sequences explained above. In particular, for the groundtruth C a recall of 95.2 % and a precision of 98.8 % for the abrupt transition detector, and a recall of 91.5 % and a precision of 84.4 % for the <b>cross-dissolve</b> detector have been obtained. These results show that the selected algorithms are adequate {{to be used in the}} overall scheme.|$|E

50|$|Image {{morphing}} is {{a technique}} to synthesize a fluid transformation from one image (source image) to another (destination image). Source image can be one or more than one images.

40|$|Abstract- Morphing {{is used to}} {{generate}} a sequence of images that smoothly transform a source image into a target image. This technique {{is often used to}} create special effects for motion pictures or television commercials. A conventional method of generating an intermediate image is by <b>cross-dissolving</b> the source and the target images. This approach, however, cannot generate a high quality image since the features (landmarks) of the objects in the source and the target images are generally not coincident with each other. In this paper, a new approach of image morphing is implemented based on averaging of pixels with their neighbourhoods to obtain a smooth image. This method is organized with the replacement of the pixel values of a source image and convolving the neighbor {{with the help of a}} mask. To obtain more details from an image a new pixel grouping method is proposed. This method is implemented for color images. Experimental results demonstrate that the method is fast and efficient for image morphing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Image {{morphing}} {{is often}} used in film and television industry to create synthetic visual effects by smooth transformation of one object into another. Based upon spatial representation of images, several image morphing techniques have been proposed. Simple spa-tial techniques, for example <b>cross-dissolve,</b> suffer from lack of smooth transformation while better quality tech-niques, like mesh warping or field warping, have signifi-cant computational complexity. In this paper we present a simple but good quality image morphing technique based upon frequency domain representation of images. Transformation from a source image to a target image takes place by mixing low frequencies of the source im-age and high frequencies of the target image in varying proportions. The proposed technique {{has been applied to}} a wide variety of images. The resulting sequence of images are better in visual quality and faster in execu-tion time...|$|E
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} {{in the field of}} graphics to exploit the basic laws of nature and apply these laws to the benefit of realistic imagery. So long, these applications have been limited to rendering using realistic light models, animating vibrations and crack propagation and deformation using physical forces, to name a few. Morphing is defined as the combination of generalized image warping with a <b>cross-dissolve</b> between image elements. In this report, the use of natural laws of physics has been extended to the field of warping. A new method is proposed, in which each particle (pixel or voxel) undergoes motion under the influence of elastic restoring forces generated due to the dislocation of the Control Points (CPs), used for warping. The motion continues till the particle attains equilibrium once again. The set of new equilibrium points forms the warped image. The motivation of this work may be attributed to the vast expanse of ways this method can be potentially applied to the si [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Morphing" {{describes}} {{the combination of}} image warping with a <b>cross-dissolve</b> between images. This term is basically derived from "image metamorphosis". It is an image processing technique which is used as an tool of animation for the metamorphosis from one image to another. The idea is to specify a warp that distorts the first image into the second and its inverse will distort the second image into the first. The first image is gradually distorted and is faded out, while the second image starts out totally distorted toward the first and is faded in. Thus, the early images in the sequence are much like the first source image. The middle image of the sequence is {{the average of the}} first source image distorted halfway toward the second one and the destinationimage distorted halfway back toward the first one. The middle image is key if it looks good then probably the entire animated sequence will look good. For morph between faces, the middle image often looks strikingly life-like, like a real person, but clearly it is neither the person in the first nor second image. The morph process consists of warping two images so that they have the same "shape", and then cross dissolving the resulting images...|$|E
40|$|Image {{morphing}} is used {{to provide}} visual effects in television and film. Image Morphing derives from the word Metamorphosis, means change shape and size of an image. Transition of one object to another is termed as Morphing. This is an animation technique which metamorphoses the first image into the second image. The morphing technique has two steps: firstly it warps two images to have same shape and in second step it cross dissolves resulting images. The warping is 2 -D geometric transformation of image, when applied, it generates a distorted image and <b>cross-dissolving</b> means color transformation. This paper uses mesh warping technique to build a framework of image based morphing of facial animation with low complexity. Image morphing is implemented using MATLAB software, which uses some digital images which are captured from camera. After morphing process, the program will output N number of images. These images are used together into a short animated sequence...|$|R
40|$|Image Morphing {{belongs to}} image {{processing}} {{defined as the}} animated transformation of one image into another, deliberately creates special effects, an essential in many multimedia systems and medical imaging field applications. In this paper, a digital image morphing technique is proposed with four phases.

The second phase deals with finding pixels by grid view of images for tracking the features such as eyes, mouth, nose, lips, ears and face. The third phase deals with mapping pixels from source image to destination image and then generate intermediate image with color interpolation and image transition. The forth most important phase of the process is generation of the final morphed resultant image {{in the number of}} certain required phases.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} to color image morphing {{which is based on}} the combination of morphological image processing tools and linear filtering. In the proposed method the morphing engine is provided by the morphological interpolation by means of the morphological median. By the successive generation of morphological medians using an algorithm proposed in the paper, the sequence transforming one input image into another one is produced. The algorithm makes use of the similarity measure between two successive frames. Two versions of the algorithm are proposed - in the first one the required parameter is the number of frames of the final sequence, in the second one the maximal acceptable error between two consecutive frames. Three linear tools are proposed to improve the visual quality of the morphing sequence: the temporal linear filtering, the spatial linear filtering and the auxiliary <b>cross-dissolving.</b> Contrary to the traditional approaches to image morphing, the proposed method doesn't require any control points. The human operator is obliged to introduce only a few input parameters. Two examples showing the results are also presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} new {{solutions to}} the following three problems inimage morphing: feature specification, warp generation, and transition control. To reduce the burden of feature specification, we firstadopt a computer vision technique called snakes. We next propose the use of multilevel free-form deformations (MFFD) to achieve C 2 -continuous and one-to-one warps among feature point pairs. The resulting technique, based on B-spline approximation, is simpler and faster than previous warp generation methods. Finally, wesimplify the MFFD method to construct C 2 -continuous surfaces forderiving transition functions to control geometry and color blending. Keywords: Image metamorphosis, morphing, snakes, multilevelfree-form deformation, multilevel B-spline interpolation. 1. Introduction Image metamorphosis deals with the fluid transformation from onedigital image into another. This technique, {{commonly referred to as}} morphing, has found widespread use in the entertainmentindustry to achieve stunning visual effects. Smooth transformations are realized by coupling image warping with color interpolation. Image warping applies 2 D geometric transformations on the images to retain geometric alignment between their features, while colorinterpolation blends their color. Given two images, their correspondence is established by ananimator with pairs of points or line segments. Each point or line segment specifies an image feature, or landmark. The featurecorrespondenceis then used to compute warps to interpolate the positions of the features across the morph sequence. Once the sourceand destination images have been warped into alignment for intermediate feature positions, ordinary color interpolation (i. e., <b>cross-dissolve)</b> is performed to generate an inbetween image. Since color interpolation is straightforward, research in image morphing hasconcentrated on warp generation from the feature correspondence...|$|E
