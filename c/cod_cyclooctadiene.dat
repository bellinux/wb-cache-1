40|$|The PhD {{contains}} to parts. In {{the first}} part, an extensive overview is presented {{on the history}} of metathesis catalysts, the current ideas in organometallic thinking and the theoretical accounts on Ru-metathesis catalysts. The second part deals with the synthesis and activity of Schiff base substituted second generation Grubbs catalysts, bimetallic Schiff base substituted Grubbs catalysts, the development of new NHCs (N-Heterocyclic Carbene) for the 2 nd generation Grubbs catalysts and a detailed investigation of secondary metathesis events. The Schiff base substituted second generation Grubbs catalysts were synthesized, proving a previous synthesis was incorrect. The new synthesis was confirmed with NMR and crystal structure analysis. A series of ten of these catalysts was synthesized and their activity was screened for several metathesis reactions. The main advantages lie in the stability of the catalysts which is expressed in challenging reactions, such as the RCM (Ring Closing Metathesis) in methanol and the RCM of disubstituted olefines. We also attempted to synthesize the bimetallic Schiff base substituted Grubbs catalysts, though we showed that here also the previous account of these catalysts was incorrect. In fact, the catalysts can not be synthesized because a disproportionation destroys the complex. Using the extensive analysis made in the theoretical piece on organometallic chemistry and theoretical accounts on Ru-metathesis catalysts, a strategy was proposed for new NHC ligands. We focused on the installation of a pi-acceptor function in the NHC, which is also interesting as a fundamental research in organometallic chemistry. We achieved in preparing an (amino) (amido) NHC which showed this characteristic and when this ligand was substituted on the Grubbs catalyst, the resulting catalysts showed faster initiation than the classical second generation catalysts for the ROMP (Ring Closing Metathesis Polymerization) of <b>COD</b> (<b>Cyclooctadiene).</b> Also the secondary metathesis was intensively investigated. We showed that the second generation Grubbs catalysts were able to lead any form of the COD-polyCOD-CDT (Cyclododecatriene) mixture to equilibrium. The first generation catalysts were unable to perform transformations concerning COD. It was also shown that the catalyst leaves a fingerprint on all polymers in the beginning of ROMP, which disappears after time due to secondary metathesis...|$|E

In contrast to the reduction of monometallic [(indenyl) Rh(cod) ], which gives rise to two well separated monoelectronic waves, the reduction of both bimetallic complexes occurs at more positive potentials in a single bielectronic and chemically reversible wave. These results indicate that an ECrevE mechanism is active, in which the chemical step following the first electron transfer is the reversible structural rearrangement of the 35 -electron radical anion, which allows the second electron transfer to occur at a more positive potential than the first one. This structural rearrangement is more marked when the two metals are syn, which suggests the presence of an interaction between the two metals in this configuration.

All except 6 c were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Formation of compounds 4 - 6 indicates a general procedure for cleavage of the S-S bonds of alkyl disulfides under mild conditions. Molecular structures of compounds 6 a,b,d reveal the first transformation of the bridging PPh 2 ligand of 1 to give the hybrid ligands Ph 2 PSR (R Me, Et, Bun) via P-S bond formation. The average Mo-W bond distance (2. 8255 angstrom) in the 34 e dimers (4 a-d, 6 a,b,d) is shorter than that in the 32 e dimers (5 a-d), 2. 8494 angstrom.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{kinetics}} {{and mechanisms}} {{involved in the}} ring-opening metathesis polymerization of 5 -norbornene- 2 -yl acetate (NAc) and <b>cyclooctadiene</b> (<b>COD)</b> in dichloromethane (DCM) were quantified using automatic continuous online monitoring of polymerization (ACOMP). The results yielded time-dependent monomer conversion {{and the effects of}} temperature and reactant concentration, evolution of weight-average molecular mass Mw, and intrinsic viscosity [Ł]w. The evolution of the molecular mass was generally consistent with a “living” mechanism in a rapid first phase, where expected target masses for p(NAc) were met, but often revealed a secondary, slight degradative phase. In contrast, p(COD) yielded molar masses far below target values and generally showed a more pronounced degradative phase. These latter two phenomena for p(COD) appear to be symptomatic of a mechanism that shortens chains with concomitant increase in polydispersity. Furthermore, through a combination of Mw, viscosity, and concentration dependencies it was deduced that the slow degradative phase for both p(NAc) and p(COD) is due almost entirely to cross-metathesis reactions. A probabilistic analysis for cross-metathesis supports these assertions. Automatic continuous mixing (ACM) was used to measure second virial coefficients and intrinsic viscosity, and these are consistent with polymers having large solvent domains and strong interactions for p(NAc). In a further application, a second addition of monomer during reactions revealed that no observable termination takes place over time. Results were cross-checked by conventional multidetector gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Ultimately, this method should help in the control of reactions to produce highly specific polymers and architectures...|$|R

A series of Au(I) phosphine complexes were {{designed and synthesized}} to investigate the possibility of room temperature phosphorescence in solution from three different types of transitions: metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer in four coordinate monomers, [ [...] . ] in Au(I) dimers, and [ [...] . ] in two and three coordinate monomers. Solution emission was only observed from the three coordinate Au(I) complexes. The complex [ [...] . ] (dcpe = 1, 2 -bis-dicyclohexylphosphinoethane) has two isolated AuP 3 units and emits at 508 nm in acetonitrile solution with a lifetime of 21 [ [...] . ] and a quantum yield of 0. 8 (366 nm excitation). The emission has been assigned as a [ [...] . ] transition with the corresponding absorption band at 370 nm. The excited state is a powerful reductant capable of reducing aryl halides. Electron transfer (ET) rates were studied from the excited [ [...] . ] {{to a series of}} substituted pyridiniums (py+). The low excited state reduction potential (Au(II) /Au(I)) of - 2. 3 V made it possible to study ET rates at driving forces as high as 2. 1 eV. High driving force, bimolecular ET rates were also studied with [Ir(cod) (pz) ] 2 (IR 2; <b>cod</b> = <b>cyclooctadiene,</b> pz = pyrazole). The forward ET rates from Ir 2 to py+ increase to the diffusion limit and remain diffusion limited at driving forces as high as 1. 60 eV. The recombination ET rates from py to Ir 2 + show inverted behavior (rates decrease as the driving force increases) at driving forces > 0. 85 eV, representing the first observation of inverted behavior for a bimolecular system. The discrepancy between the forward ET and recombination ET rates is explained by ET to low lying excited states. On the basis of the emission observed from three coordinate Au(I) complexes, Au(I) was used as a probe for the coordination environment of the active site in Pseudomonas auruginosa azurin. The active site consists a copper center strongly bound to two histidines and a cysteine in a trigonal plane with a disputed axial interaction to [ [...] . ] away.

40|$|Chapter 1 : This chapter details {{mechanistic}} work {{regarding the}} reductive elimination of electron-rich aryl fluorides from L-Pd(Ar) F species. An unexpected dearomatization/arylation process of Pd(II) complexes bearing bulky biaryl phosphines was discovered, resulting in ligand arylation during the catalytic fluorination of aryl triflates. This process must occur prior to C-F reductive elimination. Further {{experimental studies of}} this rearrangement revealed that it likely proceeds via a concerted migratory insertion into the bottom ring of the ligand. Chapter 2 : This chapter describes extensive work to understand the mechanism by which regioisomeric mixtures of products form during the Pd-catalyzed fluorination of electron-rich aryl triflates lacking ortho-substituents. Deuterium labeling experiments suggest that ortho-deprotonation of L-Pd(Ar) OTf intermediates by CsF competes with the transmetallation step of the desired catalytic process. Additional studies investigating the previously observed formation of regioisomeric products {{in the absence of}} CsF (Chapter 1) are also presented. Chapter 3 : This chapter describes the key discovery that di-adamantyl ligands are superior to tBuBrettPhos for promoting the Pd-catalyzed fluorination of aryl triflates. While previously described 2 -aminobiphenyl-based sulfonate precatalysts were ineffective, readily activated [(L-Pd) 2 COD] (<b>COD</b> = <b>cyclooctadiene)</b> complexes proved to be general precatalysts for these reactions. Further structural and reactivity studies of this new family of precatalysts are presented. Chapter 4 : The first general method for the Pd-catalyzed fluorination of aryl bromides and iodides is described using a combination of AgF and various additives, most commonly KF. Preliminary studies suggest that the additive is necessary to promote an otherwise difficult transmetallation step. In addition, the use of a "pre-modified" ligand, HGPhos, allows for the Pd-catalyzed fluorination of 6 -membered nitrogen-containing heterocycles. An investigation of ligand structural effects on this reaction is also included. Chapter 5 : An in-depth investigation of the Pd-catalyzed fluorination of 5 -membered heteroaryl bromides is described. Preliminary crystallographic and computational evidence suggest that reductive elimination of 5 -membered heteroaryl fluorides from Pd(II) is extremely difficult. Nonetheless, it was found that heteroaryl bromides bearing ortho-phenyl groups, as well as highly activated 2 -bromoazoles, can be efficiently fluorinated using a catalyst based on the recently developed ligand AlPhos. by Phillip J.
