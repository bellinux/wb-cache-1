25|$|First to meet was ILEA, on 7 March; {{supporters}} of the no rate strategy had hoped that it would still vote for defiance but the authority ended up adopting a legal budget {{by a margin of}} four votes. The GLC met the following day; with the chairman Illtyd Harrington not voting except to break a tie, one Labour member ill and another absent on holiday, the full voting strength was Labour 45, Conservatives 41 and Alliance 3. The first budget to be voted on was the Conservative proposal for cut in the rates to 27p; this was rejected by 48 to 38. A budget setting the rate at the maximum allowed by the cap was defeated by 59 to 30 with both Livingstone and McDonnell opposed. At this point the meeting was adjourned until Sunday 10 March, at which meeting a second attempt to set a budget at the <b>cap</b> <b>level</b> was rejected by 54 to 34. After a further budget proposed by the Conservative group was rejected, another budget at the <b>cap</b> <b>level</b> was proposed by Steve Bundred but again rejected by 53 to 36. Finally a budget proposed by moderate Labour councillor Barrie Stead, setting the rate below <b>cap</b> <b>level,</b> was passed by 60 to 26.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Many elderly {{persons have}} drug {{benefits}} with coverage gaps, {{such as in}} Medicare Part D. Because beneficiaries who have such gaps must pay all drug costs, an accurate knowledge of gap thresholds and communication with providers about exceeding caps is important for elderly persons to manage out-of-pocket drug costs. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Health plan. PAR TICIPANTS: One thousand three hundred eight health plan members aged 65 and older. The study was a 2002 cross-sectional survey of elderly persons with capped drug benefits in a managed care plan in one state. Participants were sampled so that half reached coverage caps and half did not. METHODS: Participants reported <b>cap</b> <b>levels,</b> communication with providers about exceeding caps, and decreased medication use due to cost. RESULTS: Of the 1, 308 participants (65. 4 % response rate), 68. 6 % did not know their correct <b>cap</b> <b>level.</b> Rates were similar in those who exceeded caps (66. 2 %), reported difficulty paying for medications (63. 9 %), or decreased medication use (66 %). For participants who exceeded caps, 59. 1 % did not know beforehand that they were close to exceeding caps and 50. 2 % did not tell providers afterward. In multivariate analyses accounting for demographics and health, the oldest participants (≥ 85 vs 65 - 74) were {{at greater risk for}} not knowing <b>cap</b> <b>levels</b> (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 2 - 3. 4) and not telling providers about exceeding caps (OR= 2. 2, 95 % CI= 1. 1 - 4. 5). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients often did not know correct <b>cap</b> <b>levels</b> and did not tell providers about exceeding caps. Providers, plans, and policymakers should actively assess and improve Medicare beneficiaries' knowledge of Part D coverage gaps. © 2009, The American Geriatrics Society...|$|R

40|$|Drilled shaft {{groups are}} often {{designed}} to resist lateral loads for transportation structures. The shaft group capacity usually {{corresponds to a}} load being applied at the shaft <b>cap</b> <b>level.</b> However, in abutment wall applications, the lateral load is, in fact, applied well above the cap elevation. Thus, the load is transferred to the cap with an additional moment, causing the cap to deflect and rotate more than if this added moment were absent. As a result, the lateral capacity for a given allowable deflection of the group should be reduced because of this effect. Design engineers usually select or approve the allowable deflection {{at the top of}} the abutment wall. However, deflection at the <b>cap</b> <b>level</b> is needed to design the group capacity. The main objective of this paper is to report the results from a series of finite element analyses on abutment wall cap configurations to study the effect of moment on the capacity of the shaft group under lateral load. A scaling factor is defined as the ratio between the group capacity at any load application point height and the group capacity for load applied at the <b>cap</b> <b>level,</b> and was found to be dependent on the wall height, spacing between shafts, and <b>cap</b> deflection <b>level,</b> and more or less independent on the soil type, cap thickness and shaft diameter. The ratio between the deflection {{at the top of the}} abutment wall and the deflection at the cap was found to be dependent on the wall stiffness (wall thickness to wall height ratio) ...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{new type}} of {{variable}} annuity has been marketed to investors which is based on structured product-like investments instead of the mutual fund-like investments found in traditional variable annuities. Embedding a structured product into a variable annuity introduces substantial complexity into an investment typically considered conservative. In this paper, we describe structured product based variable annuity (spVA) crediting formu-las and how they differ from traditional VAs, value the embedded derivative position for a range of example parameters, and calculate the fair <b>cap</b> <b>levels</b> required to fairly compensate investors for the derivative position. We also provide extensive backtests of spVA crediting formulas using our calculated <b>cap</b> <b>levels</b> and compare the results to their underlying indexes. Our findings suggest that the complexity of spVAs can be used to hide fees and reduce the comparability of variable annuities to other investments in the market. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Evaluation of the {{inflammatory}} {{activity in}} patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) and patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) {{in comparison to}} patients with chronic renal insufficiency without dialysis treatment and healthy volunteers [...] Design: Open, non randomized prospective study [...] Setting: Nephrology Department, including HD and PD therapy in a university hospital [...] Patients: Twenty-four patients on chronic PD, 21 patients on chronic HD therapy using a cuprophan dialyzer, 16 patients with chronic renal insufficiency without dialysis treatment, and 33 healthy volunteers; 8 additional patients before and after initiation of chronic HD therapy. All patients and controls were without infection or immunosuppressive therapy [...] Main Outcome Measures: As a marker of the inflammatory activity in the different patient groups, C-reactive protein (CAP) was measured serially using a sensitive, enzyme-Iinked, immunosorbent assay in order to detect values below the detection limit of standard assays [...] Results: All patient groups had <b>CAP</b> <b>levels</b> higher than the normal controls (p < 0. 01). Patients on HD had <b>CAP</b> <b>levels</b> significantly higher than PD patients (p < 0. 01) whose levels were comparable to patients without dialysis therapy. Accordingly, longitudinal meas urements before and after initiation of chronic HD showed {{a significant increase in}} <b>CAP</b> <b>levels</b> after the beginning of HD treatment (p < 0. 04) [...] Conclusions: The results suggest that induction of the inflammatory activity is lower during PD compared to HD, since stimulation by the dialyzer membrane, dialysate buffer, or bacterial fragments in the dialysate is avoided. This observation might indicate a possible lower risk of long-term complications in patients with PD...|$|R

Increased <b>level</b> of <b>CAP</b> results from activation of PPARγ transcription factor. Biochanin A, soy isoflavonoid, is a PPARγ agonist. Present {{study was designed}} to investigate the influence of Biochanin A supplementation on CAP gene expression and insulin resistance. 12 -week-old male Wistar rats were usedin this study. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin followed by Nicotinamide. Present study was designed in 8 groups of 5 animals. Biochanin A was supplemented for a month at 4 different doses: 1 and 5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal, 10 and 20 mg/kg; orally. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin level and HOMA index were examined. <b>CAP</b> <b>level</b> in adipose tissue was tested by immunoblotting analysis. Findings of this study indicated that administration of Biochanin A at doses of 5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal, and 20 mg/kg; orally, could increase the expression of CAP in adipose tissue significantly. Additionally, insulin resistance improved and fasting blood glucose level decreased considerably. According to the results, increased expression of CAP in adipocytes can be associated with improvement of insulin resistance...|$|R

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that the capping of surface {{immunoglobulins}} on murine lymphocytes can be affected by modulating the lipid environment of the surface membrane with free fatty acids. In the present study, murine lymphocytes were depleted of cholesterol by incubation with phospholipid vesicles. As the cellular cholesterol:phospholipid ratio decreased, the capping of the surface immunoglobulin was seen to decrease. This inhibition of capping could not be reversed by calcium and is not accompanied by changes in either the cytoskeletal element alpha-actinin or cellular ATP levels. Incubation of the cholesterol-depleted cells with cholesterol- containing phospholipid vesicles raised both the cholesterol:phospholipid ratio and <b>capping</b> <b>levels</b> to values close to those of untreated control cells. Remarkably, stearic acid, a saturated fatty acid, could also restore the <b>capping</b> <b>levels</b> in the cholesterol- depleted cells. On the basis of the present data and measurements of the fluorescence polarization of the probe diphenyl hexatriene, we propose a model in which the protein(s) involved in capping is located in a gel-like lipid domain, and that removal of cholesterol makes this domain less gel-like and inhibits capping. Restoration of the gel-like nature of this domain by the addition of either cholesterol or stearic acid enables the protein(s) to function normally...|$|R
