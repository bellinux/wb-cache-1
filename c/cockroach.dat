5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a <b>cockroach</b> attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works well with the American <b>cockroach,</b> but less so with the German <b>cockroach.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the American <b>cockroach</b> (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of <b>cockroach</b> harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating <b>cockroach,</b> Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Blattodea (cockroaches and termites) {{shown in the}} cladogram are based on Eggleton, Beccaloni & Inward (2007). The <b>cockroach</b> families Lamproblattidae and Tryonicidae are not shown but are placed within the superfamily Blattoidea. The <b>cockroach</b> families Corydiidae and Ectobiidae were previously known as the Polyphagidae and Blattellidae.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are insects of {{the order}} Blattodea, which also {{includes}} termites. About 30 <b>cockroach</b> species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats. About four species are well known as pests.|$|E
5|$|Although {{considered}} disgusting in Western culture, <b>cockroaches</b> are {{eaten in}} many places around the world. Whereas household pest <b>cockroaches</b> may carry bacteria and viruses, <b>cockroaches</b> bred under laboratory conditions {{can be used to}} prepare nutritious food. Common household <b>cockroaches</b> can be decontaminated by being isolated and fed a diet of apple and lettuce.|$|R
50|$|To thrive, <b>cockroaches</b> need a {{place to}} hide. They prefer warm places and a {{relatively}} high humidity; they also need a source of food/liquid. The optimum temperature for oriental <b>cockroaches</b> is between 20 and 29 C. Female oriental <b>cockroaches</b> have vestigial tegmina (reduced fore wings) and males have longer tegmina. <b>Cockroaches</b> are mainly nocturnal. Oriental <b>cockroaches</b> can be elusive in that a casual inspection of an infested dwelling during the day may show no signs of roach activity. Oriental <b>cockroaches</b> can be found in usually damp places such as sewer pipes, sink drains, and any other form of damp areas in households.|$|R

5|$|While a small {{minority}} of cockroaches are associated with human habitats and viewed as repugnant by many people, a few species are of conservation concern. The Lord Howe Island wood-feeding <b>cockroach</b> (Panesthia lata) is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Scientific Committee, but the <b>cockroach</b> may be extinct on Lord Howe Island itself. The introduction of rats, the spread of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) and fires are possible reasons for their scarcity. Two species are currently listed as endangered and critically endangered by the IUCN Red List, Delosia ornata and Nocticola gerlachi. Both cockroaches have a restricted distribution and are threatened by habitat loss and rising sea levels. Only 600 Delosia ornata adults and 300 nymphs are known to exist, and these are threatened by a hotel development. No action has been taken to save the two <b>cockroach</b> species, but protecting their natural habitats may prevent their extinction. In the former Soviet Union, <b>cockroach</b> populations have been declining at an alarming rate; this may be exaggerated, or the phenomenon may be temporary or cyclic. One species of roach, Simandoa conserfariam is considered extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{have been}} used for space tests. A <b>cockroach</b> given the name Nadezhda was sent into space by Russian {{scientists}} as part of a Foton-M mission, during which she mated, and later became the first terrestrial animal to produce offspring that had been conceived in space.|$|E
5|$|Daily rhythms {{may also}} be {{regulated}} by {{a complex set of}} hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood. In 2005, the role of one of these proteins, pigment dispersing factor (PDF), was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the circadian rhythms of the <b>cockroach.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar to ants, <b>cockroaches</b> leave {{chemical}} {{trails in}} their faeces {{as well as}} emitting airborne pheromones for swarming and mating. Other <b>cockroaches</b> will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other <b>cockroaches</b> are hiding. Thus, <b>cockroaches</b> can exhibit emergent behaviour, in which group or swarm behaviour emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{activities}} of released German <b>cockroaches</b> in a vacant wooden house were investigated. Migrations to rooms {{away from the}} release point were infrequent and most <b>cockroaches</b> remained near the release point. Populations of <b>cockroaches</b> which became established in rooms, increased in summer but decreased with the fall in indoor temperature. However, the population which became established around the heating resource did not decrease. It is suggested that the distribution and population density of German <b>cockroaches</b> in buildings is determined by wandering <b>cockroaches,</b> the existence and numbers of heating resources {{and the presence of}} a food supply. A trial to estimate the population by capturing <b>cockroaches</b> on traps was not successful because of a marking failure...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to isolate and identify microorganisms of medical importance from <b>cockroaches</b> (Blattella germanica) and to ascertain their vector potential in the epidemiology of nosocomial infections. Bacteria, fungi and parasites of medical importance were isolated and identified. Important bacterial pathogens responsible for wound infections, were further studies by antibiograms. One hundred and fifty-eight out of 159 (99. 4 %) <b>cockroaches</b> collected from hospital (test) and 113 out of 120 (94. 2 %) <b>cockroaches</b> collected from residential areas (control) were carrying medically important microorganisms (P less than 0. 05). significantly higher (P less than 0. 001) number of test <b>cockroaches</b> were carrying a higher bacterial load (1 x 10 (4) and 1 x 10 (5] as compared to control <b>cockroaches.</b> Multiple drug-resistant bacterial were isolated from test <b>cockroaches.</b> The diversity of drug-resistant bacterial species isolated from test <b>cockroaches</b> suggests their involvement in the transmission of drug-resistant bacteria. Various fungi and parasitic cysts of medical importance were also isolated from the test and control <b>cockroaches,</b> but the carriage rates were low.

5|$|In China, {{cockroaches}} {{have become}} popular as medicine and <b>cockroach</b> farming is rising. The cockroaches are fried {{twice in a}} wok of hot oil, which makes them crispy with soft innards that are like cottage cheese.

5|$|Pest species adapt {{readily to}} a variety of environments, but prefer warm {{conditions}} found within buildings. Many tropical species prefer even warmer environments. Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and run away when exposed to light. An exception to this is the Asian <b>cockroach,</b> which flies mostly at night but is attracted to brightly-lit surfaces and pale colors.|$|E
5|$|Some species make a {{hissing noise}} while other {{cockroaches}} make a chirping noise.

5|$|Since the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{believed that}} <b>cockroaches</b> were an ancient group of insects {{that had a}} Devonian origin, according to one hypothesis. Fossil roachoids that lived during that time differ from modern <b>cockroaches</b> in having long external ovipositors and are the ancestors of mantises, as well as modern blattodeans. As the body, hind wings and mouthparts are not preserved in fossils frequently, the relationship of these roachoids and modern <b>cockroaches</b> remains disputed. The first fossils of modern <b>cockroaches</b> with internal ovipositors appeared in the early Cretaceous.

5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gregarious German <b>cockroach,</b> have an {{elaborate}} social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition.

5|$|The {{similarity}} of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus {{to those in}} termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be {{more closely related to}} termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive <b>cockroach.</b> It had previously been thought that all five families of <b>cockroach</b> were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts, or alternatively this hypothesis will need to be re-examined.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects.

5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} for biological control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain.

One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a <b>cockroach</b> on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead <b>cockroach</b> on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cockroaches</b> play an {{important}} role in transmitting different diseases either mechanically and occasionally biologically. The aim of the current study is to the determine the possible role of <b>cockroaches</b> in dissemination of medically important gastrointestinal parasites in North Gaza Governorate, Palestine. A total of 200 <b>cockroaches</b> were collected from residential area and hospital environment were screened for the parasites between October 2012 and January 2013. Direct wet smear, 1 % lugols iodine and modified acid-fast bacilli staining were used to identify the parasites from the body surface and the faecal samples of the <b>cockroaches.</b> The results show that 47 (23. 5 %) of the <b>cockroaches</b> harbored parasitic organisms. Nineteen (17. 3 %) of the 110 <b>cockroaches</b> collected from residential areas harboured gastrointestinal parasites while 28 (31. 1 %) of the 90 <b>cockroaches</b> from hospital environment harboured parasites. Of these, 27 (57. 4 %) were protozoa and the remaining 20 (42. 6 %) were pathogenic helminthes and non-pathogenic helminthes. Of the pathogenic helminthes, the species included ova of Ascaris lumbricoides,ova of Enterobius vermicularis and ova of hookworm. The protozoa types that were identified included cysts of Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar, trophozoites of Balantidium coli, cysts of Entamoeba coli and cysts of Endolimax nana were encounter from internal and external surface of the <b>cockroaches</b> during this study. The <b>cockroaches</b> from hospital environment harboured more parasites(31. 1 %) than residential areas(17. 3 %) but the difference in parasite burden was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). <b>Cockroaches</b> represent {{an important}} reservoir for infectious pathogens, therefore, control of <b>cockroaches</b> will substantially minimize the spread of infectious diseases in our environment...|$|R
