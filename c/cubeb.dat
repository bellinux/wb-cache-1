5|$|In Europe, <b>cubeb</b> {{was one of}} the {{valuable}} spices during the Middle Ages. It was ground as a seasoning for meat or used in sauces. A medieval recipe includes <b>cubeb</b> in making sauce sarcenes, which consists of almond milk and several spices. As an aromatic confectionery, <b>cubeb</b> was often candied and eaten whole. Ocet Kubebowy, a vinegar infused with <b>cubeb,</b> cumin and garlic, was used for meat marinades in Poland during the 14th century. <b>Cubeb</b> can still be used to enhance the flavor of savory soups.|$|E
5|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese medicine <b>cubeb</b> is {{used for}} its alleged warming property. In Tibetan medicine, <b>cubeb</b> (ka ko la in Tibetan) is one of bzang po drug, six fine herbs beneficial to specific organs in the body, with <b>cubeb</b> assigned to the spleen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cubeb</b> reached Africa {{by way of}} the Arabs. In Moroccan cuisine, <b>cubeb</b> is used in savory {{dishes and}} in {{pastries}} like markouts, little diamonds of semolina with honey and dates. It also appears occasionally in the list of ingredients for the famed spice mixture Ras el hanout. In Indonesian cuisine, especially in Indonesian gulés (curries), <b>cubeb</b> is frequently used.|$|E
500|$|About 15% of a {{volatile}} oil is obtained by distilling <b>cubebs</b> with water. Cubebene, the liquid portion, has the formula C15H24 {{and comes in}} two forms, α- and β-. [...] They differ only {{in the position of}} the alkene moiety, with the double-bond being endocyclic (part of the five-membered ring) in α-cubebene, as shown, but exocyclic in β-cubebene. It is a pale green or blue-yellow viscous liquid with a warm woody, slightly camphoraceous odor. After rectification with water, or on keeping, this deposits rhombic crystals of camphor of <b>cubebs.</b>|$|R

500|$|In 1654, Nicholas Culpeper {{wrote in}} the London Dispensatorie that <b>cubebs</b> were [...] "hot and dry in the third degree... (snip) they cleanse the head of flegm and {{strengthen}} the brain, they heat the stomach and provoke lust". A later edition in 1826 informed the reader that [...] "the Arabs call them Quabebe, and Quabebe Chine: they grow plentifully in Java, they stir up venery.

5|$|<b>Cubeb</b> {{was thought}} {{by the people}} of Europe to be repulsive to demons, just as it was {{by the people of}} China. Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of {{exorcism}} in the late 17th century, includes <b>cubeb</b> as an ingredient in an incense to ward off incubus. Even today, his formula for the incense is quoted by neopagan authors, some of whom also claim that <b>cubeb</b> can be used in love sachets and spells.|$|E
5|$|The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, {{compiled}} in the 9th century, mentions <b>cubeb</b> as {{a remedy}} for infertility, showing it was already used by Arabs for medicinal purposes. <b>Cubeb</b> was introduced to Arabic cuisine around the 10th century. The Travels of Marco Polo, written in late 13th century, describes Java as a producer of <b>cubeb,</b> along with other valuable spices. In the 14th century, <b>cubeb</b> was imported into Europe from the Grain Coast, {{under the name of}} pepper, by merchants of Rouen and Lippe. A 14th-century morality tale exemplifying gluttony by the Franciscan writer Francesc Eiximenis describes the eating habits of a worldly cleric who consumes a bizarre concoction of egg yolks with cinnamon and <b>cubeb</b> after his baths, probably as an aphrodisiac.|$|E

The drug, along with gum, fatty oils, and malates of magnesium and calcium, contains also about 1% of cubebic acid, and about 6% of a resin. The dose of the fruit is 30 to 60 grains, and the British Pharmacopoeia contains a tincture with a dose of 4 to 1 dram.|$|R

5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are <b>cubebs,</b> long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{definitive}} composition of spices {{that makes up}} ras el hanout. Each shop, company, or family may have their own blend. The mixture usually consists of over a dozen spices, in different proportions, although some purists insist that it must contain exactly 12 items. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. Some spices may be particular to the region, such as ash berries, chufa, grains of paradise, orris root, monk's pepper, <b>cubebs,</b> dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper. Ingredients may be toasted before being ground or pounded in a mortar and mixed together. Some preparations include salt or sugar, but that is generally not the accepted practice. Garlic, saffron, nuts or dry herbs are generally not included, as they are usually added to dishes individually, but some commercial preparations, particularly in Europe and North America, may contain them.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with <b>cubeb,</b> {{probably due to the}} resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of <b>cubeb,</b> kumukus. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them from somewhere else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The dried <b>cubeb</b> berries contain {{essential}} oil consisting monoterpenes (sabinene 50%, α-thujene, and carene) and sesquiterpenes (caryophyllene, copaene, α- and β-cubebene, δ-cadinene, germacrene), the oxides 1,4- and 1,8-cineole and the alcohol cubebol.|$|E
5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which <b>cubeb</b> is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by heat or nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E
5|$|Spices {{were among}} the most luxurious {{products}} available in the Middle Ages, the most common being black pepper, cinnamon (and the cheaper alternative cassia), cumin, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. They all had to be imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them extremely expensive, and gave them social cachet such that pepper for example was hoarded, traded and conspicuously donated in the manner of gold bullion. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tons of pepper and 1,000tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the late Middle Ages. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people. While pepper was the most common spice, the most exclusive (though not the most obscure in its origin) was saffron, used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor, for according to the humours, yellow signified hot and dry, valued qualities; turmeric provided a yellow substitute, and touches of gilding at banquets supplied both the medieval love of ostentatious show and Galenic dietary lore: at the sumptuous banquet that Cardinal Riario offered the daughter of the King of Naples in June 1473, the bread was gilded. Among the spices that have now fallen into obscurity are grains of paradise, a relative of cardamom which almost entirely replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, long pepper, mace, spikenard, galangal and <b>cubeb.</b> Sugar, unlike today, was considered to be a type of spice due to its high cost and humoral qualities. Few dishes employed just one type of spice or herb, but rather a combination of several different ones. Even when a dish was dominated by a single flavor it was usually combined with another to produce a compound taste, for example parsley and cloves or pepper and ginger.|$|E
25|$|The first regular {{contact between}} Europeans and {{the peoples of}} Indonesia began in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and <b>cubeb</b> pepper in Maluku. Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch {{established}} the Dutch East India Company (VOC), and in following decades, the Dutch gained a foothold in Batavia and Amboina. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the company became the dominant European power in the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|The use of Chinese herbs {{was popular}} during the medieval age in western Asian and Islamic countries. They were traded through the Silk Road from the East to the West. Cinnamon, ginger, rhubarb, nutmeg and <b>cubeb</b> are {{mentioned}} as Chinese herbs by medieval Islamic medical scholars Such as Rhazes (854– 925 CE), Haly Abbas (930-994 CE) and Avicenna (980-1037 CE). There were also multiple {{similarities between the}} clinical uses of these herbs in Chinese and Islamic medicine.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{botanicals}} or flavouring {{agents for}} gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and bitter orange peel, {{as well as}} a combination of other spices, which may include any of anise, angelica root and seed, orris root, licorice root, cinnamon, almond, <b>cubeb,</b> savory, lime peel, grapefruit peel, dragon eye (longan), saffron, baobab, frankincense, coriander, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cassia bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} he {{mentioned}} that he visited Java without explaining the exact place he had visited. He said that king of Java ruled over seven other kings (vassals).

The stairs and palace interior were coated with gold and silver, and even the roofs were gilded. He also recorded that the kings of the Mongol had repeatedly tried to attack Java, but always ended up in failure and managed to be sent back to the mainland. The Javanese kingdom mentioned in this record is Majapahit, and the time of his visit is between 1318–1330 during the reign of Jayanegara.|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the ancient}} texts of Ayurveda (Sanskrit आयुर्वेद) include <b>cubeb</b> in various remedies. Charaka and Sushruta {{prescribe}} a <b>cubeb</b> paste as a mouthwash, {{and the use}} of dried cubebs internally for oral and dental diseases, loss of voice, halitosis, fevers, and cough. Unani physicians use a paste of the <b>cubeb</b> berries externally on male and female genitals to intensify sexual pleasure during coitus. Due to this attributed property, <b>cubeb</b> was called [...] "Habb-ul-Uruus".|$|E
500|$|<b>Cubeb</b> was {{frequently}} {{used in the}} form of cigarettes for asthma, chronic pharyngitis and hay fever. Edgar Rice Burroughs, being fond of smoking <b>cubeb</b> cigarettes, humorously stated that if he had not smoked so many cubebs, there might never have been Tarzan. [...] "Marshall's Prepared <b>Cubeb</b> Cigarettes" [...] was a popular brand, with enough sales to still be made during World War II.

500|$|The modern use of <b>cubeb</b> in England {{as a drug}} {{dates from}} 1815. There were various preparations, {{including}} oleum cubebae (oil of <b>cubeb),</b> tinctures, fluid extracts, oleo-resin compounds, and vapors, which were used for throat complaints. A small percentage of <b>cubeb</b> was commonly included in lozenges designed to alleviate bronchitis, in which the antiseptic and expectoral properties of the drug are useful. The most important therapeutic application of this drug, however, was in treating gonorrhea, where its antiseptic action was of much value. William Wyatt Squire wrote in 1908 that cubebs [...] "act specifically on the genito-urinary mucous membrane. (They are) given in all stages of gonorrhea". As compared with copaiba in this connection <b>cubeb</b> has the advantages of being less disagreeable to take and somewhat less likely to disturb the digestive apparatus in prolonged administration.|$|E
500|$|After the {{prohibition}} of sale, culinary use of <b>cubeb</b> decreased dramatically in Europe, and only its medicinal application continued to the 19th century.

500|$|In the Tang Dynasty, <b>cubeb</b> {{was brought}} to China from Srivijaya. In India, the spice {{came to be called}} kabab chini, that is, [...] "Chinese cubeb", {{possibly}} because the Chinese had a hand in its trade, but more likely because it was an important item in the trade with China.
