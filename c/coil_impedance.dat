Epicardial patches did not improve since 30 years, are rigid {{and need to be}} sewed to the epicard which favors bleeding. In some rare cases, epicardial AICD implantation remains indicated. Therefore we tested a new simple implant technique in 5 patients undergoing open chest surgery trough a median sternotomy. MethodsIn 3 cases surgery was performed for percutaneous infected lead extraction failure. The two other patients required surgical operation and AICD implant (one for mitral valve regurgitation, one for tricuspid repair). A screw-in bipolar pace/sense lead (St Jude MyodexTM 1084 T) was placed on the right ventricular free wall and two defibrillation leads (Medtronic Transvene® 6937) were respectively sewed on the pulmonary artery trunk and on the diaphragmatic wall of the right ventricle and then connected to an AICD (Biotronik Lumax 540) placed in an abdominal pocket. ResultsBest defibrillation configuration (31 J tested) was obtained with a shock delivered between the two coils (AICD passive), from the inferior one to the superior one.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the view}} of {{optimizing}} the maintenance cost of combustion turbine, {{it is necessary to}} predict remaining blade coating life. This goal can be achieved by using a multi-frequency Eddy Current non-destructive technique for assessing condition and quality of the coatings and hence permitting reduction of unexpected shut-downs caused by blade coating failure. This paper deals with stating and solving underlying direct and inverse problems. The direct problem consists in modelling the <b>impedance</b> <b>coil</b> over a layered metallic structure protected by a top over-aluminized coating who degrades by inward and outward diffusion of aluminium, respectively due to differences of conductivities between the coating and blade materials and to oxidation when aluminium in the coating diffuses out to reform the protective oxide layer formed by metallic coatings which spalls off during operation. For taking such diffusion process of aluminium inside the blade into account, we developped a model where the conductivity profile, which varies continuously with depth in the blade, is described using two hyperbolic tangents (we extend the Uzal-Rose’s model [1] based on one hyperbolic tangent conductivity profile). Comparison of results obtained with this model and with those obtained with a numerical multi-layers model, based on discretization of the conductivy profile by a high number of layers of constant conductivity, is very good. The inverse problem consists in estimating conductivity profile by minimizing an error function defined as euclidian norm of difference between Eddy-Current measurements over blade coating and output of the direct model describing the predicted <b>impedance</b> <b>coil</b> for a given layered structure [3]. We explicit expressions of derivatives of <b>impedance</b> <b>coil</b> with respect to parameters model needed for optimizing the error which is sought using a conjugate gradient algorithm.
