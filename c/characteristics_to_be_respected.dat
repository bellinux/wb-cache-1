As a result, these <b>characteristics</b> tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> by his publishers in the published version of his poems.|$|R

40|$|To {{respect the}} {{autonomous}} choices of persons {{is an important}} moral principle. There is, however, little agreement about its nature and its normative importance. This <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> {{the fact that the}} concept of autonomy as well as the moral relevance of autonomy are contested. It is argued in this paper that the debate about autonomy is at its core a debate about the reasons for respecting decisions. Decisions of persons <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> as their decisions, and they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respected</b> as determining the deontic properties of situations. This, however, can only be understood against the background of persons having rights over themselves. Their decisions determine the deontic properties as exercises of their rights. Thus, respect for the autonomous choice of persons turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>respect</b> for their rights...|$|R
