5|$|In {{response}} to Clement's visit, moreover, the Pope had empowered the Bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin and St Andrews {{to take action}} to rescue the bishopric. He told these bishops that, Since the continual <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the churches is our daily burden, we grant to the said Church , so far as we personally can, and authorise you, if you find the situation to be as described, to assign to the said Bishop, if it can be done without scandal, a quarter of the teinds of all the parish churches of the Diocese of Dunblane, so that under your guidance and that of upright men, he may set aside a suitable portion of them for his own maintenance, and thereafter assign revenues for a dean and canons whom we wish and authorise you to institute there. Failing this, the Pope wrote, The quarter teinds of all the churches of the Diocese assigned to the Bishop, which are held by laymen, you shall transfer with the episcopal seat to the Canons Regular of St. John in the Diocese , who shall have power to elect a Bishop in any vacancy.|$|E

25|$|Medicine in the monasteries was {{concentrated}} on assisting {{the individual to}} return to normal health. Being able to identify symptoms and remedies was the primary focus.

25|$|The Russian {{military}} base was deployed on {{the territory of}} Armenia as early as 1996 (before that, the installation was still known as the 127th MRD of the Soviet Ground Forces).

25|$|Pentagram {{split up}} again, and in 1996, a new lineup was forged, {{consisting}} of Liebling on vocals, Hasselvander on drums and new members Greg Reeder on guitar and Ned Meloni on bass. This lineup recorded a demo, Change of Heart. Shortly afterward, Pentagram reemerged as a duo, with Liebling retaining vocal duties and Hasselvander taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> instrumentation. In 1998, Downtime Records released {{a number of}} early recordings on a compilation album titled Human Hurricane, and 1972–1979 (Vol. 2), a bootleg follow up to 1972–1979, was released in 1999 by Peace Records.|$|E
25|$|Gradually, the Gauleiter (English:Gau Leader) {{took control}} over their territories, {{reducing}} the local Minister Presidents, nominally the highest office in the German states, to figureheads. As such, {{the development of the}} Gau from a form inner-party administration to a political and administrative sub-division of the country was gradual, not sudden, but completed by 1934. The process termed Gleichschaltung took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> political opposition and the Law concerning the reconstruction of the Reich from 30 January 1934 can possibly be seen as the final date for the transfer of power from the states to the Gaue.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} paper, the algorithm is presented more formally using a substitution style instead {{of side effects}} in the method above. In the latter form, the side effect invisibly takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> places where a type variable is used. Explicitly using substitutions not only makes the algorithm hard to read, because the side effect occurs virtually everywhere, but also gives the false impression that the method might be costly. When implemented using purely functional means or {{for the purpose of}} proving the algorithm to be basically equivalent to the deduction system, full explicitness is of course needed and {{the original}} formulation a necessary refinement.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus of}} the governor's {{emergency}} powers is to ensure the security and stability {{of the state and}} he or she receives comprehensive police powers in an emergency. In discharging those power to enforce laws, rules and regulations relating to emergency management, the governor assumes direct operational control of emergency management forces of the state, including the Oklahoma National Guard, state police agencies, state and local health departments, as well as county sheriff's offices and local police departments. These emergency police powers extend to providing for the evacuation of the state’s population from any affected or threatened area or areas within the state, regulating the conduct of civilians and the movement of pedestrians and vehicular traffic, and regulating public meetings and gatherings. The governor is responsible for providing for the <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> those regulated by his or her orders.|$|E
25|$|Since he took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the prison's bodies, he {{had some}} {{influence}} with officials there. In 1942 they changed schedules so that executions took place at night; Stieve was able to persuade them to return to mornings {{so that he could}} process the bodies and tissue the same day. Claims that his influence {{went so far as to}} choosing the women's execution dates based on their cycles have been debunked, and other reports that he allowed SS officers to rape some prisoners in order to study sperm migration have not been substantiated and appear dubious (none of Stieve's papers mention sperm as a subject of inquiry); although Seidelman, who first reported this, insists it occurred. Nor, contrary to another report, did Stieve make soap from the remains of the bodies after they had been dissected.|$|E

25|$|May 2006 saw {{the sale}} of Silja Line to the Estonian Tallink. The SuperSeaCats {{trafficking}} between Helsinki and Tallinn {{were not included in}} the sale as their purchase would have given Tallink a dominant market position on the route, which would have resulted in the competition regulators of Finland and Estonia not approving the sale. As a result, Sea Containers (that had barely a year ago announced their intention to give up the ferry business completely) continued operating them under the SuperSeaCat brand. In late 2006 the land organisations of Tallink and Silja Line were reorganised in Finland so that Tallink Finland and Superfast Finland were merged into Oyj Silja Abp, which now took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Finnish operations of Tallink/Silja. Shortly afterwards Oyj Silja Abp was renamed into Tallink Silja Oy. Similarly the land organisations in Sweden became Tallink Silja AB.|$|E
25|$|In January 1827, Pathkiller, the Cherokee's {{principal}} {{chief and}} last hereditary chief, and, two weeks later, Charles R. Hicks, Ross's mentor, both died. Ross, {{as president of}} the National Committee and Major Ridge, as speaker of the National Council, were responsible for the affairs of the tribe. In a letter dated February 23, 1827, to Colonel Hugh Montgomery, the Cherokee agent, Ross wrote that with the death of Hicks, he had assumed responsibility for all public business of The Nation. Charles Hicks' brother William served briefly as interim chief until a permanent chief could be elected. Although he believed he was the natural heir to his brother's position, William Hicks had not impressed the tribe with his abilities. A majority of the people knew that during the year Ross, not Hicks, had taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the mundane business of the tribe. On October 17, 1828 the Cherokee elected John Ross as principal chief.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a six-man tag team match {{featuring}} Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega) against Bart Gunn, Goldust and Flash Funk. All the six men began brawling with each other, until Nation {{were sent to}} the outside. As they regrouped, Funk dived from the top rope onto all the three members of Nation. Funk hit a hurricanrana on Vega from the top rope and tried to dive on the Nation again but they controlled his landing and dragged him into the ring. Faarooq, Crush and Vega took turns and attacked Funk. After a great damage, he was able to tag with Gunn who took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> three men. Gunn, Goldust and Funk sent Nation outside the ring and Gunn hit a diving bulldog on Faarooq and went for the cover but the referee was distracted in sending Goldust and Funk to the outside. Crush took advantage and hit a leg drop on Gunn while Faarooq pinned Gunn to get the win.|$|E
