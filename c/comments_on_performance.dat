40|$|Abstract: The {{use of a}} {{loop antenna}} {{combined}} with a vertical monopole, described here as an electric-magnetic electrically small antenna (E-M-ESA) system has been proposed as a technique to miniaturize antennas, providing, according to some authors, a reduction in near field reactive energy; improved radiation efficiencies relative to a single element antenna alone; and maximizing the bandwidth. But realistic practical antenna systems have not been modeled, including tuning and matching losses; and for {{our understanding of the}} radiation characteristics of the antenna system, the details of the fields in the near and far field regions have not been described. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a detailed study and critical <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|E

40|$|This report <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>performance</b> to {{physical}} targets and performance to financial budgets {{during the first}} nine months of 1990. Inevitably, there are variations, but we did not identify any which we judge need be of major concern to donors. The general record is of greater rather than lesser achievement in relation to what was planned. The report focuses on those areas where we believe improvements might be made. In many cases, our suggestions are largely endorsements of what we have discovered BRAC is already doing, or of changes that BRAC has already started to make. In certain areas, we have identified further improvements. In only a few instances do we recommend changes of substance or significance. 1. Executive summary 2. Introduction 3. BRAC: the organisation 4. RDP II and RCP financial overview 5. Social and institutional development 6. Economic activities 7. Financial analysis 8. Management 9. Gender-related issues 10.

40|$|I am {{grateful}} {{to all those who}} contributed to the completion of this thesis. It was an honor for me to work with my adviser, Bertrand Meyer, and learn from his expertise in designing programming languages. His encouragement to find practi-cal and simple solutions has significantly influenced the results in this thesis. His experience in writing has helped me improve my own technical writing skills. I also thank Jose ́ Meseguer and Jayadev Misra for reviewing this thesis and giv-ing me insightful questions and comments. Their feedback greatly helped me in compiling the final version of this thesis. During my stay at the Chair of Software Engineering, I had the privilege to work with many competent and inspiring colleagues. First and foremost, I {{am grateful}} to Sebastian Nanz for guiding me to grow as a researcher. Our interesting and enjoyable collaboration and his numerous detailed comments have substan-tially contributed to this thesis. I am also thankful to Scott West for our collabora-tion on various topics and his helpful <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>performance</b> analysis. Further-more, I {{am grateful to}} Stephan van Staden for his comments on locks, to Marti...|$|E
40|$|This report {{comments}} on the financial results, trends and risks arising from audits of TAFE financial and performance statements, and the financial statements of the 16 entities they control. Summary This report {{comments on}} the outcomes of the 2014 financial audits of the 12 technical and further education (TAFEs) institutes and their controlled entities. It also <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>performance</b> reporting and risk management at the TAFEs, being two key areas of governance within TAFEs. The TAFEs whose financial reports are complete and commented on in this report had a combined net deficit of 75. 4 million for 2014. This result follows a combined net deficit of 15. 1 million in 2013. Our indicators of financial sustainability risks show short-term challenges at six TAFEs, and longer-term risks emerging for the whole sector as spending on asset replacement and renewal is decreasing. Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s TAFEs have undergone a period of structural change since 2012 when the then government altered its funding model. The agility of TAFEs {{to respond to the}}se changes and associated challenges has varied, and not all have responded in a timely and/or financially sustainable way. While some steps have been taken by the sector to respond to the structural changes, bigger steps are needed by TAFE boards and the Department of Education & Training to turn around the financial decline within the sector...|$|E

40|$|The {{project was}} {{performed}} in collaboration with Husqvarna, one of the world’s leading manufacturer in the market of electric outdoor products. The report is a thesis work of a bachelor mechanical engineer program, in the field product development and design. The project is {{a study of the}} development opportunities within drive belt for a gear driven gearbox to one of Husqvarnas petrol powered hedge trimmers. A big part of the project was also to find combinations of materials for all components in the gearbox, to reduce weight and maintain or improve the performance of the system. Belt drive was of interest to investigate as an alternative solution to the current design that can reduce wear on the system at a performance test performed in the company before the product is released to market. Direct surface contact as a result of gear drive causes a great wear on the gear teeth in the performance test. Reducing weight was also of interest because it is a major competitive advantage in the market. The work began with a pilot study within and outside the company to increase vision field and get {{a better understanding of the}} product. The project was carried out in the company, with continuous guidance and advice on the authors' concept generation and work. In this report, readers can get access to how the work was done from start to the final concept that has been modeled in the CAD program CATIA. In the design process and the results, readers can take part in the construction of the new design, the material selection of each component, a comparison of the conceptual and ordinary gearbox weight and also <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>performance</b> test with belt drive...|$|E
40|$|This {{study had}} the {{following}} aims: (1) {{to investigate the}} feedback and teaching practices of L 2 writing at the University of Bahrain through classroom observations; (2) to investigate the effectiveness of two types {{of written corrective feedback}} (a. direct corrective feedback in the form of corrections of errors next to or above the original errors and b. indirect corrective feedback in the form of error underlining) through a 12 week quasi-experimental study that involved 46 Bahraini media students assigned to one of three groups (experimental group A receiving direct corrective feedback, experimental group B receiving error underlining and the control group C receiving no corrections but rather simple and summative <b>comments</b> <b>on</b> <b>performance)</b> and evaluated through pre-, post- and delayed post-tests; (3) to investigate teachers’ and students’ beliefs about feedback through interviews and questionnaires. The following are the most important findings. (1) Classroom observations showed that there were several problems in the teaching of L 2 writing and feedback methods at the University of Bahrain. (2) The quasi-experimental study showed that even though the students improved {{in the course of the}} experiment, neither type of corrective feedback had a significant effect on their accuracy, grammatical complexity or lexical complexity in writing, and that there was no difference in the effectiveness between the first type of feedback compared to the second. (3) Interviews and questionnaires showed that the students preferred direct corrective to indirect corrective feedback (i. e. they preferred it when their errors were corrected by providing the corrections on their scripts to underlining) and that the teachers and the students valued feedback and believed it was beneficial. Interviews and questionnaires also showed that even though the teachers used a variety of feedback methods, they did not follow up students after the first draft was produced. In the light of the findings, some recommendations are made in the final chapter of the thesis...|$|E
