Engines were built in the Dearborn Engine Plant for the North American market, and in Ford's then-new engine plant in Bridgend in Wales for the European market.|$|E
40|$|A Sequential Quadratic Programming {{optimization}} algorithm was interfaced to the Engine System Assessment (ESA) model {{to determine the}} optimal combustion chamber geometry to maximize power. Both net power and power per unit displacement were studied, together with packaging, fuel economy and knock limiting constraints. Sensitivity of the optimal solution to changes in constraint parameters was also studied. Changes in the fuel economy and the displacement volume specifications affected the optimal design. It is shown {{that the problem of}} optimizing power is one of maximizing bore without exceeding the package constraint and/or degrading fuel economy. Also, to optimize net power subject to package constraints, the displacement volume should be treated as a variable subject to package constraints and not specified a priori. Two algebraic models are developed first,based on ESA expressions; one for a flat head design and one for a <b>compound</b> <b>valve</b> head design. They are used with monotonicity analysis to determine a partial solution analytically. The analytical results and the numerical results with the ESA program gave identical solutions for the geometric design variables. Absolute values of brake power and specific fuel consumption differed because the algebraic expressions contained incomplete friction models. While the optimal designs concluded from this work may be readily apparent to experienced engine engineers, the readily available sensitivity of the optimal design to changes in constraint parameters is not. Therein lies the utility of the described approach. The {{optimization algorithm}}, the interface, and relevant future work are also described...|$|E

50|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Henry J. Kaiser asked William Besler to convert his 1953 Kaiser Manhattan to steam. Besler {{completed}} this in either 1957 or 1958. The engine {{was described as}} a V4 single acting uniflow with trunk pistons. It was a cross <b>compound</b> with piston <b>valves</b> across the high-pressure heads. Kaiser apparently did not take the car back and left it with Besler.|$|R
5000|$|The Bancroft mill {{engine is}} a {{horizontal}} cross <b>compound</b> Corliss <b>valve</b> condensing steam engine built 1914 and installed by William Roberts of Nelson in 1920. As was traditional, the cylinders were named, the high-pressure cylinder [...] "James", and the low-pressure [...] "Mary Jane". Together they were rated to at 600 ihp, enough for 1200 0.5 hp looms, the rating was conservative {{and the engine}} could deliver more power if needed. Its speed is 68 rpm controlled by a Porter type governor and a Lumb regulator acting on the high-pressure cylinder valves and Dobson-type trip gear is fitted. The high-pressure cylinder (HP) has a 17 in bore and the low-pressure (LP) 32 in; both have a stroke of 4 ft. It uses Corliss valves. The engine drives a 16 ft flywheel running at 68 rpm, with a second motion wheel running at 136 rpm.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1860s, {{the company}} {{supplied}} a cam operated, drop <b>valve</b> <b>compound</b> engine operating at 100psi to the India Mill, Darwen. Other mills supplied by Yates and Thom included the Durban Mill, Oldham. This was 1800 hp triple-expansion four-cylinder engine built in 1906. It had a 24"HP, 29"IP, two 38"LP cylinders with a 5 ft 6" [...] stroke. At 180psi, it drove a. 27 ft, 67 ton flywheel with 38 ropes, at 65 rpm. It used Corliss valves on all cylinders.

50|$|The {{key to the}} Vauclain <b>compound</b> is its <b>valve</b> system. In essence, {{there is}} an extra system of valves, {{concentric}} with the usual middle steam passage in conventional single expansion piston valves. This passage connects the high-pressure cylinder exhaust to the low-pressure cylinder intake. The driving pistons are rigidly connected {{to either side of}} the crosshead, so that they move in concert. As high-pressure steam is admitted {{to one side of the}} high-pressure cylinder, the low-pressure steam exhausted from the other side is passed through the valves to the opposite side of the engine and into the low-pressure cylinder; finally the exhaust steam from the opposite side of the low-pressure cylinder escapes through the center part of the valve to the blastpipe.|$|R
40|$|Aortic valve {{stenosis}} (AVS) is {{a complex}} disorder that is present in> 3 % of individuals aged> 75 years, and the prevalence of AVS may double within the next 50 years. 1 AVS is the most frequent indication for surgical valve replacement and for transcatheter aortic valve implantation, which remain to date the main forms of treatment for this disease. 2 Although {{some have suggested that}} the risk factors for AVS {{are similar to those of}} cardiovascular disease, studies on AVS risk factors and biomarkers are more limited than those on cardiovascu-lar disease biomarkers. 3 Moreover, as suggested by 2 studies performed in France investigating the regional distribution of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and the familial aggregation of the disease, AVS might have a strong genetic basis. 4, 5 Only few studies have tried to identify genetic vari-ants or loci associated with this disease. 6, 7 To this date, genetic variants that show a consistent association with AVS risk have yet to be identified. One recent study, however, has shown that a common genetic variant at the LPA loci that is closely associated with lipoprotein(a) levels shows significant asso-ciations with aortic valve calcium content and risk of AVS in 2 European population studies. 8 Several studies have suggested that similar to coronary artery disease (CAD), high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) might have a role to play in the pathology of AVS. 9 Results from our previous investigations have suggested that HDL-mimetic <b>compounds</b> decrease aortic <b>valve</b> calcium and induc...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} that allows fast target analysis in multidimensional gas chromatography {{by using a}} microswitching valve between two GC columns, with cryogenic trapping and rapid re-injection of trapped solutes in the second dimension. The essence of the procedure is that heart-cut fractions from the first column (1 D) can be selectively transferred to column 2 (2 D), where a moveable cryogenic trap first focuses the transferred solute(s) {{at the head of}} the second column and then permits their facile rapid analysis on 2 D. Since 2 D is a short narrow-bore column, which exhibits very fast analysis (on the order of a few seconds elution), peak responses (heights) are significantly enhanced (by up to 40 -fold). Additionally, by using a 2 D phase of a selectivity different from that used for 1 D, it is possible to also separate components that are not resolved on the first column and to increase the resolution for other <b>compounds.</b> The heart-cut <b>valve</b> isolates the section(s) of solutes of interest from the first column separation, and this provides a considerable simplification to the chromatogramin addition to the separation and sensitivity advantages. By using this method, multidimensional gas chromatography with multiple heart-cuts can be completed within the same time as the primary column separation. Since the described method permits non-heart-cut fractions to be transferred to a monitor detector, normal detection of these fractions is still permitted. By modulation of the cryotrap, it is also possible to achieve comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography for the heart-cut fractions; however, only those compounds passed to the second, separation column, which passes through the cryotrap, will be subjected to GC×GC analysis. The technique and the various modes of operation are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{chemical}} incorporated in plastics and resins used {{for food and}} beverage containers that {{has been shown to}} have estrogenic activity. The fact that BPA possess this activity should not be surprising as it was originally explored for use as a pharmaceutical estrogen. Exposure to BPA has been associated with adverse reproductive and developmental effects in wildlife and laboratory animal models. There are also associations between exposure in humans and adverse health effects, although some of these findings are controversial. The mechanism(s) of action of BPA are well researched, however there is no definitive explanation for the frequently reported discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo studies. Metabolic activation of BPA in vivo has been suggested as a possible reason for this discrepancy in estrogenic potency. As public awareness of the possible health effects of BPA increases manufacturers have increasingly started to use replacement chemicals as monomers in materials that can be labelled as BPA-free. However there is still little information on the estrogenic potency of these structurally similar bisphenol chemicals or how they may affect health outcomes, as observed with BPA. The studies conducted in this thesis therefore aimed to investigate the tissue targets, molecular mechanisms and health effects of BPA, its related chemicals Bisphenol S (BPS), Bisphenol F (BPF) and Bisphenol AF (BPAF) and the BPA metabolite 4 -methyl- 2, 4 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) pent- 1 -ene (MBP). For this work, a novel ERE transgenic (ERE-TG) zebrafish, that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in response to activation of ERE was employed. These fish can be applied to identify body targets of environmental estrogens in real time with high sensitivity and specificity. BPA, BPF, BPS and BPAF were shown to all preferentially target the heart in ERE-TG zebrafish and GFP induction occurred first in the heart out of the different responding body tissues. The response to BPA was shown to be dependent on the classical estrogen receptor (ER) signalling pathway. However concentrations necessary to induce this response varied for the different bisphenols, with the rank order of potency of BPAF>BPA=BPF>BPS. Bioconcentration factors of the bisphenols were 4. 5, 17. 8, 5. 3 and 0. 067 for exposures to 1000 µg BPA/l, 1000 µg BPF/l, 100 µg BPAF/l and 50000 µg BPS/l respectively. These data indicate bioavailability is an important consideration in the differing estrogenic potencies of the different bisphenols. The toxicities of the different bisphenols on early life stage zebrafish followed a similar rank potency order as for the estrogenic activity (BPAF>BPA>BPF>BPS). Specific morphological abnormalities were observed for the different bisphenolic chemical treatments in the toxicity assessments, possibly suggesting that they may act through different ways in inducing their toxic effects. It is recognised that the toxicities for the bisphenolic chemicals were observed at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than those measured in most aquatic environments and thus the threat they pose to wildlife health might be considered as relatively low, except in circumstances where short but high exposures may occur from accidental release into the environment. The BPA metabolite MBP was found to be up to 1000 -fold more potent than the parent compound as an estrogen in ERE-TG fish. The heart was a key target tissue for MBP, as observed for the other bisphenolic <b>compounds.</b> The atrioventricular <b>valves</b> and bulbus arteriosus were identified as the primary targets within the heart. MBP was not measured in zebrafish embryos exposed to BPA and whether this is produced as a metabolite in zebrafish is still not known. Morpholino knockdown of specific ER subtypes indicated that esr 1 is a major pathway for the estrogenic response to BPA in the heart during early life stages of zebrafish. Video capture and analysis was used to assess the cardiovascular health of zebrafish exposed to BPA and it was found that at very high exposure concentrations (2500 µg/l) BPA could induce an unstable atrial:ventricular beat ration in 5 dpf larvae and reduced heart beat rate in 14 dpf. In the final study of this thesis transcriptomic profiling was conducted on hearts extracted from 96 hpf ERE-TG zebrafish larvae exposed to BPA. The findings demonstrated that BPA, at an exposure concentration of 150 µg/l caused a down-regulation of a number of genes associated with ion transport and cell-to-cell communication, functions that are essential in maintaining a regular and consistent heart rate. These effect mechanisms may help to explain the effects on the heart seen at the higher BPA exposure concentrations in the previous chapter, although this would need more extensive work to draw any such associations with good confidence Overall, the findings presented in this thesis have provided a body of evidence to show that all of the bisphenolic chemicals tested possess estrogenic activity and as such have the potential for health effects in wildlife and also to humans. It is also the case however that currently in most ambient environments concentrations of these bisphenolic chemicals are far below those that could induce adverse health outcomes. The work in this thesis re-enforces the importance of understanding metabolic activation of chemicals in vivo. It furthermore illustrates the power of transgenic fish and an integrated approach for gaining greater insight into potential health effects of chemicals. NER...|$|R
