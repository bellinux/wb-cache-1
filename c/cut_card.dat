5000|$|<b>Cut</b> <b>card</b> (or postilion): This is a plain opaque plastic card, {{the same}} size and shape as a playing card. The dealer will place the <b>cut</b> <b>card</b> on the table so that the top cards in the cut can be placed on it; this {{prevents}} the accidental exposure of the bottom card when the dealer picks up the deck after the cut has been completed. While rarely used in home games, the <b>cut</b> <b>card</b> is universal in casino play.|$|E

50|$|In formal player dealt settings, {{such as in}} {{a casino}} or during a tournament, an offer to cut the deck is {{mandatory}} and the designated player must perform the cut, generally by inserting a <b>cut</b> <b>card</b> (a plastic card {{about the size of}} a playing card, usually solid-colored) into the deck; the dealer then makes the actual cut at that point in the deck. When the dealer is not a player (i.e. a casino employee), the cut is mandatory and is usually performed by the dealer. In this instance, the deck is cut onto the aforementioned <b>cut</b> <b>card,</b> and the cut completed; this prevents players from seeing the bottom card of the deck.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cutting</b> <b>cards</b> {{is usually}} a prelude to a game, {{but it can be}} a game unto itself. Each player, in turn, removes a {{selection}} of cards from the top and reveals the bottom card to all the players, and then replaces the cards in the original position. Whoever has revealed the highest (or sometimes lowest) card is the winner. This is often used in an informal setting, much like flipping coins; it is also sometimes used to determine who will play first in a card game.|$|R

The deal rotates clockwise and one fewer card is dealt each hand (thus ensuring that the game must end, as eventually only one trick will be played). The game is won when a player takes all the tricks in a round, as after that there would only be one player remaining.|$|R
50|$|Charlie {{continues}} {{the story from}} the prologue, where Dean and the mobster agree to <b>cut</b> <b>cards</b> for the money. The mobster cuts a King and Dean cuts the Ace of spades. The mobster goes for his gun but Dean gets to his first, shooting the mobster and splashing the Ace with his blood. The three speculate that the story is an urban legend. They talk about taking the Dean (Sylvester Stallone) down at a game with a $250,000 buy-in and total stakes of at least $2,000,000.

50|$|Instead {{of turning}} the dealer's last dealt card for trump, some <b>cut</b> a <b>card</b> from a second pack. Others go through the trump suits in cyclic order: hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades, hearts, etc. Some even add 'no trumps' into that cycle.|$|R
50|$|One {{player from}} each team <b>cuts</b> a <b>card</b> {{from the pack}} and whoever <b>cuts</b> the highest <b>card</b> will pitch first.

The player to the dealers left leads first and the suit he plays {{establishes}} trumps. Others must follow suit if possible, otherwise may play any card. The trick is taken by the highest card led or by the highest trump if any are played. Each trick-winner leads to the next.|$|R
