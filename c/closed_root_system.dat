30|$|Less {{well-documented}} for New Zealand’s {{most common}} indigenous species is {{the variability in}} the proportion of BGB apportioned to the roots versus the root bole of different <b>root</b> <b>system</b> types (e.g. tap- versus heart-rooted).

Furthermore, the allocation of root biomass to the different root size classes differed among species. For example, the <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> of Myrsine australis, Cordyline australis, and Coprosma robusta were dominated by fibrous roots comprising ≥[*] 30 % of their total root biomass.

Tree <b>root</b> <b>system</b> {{structure}} and development {{are difficult to}} assess and poorly understood in natural conditions because of soil heterogeneity and the difficulty in extracting mature tree <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> without damaging them. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand <b>root</b> <b>system</b> development plasticity according to biological and physical parameters: species tree age and size, soil material, water availability, slope angle, and climate. Methods. Two hundred and forty-three mature trees from twelve species were uprooted from homogeneous French dikes fills. <b>Root</b> <b>system</b> structure (<b>root</b> number and size, <b>root</b> <b>system</b> span, depth and volume) was compared between two contrasting soil materials: fine and coarse. Results. Tree species had little influence on <b>root</b> <b>system</b> structure: all <b>root</b> <b>system</b> types and <b>root</b> size could be found for most of the species according to site conditions. Heart <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> were limited to fine material while mixed and tap <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> were found on coarse material. In coarse materials, trees developed few but rather large roots (> 5 cm in diameter and > 4 m in length). In fine materials, <b>root</b> <b>systems</b> had three times more roots but they were 40 % smaller and shorter.

So we can judge coarse root distribution of Populus euphratica Oliv. by the function.
