5000|$|Most current gas systems employ {{some type}} of piston. The face of the piston is acted upon by {{combustion}} gas from a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. Early guns such as Browning's 'flapper' prototype, the Bang rifle, and Garand rifle used relatively low-pressure gas from {{at or near the}} muzzle. This, combined with more massive operating parts, reduced the strain on the mechanism. To simplify and lighten the firearm, gas from nearer the chamber needed to be used. This high pressure gas has sufficient force to destroy a firearm unless it is regulated somehow. Most gas-operated firearms rely on tuning the gas port size, mass of operating parts, and spring pressures to function. Several other methods are employed to regulate the energy. The M1 carbine incorporates a very short piston, or [...] "tappet". This movement is closely restricted by a shoulder recess. Excess gas is then vented back into the bore. The M14 rifle and M60 GPMG use the White expansion and <b>cutoff</b> <b>system</b> to stop (cut off) gas from entering the cylinder once the piston has traveled a short distance.

40|$|After the {{discovery}} of the Higgs particle the most relevant structures of the SM have been verified {{and for the first time}} we know all parameters of the SM within remarkable accuracy. Together with recent calculations of the SM renormalization group coefficients up to three loops we can safely extrapolate running couplings high up in energy. Assuming that the SM is a low energy effective theory of a cutoff theory residing at the Planck scale, we are able to calculate the effective bare parameters of the underlying <b>cutoff</b> <b>system.</b> It turns out that the effective bare mass term changes sign not far below the Planck scale, which means that in the early universe the SM was in the symmetric phase. The sign-flip, which is a result of a conspiracy between the SM couplings and their screening/antiscreening behavior, triggers the Higgs mechanism. Above the Higgs phase transition the bare mass term in the Higgs potential must have had a large positive value, enhanced by the quadratic divergence of the bare Higgs mass. Likewise the quartically enhanced positive vacuum energy density is present in the symmetric phase. The Higgs system thus provides the large dark energy density in the early universe, which triggers slow-roll inflation, i. e. the SM Higgs is the inflaton scalar field. Reheating is dominated by the decay of the heavy Higgses into (in the symmetric phase) massless top/anti-top quark pairs.

Many real component-based systems, {{so called}} Control-User systems, are {{composed}} of a stable part (control component) {{and a number of}} dynamic components of the same type (user components).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates superresolution {{applications in}} optical data storage systems. The performance of standard and superresolving magneto-optic data storage system are quantified by scalar diffraction modeling and experiments. Classical resolution measures are reviewed. Background on superresolution definitions and their conceptual development in scanning optical microscopes, optical data storage, and image processing is presented. Figures of merit for quantifying {{the performance of}} the systems are reviewed, such as system transfer function, two-point response, focused spot size, and signal-to-noise ratio. The description of the scalar diffraction modeling used to simulate an optical data storage system is reviewed. Operation of the magneto-optic data storage system and tradeoffs of superresolving techniques are discussed. The signal and noise spatial distribution in the pupil of an optical data storage system are shown to be different. For a particular spatial frequency bandwidth, the signal and noise are concentrated in different regions of the pupil. This understanding allows the use of optical filters that partially equalize the system transfer function and increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The main superresolution techniques investigated are those that increase the transmission of the higher spatial frequencies, or equalize the system transfer function, without changing the <b>system</b> <b>cutoff</b> frequency. The optical methods used to achieve superresolution are amplitude and phase filters placed in strategic system locations. One location influences the properties of the focused spot such as the irradiance distribution and width of the central core. Another location does not change the focused spot at all, but does change the signal and noise properties of the system. Electronic filtering techniques are also used to increase the transmission of the high spatial frequencies. The amplitude and phase filter sensitivities to aberration are also investigated. Optical properties of a new laser diode are investigated. The new laser diode has potential superresolving properties that are inherent to the device. Potential application of this device in an optical data storage device is presented. Another method of increasing the transmission of higher spatial frequencies within the system bandwidth and beyond the <b>system</b> <b>cutoff</b> frequency is to use adaptive optical systems. Adaptive systems for optical data storage are also discussed...|$|R
