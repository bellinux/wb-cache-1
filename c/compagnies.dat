25|$|For {{the first}} century of the colony's existence, the chief threat to the {{inhabitants}} of New France came from the Iroquois Confederacy, and particularly from the eastern-most Mohawks. While the majority of tribes in the region were allies of the French, the tribes of the Iroquois confederacy were aligned first with the Dutch colonizers, then the British. In response to the Iroquois threat, the French government dispatched the Carignan-Salières Regiment, {{the first group of}} uniformed professional soldiers to set foot on what is today Canadian soil. After peace was attained, this regiment was disbanded in Canada. The soldiers settled in the St. Lawrence valley and, in the late 17th century, formed the core of the <b>Compagnies</b> Franches de la Marine, the local militia. Later militias were developed on the larger seigneuries land systems.|$|E
25|$|The early {{military}} of New France {{consisted of}} a mix of regular soldiers from the French Army (Carignan-Salières Regiment) and French Navy (Troupes de la marine and <b>Compagnies</b> Franches de la Marine) supported by small local volunteer militia units (Colonial militia). Most early troops were sent from France, but localization after {{the growth of the}} colony meant that, by the 1690s, many were volunteers from the settlers of New France, and by the 1750s most troops were descendants of the original French inhabitants. Additionally, many of the early troops and officers who were born in France remained in the colony after their service ended, contributing to generational service and a military elite. The French built a series of forts from Newfoundland to Louisiana and others captured from the British during the 1600s to the late 1700s. Some were a mix of military post and trading forts.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{defeat in}} the Spanish Civil War in early 1939, about half a million Spanish Republicans fled to France to escape {{imprisonment}} or execution. On {{the north side of}} the Pyrenees, such refugees were confined in internment camps such as Camp Gurs and Camp Vernet. Although over half of these had been repatriated to Spain (or elsewhere) by the time Pétain proclaimed the Vichy Régime in 1940, the 120,000 to 150,000 who remained became political prisoners, and the foreign equivalent to the Service du Travail Obligatoire, the <b>Compagnies</b> de Travailleurs Étrangers (Companies of Foreign Workers) or CTE, began to pursue them for slave labour. The CTE permitted prisoners to leave the internment camps if they agreed to work in German factories, but as many as 60,000 Republicans recruited for the labour service managed to escape and join the French Résistance. Thousands of suspected anti-fascist Republicans were deported to German concentration camps instead, however. Most were sent to Mauthausen where, of the 10,000 Spaniards registered, only 2,000 survived the war.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, technocrats such as Jean Bichelonne and {{engineers}} from the Groupe X-Crise used their position to push various state, administrative, and economic reforms. These reforms {{have been cited}} as evidence of a continuity of the French administration {{before and after the}} war. Many of these civil servants and the reforms they advocated were retained after the war. Just as the necessities of a war economy during the First World War had pushed forward state measures to reorganize the economy of France against the prevailing classical liberal theories – structures retained after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles – reforms adopted during World War II were kept and extended. Along with the 15 March 1944 Charter of the Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR), which gathered all Resistance movements under one unified political body, these reforms were a primary instrument in the establishment of post-war dirigisme, a kind of semi-planned economy which led to France becoming the modern social democracy it is now. An example of such continuities is the creation of the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems by Alexis Carrel, a renowned physician who also supported eugenics. This institution was renamed as the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) after the war, and exists to this day. Another example is the creation of the national statistics institute, renamed INSEE after the Liberation. The reorganization and unification of the French police by René Bousquet, who created the groupes mobiles de réserve (GMR, Reserve Mobile Groups), is another example of Vichy policy reform and restructuring maintained by subsequent governments. A national paramilitary police force, the GMR was occasionally used in actions against the French Resistance, but its main purpose was to enforce Vichy authority through intimidation and repression of the civilian population. After Liberation, some of its units were merged with the Free French Army to form the <b>Compagnies</b> Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS, Republican Security Companies), France's main anti-riot force.|$|E

This contract is known as excess of loss reinsurance. The objective of the insurance <b>compagny</b> is to maximize the expected utility of its reserve at some planning horizon and under a nonnegativity constraint.

2500|$|Popular {{conceptions of}} {{the final stages of}} the Hundred Years War are often {{dominated}} by the exploits of Joan of Arc, but French resurgence was rooted in multiple factors.

The <b>Compagnies</b> gave the French a considerable edge in professionalism and discipline. Strong French counterattacks turned the tide of the war.
