25|$|The {{scope of}} RoHS 2 is widened to include {{products}} previously excluded, such as medical devices and industrial equipment. In addition, manufacturers are now obliged to provide conformity risk assessments and test reports – or {{explain why they}} are lacking. For the first time, not only manufacturers, but also importers and distributors share a responsibility to ensure Electrical and Electronic Equipment {{within the scope of}} RoHS comply with the hazardous substances limits and have a <b>CE</b> <b>mark</b> on their products.|$|E
5000|$|If the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is affixed on a product, it {{can bear}} {{additional}} markings {{only if they}} are of different significance, do not overlap with the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> and are not confusing and do not impair the legibility and visibility of the <b>CE</b> <b>marking.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} is to {{identify}} whether the product needs to bear <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> or not. Not all products are required to bear <b>CE</b> <b>marking,</b> only the products that fall within the scope of {{at least one of the}} sectoral directives requiring <b>CE</b> <b>marking.</b> There are more than 20 sectoral product directives requiring <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> covering, but not limited to, products such as electrical equipment, machines, medical devices, toys, pressure equipment, PPE, wireless devices and construction products.|$|R
50|$|There are {{mechanisms}} {{in place to}} ensure that the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is put on products correctly. Controlling products bearing <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is the responsibility of public authorities in member states, in cooperation with the European Commission. Citizens may contact national market surveillance authorities if the misuse of the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is suspected or if a product's safety is questioned.|$|R

2500|$|The first resorbable stent {{tested in}} humans was {{developed}} by the Igaki Medical Planning Company in Japan and was constructed from poly-L-lactic acid (a form of polylactic acid); they published their initial results in 2000. [...] The German company, Biotronik, developed a magnesium absorbable stent and published clinical results in 2007. [...] The first company to bring a bioresorbable stent to market was Abbott Vascular which received a European marketing approval in September 2012; the second was Elixir which received its <b>CE</b> <b>mark</b> in May 2013.|$|E

QuantiFERON-TB Gold is [...] FDA-approved in the United States, has <b>CE</b> <b>Mark</b> approval in Europe and has been approved by the MHLW in Japan. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold blood test give 2% false results in contrast to about 30% of Mantoux test.|$|E

2500|$|A {{notified}} body, in the European Union, is {{an entity}} {{that has been}} accredited by a Member State to assess whether a product {{to be placed on}} the market meets certain preordained standards. Conformity assessment can include inspection and examination of a product, its design, and the manufacturing environment and processes associated with it. [...] For example, a notified body may designate that a medical device conforms to the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, which defines the standards for medical devices. With this Declaration of Conformity, the manufacturer can label the product with the <b>CE</b> <b>Mark,</b> which is required for distribution and sale in the E.U. Additionally, the E.U. member state accrediting the notified body will then inform the European Commission that the product complies with set standards (or not).|$|E

50|$|Only {{when this}} {{condition}} {{has been satisfied}} can the <b>CE</b> <b>mark</b> be properly affixed to the product, recognising and demonstrating that the product fulfills the European Union safety and performance requirements and thereby allowing free trade inside the European Union. Therefore, <b>CE</b> <b>mark</b> is a legal requirement for trade within the EU. Any other mark is voluntary and can not substituted the <b>CE</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
50|$|Products {{which are}} covered by EN 16034 have to be <b>CE</b> <b>marked</b> when placed on the market. <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> enables free trade within all Member States. This is a major change as the {{affixing}} of the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> under {{the provisions of the}} old Construction Products Directive (CPD) which has been replaced by the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) was wrongly considered to be voluntary.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{the level}} of risk of the product, the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is affixed to a product by the {{manufacturer}} or authorized representative who decides whether the product meets all the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> requirements. If a product has minimal risk, it can be self-certified by a manufacturer making a declaration of conformity and affixing the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> to their own product. In order to self-certify, the Manufacturer must do several things: ...|$|R

50|$|Existing in {{its present}} form since 1985, the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> {{indicates}} that the manufacturer or importer claims compliance with the relevant EU legislation applicable to a product, regardless of where manufactured.

50|$|Once an EU {{declaration}} of conformity has been completed, the final step is to affix the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> to the product. When this has been done, the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> requirements have been met for the product to be placed legally on the EEA market.|$|R
5000|$|Not all {{products}} need <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> {{to be traded}} in the EEA; only product categories subject to relevant directives or regulations are required (and allowed) to bear <b>CE</b> <b>marking.</b> Most CE-marked products can {{be placed on the}} market subject only to an internal production control by the manufacturer (Module A; see Self-certification, below), with no independent check of the conformity of the product with EU legislation; ANEC has cautioned that, amongst other things, <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> cannot be considered a [...] "safety mark" [...] for consumers.|$|R
50|$|<b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is a {{certification}} mark that indicates conformity with health, safety, {{and environmental protection}} standards for products sold within the European Economic Area (EEA). The <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> is also found on products sold outside the EEA that are manufactured in, or designed to be sold in, the EEA. This makes the <b>CE</b> <b>marking</b> recognizable worldwide even {{to people who are}} not familiar with the European Economic Area.

If the product passed the test it was issued with the <b>CE</b> <b>mark.</b> Trading Standards officers could fine a company £5,000 that did not have a <b>CE</b> <b>mark</b> on an electronic product. The <b>CE</b> <b>mark</b> was originally going to be needed for electronic equipment from January 1992, and from January 1993 the DTI spent £450,000 informing companies about the change in legislation, spending another £100,000 after January 1996.
