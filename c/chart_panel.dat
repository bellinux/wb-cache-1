Additional adjustments for metabolic factors reduced the risk to approximately 1. 2 - 1. 4 -fold, which is still significant. Of interest, high-sensitive CRP also predicted all-cause and cancer mortality.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{study on}} sandwich panels for slab applications looking at expanded polystyrene core sandwich panels with various materials for the face. The aim {{is to determine the}} optimum thickness for strength and serviceability of a number of sandwich panels. Finite element analysis using Strand 7 and the construction and testing of physical samples were carried out to verify the accuracy of a numerical study. Four panels were constructed using plywood, oriented strand board, aluminium and steel as the face material and were tested in a SANS material testing machine which measured applied loading and mid-span deflection. These same panels were modelled using finite element analysis in the Strand 7 software package under the same conditions as the laboratory tests. The results were compared and found to be in good agreement between them which confirmed the validity of the computer model. Further study was undertaken using Strand 7 to model the same panels with the application of domestic floor loading as per AS 1170. Three formulas to calculate the optimum core thickness with respect to the panel failure mode were tested however were found to be unsuitable for the loading arrangement of a uniformly distributed load and a concentrated load. An iterative approach to determining the optimum core thickness was then used. Modelling various thicknesses of the same span panel allowed the optimum core thickness to be determined for that span that would allow the panel to only deflect a maximum of Span/ 400 or 10 mm. This process was repeated until a span/thickness curve was created that allows the optimum thickness core to be read from the <b>chart</b> for <b>panel</b> spans up to 6 metres. This research project shows that sandwich panel can be used for slab applications under domestic floor loading. The validity of the Strand 7 model has been shown be comparing physical test results to the computer model. By developing span/thickness charts to optimise the core thickness of the panels allows a panel system to be manufactured that will minimise weight and cost while still satisfying strength and serviceability requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|Until {{households}} and financial institutions repair their balance sheets, recovery in many advanced economies will be halting GOING down a mountain is usually easier than going up. But finance {{seems to work}} differently from the law of gravity. Reducing debt, that is, “deleveraging, ” {{has proven to be}} a much harder slog than the climb up the debt mountain. This is why balance sheet recessions, like the one many advanced economies recently suffered, are much worse than recessions in which balance sheets are not overloaded with unsustainable debts (see “Tracking the Global Recovery ” in this issue of F&D). Until financial institutions, households, and governments in advanced economies return their balance sheets to sustainable levels of assets and debt, recovery from the worst global economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930 s will be retarded. At issue is why deleveraging is so hard, what governments can do to help, how far the world has come in shedding debt, and what policies for the future are best. Origins of the crisis Most financial crises involve too much borrowing. Who does the excess borrowing, though, varies. In the past, it was often governments or corporations that borrowed too much. Before the recent crisis, it was financial institutions and households in advanced economies, as well as some governments, that took on too much debt. Financial corporations in some key advanced economies registered the sharpest increase in debt. Before the crisis, their balance sheets multiplied relative to the total size of their underlying economies (see <b>Chart</b> 1, top <b>panel).</b> The debt-toequity ratio (leverage) of financial institutions also often ros...|$|R

The review <b>panel</b> <b>charted</b> ILCA's progress in acting on the recommendations of the generally critical 1982 quinquennial review, and found this progress found to be substantial, but not complete. The panel encouraged ILCA to continued with its farming systems approach, although the collaborating national research systems had not yet adopted this approach. This aspect of ILCA's work was concentrated in five zonal programs, which worked quite independently. ILCA faced the difficult issues of promoting mutual reinforcement among the zonal programs, located in different agroclimatic areas, and determining the proper balance between central research on common problems and the zonal farming systems work. The panel stressed the importance of ILCA keeping longer term perspectives in mind,. Faced with a broad mandate, and pressure from African governments to respond to their interests, the panel recommended greater focus in the research, and to that end the preparation of a long term strategy as a basis for setting priorities. The report contained a detailed appraisal of various ILCA programs and supporting services, and recommendations concerning them. This review was considered, with the EMR, at TAC 40 in July 1986 and at the CGIAR in November 1986 and, after ILCA had prepared the required strategy document, at TAC 43 in June 1987 and the CGIAR meeting of October 1987...|$|R

40|$|Background Hypertension is now {{estimated}} to effect 1 billion people worldwide, {{with one of}} its main risk factors being salt intakes largely exceeding our physiological requirements. Currently the average salt intake within the UK is 8. 6 g/day of which bread is {{estimated to}} contribute 1 / 5 of. The {{aim of this study}} was the determine whether the replacement of mineral salt (Smart salt which a low sodium, potassium and magnesium containing salt) is able to produce a loaf of bread considered acceptable in terms of rheological and baking qualities; as this salt replacement strategy may have important implications for a population based reduction in salt intake and consequently, blood pressure. Methods The control (n= 1) and experimental (n= 4) breads were baked within the queen Margaret Laboratory, where dough development time, baking time and loaf height were measured. The breads were then subjected to a single, blind, randomised controlled sensory evaluation study {{with the use of a}} star profile <b>chart</b> in a <b>panel</b> of 11 testers. These samples were analysed based on various baking qualities considered important to the consumer Results Dough development times for corresponding levels of regular salt against Smart salt were similar for the same NaCl levels within each bread showing the extra Potassium and Magnesium content within smart salt have no marked effect on dough development time. The Smart salt loaves were (23 ± 4. 5 mm) taller in height when compared with their corresponding NaCl levels, showing the S. S may have a reduced inhibitory effect on yeast. A significant difference (p 0. 05) were found between other loaves, it may be noted that the mean score of the Smart salt samples for four out of five qualities. Conclusions Smart salt had no direct effect on the dough development time of bread, however, the outcome loaf height was markedly taller than the normal salt loaves (23 mm ± 4. 5). Although no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found between most groups within the sensory evaluation, we can conclude that Smart salt is able to produce a loaf of bread considered acceptable in terms of all baking qualities when compared to the regular salt variants. This may have important future implications in the current battle of implementing substantial a salt reduction within the population.

40|$|Fast patrol {{boats are}} {{high-speed}} vessels {{operated by the}} Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN). These ships are 36, 5 meters long, have a beam of 6, 2 meters and operate at high speed (32 knots – 16, 5 meters per second) in very restricted waters. The fast patrol boats are war ships and navigation tasks performed by the crews {{are different from those}} in civilian high-speed craft. A team of five persons navigate the fast patrol boats, and navigation is based on traditional means such as visual observations and paper charts. The person leading the team is the navigator. The ships were built in the late 1970 s and upgraded in 2001 when new navigation equipment was installed. However, the crews criticized the modern navigation equipment for being complex and difficult to use. In 2002, an upgraded fast patrol boat collided with a rock during high-speed navigation. The accident resulted only in material damage. Following this accident the RNoN acknowledged the need to gather knowledge about human factors and design of navigation equipment. Navigating a fast patrol boat is about operating a complex sociotechnical system. Strong demands are put on both people and their tools. In order to design usable navigation equipment for these ships, one has to have knowledge about the ships’ task, the crew that carry out the navigation, and the contexts in which navigation takes place. To gather such knowledge, this study observed several navigation teams at work and used different approaches to structure and describe the work of navigation teams. A hierarchical task analysis was conducted in order to describe navigation in accordance with procedures and established best practices. The assignment navigate to destination was the highest level of the navigator’s work. The assignment included the navigation tasks; plan, start, monitor, change course, and arrive. For each navigation task, a detailed analysis was conducted. It was found that the crews used work practices that emphasize efficiency rather than accuracy in e. g. position fixing. Although efficiency was given priority, the navigation teams controlled system variation {{in order to keep the}} ship within safe waters. A usability study was conducted. This study treated navigation equipment that had been fitted when the ship was upgraded. A cognitive walkthrough was conducted in order to evaluate whether human factors guidelines were applied in the design of the modern navigation equipment. In total 30 usability findings were described. The study suggested that navigation equipment to little extent were user-centered. The navigation teams compensated for lack of usability by expanding actions and by modifying the equipment. The framework of distributed cognition was used to describe the observed work of the navigation teams. Distributed cognition suggests that cognitive processes are not bounded by the individual person, but are distributed between humans and the physical artifacts they use. Humans and artifacts that participate in goal directed processes are said to be in a functional relationship. Within the functional relationships information trajectories describe how information is gathered, shared and used. Functional relationships are not static but can configure depending on the context. In studies of distributed cognitive processes, investigating physical representations are important as these are outside the head of the people, yet within the cognitive system. The navigation team and their artifacts were described as one cognitive system where the crew and their tools were functionally related. Navigation was in most cases founded on a detailed plan. The navigator drew lines and symbols in nautical paper charts in order to represent the plan. The navigation plan was a resource for the teams’ actions and the charts were a frame of reference for the teamwork on the bridge. The crew enriched their tools in order to improve communication and information retrieving. For instance, information important to navigation was to large extent noted in the chart. Another example was equipping the bearing device with small pins in order to feel the direction of the device. Artifacts were also used to support the navigators’ memory. Pointing the bearing device in the direction of the upcoming course meant that the navigator did not have to remember the sailing direction. The dynamic properties of the system did on the one hand provide barriers towards erroneous actions. The crewmembers monitored each other’s tasks and corrected mistakes when necessary. On the other hand, when the functional relationship was not held together, the result was entropy. The framework of activity theory was used to provide further descriptions of the navigation teams’ work. Activity theory focuses on people working in a context. In this study, activity was regarded as situated actions taking place in shorter time frames. Activity theory claims that the elements of the activity encompass the persons and their use of tools towards a conscious goal. Further, the goals of the activity are influenced by the outcome of the activity and by specific constraints. Activity theory describes the structure of navigation at different levels. The basic constraints that influenced the navigation teams were related to the space available to maneuver the ship, and to the conditions for making visual observations. Crewmembers’ behavior was not constant, but directed towards different motives depending on the circumstances. The crew usually carried out goal related tasks. However, in some cases the crew directed their work towards the operations of equipment or towards solving problems. The framework of activity theory described how internal and external factors influenced the focus of the teams’ work. Both distributed cognition and activity theory findings suggested that the teams frequently used artifacts for purposes beyond their initial scope of design. For instance, bearing devices were used to augment navigators’ memory. Based on the knowledge gathered from task analysis, the usability study, and from the frameworks of distributed cognition and activity theory, a design study was carried out. Four prototypes were produced in order to explore possible design solutions that could improve the thinking and cooperation for the navigation teams. The prototypes included an automatic steering system, an electronic <b>chart,</b> alarm <b>panels,</b> and audio alarms. The prototypes emphasized the use of physical representations and perceptually rich interfaces. The interfaces used for instance sound, vision, and tacitle feedback. Applying human factors principles in design suggested several design solutions that possibly could improve navigators’ working conditions. However, there is a risk that new design will create opportunities for new types of failures. For this reasons, user evaluations were suggested as a necessary part of design development. However, user evaluation was outside the scope of this study. This study suggested two outcomes of a design processes. One outcome is the improvement of the design in question. The second outcome is the design seeds, that is concepts and techniques that can be reused in other development settings. Development on navigation technology is at present an industry with strong engineering influence and traditions. This study suggested that a user-centered approach should involve engineers and work through the engineers’ domain. It was suggested that a design process for development of navigation equipment would benefit from being multidisciplinary, iterative and utilize user evaluation.
