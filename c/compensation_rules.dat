Both players {{were subject to}} draft pick {{compensation}} under MLB rules, dampening their market. Boras criticized the <b>compensation</b> <b>rules,</b> while the MLBPA launched an investigation into team conduct. The rules, which Boras dismissed as [...] "corrupt" [...] the previous winter, also hurt the market for players Boras did not represent, like Nelson Cruz, Ubaldo Jiménez, and Ervin Santana. All three signed one-year deals {{before the start of}} the 2014 regular season. That meant all three were again exposed to the draft pick <b>compensation</b> <b>rules</b> following the 2014 season. By waiting to sign, Drew and Morales avoided any draft pick compensation following the 2014 season.|$|E

50|$|Heading {{into the}} 2010 Major League Baseball Draft, Loux {{was seen as}} a {{potential}} late-first round pick. Surprising many, the Arizona Diamondbacks drafted Loux with the sixth overall selection, agreeing to a pre-draft deal with Loux with a $2 million signing bonus. However, Loux failed his physical with the Diamondbacks due to a torn labrum and elbow damage that doctors felt might require ligament-replacement surgery in the future.

50|$|In {{the first}} section, the authors {{identify}} the challenges entrepreneurs face {{when trying to}} raise capital: (1) uncertainty about the future; (2) information gaps about the new product and the market for it; (3) the predominance of soft assets (e.g. patents, trade secrets), in contrast to hard assets (e.g. land, equipment) that are easier to finance; and (4) the volatility of the product- and financial market conditions. The authors then explain how VCs addresses these problems: screening mechanisms, due diligence, staged financing, syndicated investment, executive <b>compensation</b> <b>rules,</b> financing covenants like convertible debt, and corporate governance mechanisms {{are some of the}} solutions employed and discussed in the book.|$|E

5000|$|The report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the structure and evolution of the EU banking sector with its tradition of universal banking, and assesses banking reforms in the European post-debt crisis era. It lists a range of proposals to remedy deficits in bank reforms, such as improving of already existing regulations in risk management under the Basel III rules, corporate governance, bank resolution mechanisms, management and strengthening of supervision and <b>compensation</b> <b>rules</b> for bank staff. It advocates for a better alignment of executive pay with long term corporate and national interests, by raising the fixed income or “debt” component of bankers’ bonuses, meaning the bonuses could be decreased if short-term profits yield long-term troubles, paying bonuses with bonds. The Swiss bank UBS adopted the latter so called [...] "bail-in bonds". 2/5/13.|$|E
50|$|These are {{additions}} made by {{the king}} of the Franks to the barbarian laws promulgated under the Merovingians, the Salic law, the Ripuarian or the Bavarian. These capitularies have the same weight as the law which they complete; they are particular in their application, applying, that is to say, only to the men subject to that law. Like the laws, they consist chiefly of scales of <b>compensation,</b> <b>rules</b> of procedure and points of civil law. They were solemnly promulgated in the local assemblies where the consent of the people was asked. Charlemagne and Louis the Pious seem to have made efforts to bring the other laws into harmony with the Salic law.

40|$|I {{develop a}} model {{in which there are}} two groups in society, one of which bears all the costs of a {{regulation}} that provides (potentially unequal) benefits to both groups. Absent compensation, a biased government will not choose the efficient level of regulation. If taxes are nondistorting, a <b>compensation</b> <b>rule</b> can be designed to achieve the first best outcome. The optimal rule always involves a positive degree of compensation regardless of the direction of the government bias.

40|$|Modern {{international}} investment agreements {{have challenged}} the customary exclusion of public good regulations from being considered government ‘takings ’ subject to <b>compensation</b> <b>rules.</b> Full compensation for regulatory takings can, however, lead to over-investment and excessive entry in risky industries.

We design a carve-out/compensation rule that induces efficient regulation and firm-level investment even when the regulator suffers fiscal illusion and has private information about the social benefit from regulation. We also show that a carve-out reduces the subsidy to risky industry implicit in <b>compensation</b> <b>rules,</b> and thus mitigates the entry problem. * The authors thank the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation for providing financial support for this project...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{a model of}} the country with heterogeneous population and examine compensation schemes that may prevent a threat of secession by dissatisfied regions.

In the case of uniform distribution, we establish the 50 -percent <b>compensation</b> <b>rule</b> for disadvantageous regions. Thus, we argue for a limited gap reduction between advantageous and disadvantageous regions and show that neither laissez faire nor Rawlsian allocation is secession-proof. ...|$|R

When the taking decision is independent of land use, zero compensation is efficient, but full compensation is not. When the project decision is no longer independent of land use, and can be affected by investor decisions, neither <b>compensation</b> <b>rule</b> is generally efficient because of the moral hazard problem. With risk-averse consumers and risk-neutral firms, the previous conclusions remain essentially unchanged. However, when the project decision rule involves a budgetary "fiscal illusion," additional compensation may be necessary to correct the incentives facing the project decision-maker...|$|R

To the contrary, this paper shows that the <b>compensation</b> <b>rule</b> is irrelevant regarding the level of investment landowners make in their property, as well as the amount of land they authorize the government to acquire, both of which will be efficient. Intuitively, landowners recognize the equivalence of taxes and takings in budgetary terms, causing the distortionary effects of compensation and property taxation to cancel each other out through the balanced budget condition.

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} {{desirability}} of compensation for regulatory takings. To do so, we describe a public choice model in which regulators' decisions are influenced by competing political interests. We consider how the political incentives of landowners, environmentalists, and taxpayers are affected by alternative <b>compensation</b> <b>rules</b> and in turn describe the regulatory decisions made in such a pluralistic political environment. Modeling the regulator's incentives in this way leads {{to the conclusion that}} compensation should not be paid unless environmentalists and property owners have unequal influence politically. Moreover, the model has several counter-intuitive implications when political influence is not balanced. For instance, if environmentalists are disenfranchised they should support compensation, since it reduces property owner opposition to regulation. In contrast, if environmentalists wield disproportionate influence, penalizing rather than compensating landowners can induce more efficient regulation by stimulating landowner opposition. The analysis emphasizes the deadweight social costs of compensation and {{the desirability of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>rules</b> conditioned on both diminished land value and irreversible landowner investments. ...|$|E
