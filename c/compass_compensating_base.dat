40|$|This paper investigates how the {{behavior}} of individual decision makers can affect {{the performance of a}} supply chain. We study a two-stage supplier-retailer system, using a buy-back contract. Each firm's actions are executed by an agent. The retailer's purchasing agent and the supplier's sales agent are <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on certain performance measures, and they act accordingly. We study the impacts of their behavior in both the supplier-as-leader and retailer-as-leader settings. We find that, unless their incentives are carefully constructed, the agents can strongly distort the system's behavior. Specifically, "channel stuffing" (packing the distribution channel with excess inventory) can occur in both settings. Only when the agents are <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on net profit do they act in accord with their firms' objectives. These results may help explain some recent scandals.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the sensorimotor system uses a loss (cost) function to evaluate potential movements {{in the presence of}} random noise. Here we test this idea in the context of both error-based and reinforcement-based learning. In a reaching task, we laterally shifted a cursor relative to true hand position using a skewed probability distribution. This skewed probability distribution had its mean and mode separated, allowing us to dissociate the optimal predictions of an error-based loss function (corresponding to the mean of the lateral shifts) and a reinforcement-based loss function (corresponding to the mode). We then examined how the sensorimotor system uses error feedback and reinforcement feedback, in isolation and combination, when deciding where to aim the hand during a reach. We found that participants compensated differently to the same skewed lateral shift distribution depending on the form of feedback they received. When provided with error feedback, participants <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on the mean of the skewed noise. When provided with reinforcement feedback, participants <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on the mode. Participants receiving both error and reinforcement feedback continued to <b>compensate</b> <b>based</b> on the mean while repeatedly missing the target, despite receiving auditory, visual and monetary reinforcement feedback that rewarded hitting the target. Our work shows that reinforcement-based and error-based learning are separable and can occur independently. Further, when error and reinforcement feedback are in conflict, the sensorimotor system heavily weights error feedback over reinforcement feedback...|$|R

40|$|A huge {{fraction}} of cameras used nowadays {{is based on}} CMOS sensors with a rolling shutter that exposes the image line by line. For dynamic scenes/cameras this introduces undesired effects like stretch, shear and wobble. It has been shown earlier that rotational shake induced rolling shutter effects in hand-held cell phone capture can be <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on {{an estimate of the}} camera rotation. In contrast, we analyse the case of significant camera motion, e. g. where a bypassing streetlevel capture vehicle uses a rolling shut-ter camera in a 3 D reconstruction framework. The intro-duced error is depth dependent and cannot be <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on camera motion/rotation alone, invalidating also rectification for stereo camera systems. On top, significant lens distortion as often present in wide angle cameras in-tertwines with rolling shutter effects as it changes the time at which a certain 3 D point is seen. We show that naive 3 D reconstructions (assuming global shutter) will deliver biased geometry already for very mild assumptions on ve-hicle speed and resolution. We then develop rolling shutter dense multiview stereo algorithms that solve for time of ex-posure and depth at the same time, even in the presence of lens distortion and perform an evaluation on ground truth laser scan models as well as on real street-level data. 1...|$|R

Four-member ad hoc student teams repeatedly complete an interdependent task on the computer in an experiment in which I manipulate individual compensation plan (flat wage or performance-based incentives), team compensation plan (flat wage or performance-based incentives), and teammate familiarity (identified teammates with pre-experiment interaction ? strong id or unidentified teammates with no pre-experiment interaction ? weak id). Results indicate that while the combination of team and individual performance-based compensation results in the highest performance, the incremental performance boost is higher from the first performance-based reward strategy, regardless of whether it is team or individual. Under both strong and weak identity, offering a combination of individual and team performance-based compensation results in comparable performance, suggesting that lower productivity levels associated with low team identity can be overcome with performance-based compensation. Together these results suggest that, regardless of team identity, firms can benefit from offering both team and individual performance-based compensation. However, companies should understand that the performance bump may be smaller from the second performance-based scheme...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{regulatory}} non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) function through complementary binding with mRNAs {{or other}} ncRNAs, e. g., microRNAs, snoRNAs and bacterial sRNAs. Predicting these RNA interactions {{is essential for}} functional studies of putative ncRNAs or {{for the design of}} artificial RNAs. Many ncRNAs show clear signs of undergoing <b>compensating</b> <b>base</b> changes over evolutionary time. Here, we postulate that a non-negligible part of the existing RNA-RNA interactions contain preserved but covarying patterns of interactions. Methods We present a novel method that takes <b>compensating</b> <b>base</b> changes across the binding sites into account. The algorithm works in two steps on two pre-generated multiple alignments. In the first step, individual base pairs with high reliability are found using the PETfold algorithm, which includes evolutionary and thermodynamic properties. In step two (where high reliability base pairs from step one are constrained as unpaired), the principle of cofolding is combined with hierarchical folding. The final prediction of intra - and inter -molecular base pairs consists of the reliabilities computed from the constrained expected accuracy scoring, which is an extended version of that used for individual multiple alignments. Results We derived a rather extensive algorithm. One of the advantages of our approach (in contrast to other RNA-RNA interaction prediction methods) is the application of covariance detection and prediction of pseudoknots between intra - and inter -molecular base pairs. As a proof of concept, we show an example and discuss {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the approach. </p...|$|R

40|$|We study a setup {{in which}} a system {{operator}} hires a sensor to exert costly effort to collect accurate measurements of a value of interest over time. At each time, the sensor is asked to report his observation to the operator, and is <b>compensated</b> <b>based</b> on the accuracy of this observation. Since both the effort and observation are private information for the sensor, a naive payment scheme which <b>compensates</b> the sensor <b>based</b> only on his self-reported values will lead to both shirking and falsification of outcomes by the sensor. We consider the problem of designing an appropriate compensation scheme to incentivize the sensor to at once exert costly effort and truthfully reveal the resulting observation. To this end, we formulate the problem as a repeated game and propose a compensation scheme that employs stochastic verification by the operator coupled with a system of assigning reputation to the sensor. In particular, our proposed payment scheme <b>compensates</b> the sensor <b>based</b> on both the effort {{in the current period}} as well as the history of past behavior. We show that by using past behavior in determining present payments, the operator can both incentivize higher effort as well as more frequent truthtelling by the sensor and decrease the required verification frequency.
