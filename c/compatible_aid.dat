40|$|The last {{pieces of}} the new {{regulatory}} framework for regional aid are finally coming together: following {{the adoption of the}} new regional aid guidelines last year, Member States have been engaged in devising assisted area maps, the last of which were approved on 16 September 2014; and, with the adoption of the general block exemption regulation this year, new instruments are being designed and i mplemented. More generally, over the last year or so, the European Commission has largely completed the reform programme set out in the 2012 State aid modernisation initiative. The reach of the reforms has been considerable: almost every substantive State aid text has been subject to review and revision, and there have been important procedural changes, notably in relation to transparency and new requirements for evaluation. Overall, there has been a significant recalibration of policy. In some areas, the s cope of <b>compatible</b> <b>aid</b> has been enlarged. By contrast, in the area of regional aid, there has been a significant tightening of some aspects of policy – notably regarding support for large firms in ‘c’ areas and the treatment of large cases of aid in all assisted areas...|$|E

40|$|A {{strategic}} partnership {{was formed}} among the American Foundrymen`s Society and the Federal government {{to develop and}} transfer the technology needed by the US foundry industry to: increase energy efficiency of cupola melting; improve recovery of carbon, silicon, and manganese through reduced oxidation losses; and improve productivity due to more uniform and predictable iron compositions. An effective mathematical model of the cupola offers {{a solution to the}} complex and interactive chemical and heat transfer processes to melt cast iron. The transient changes in charge size, charge composition, blast rate, and coke rate are used to optimize operation to improve melting rates, minimize oxidation losses of valuable alloying elements (C, Si, and Mn), and maintain iron composition. Despite these challenges, the cupola produces iron at a lower cost, and have better environmental controls than other melting process with 70 % of domestic liquid iron produced by this technique.

40|$|The {{realization}} of a commercially viable, thin-film uncooled pyroelectric detector {{has been the}} focus of research for several years. As part of this effort, we show that a conventional metallic electrode system (typically Pt) can be replaced with a conductive oxide such as LaxSr(1 –x) CoO 3 (LSCO). In addition to being crystallographically compatible with the lead-based, pyroelectric oxides such as Pb 0. 9 La 0. 1 Ti 0. 975 O 3 (PLT 10), LSCO is also chemically <b>compatible,</b> which <b>aids</b> in reducing the energy barrier for oriented growth and promotes the formation of phase-pure perovskite pyroelectric material. We have grown pyroelectric heterostructures of LSCO/PLT 10 /LSCO on single-crystal LaAlO 3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition. By carefully optimizing the processing conditions, we are able to obtain high-quality, thin films that allow us to investigate the basic pyroelectric properties of this material system. Additionally, LSCO exhibits a strong infrared absorption (α= = 105 /cm), which is beneficial for producing a simplified detector design with enhanced performance. We will discuss the pyroelectric and dielectric properties of LSCO/PLT 10 /LSCO heterostructures and their dependence on microstructure. Structural characterizations reveal that the c-axis orientation of the PLT 10 can be maximized. Pyroelectric measurements using the Byer-Roundy method have yielded, on the average, pyroelectric coefficients of 50 nC/cm 2 K for PLT 10. Both pyroelectric coefficients and pulsed polarization values show a clear dependence on the c-axis volume fraction of the PLT 1...|$|R

The proposed method extends the existing trainable COSFIRE approach by adding an inhibition mechanism that is inspired by shape-selective TEO neurons in visual cortex. A COSFIRE filter with inhibition takes as input excitatory and inhibitory responses from line and edge detectors. The type (excitatory or inhibitory) and the spatial arrangement of low level features are determined in an automatic configuration step that analyzes two types of prototype pattern called positive and negative. Excitatory features are extracted from a positive pattern and inhibitory features are extracted from one or more negative patterns. In our experiments we use four subsets of images with different noise levels from the Graphics Recognition data set (GREC 2011) and demonstrate that the inhibition mechanism that we introduce improves the effectiveness of recognition substantially...|$|R
40|$|Background: Percutaneous cardiac {{interventions}} are currently performed under X-ray guidance. Magnetic resonance imaging has been employed to guide intravascular interventions in the past, but mainly in animals. Translation of MR-guided interventions into humans {{has been limited}} {{by the lack of}} fully MR-compatible and safe devices, such as MR guidewires with mechanical characteristics similar to standard guidewires. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a newly developed MR-safe and compatible passive guidewire in aiding MR-guided cardiac interventions in a swine model and describe the two first-in-man solely MR-guided interventions. Methods and Results: In the preclinical trial, the new MR <b>compatible</b> wire <b>aided</b> the performance of 20 interventions in 5 swine. These consisted of balloon dilation of nondiseased pulmonary and aortic valves, aortic arch and branch pulmonary arteries. Catheter manipulations were monitored with real time MRI sequence with interactive modification of imaging plane and slice position. Following ethics and regulatory authority approval the two first-in-man MR-guided interventions were performed in a child and an adult, both with elements of valvar pulmonary stenosis. Both patients had successful relief of the valvar stenosis and were discharged home a few hours later with no complications. Conclusions: The described pre-clinical study and case reports are encouraging that with the availability of the new MR compatible and safe guidewire, certain percutaneous cardiac interventions will become feasible to perform solely under MR-guidance. The benefits are clear with elimination of the use of ionising radiation and improvement of visualisation of the target lesions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAdaptation to osmotic {{stress can}} be {{achieved}} by the accumulation of <b>compatible</b> solutes that <b>aid</b> in turgor maintenance and macromolecule stabilization. The genetic regulation of solute accumulation is poorly understood, and has been described well at the molecular level only in enterobacteria. In this study, we show the importance of the alternative sigma factor RpoE 2 in Sinorhizobium meliloti osmoadaptation. Construction and characterization of an S. meliloti rpoE 2 mutant revealed compromised growth in hyperosmotic media. This defect was {{due to the lack of}} trehalose, a minor carbohydrate osmolyte normally produced in the initial stages of growth and in stationary phase. We demonstrate here that all three trehalose synthesis pathways are RpoE 2 dependent, but only the OtsA pathway is important for osmoinducible trehalose synthesis. Furthermore, we confirm that the absence of RpoE 2 -dependent induction of otsA is the cause of the osmotic phenotype of the rpoE 2 mutant. In conclusion, we have highlighted that, despite its low level, trehalose is a crucial compatible solute in S. meliloti, and the OtsA pathway induced by RpoE 2 is needed for its accumulation under hyperosmotic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cell phones became {{extremely}} popular devices considering their vast utility world wide. However, making cell phones {{accessible to the}} deaf and hard-of-hearing community is still a challenge. Main available {{products on the market}} for this community offer no more than the possibility to boost/amplify volume. Many cellular provides individual cell phone models which are hearing <b>aid</b> <b>compatible</b> and possess speakerphone capabilities. However, if the user is completely deaf, these phones still tend to be somewhat complex or impossible to use. Another alternative, based on Video phones messages, are quickly widespread as the preferred method of communicating for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. However Video phones require significant computer processing power to compress and decompress video in real time. Nevertheless, this alternative still has to overcome the various technological challenges associated with utilizing video phone technology, especially via low bandwidth network. In this context, this paper describes a new application allowing the use of MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) to generate sign language animation in order to communicate with deaf people via cell phones. These animations are avatar based animation obtained by automatic interpretation of text into sign language. This application is a new component developed amongst WebSign kernel (Jemni et al., 2007; Jemni and Ellghoul, 2007) ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the great}} {{progress}} in devising technological aids to decision makers, most decisions are largely or entirely {{the product of}} intuitive, psychological processes. Many times, aids are not available (e. g., under field conditions); at other times, too many decisions {{have to be made}} to rely on more than educated intuition (e. g., those made by an officer or executive during a routine day); even when the stakes involved clearly justify investment in aids, time pressures may make that impossible (e. g., crisis situations). Moreover, the use of formal aids has a strong judgmental component. If these psychological processes are to be improved, they. must first be understood. For many years, the dominant model for describing many kinds of decisions has been a weighted average model. In this view, people make decisions on the basis of arithmetic calculations that systematically consider the magnitude of all possible consequences of a decision and the chances of achieving them. Ii Reviewing many research results, the present report concludes: (a) the ability of the weighted average models to *predict the decisions that people make varies from situation to situation; (b) even where they are successful in predicting decisions, these models may not {{do a very good job}} of describing the psychological processes that determined them. That is, their predictive accuracy is in part an artifact of the research techniques used. Without an understanding of how people make decisions, it is difficult to devise ways of enabling them to make better I i I I decisions.

40|$|The {{ability to}} pattern {{functional}} polymers at different length scales {{is important for}} the advancement of modern science and technology. This dissertation mainly describes the work done on the high resolution patterning of polymer thin films that have a variety of potential uses. The nanoscale patterning of spun-coated polar polymers was demonstrated using environmentally benign supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) as a processing solvent. The use of scCO 2 as a processing solvent has several technical advantages that help resolve some of the key problems faced in lithography. In addition, it helps reduce the energy and resource usage that can negatively affect the environment. scCO 2 is generally a poor solvent for high molecular weight polymers that are used as standard photoresists. Chapter 2 describes a series of fluorinated quaternary ammonium salts that were synthesized and used as CO 2 <b>compatible</b> additives to <b>aid</b> the dissolution of polar polymer photoresists in scCO 2. Using these dissolution aids, patterns as small as 100 nm lines were obtained with scCO 2 development. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the patterning of high-tech thin polymer films referred to as polymer brushes. In these films the polymer chains are covalently attached to a surface. A direct method of patterning polymer brushes in a single step using electron beam lithography has been described. Polymer brushes of different structures such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) brushes, poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) brushes, poly(isobutyl methacrylate) (PIBMA) brushes, poly(neopentyl methacrylate) (PNPMA) brushes and poly(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl methacrylate) (PTFEMA) brushes were grown via atom transfer radical polymerization. These brushes were directly patterned using e-beam and their sensitivity to e-beam patterning has been compared and explained. This direct patterning approach produced polymer brush patterns down to 50 nm lines. Due to the number of advantages of using scCO 2 as a processing solvent, the dry development of a directly patterned low surface energy coating composed of PTFEMA brushes in scCO 2 has been demonstrated in Chapter 4. Using scCO 2 as a developer, patterned PTFEMA brushes with 150 nm lines were obtained. Polymer brushes have been used to prepare biocompatible surfaces with reduced non-specific adsorption. Chapter 5 describes the synthesis of a new oligo(ethylene glycol) containing ATRP intiator to prevent non-specific adsorption of biomolecules on polymer brush coated gold electrodes. The adsorption of non-specific antibodies on modified gold electrodes was studied using cyclic voltammetry. Poly(acrylic acid) brushes grown using this new ATRP initiator showed reduced nonspecific binding of the gold electrodes. There has been a continuing need for developing new medical countermeasures for emerging infectious diseases. Chapter 6 describes the role of functionalized poly(acrylic acid) brushes {{in the development of a}} biosensor based on sensitive electrochemical detection of the intrinsic catalytic activity of antibodies. Poly(acrylic acid) brushes have been functionalized with 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl groups (model antigen) and Ni-NTA to immobilize specific antibodies on the sensor surface. The modification of gold surfaces with polymer brushes provides a bio- and electronically compatible substrate with high density of specific haptens with reduced non-specific adsorption...|$|R
40|$|Although various {{pieces of}} European {{secondary}} law law use the terms "mise en concurrence" ("calling for competition" or "competitive tendering procedure") they provide no {{definition of the}} expression "obligation de mise en concurrence" ("obligation to call for competition"). At the very beginning, the author therefore defines what is meant thereby in his thesis, i. e. "a more or less formalized action which a public or a private person has to follow in order to provoke a competition or a contest between potentially interested persons that perform an economic activity, in order to grant an individual advantage to one or several of them". The {{first part of the}} work deals with the regime of competitive tendering of the public procurement directives which the Court of Justice has considered "as a whole" to be the "core" of European law on public contracts. First, this part examins the development of the public procurement directives from 1971 on. The author shows that the puzzling evolution of the personal scope of the public procurement directives is guided by the personal scope of European primary law. While considering the remedies directives, the author examines to what extent they introduce requirements beyond the principle of effective judicial protection. While some of their requirements obviously do so, the remedies directives however remain very far from standardizing the means of redress at national level. Due to the member States' judicial autonomy, the compelling force of EU primary law differs from one member State to another. The same applies within the scope of the remedies directives as they let the member States a large degree of autonomy. The author then turns to examine the contribution of the procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE, 2004 / 18 /CE and 2009 / 81 /CE, their scope of application, as well as the concepts of public works concession and service concession. Various other questions are dealt with in the first part, {{such as the use of}} functional interpretation, the power of the European legislator to adopt regulations on public procurement and the impact of the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), the Revised GPA and other international agreements. At last the author explores the issue of electronic procurement and the Commission's proposals for replacing the public procurement directives 2004 / 17 /CE and 2004 / 18 /CE and its proposal concerning the award of concession contracts. The second part of of the thesis focuses on primary public procurement law. After having described the origin of the obligation to call for competition under EU primary law which the Court of Justice derives from articles 49 and 56 TFEU as well as from the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality, the author strives to determine whether this obligation is well-founded. This examination brings to light that the rationale behind the requirement to call for competition under EU primary law is rather fragile. Amongst others, the author comes to the conclusion that the condition of a certain cross-border interest of each public contract individually as a condition for the application of the primary law obligation to call for competition lacks relevance The author then reviews and examines other possible bases for an obligation to call for competition under EU primary law such as the right to good administration, the freedom of enterprise and the right to property, which are protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. Finally, it seems that only article 102 TFEU (abuse of a dominant position) could to a limited extent give rise to an obligation to call for competition. However, once a situation is governed by EU secondary law, it enters the scope of European law. Hence, the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on the grounds of nationality apply even if a situation involves no cross-border interest. If the Court of justice's case law were followed consistently, these principes should lead to require calls for competition in a number of purely internal situations. According to the author, deducing as precise consequences as does the Court of justice from the principal of equal treatment and other fundemental principles can hardly be justified. After that examination, the material rules of public procurement primary law stated by the Court of Justice and the General Court are successively reviewed. The pages that follow are about the exceptions to the obligation to call for competition under the public procurement directives and under primary law, as for instance articles 51 and 52 TFEU, overriding reasons of general interest and article 106, paragraph 2, TFEU. The author thereafter addresses the question whether primary law applies within the scope of secondary law. He comes to the conclusion that it does even when secondary law represents an exhaustive body of rules. Notwithstanding some ambiguous judgements of the Court of justice there is no support for the doctrine of priority of application of secondary law in the Court's case law. In what follows, the author tries to answer the question whether, in order to stay consistent with the case law developed in the wake of Telaustria, the obligation to call for competition which the case law of the Court of Justice requires for public works, service and supply contracts ought to be extended to other operations (sale or lease of real estate, design contests outside the scope of the public procurement directives, employment contracts, subsidised contracts awarded by private entities outside the scope of the public procurement directives, grants, …). The end of the second part deals with the personal scope of the primary law of public procurement which corresponds to that of EU primary law. The rules concerning State aid are addressed in detail in the third part of the thesis. The examination in that part shows that the public procurement directives, the primary law of public procurement and the EU state aid rules apply cumulatively. The EU State aid rules require efficency when awarding public contracts. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the categorization as State aid, a call for competition is never formally required. The Commission however insists on calls for competition in order to declare certain <b>aids</b> <b>compatible</b> with the internal market. Aids include by definition an advantage for their recipients. This remains true even though an aid has been authorised by the Commission pursuant to article 107, paragraphe 3, TFEU. Given the very broad scope the Court of Justice gives to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, aid measures give generally rise to obstacles to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services. At the risk of rendering article 107, paragraph 3, TFEU unnecessary, the fact that an aid measure impedes the fundamental freedoms of the internal market should therefore not prevent the Commission to declare it compatible with the internal market. This applies in particular to aids consisting in the award of a public contract that is covered only by EU primary law. That solution seems however excluded for public contracts within the scope of the public procurement directives. The Commission has adopted a broad concept of what is an "advantage" in the sense of the State aid rules. This leads the Commission to consider certain grants for environmental protection as State aid measures even though it may be difficult to dectect any kind of advantage. The Commission claims to control these measures in accordance with the rules of State aid control. On that occasion the Commission tends to make its consent subject to a call for competition in order to identify the projects that will be subsidized. A broad approach of the concept of undertaking leads to class as State aid various public infrastructure investments insofar they do not satisfy the private investor test. The Commission tends to make its consent to these investments subject to calls for competition. Such is notably the case regarding public investments in broadband network facilities. In the fourth part, the author examines a variety of secondary legislation imposing calls for competition other than the public procurement directives. These texts cover a wide range of areas and provide for competitive awards of various form and diverse content. Sometimes a requirement for competitive tendering is overtly expressed. At other times, it is implicit, indirect or just inchoate. Some advantages are awarded without a genuine competition or without any competition at all. Directive 2012 / 34 /CE establishing a single European railway area for instance sets principles for the allocation of "infrastructure capacity" (i. e the right to use a railway network). It does not employ such terms as "calling for competition". Where the infrastructure capacity is insufficient it has to be allocated in a fair and non discriminatory manner. The fee for using the railway network cannot be used as an award criterion. In some areas, competition in terms of price is the very basis of the system. This is true for the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. It happens that competitive assignment occurs incidentally and in a non compulsory way as in the case of the milk quota regime. In other cases, e. g. certain situations covered by the internal electricity market regime, the system excludes calls for competition whereas they should be required according to primary procurement law principles. Under still other circumstances, i. e. the award of public service contracts for public passenger transport services, competitive tendering only needs to be strictly complied with after a transitional period. This can hardly be reconciled with the principles of primary procurement law. In some cases the rules in place are such, for example when awarding the universal postal service, that it seems doubtful that a competitive bidding following objective and transparent criteria is really possible. The European greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme relies on auctions for the allocation of gaz emission authorisations. At first, it does so to a limited extent. Such authorisations, called "allowances", are freely transferable. Thus a reallocation of allowances according to market mechanismes is made possible. The author sheds light on some major inconsistencies of the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme. The late deadline for surrendering allowances gives rise for several years to a surplus of allowances over the greenhouse gas emissions considered in the scheme. On the other hand, the costs for same amounts of greenhouse gas emitted at the same time may vary. This gives rise to a problem of equality. The author comes to the conclusion that the scheme has little capacity to reach the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least cost to the economy. The designation of the universal postal service providers implies to lay down rules as to how the net cost of the universal service is to be calculated, as well as to define appropriate award criteria. These steps face considerable difficulties. A similar situation can be found in other areas such as electronic communications and electricity or natural gas transmission or distribution systems. In the latter case, the risk of a change of transmission or distribution tariffs due to decisions of national regulatory authorities leaves the competitors in the dark on a crucial point. The legislation regarding the internal electricity market and the internal gaz market puts the transmission and distribution system operators in a position very similar to that of service or public works concession holders. In some cases the principles which underlie these schemes exclude competitive tendering as required by primary procurement law. The networks being freely transferable, ownership of networks and hence, in principle, their operators are determined by private market mechanismes mainly through the level of the proposed sales price. This is not consistent with the principles of primary procurement law stated by the Court of Justice (advertising requirements, award criteria linked to the subject matter of the contract, [...] .). Neither does it seem compatible with these principles that the development of the networks belongs automatically to the transmission and distribution system operators. The assessment of conformity of secondary legislation with primary law is less strict than the conformity assessment of national law. The Court of Justice has allowed the European legislator a wide margin of discretion when establishing the internal market and seems to have tacitely acknowledged a form of conformity presumption of secondary law. Save in exceptional cases, it seems unlikely that the Court will put into question secondary law regimes differing from primary law procurement rules. Thus, the European legislator may adopt such solutions without incurring major legal risks...|$|R
