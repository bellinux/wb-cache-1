50|$|Toxocariasis {{will often}} resolve itself, because the Toxocara larvae cannot mature within human hosts. Corticosteroids are {{prescribed}} in severe cases of VLM {{or if the}} patient is diagnosed with OLM. Either albendazole (preferred) or mebendazole (“second line therapy”) may be prescribed. Granulomas can be surgically removed, or laser photocoagulation and <b>cryoretinopexy</b> {{can be used to}} destroy ocular granulomas.|$|E

Methods: Three eyes were treated in three patients, healthy boys aged 7  years, 12  years, and 11  years, with RRD, macular involvement, and small retinal holes, of which two were preoperatively undetectable. Conventional scleral buckling with <b>cryoretinopexy</b> was performed under the contact lens for vitreous surgery or noncontact wide-angle viewing system using 27 -gauge twin chandelier illumination. Results: The only known predisposing factor for retinal detachment was myopia stronger than 3  D with lattice retinal degeneration {{in two of the}} three patients. Retinal reattachment was achieved in all cases without intra- or postoperative complications. However, visual recovery was limited in one of the three patients. Conclusion: Scleral buckling with chandelier illumination is effective for pediatric RRD, especially if the retinal hole is difficult to detect preoperatively. However, visual recovery was sometimes limited because of macular involvement due to late diagnosis, {{which is one of the}} characteristic features of pediatric RRD.

40|$|Severe vaso-occlusive {{retinopathy}} as {{the initial}} manifestation of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) is rare. We report a 16 -year-old female who developed bilateral visual impairment. Fundus examinations showed bilateral “cherry-red spot” appearance, multiple confluent cotton wool spots, and widespread arterial occlusion. Laboratory studies showed leukopenia, antinuclear antibody (+), and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody (+). Malar rashes, oral ulcers, and bilateral knee joint tenderness were noted during physical examination. SLE was diagnosed and pulse therapy started immediately. Best corrected visual acuity of the left eye improved to 6 / 10 after treatment. However, there was no visual improvement in the right eye. Four months later, bilateral panretinal laser photocoagulation was performed due to retinal neovascularization. However, tractional retinal detachment of the right eye and vitreous hemorrhage of the left eye still occurred. After undergoing <b>cryoretinopexy</b> of the right eye and intravitreous tissue plasminogen activator injection of the left eye, the visual acuity of the patient's right eye remained hand movement only at 10 cm, but that of the left eye returned to 6 / 10. The ocular and systemic conditions were stable in the follow-up period of more than 2 years. This case demonstrates that in patients with severe vaso-occlusive retinopathy, a generalized immunological disorder, like SLE, should be suspected...|$|E

Here, we compared outcomes of primary RRD eyes operated with conventional scleral buckling (SB) with <b>cryoretinopexy</b> to those operated with standard pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Methods: This is an institutional, retrospective, register-based, observational, comparative study. Based on the surgical procedure, 319 eyes of 319 patients were divided into two groups: SB plus cryotherapy (n= 50) and PPV (n= 269). Changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded at 30 days and reoperation rates within 180 days postoperatively. Results: Eyes operated with PPV had less reoperations within the first 180 days as compared with SB eyes (P= 0. 001, log-rank test); however, changes in IOP were more prominent (mean ± standard deviation: + 8. 1 ± 8. 8 vs. + 4. 4 ± 7. 0  mmHg, respectively; P= 0. 006). Changes in BCVA did not differ between the surgical procedures. Conclusion: PPV was associated with higher primary anatomic success rates and lower risk of reoperation but significant IOP elevation when compared to SB. These factors should be case-specifically considered when choosing treatment modality for primary RRD. Keywords: rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, vitrectomy, scleral bucklin...|$|E
40|$|Human toxocariasis is an {{parasitic}} infection {{caused by the}} ingestion of larvae of dog nematode Toxocara canis and less frequently of cat nematode T. cati. Toxocara eggs, shed to environment by infected dogs’ and cats’ droppings, become infective by embryonation. Humans, particularly children, can be infected by accidentally ingesting embryonated Toxocara eggs. Larvae hatch in the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate {{to other parts of}} body via the bloodstream. It is generally a benign, asymptomatic, and self-limiting disease, although migrating larvae can cause damage to tissues and organs, especially brain involvement can cause severe morbidity. The two main clinical presentations of toxocariasis are visceral larva migrans (VLM) (a systemic disease caused by larval migration through major organs) and ocular larva migrans (OLM) (a disease limited to the eyes and optic nerves). There are also two less-severe syndromes which have recently been described, one mainly in children (covert toxocariasis) and the other mainly in adults (common toxocariasis). Diagnosis is usually made by clinical signs/symptoms, epidemiological background of the patient and the use of immunological methods (ELISA or western-blot). On the other hand definitive diagnosis is much more challenging, since it requires the demonstration of larvae via biopsy or autopsy. Most cases of toxocariasis clear up without any treatment. VLM is primarily treated with antihelmintic drugs, such as; albendazole or mebendazole. Treatment of OLM is more difficult and usually consists of measures to prevent progressive damage to the eye like steroids. Laser photocoagulation and <b>cryoretinopexy</b> may also be used to treat severe cases. Since eradicating T. canis infection is difficult due to the complexity of its life cycle, prevention of toxocariasis is always preferred. Toxocara eggs have a strong protective layer which makes the eggs able to survive in the environment for months or even years under the right conditions. In this review, current information about human toxocariasis, a continuing and important problem suspected to cause rheumatologic, dermatologic and respiratory system diseases, is presented...|$|E
