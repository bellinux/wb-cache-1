40|$|Medical Association (JAMA) {{was taken}} to the senior staff meeting for consideration: Could the copy editors ’ title be changed to {{manuscript}} editor, a change that would—the requestor felt—better reflect the scope of work done and help gain the editor the respect needed to negotiate changes with authors? The group was in agreement with making a change that would reflect the work done and satisfy the staff—and (an important factor in days of tight budgets) cost nothing! When all the copyediting staff were polled on the change, agreement was almost unanimous; a few felt that “copy editor ” encompassed more than “manuscript editor”, reflecting that editors also edit figures and tables in addition to the manuscript, but the objections were in the minority and were not strong. Stacy Christiansen, director of editing for JAMA, supported the change: “I have always associated ‘copy editor ’ with newspapers [...] While copy editors perform valuable services for newspapers and other media, I think the medical editing positions on JAMA/Archives [see Figure] and similar publications are different.

50|$|The {{church was}} {{extensively}} restored in the 18th and 19th centuries, but was largely destroyed by Second World War bombing by German bombers during the London Blitz {{during the night}} of 29-30 December 1940. It was rededicated in 1966, largely through donations by the worldwide Lutheran church, {{for use by the}} exile Estonian and Latvian communities in London. The reconstructed interior is a mixture of replicas of the prewar fittings and original or <b>copied</b> <b>fittings</b> from other London churches, some of which had also been destroyed in the war but were not reconstructed. The congregation of St Anne's Lutheran Church left the church in June 2013, and will share St Mary-at-Hill with its existing Anglican congregation. The building, now called the Gresham Centre, has become the home of Voces Cantabiles Music, an education project of the vocal ensemble Voces8.|$|R
