5|$|The {{physical}} characteristics {{seen in the}} breed are currently in flux, so {{there is not a}} single breed phenotype, though many members of the breed <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> the Mérens. Enthusiasts are breeding for a rustic mountain horse, of medium size, with good gaits and good temperament. Some members of the breed <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> Iberian horses such as the Andalusian horse. The official breed standard calls for a moderately long neck and long, sloped shoulder, broad back, rounded croup and muscular legs. Some members of the breed are branded on the left hindquarter. Because of its relative rarity and physical similarities, the Castillonnais is commonly confused with the Mérens.|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{preparation}} of a taxonomic revision of Cestrum (Solanaceae) for Flora Mesoamericana eight hitherto undescribed species from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Panama were identified. These eight new species are described and illustrated. Affinities of the species are discussed and Global Species Conservation Assessments presented. The new species are Cestrum amistadense A. K. Monro, sp. nov. (Vulnerable) which most <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> Cestrum longiflorum Ruiz & Pav., Cestrum contrerasianum A. K. Monro, sp. nov. (Vulnerable) which most <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> Cestrum formosum C. V. Morton, Cestrum darienense A. K. Monro, sp. nov. (Near Threatened) which most <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> Cestrum morae Hunz., Cestrum gilliae A. K. Monro, sp. nov. (Near Threatened) which most <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> Cestrum morae, Cestrum haberii A. K. Monro, sp. nov. (Vulnerable) which most <b>closely</b> <b>resembles</b> Cestrum poasanum Donn.

5|$|Additionally, The Adventure of Link {{was one of}} {{the first}} games to combine {{role-playing}} video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree. Over the next few years, a number of Japanese-made games appeared with a similar format; major titles such as Cadash (1989) <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> The Adventure of Link, with side-scrolling platform stages supplemented by RPG-like statistical systems, weapons, armor, magic spells, and so forth.|$|E

5|$|C.mutica <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> Caprella acanthogaster, also {{a native}} of East Asian waters. It may be {{difficult}} to distinguish the two species, particularly since Caprellamutica can exhibit considerable morphological variations among males. C.mutica can only be reliably differentiated by their setose first and second pereonites (smooth in C.acanthogaster), as well as the elongated oval shape of their gills (linear in C.acanthogaster).|$|E
5|$|In the DNA-study by Fain and Houde (2004) {{they were}} {{included}} in the Metaves, together with the Columbiformes. In the larger study by Hackett et al. (2008) they were once again positioned close to the Columbiformes, in Columbimorphae, but also with the Mesites. The intricately patterned, precocial downy young and egg colouration (though not shape) <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> those of many Charadriiformes. Eggs are near elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Some longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) are {{effective}} Batesian mimics of wasps. Beetles may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already <b>closely</b> <b>resemble.</b> Many other beetles, including ladybirds, blister beetles, and lycid beetles secrete distasteful or toxic substances {{to make them}} unpalatable or poisonous, and are often aposematic, where bright or contrasting coloration warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.|$|E

5|$|The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs {{which are}} then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the {{existing}} currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and lace monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Sirex {{woodwasp}} {{are almost}} colourless and only have three stub-shaped pairs of sterna. They cut through host wood with their powerful mandibles. They have a pointed, dark tip at their rear end, which presses the drilling {{dust on the}} walls of the borehole. They <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> other larvae in the genus Sirex.|$|E
5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E

5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children {{who arrived in}} the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887. Many details of the story very <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly {{as there is no}} record of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E
5|$|Ellie {{was created}} by Neil Druckmann, the {{creative}} director and writer of The Last of Us. Inspired by a mute character proposed for , Druckmann created her as a strong female character with {{a close relationship with}} Joel; throughout the game's development, the relationship between Ellie and Joel was the central focus, with all other elements developed around it. Johnson inspired aspects of Ellie's personality, prompting Druckmann to make her more active in fighting hostile enemies. Naughty Dog also redesigned her appearance during the game's development to more <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> Johnson. Her appearance has also been compared to that of actress Ellen Page.|$|E
5|$|Fossilized {{porbeagle}} remains {{are known}} from Late Miocene epoch (c. 7.2 Ma) deposits in Belgium and the Netherlands, Pliocene epoch (5.3–2.6 Ma) deposits in Belgium, Spain, and Chile, and Pleistocene epoch (2.6 Ma to 12,000 BP) deposits in the Netherlands. However, Lamna teeth that <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> {{those of the}} porbeagle {{have been found in}} the La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, which date to the middle to late Eocene epoch (50–34 Ma). There is much taxonomic confusion regarding Lamna in the fossil record due to the high degree of variability in adult tooth morphology within species.|$|E

Apollo astronauts performed part of their training at Craters of the Moon Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in an unfamiliar and harsh environment.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a new registry, the Foundation Foxtrotter Heritage Association (FFHA), {{was formed}} {{with a goal}} of {{preserving}} and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that {{was seen in the}} first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry, in large part through reducing the amount of Tennessee Walking Horse blood. The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, is attempting to develop horses that more <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker {{blacks and whites}} of their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds of both sexes <b>closely</b> <b>resemble</b> and are {{difficult}} to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded.
