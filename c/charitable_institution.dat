5|$|In June 2003 Wikipedia was {{transferred}} to a nascent non-profit organization, the Wikimedia Foundation, which was formed as a <b>charitable</b> <b>institution</b> to supervise Wikipedia and its associated wiki-based sites. When the foundation was established, its staff began to solicit public funding and Bomis turned Wikipedia over to the non-profit. All Bomis-owned hardware used to run Wikipedia-associated websites was donated to the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wales transferred Wikipedia-related copyrights from Bomis to the foundation. It was first headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida, where Bomis was located. The foundation shifted Wikipedia's dependence away from Bomis, allowing it to purchase hardware for expansion.|$|E

5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where the {{northern}} city gate and defensive wall were located. Today occupied by the Swedish Parliament, this islet was named after the <b>charitable</b> <b>institution,</b> Helige andens holme ("Islet of the Holy Spirit"), located there from around 1300 and discernible in the painting as a building with stepped gables facing an open space perhaps indicating {{the location of the}} demolished Johannite monastery. King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E

25|$|The Hong Kong AIDS Foundation is a {{registered}} <b>charitable</b> <b>institution</b> which depends on funding and donations. According to the annual reports of year 2002–2005, the Foundation received funding mainly from the AIDS Trust Fund, donations and income from the seed fund. The greatest contribution in terms of monetary value comes from the seed fund, in which the capital donation came from the Hong Kong SAR Government and The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The Foundation has a continued annual trend of current expenses exceeding current income and therefore relies on the income brought by the seed fund as well as investments which contributes to surpluses {{at the end of}} March throughout the years. The top three donors were AIDS Trust Fund (愛滋病信託基金委員會), Maryknoll China Service and Levi Strauss & Co.in the year 2004–2005. Also, the Foundation is exempted from Hong Kong profits tax as it is {{a registered}} <b>charitable</b> <b>institution.</b> The fund is mainly spent on various projects and activities, library development, education and publicity programs and other administrative costs like salaries for full-time staff. The percentage of expenses spent on staff and allowances has remained high throughout the years – 69% of the total amount of expenditure was allocated under the category of staff and allowances in the year 2005. It is Mr Stephen W.T. Liu, JP who guides and gives advises to the Finance Committee.|$|E
25|$|A second public <b>charitable</b> <b>institution</b> {{was opened}} in 1713, the Bethel in Norwich. It {{was a small}} {{facility}} which generally housed between twenty and thirty inmates. In 1728 at Guy's Hospital, London, wards were established for chronic lunatics. From the mid-eighteenth century the number of public charitably funded asylums expanded moderately {{with the opening of}} St Luke's Hospital in 1751 in Upper Moorfields, London; the establishment in 1765 of the Hospital for Lunatics at Newcastle upon Tyne; the Manchester Lunatic Hospital, which opened in 1766; the York Asylum in 1777 (not {{to be confused with the}} York Retreat); the Leicester Lunatic Asylum (1794), and the Liverpool Lunatic Asylum (1797).|$|E

Rebuilt after a fire in 1410, it was moved to Riddarholmen by King Gustav Vasa (1496–1560) in 1531. Though the appearance of Helgeandshuset is not known, it is believed to have resembled similar institutions elsewhere and thus consist of a hospital ward and a church surrounded by other buildings and a graveyard.|$|E

25|$|The tall {{house at}} the bend in the road, {{recently}} occupied by the De La Salle Brothers, seems to be identical to a house named Waxfield where the death is recorded in 1766 of Mr. John Lamprey. In 1836 it was known as Hazelbrook, a name which was later transferred to the nearby, now defunct, Hughes Brothers milk bottling plant. The Hughes Brothers original house, built 1898, and called Hazelbrook House, was rebuilt in the Bunratty Folk Park in 2001. From 1844 to 1899 it was known as Bachelor's Hall, after which it became the headquarters of a <b>Charitable</b> <b>Institution</b> {{under the name of}} Berwick Home. In 1944 it again became a private residence and the name was changed to Berwick House.|$|E

The Kasanka Trust has a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife (previously ZAWA - Zambian Wildlife Authority) and under this agreement is responsible for infrastructure and habitat management, community outreach and tourism. It became the first national park park to be managed by a private body. DNPW retains the responsibilities for anti-poaching work {{in the park and}} surrounding Game Management Area in conjunction with the Trust. The Kasanka Trust aims to cover its costs through tourism-generated revenue, however it is still reliant on external funding from grants and donations for part of its budget.|$|E

25|$|In Fall 2008, Northwestern {{opened a}} campus in Education City, Doha, Qatar, joining five other American universities: Carnegie Mellon University, Cornell University, Georgetown University, Texas A University, and Virginia Commonwealth University. Through the Medill School of Journalism and School of Communication, NU-Q offers bachelor's degrees in journalism and {{communication}} respectively. However, some have questioned whether NU-Q can truly offer a comparable journalism program {{to that of}} its U.S. campus given Qatar’s strict limits on journalistic and academic freedoms and instances of censorship. The Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development, a private <b>charitable</b> <b>institution</b> started by former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani {{and his wife and}} mother of the current emir Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, provided funding for construction and administrative costs as well as support to hire 50 to 60 faculty and staff, some of whom rotate between the Evanston and Qatar campuses. Northwestern receives about $45 million per year to operate the campus. In February 2016, Northwestern reached an agreement with the Qatar Foundation to extend the operations of the NU-Q branch for an additional decade, through the 2027-2028 academic year. As with other universities with campuses in Doha, Northwestern has received criticism for accepting money from a country that supports terrorism and has a poor human rights record.|$|E
25|$|In 1953 {{the house}} and {{surrounding}} grounds with an exceptional river frontage on the Thames were purchased by the British province of the Polish Congregation of Marian Fathers, in answer to the demand from the post World War II newly settled Polish community, for use as an independent educational establishment known as, Divine Mercy College and as a religious house. The enterprise was in straitened financial circumstances from the start and, as a <b>charitable</b> <b>institution,</b> relied heavily on public support to build the residential accommodation for the pupils and to keep it running. It was intended for boys of Polish descent but accepted local {{children as well as}} those from overseas, e.g. from Ghana. At its peak the school catered for 150 boys of 9 to 19 years of age and offered a rounded education including university entrance exams. An alumnus of the time is Waldemar Januszczak, the prominent British art critic (born 1954). The house was severely damaged by fire in 1973, but was rebuilt with the help of donations from the Polish community in Britain and abroad. The school finally closed in 1986 due to falling rolls of students of Polish origin, and the Marian Fathers converted Fawley Court into a 'Retreat and Conference Centre'.|$|E
