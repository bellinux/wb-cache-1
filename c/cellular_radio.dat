2500|$|In 1947 Bell Labs was {{the first}} to propose a <b>cellular</b> <b>radio</b> {{telephone}} network. The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they move through a network and passes their calls from one site to another without dropping the connection. In 1956 the MTA system was launched in Sweden. The early efforts to develop mobile telephony faced two significant challenges: allowing a great number of callers to use the comparatively few available frequencies simultaneously and allowing users to seamlessly move from one area to another without having their calls dropped. [...] Both problems were solved by Bell Labs employee Amos Joel who, in 1970 applied for a patent for a mobile communications system. [...] However, a business consulting firm calculated the entire U.S. market for mobile telephones at 100,000 units and the entire worldwide market at no more than 200,000 units based on the ready availability of pay telephones and the high cost of constructing cell towers. [...] As a consequence, Bell Labs concluded that the invention was [...] "of little or no consequence," [...] leading it not to attempt to commercialize the invention. [...] The invention earned Joel induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2008. [...] The first call on a handheld mobile phone was made on April 3, 1973 by Martin Cooper, then of Motorola to his opposite number in Bell Labs who were also racing to be first. [...] Bell Labs went on to install the first trial cellular network in Chicago in 1978. This trial system was licensed by the FCC to ATT for commercial use in 1982 and, as part of the divestiture arrangements for the breakup of ATT, the AMPS technology was distributed to local telcos. [...] The first commercial system opened in Chicago in October 1983. [...] A system designed by Motorola also operated in the Washington D.C./Baltimore area from summer 1982 and became a full public service later the following year. [...] Japan's first commercial radiotelephony service was launched by NTT in 1978.|$|E
