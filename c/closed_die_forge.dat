40|$|Demand for {{lighter and}} stiffer {{products}} {{has been increasing}} {{in the last few}} years especially in automobile manufacturing. The <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process of Metal Matrix Material (MMC) is presented as possible solution, since it produces parts with good mechanical properties and lighter weight. A computational modeling of <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process using finite element method and optimization techniques makes the design optimization faster and more efficient, decreasing the use of conventional trial and error methods. In this study, the application of commercial finite element software (ANSYS) has been used to model cold <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process. The model has been developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL) to simulate a single stage axi-symmetry <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process for H cross sectional shape. The material used is AlMgSi matrix with 15 % SiC particles. Its flow curve and fractural strain are obtained from the literature. ANSYS Optimizer is used to obtain the maximum height in which the material can flow in the rib by changing Design Variables (DV) and State Variables (SV). Normally design variables are geometrical parameters such as, rib height to width ratio, web height to rib height ratio, fillet radii, draft angle and billet radius. State Variables (SV) are some parameters that depend on the design variables such as, the equivalent strain which must be below the fracture strain of the MMC material, and an acceptable contact gap (within the allowable tolerances range). Optimization method called Sub-Problem Approximation Method was used to find out the optimal design set. The technique used in this study can be used for newly developed materials to investigate its forgeability for much complicated shapes in <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the various aspects of <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> cold <b>forging</b> of polygonal powder preforms, which have been compacted and sintered from atomized powder. It is found that for certain dimensional ratios of the preform the die pressure is minimum. An attempt has been made for the determination of the die pressures developed for given geometries of the disc during the <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> of polygonal powder preform by using an upper bound approach. Uniform frictional stresses are assumed on top and bottom interfaces and along the interfaces on sides. The feasibility of metal powder preform has been demonstrated by applying an appropriate interfacial friction law and yield criteria.

40|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> is a {{very complex}} process, and {{measurement}} of actual forces for real material is difficult and time consuming. Hence, the modelling technique has taken the advantage of carrying out the experimentation with the proper model material which needs lesser forces and relatively low temperature. The results of experiments on the model material then may be correlated with the actual material by using the theory of similarity. There are several methods available to resolve the complexity involved in the <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> process. Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM) are relatively difficult as compared to the slab method. The slab method is very popular and very widely used by the people working on shop floor because it is relatively easy to apply and reasonably accurate for most of the common forging load requirement computations...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} the thesis concerns phase transformations and fatigue properties in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The need to weld the alloy for certain engine components can expose the alloy locally to non-optimum thermal cycles and it is therefore of importance to {{gain an understanding of}} the kinetics involved in the phase transformations during heating and cooling. Moreover, for the purpose of modelling and computer simulations of heat treatments and welding processes, quantitative descriptions of the transformation are necessary. One focus in this work has been to examine the feasibility of using high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) to study the phase transformation kinetics. In addition, two components of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V produced by ring-rolling and <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging,</b> respectively, showed unexpected differences in low cycle fatigue (LCF) under certain loading conditions. Quantitative metallographic studies and texture examinations were conducted in order to find possibly reasons for the observed difference in fatigue properties. The HT-XRD technique was successfully used to monitor the alpha-to-beta transition during heating and the beta-to-alpha transition during cooling and including the transformation kinetics during isothermal hold. From the recorded spectra the thermal expansion properties for the alpha and beta phases could be extracted up to a temperature of 1050 °C, enabling the determination of the overall thermal expansion for the alloy by using rule of mixture (ROM) calculations. Quantitative metallographic studies revealed that the <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forged</b> material exhibited a finer primary alpha grain size and a finer Widmanstätten platelet colony size which would be expected to provide a superior resistance to fatigue crack initiation. Observed differences in the texture of the two materials as determined by electron back-scattered diffraction might also have contributed to the difference in fatigue properties.

50|$|The {{most common}} thought of forging {{equipment}} is the hammer and anvil. The principles behind the hammer and anvil are still used today in drop-hammer equipment. The principle behind {{the machine is}} very simple, raise the hammer and then drop it or propel it into the workpiece, which rests on the anvil. The main variations between drop-hammers is {{in the way that}} the hammer is powered; the most common being air and steam hammers. Drop-hammers usually operate in the vertical position. The main reason for this is because excess energy (energy that isn't used to deform the workpiece) that isn't released as heat or sound needs to be transmitted to the foundation. Moreover, a large machine base is needed to absorb the impacts.To overcome some of the shortcomings of the drop-hammer the counterblow machine or impactor is used. In a counterblow machine both the hammer and anvil move and the workpiece is held between them. Here excess energy becomes recoil. This allows for the machine to work horizontally and consist of a smaller base. Other advantages include less noise, heat and vibrations. It also produces a distinctly different flow pattern. Both of these machines can be used for open <b>die</b> or <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging.</b> A forging press, often just called a press, is used for press forging.|$|R

These two coupons were taken from two differently processed wrought products viz. rolled ring and <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging.</b> The coupons were then subjected to solution treatment followed by employing different cooling rates to vary the quench severity and different aging treatments by changing the aging temperature and time.

It is noted that there is a significant increase in strength of the alloy retaining the ductility when it is aged in the aging temperature regime of 550 - 650 A degrees C and time of 8 h. Role of higher oxygen content is noted, which is more pronounced with higher severity of quench (by water quenching). Specimens representative of different heat treatment conditions were characterized using optical microscope, electron back-scattered diffraction, and electron microscope. The presence of martensitic (alpha') structure along with uniform distribution of fine primary alpha, secondary alpha precipitates and refined beta-grains, twins in the microstructure helps in improving the strength of the material. Also, during high temperature aging of 700 A degrees C, which incidentally falls in the range of annealing temperature of the alloy, overaging occurs which is similar to effect of annealing and hence retains the ductility as well...|$|R
40|$|<b>Closed</b> <b>die</b> hot <b>forging</b> {{process is}} one of the most adopted methods for forming complex shaped parts with {{satisfactory}} geometrical accuracy. Over sixty percent of the forgings are processed through this route. Forged parts, though required in many engineering sectors, play a vital role in the automotive sector. The majority of the crucial load bearing structural components as well as safety critical items are processed via the forging route. This is mainly due to the inherent strength to weight ratio and dimensional accuracy that can be combined into the components. Faster production of complex shapes with least wastage of material are some of the other benefits. The metal flow analysis of the process is complex due to the involvement of a large number of parameters. A number of experimental testings and production-trials are being done in the industry in order to develop a robust manufacturing process. Such practices however involve huge investments in tooling and raw materials, including a great deal of development time and effort.

40|$|Powder forging is a {{technique}} {{that has been used}} to produce fully dense near-net parts from metal powders. Due to a “low cost titanium” product manufacturing initiative, targeting a reduction in the cost of titanium components, a titanium powder forging technique has gained significant interest. In titanium powder forging, powder consolidation is a key factor that influences successful component manufacture. Consolidation during titanium powder forging is dependent on the densification and deformation mechanisms involved. In this study, a finite element method is used to model the densification and deformation behaviour of titanium powder compacts during powder forging. The research focuses on developing a simulation capability and identifying a suitable constitutive model to simulate the powder forging process that can predict the relative density distribution. The simulation is carried out in Abaqus software and the results are compared with experimental results. A gamma particle radiography technique is used to compare the experimental density results with the simulated results. The Gurson and Gurson-Tvergaard models are used to predict the relative density of porous titanium powder compacts during upset-powder forging and are used to include the effect of hydrostatic stresses and the extent of densification.

This study attempts to relate some of the important parameters involved when considering, simple upsetting, <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging</b> and extrusion forging. A literature survey showed some of the empirical graphical and statistical methods of load prediction together with analytical methods of estimating load and energy. Investigations of the effects of high strain rate and temperature on the stress-strain properties of materials are also evident. In the present study special equipment including an experimental drop hammer and various die-sets have been designed and manufactured. Instrumentation to measure load/time and displacement/time behaviour, of the deformed metal, has been incorporated and calibrated. A high speed camera was used to record the behaviour mode of test pieces used in the simple upsetting tests. Dynamic and quasi-static material properties for the test materials, lead and aluminium alloy, were measured using the drop hammer and a compression-test machine. Analytically two separate mathematical solutions have been developed: A numerical technique using a lumped-mass model for the analysis of simple upsetting and closed-die forging and, for extrusion forging, an analysis which equates the shear and compression energy requirements to the work done by the forging load. Cylindrical test pieces were used for all the experiments and both dry and lubricated test conditions were investigated. The static and dynamic tests provide data on Load, Energy and the Profile of the deformed billet. In addition for the Extrusion Forging, both single ended and double ended tests were conducted. Material dependency was also examined by a further series of tests on aluminium and copper. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical results was made which shows clearly the effects of friction and high strain rate on load and energy requirements and the deformation mode of the billet.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} and numerical {{study of the}} weaknesses and capabilities of alternative finite element procedures for simulation of the blade forging problem and also {{an analysis of the}} practical aspects of that process. An overview is presented of the finite element method for non-linear problems with elastoplastic constitutive relations, focusing on quasistatic implicit and dynamic explicit approaches. It is shown that in bulk metal forming problems the application of the dynamic explicit method using increased velocity or mass scaling, can compete well with the quasistatic implicit method. Numerical comparisons show that the dynamic explicit method is more stable, has enough accuracy, consumes less CPU- time, and is more simple to use than the implicit one. In a second part of the study, the efficiency of the solid and flow approaches is investigated and a new approach is proposed. Deformations, strains, stresses and load curves are compared for both loading and unloading simulations. It is demonstrated that the flow approach shows a good convergence but that it can not predict the volume change which is very important in <b>closed</b> <b>die</b> <b>forging.</b> On the other hand, the solid approach shows convergence problems. A new approach, a combined flow-solid approach, is proposed. It is explained how the solution can automatically switch from the flow to the solid approach and how both can work in the same solution environment. The flow-solid approach is examined numerically and compared with the two previous approaches in the loading and unloading simulations. In comparison with the solid approach, most of the convergence difficulties are removed in the new approach while the same accurate results are obtained with less computational time. In comparison with the flow approach, the new approach is was much more accurate for a little more computational time. Comparing all tested methods, it is concluded that the dynamic explicit procedure and the flow-solid approach are the two best ones when accuracy, efficiency and simplicity are considered. From strains and stresses internal and surface properties can be obtained. The press load and the optimal initial location of the billet are among the results which have practical importance for the process. Forming of the blade without any defects and the possibility to include the process in one stage from a circular stock are also very important aspects of the process. By means of the numerical simulations these aspects could be realized...|$|R
