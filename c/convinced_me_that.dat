25|$|I {{was shocked}} at college to see one hundred of my classmates in the library all reading copies of the same book. Instead of doing as they did, I went into the stacks and read the first book written by an author whose name began with Z. I {{received}} {{the highest grade in}} the class. That <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the institution was not being run correctly. I left.|$|E
25|$|The other {{exception}} {{has to do}} with {{a rather}} peculiar case of psychic phenomena, one which I find myself unable to classify.... I was brought in contact with it, in the summer of 1911, and I have had it under my observation more or less ever since, having been present at probably 250 of the night sessions, many of which have been attended by a stenographer who made voluminous notes. A thorough study of this case has <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is not one of ordinary trance.... This man is utterly unconscious, wholly oblivious to what takes place, and, unless told about it subsequently, never knows that he has been used as a sort of clearing house for the coming and going of alleged extra-planetary personalities.... Psychoanalysis, hypnotism, intensive comparison, fail to show that the written or spoken messages of this individual have origin in his own mind. Much of the material secured through this subject is quite contrary to his habits of thought, to the way in which he has been taught, and to his entire philosophy. In fact, of much that we have secured, we have failed to find anything of its nature in existence.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I had overcome all traces of my depression.

500|$|A {{textbook}} for {{an advanced}} undergraduate course. [...] "Experience has <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it is pedagogically unsound (though logically correct) {{to start off}} with the construction of the real numbers from the rational ones. At the beginning, most students simply fail to appreciate the need for doing this. Accordingly, the real number system is introduced as an ordered field with the least-upper-bound property, and a few interesting applications of this property are quickly made. However, Dedekind's construction is not omitted. It is now in an Appendix to Chapter 1, where it may be studied and enjoyed whenever the time is ripe." [...] (p. ix) ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's Richie Unterberger {{awarded the}} album three stars out of five, {{describing}} Nico's songwriting as [...] "singularly morose". Dorian Lynskey wrote for The Guardian that The Marble Index forces {{the distinction between}} art and entertainment, comparing it to the [...] "terrifying" [...] output of musician Scott Walker (particularly the album Tilt), painter Mark Rothko and writer Philip Roth. Simon Reynolds described the record as [...] "psychic landscapes, glittering in their immaculate, lifeless majesty of someone {{cut off from the}} thawing warmth of human contact and fellowship" [...] and [...] "religious music for nihilists". Sputnikmusic's Louis Arp was less enthusiastic, finding the music [...] "pretentious" [...] and [...] "agitating" [...] in the aura it evoked while deeming Nico's lyrics repetitive and meaningless. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said, [...] "While The Velvet Underground and Nico plus Chelsea Girl <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Nico had charisma; The Marble Index plus Desertshore convince me that she's a fool." ...|$|E
500|$|Lee was a {{character}} actor and acting instructor {{with a range}} of roles in the theater and who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy era. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lee played Mr. Hooper, known for his bowtie and hornrimmed glasses, [...] "with such certainty and naturalness he made adults suspend their sense of disbelief". [...] Writer Louise A. Gikow stated that Lee was [...] "perfectly cast" [...] as Mr. Hooper. [...] According to fellow cast member Bob McGrath, who also appeared in Sesame Streets first episode with Lee, [...] "Will had a broader dimension to his character than perhaps the rest of us did... He <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> no matter how simple the scene was with a child, you had to bring a tremendous integrity and an honesty and credibility to it". [...] Joan Ganz Cooney, Sesame Street co-creator and president of the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), said, [...] "He gave millions of children the message that the old and the young have a lot to say to each other". [...] The New York Times reported that Mr. Hooper ranked first of all human characters of the show in recognition by young viewers.|$|E

2500|$|Key {{publicly}} criticized slavery's cruelties, so {{much that}} after his death a newspaper editorial stated [...] "So actively hostile was he to the peculiar institution that he was called 'The Nigger Lawyer' .... because he often volunteered to defend the downtrodden {{sons and daughters of}} Africa. Mr.Key <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> slavery was wrongradically wrong."

2500|$|Around 1981, Kramer began {{researching and}} writing a {{manuscript}} called The American People: A History, an ambitious historical work that {{begins in the}} Stone Age and continues into the present. For example, there is information relating to Kramer's assertion that Abraham Lincoln was gay. In 2002, Will Schwalbe, editor-in-chief of Hyperion Books– the only man to have read the entire manuscript to that date– said, [...] "He has set himself the hugest of tasks," [...] and he described it as [...] "staggering, brilliant, funny, and harrowing." [...] In 2006, Kramer said of the work, [...] " [...] my own history of America and of the cause of HIV/AIDS... Writing and researching this history has <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the plague of HIV/AIDS has been intentionally allowed to happen." ...|$|E

In response, Eric Erlandson stated in Spin magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement, citing that he and Love [...] "have a contract". In a later interview, Erlandson explained how [...] " [...] management <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> it was all hot air and that she {{would never be able to}} finish her album.

2500|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of letters from Masqueraders have <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the human mind has an equal capacity for pattern-matching and self-deception. While some addicts were busy cooking the riddle, others were more single-mindedly continuing their own pursuit of the hare quite regardless of the news {{that it had been}} found. Their own theories had come to seem so convincing that no exterior evidence could refute them. These most determined of Masqueraders may grudgingly have accepted that a hare of some sort was dug up at Ampthill, but they believed there would be another hare, or a better solution, awaiting them at their favourite spot. [...] Kit would expect them to continue undismayed by the much publicised diversion at Ampthill and would be looking forward to the day when he would greet them as the real discoverers of the real puzzle of Masquerade. Optimistic expeditions were still setting out, with shovels and maps, throughout the summer of 1982.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{spin-off}}, Bianca {{had fallen}} upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky {{embroiled in a}} drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fiancée Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why {{she did not want}} to return to EastEnders: [...] "I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now – the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish." [...] In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show [...] "rubbish".|$|E
