5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and <b>cyanides,</b> contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the <b>cyanides.</b> These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cyanides</b> are {{produced}} by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found {{in a number of}} plants. <b>Cyanides</b> are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches. In plants, <b>cyanides</b> are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.|$|E
30|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{is often}} found joined with other {{chemicals}} to form compounds. Examples of simple <b>cyanide</b> compounds are hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> sodium <b>cyanide</b> and potassium <b>cyanide</b> and hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> {{is the main}} form present in the air. <b>Cyanide</b> can be released into the environment {{during the course of}} industrial usage, from smoke or vehicles exhaust containing the incomplete combustion products of nitrogen-containing organic polymers. Also, several plants contain cyanogen glycosides that can release hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> upon biodegradation or digestion [6].|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{comes in}} many forms {{including}} hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> (HCN), cyanogen chloride (CNCl), and salts such as sodium <b>cyanide</b> (NaCN) or potassium <b>cyanide</b> (KCN). In manufacturing, <b>cyanide</b> is used to make paper, textiles, and plastics. <b>Cyanide</b> salts are used in metallurgy for electroplating, metal cleaning, and removing gold from its ore. <b>Cyanide</b> gas is used to exterminate pests and vermin in ships and buildings. [...] <b>Cyanide</b> is a basic building block for the chemical industry. About 80% of global <b>cyanide</b> production is used to synthesize {{a wide range of}} industrial organic chemicals such as nylon and acrylics.|$|R
50|$|Calcium <b>cyanide</b> hydrolyzes {{readily to}} form {{hydrogen}} <b>cyanide</b> gas. The presence of acid accelerated evolution of hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> gas.

40|$|Background: Although <b>cyanide</b> {{poisoning}} can {{be serious}} or fatal, it is typically described as mild when the <b>cyanide</b> is ingested {{in the form}} of either mercuric <b>cyanide</b> or mercury oxycyanide. Methods: We studied two patients with acute <b>cyanide</b> poisoning following ingestion of one of these two agents in each case. Results: Both patients demonstrated features of life-threatening <b>cyanide</b> poisoning, including hemodynamic instability, severe lactic acidosis, and high blood <b>cyanide</b> concentration. One of the patients died, while the second demonstrated signs of mercury intoxication (acute renal failure and severe gastrointestinal symptoms), in addition to <b>cyanide</b> intoxication. Conclusion: Ingestion of either mercuric <b>cyanide</b> or mercury oxycyanide can result in life-threatening <b>cyanide</b> intoxication...|$|R
25|$|The most {{hazardous}} compound is hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> {{which is}} a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen <b>cyanide.</b> Hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a <b>cyanide</b> salt. Alkaline solutions of <b>cyanide</b> are safer to use {{because they do not}} evolve hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> gas. Hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> may be produced in the combustion of polyurethanes; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid <b>cyanide</b> or a <b>cyanide</b> solution as little as 200mg, or exposure to airborne <b>cyanide</b> of 270 ppm, is sufficient to cause death within minutes.|$|R

25|$|Prussian blue {{was first}} accidentally made around 1706, by heating {{substances}} containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other <b>cyanides</b> made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to blueprints, bluing, and cyanotypes.|$|E
40|$|At {{gold and}} silver mineral {{processing}} plants, <b>cyanide</b> species are always present in the process water recycled to flotation circuits, despite the <b>cyanide</b> destruction process. The effect of <b>cyanide,</b> in particular, cuprous <b>cyanide</b> on {{gold and silver}} flotation has not been well understood. In the present study, free <b>cyanide</b> and cuprous <b>cyanide</b> species were isolated and their effects on the flotation of a pyritic ore were evaluated. It was found that free <b>cyanide</b> depressed gold and silver flotation through their carrier, pyrite. Cuprous <b>cyanide</b> mainly {{in the form of}} Cu(CN) depressed pyrite flotation similarly as free <b>cyanide.</b> Electrochemical studies including open circuit potential (OCP), cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were carried out to understand the underpinning depression mechanism of <b>cyanide</b> species on pyrite flotation using xanthate as collector. It was found that all surface electrochemical reactions were inhibited by either free <b>cyanide</b> or cuprous <b>cyanide.</b> The surface layer as a result of xanthate adsorption on pyrite was completely removed in the presence of these <b>cyanide</b> species, which was suggested to contribute to the hydrophilic pyrite surface...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cyanide,</b> a {{substance}} of sanitary concern, is only due {{to use and}} discharge of the industrial sector. <b>Cyanide</b> has severe effects both in human health and ecosystems. The severity of the harmful effects following <b>cyanide</b> exposure depends {{in part on the}} form of <b>cyanide,</b> such as hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> gas or <b>cyanide</b> salts. It becomes more dangerous when exposure concentrations are high. <b>Cyanide</b> has been a major component of metal-plating solutions and is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver mining.|$|R

25|$|Being {{a strong}} {{oxidizing}} agent, nitric acid can react with compounds such as <b>cyanides,</b> carbides, or metallic powders explosively and with many organic compounds, such as turpentine, violently and hypergolically (i.e. self-igniting). Hence, {{it should be}} stored away from bases and organics.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009 the German NGO Sign of Hope {{reported}} that {{in the village of}} Rier, close to the Thar Jath Central Processing Facility, there were critical levels of salts and contaminants such as <b>cyanides,</b> lead, nickel, cadmium and arsenic.

25|$|Hydrogen cyanide is weakly acidic with a pKa of 9.2. It {{partially}} ionizes {{in water}} solution {{to give the}} cyanide anion, CN−. A solution of hydrogen cyanide in water, represented as HCN, is called hydrocyanic acid. The salts of the cyanide anion are known as <b>cyanides.</b>|$|E
40|$|B-trichloro-N-trimethylborazine {{in a dry}} {{tetrahydrofurane}} {{solution was}} reacted with potassium <b>cyanide,,</b> and sodium <b>cyanide.</b> On analysis of this reaction mixture, the precipitate was shown to contain both potassium chloride, and potassium <b>cyanide</b> when reacted with- the potassium <b>cyanide,</b> and sodium chloride and sodium chloride when reacted with sodium <b>cyanide.</b> On repeated runs of these reactions, it was shown that the precentages of the chloride to <b>cyanide</b> was approximately the same...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{was rapidly}} removed when added to culture supernatants of seven {{different}} Pseudomonas. The ability to remove <b>cyanide</b> {{was correlated with}} the accumulation of α-keto acids (pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate). These compounds react with <b>cyanide</b> forming less toxic cyanohydrins, thus conferring a mechanism for bacterial <b>cyanide</b> tolerance. When added to growth media the α-keto acids were shown also to serve as effective <b>cyanide</b> antagonists. While all bacteria tested accumulated α-keto acids, only those capable of utilizing <b>cyanide</b> as a nutritional nitrogen source were able to metabolize cyanohydrins. In P. fluorescens NCIMB 11764, the same enzyme (<b>cyanide</b> oxygenase) shown previously {{to be involved in}} <b>cyanide</b> metabolism appears responsible for cyanohydrin transformation. Keto acid excretion is believed to represent a new mechanism of bacterial <b>cyanide</b> detoxification with further enzymatic metabolism of the cyanohydrins helping to explain how <b>cyanide</b> can satisfy the nitrogen requirement in cyanide-utilizing bacteria...|$|R
30|$|<b>Cyanide</b> {{is used in}} many {{industrial}} applications such as electroplating, precious metal refining, gold mining, metal ore processing, and smelting, chemical and petrochemical applications. <b>Cyanide</b> compounds used in industry include hydrogen <b>cyanide,</b> cyanogen chloride, <b>cyanide</b> salts containing potassium or sodium, gold and silver <b>cyanide.</b> The mining of gold depends on cyanidation (MacArthur et al. 1988). <b>Cyanide</b> leaching, {{which is one of}} the gold extraction technologies, has replaced the mercury amalgamation. It involves spraying sodium <b>cyanide</b> solution, of a concentration of 200 – 600  ppm, on piles of ground ore. Gold reacts with <b>cyanide</b> to form a water-soluble compound. Gold then can be extracted by passing the solution over an activated carbon. The remaining <b>cyanide</b> solution is stored in covered ponds (Schnepp 2006).|$|R
25|$|Phosphoric acid is not combustible, nor flammable, {{and will}} not burn in itself. Flammability of the {{chemical}} exists only from incompatible reactions with other compounds/materials. Decomposition of H3PO4 to toxic fumes readily occurs upon mixing with: alcohols, aldehydes, <b>cyanides,</b> ketones, phenols, esters, sulfides, and halogenated organics.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a nitrile is CH3CN, acetonitrile, also known as methyl cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A {{functional}} group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called cyanohydrin. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release hydrogen cyanide. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N− ion {{are referred to as}} <b>cyanides.</b>|$|E
25|$|The large {{demand for}} <b>cyanides</b> for mining {{operations}} in the 1890s was met by George Thomas Beilby, who patented a method to produce hydrogen cyanide by passing ammonia over glowing coal in 1892. This method was used until Hamilton Castner in 1894 developed a synthesis starting from coal, ammonia, and sodium yielding sodium cyanide, which reacts with acid to form gaseous HCN.|$|E
50|$|The International <b>Cyanide</b> Management Code For The Manufacture, Transport and Use of <b>Cyanide</b> In The Production of Gold, {{commonly}} referred to as the <b>Cyanide</b> Code is a voluntary program designed to assist the global gold mining industry and the producers and transporters of <b>cyanide</b> used in gold mining in improving <b>cyanide</b> management practices, and to publicly demonstrate their compliance with the <b>Cyanide</b> Code through an independent and transparent process.

25|$|Many <b>cyanides</b> {{are highly}} toxic. The cyanide anion is an {{inhibitor}} of the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (also known as aa3) {{in the fourth}} complex of the electron transport chain (found in the membrane of the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce ATP for energy. Tissues that depend highly on aerobic respiration, such as {{the central nervous system}} and the heart, are particularly affected. This is an example of histotoxic hypoxia.|$|E
25|$|Proteus is {{the second}} largest moon of Neptune. It is about 420 {{kilometres}} in diameter, larger than Nereid, the second to be discovered. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes {{because it is so}} close to Neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight. The surface of Proteus is dark—its geometrical albedo is about 10%. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared around 2μm Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or <b>cyanides.</b> These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface.|$|E
