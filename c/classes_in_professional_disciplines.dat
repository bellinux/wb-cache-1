40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} ways in which university students are introduced to disciplines and thence to the professions based on those disciplines. Design/methodology/approach – E-mail interviews with a broad sample of university teachers in a variety of professional disciplines formed the basis of a grounded theory approach to identification of analytically distinct themes. Findings – Four different approaches were identified from the interview data, labelled as academic, apprenticeship, affective, and experiential. While these themes represent distinct approaches to introductory classes in professional fields, and have been described independently in the paper, in practice most teachers would use combinations of them. Research limitations/implications – The research represents a first stage in investigating approaches to introducing students to a discipline and profession. No claim is made to randomness, completeness or representativeness of the sample, which indeed was heavily based on colleagues in the broad area of pedagogy and teacher preparation. Practical implications – Teachers of introductory <b>classes</b> <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> can recognise their own approaches in the themes identified, and can consider a broader range of approaches based on the complete results. Workplace supervisors can consider diverse approaches utilised in academic settings. Social implications – Findings can contribute towards an awareness of the effect of introductory approaches to disciplines and professions in university classes, with potential implications for the way that university-trained professionals are accepted into the workplace. Originality/value – The research, unusually, shifts the focus from the end stage of professional education at university to the initial level. The investigation may form the basis of further research. 12 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Students majoring <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as business, education, {{and social}} work are notably {{underrepresented}} in most universities’ undergraduate research (UR) programs—both {{because of the lack}} of appropriate models of UR <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> schools and definitions of “research” that inadvertently leave out what scholars <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> do. However, BSU’s Office of Undergraduate Research and Departments of Communication Disorders 2 ̆ 6 Special Education, Elementary 2 ̆ 6 Early Childhood Education, Business Management, and Social Work have successfully employed several strategies for including faculty and students from <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> <b>in</b> the university’s whole range of UR opportunities, from ATP summer and semester grant-funded projects, to honors theses, community-based research, UR abroad, and research presentations at national conferences and BSU campus symposia.

40|$|In {{exploring}} phenomenological literature, it {{is evident}} that the term ‘phenomenology’ holds rather different meanings depending upon the context. Phenomenology has been described as both a philosophical movement and an approach to human science research. The phenom- enology of Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, and Merleau-Ponty was philo- sophical in nature and not intended to provide rules or procedures for conducting research. The Canadian social scientist, van Manen, however, introduced specific guidelines for conducting human science research, which is rooted in hermeneutic phenomenology and this particular method has been employed <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as education, nursing, clinical psychology, and law. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the difference between the phenomenological method as described by van Manen and that of other philosophers such as Husserl, Heidegger, Gadamer, and Merleau-Ponty. In so doing, the author aims to address the blurred boundaries of phenomenology as a research method and as a philosophical movement and highlight the influence of theseblurred boundaries on nursing knowledge development...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge is a {{defining}} characteristic of professions but, given the ever‐increasing knowledge base, curricula <b>in</b> <b>professional</b> <b>disciplines</b> are becoming overcrowded. This paper discusses propositional/declarative knowledge {{in relation to the}} accounting knowledge base. Historically, professional areas such as medicine, law and accountancy have expanded their curriculum to encompass new areas. However, core curricula have been introduced recently in medicine and law to provide space for the development of wider skills, to equip students for lifelong learning and to enable them to tailor their study in line with interests, aptitudes and career intentions. These core curricula are examined in order to assess the arguments for and against a core curriculum for accounting. The paper concludes that the introduction of core curricula in undergraduate accounting education could address the problem of the increasing knowledge base while providing breadth, opportunities for developing interpersonal skills and allowing students to tailor their degrees. In this way, the vocational and academic aspects of undergraduate accounting education could be balanced more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Threshold Concepts {{had been}} {{identified}} that related to learning to be a researcher. The tentative threshold concepts included the concepts of: knowledge creation, argument, theory, framework, analysis and research paradigm.

However, {{knowledge and understanding of}} the Threshold Concepts noted above does not necessarily address the issue of the research candidate who appears to be able to demonstrate some of these concepts but still has difficulty with completing a quality doctorate. In particular, considerable anecdotal evidence suggests that some mature-age candidates, who have substantial professional experience, seem to be challenged more than one might expect in appreciating as Trafford and Leshem (2009) describe “doctorateness”.
