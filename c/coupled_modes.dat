50|$|TOGA {{emphasized}} the tropical oceans {{and their relationship}} to the global atmosphere. Underlying TOGA is the premise that the dynamic adjustment of the ocean in the tropics is far more rapid than at higher latitudes. Thus disturbances emanating from the western Pacific Ocean (such as El Niño) may propagate across the basin on time scales of weeks compared to years for corresponding basin-wide propagation at higher latitudes. The significance of shorter dynamic times scales near the equator is that they {{are similar to those of}} highly energetic atmospheric modes. This similarity allows the formation of <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> between the ocean and the atmosphere. TOGA was instrumental in developing a comprehensive observing system for the equatorial Pacific Ocean and laid important groundwork for ENSO prediction, data assimilation and understanding of air-sea interaction.|$|E

Firstly, {{the dependence of}} 	Young's modulus on temperature was measured since {{it is a major}} concern 	in structure analysis. It is demonstrated that Young's modulus depends on 	temperature greatly and the dependence should be considered in vibration analysis, 	but the temperature gradient from the leading edge to the trailing edge of a blade 	can be ignored by applying the mean temperature. Secondly, turbine blades suffer 	many excitations during operation, such as pressure fluctuations (unsteady 	aerodynamic forces), torque fluctuations, and so forth. Meanwhile, they have many 	kinds of vibration modes, typical ones being blade-hub (disk) <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> and 	blade-shaft (torsional, longitudinal) <b>coupled</b> <b>modes.</b> Model experiments and FEM 	analysis were conducted to study the coupled vibrations and to identify the modes 	which {{are more likely to be}} excited.

In this paper, the priority and deadline assignment to triggered transactions under two <b>coupling</b> <b>modes,</b> the deferred and immediate, in a DRTADBS is discussed. Two new approaches, the data state dependent (DSD) and the transaction-data deadline (TDD) are proposed to assign criticality and deadlines to the triggered transactions, respectively.

Phonon and plasmon damping dramatically modifies the spectral {{features of the}} optical spectra and destabilizes the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> of the system. Phonon damping affects the optical properties in a qualitatively different way from plasmon damping. Increased phonon damping leads to a merging of the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> for a certain range of carrier density. Plasmon damping broadens the spectral linewidths of both of the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> when plasmon energies are {{of the order of}} LO-phonon energies. However, when plasmon energies are larger than LO-phonon energies, increasing plasmon damping makes the higher-energy mode completely degenerate with plasmon, and may even have lower energies than plasmon. In weakly damped situations, we also discuss the low-energy optical transmission region that forms in between the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes.</b> Finally, the effect of plasmon and LO-phonon coupling on the analyses of the experimental infrared reflection data of InN films (for different electron densities) is discussed. © 2004 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{coupling}} between {{negative and}} positive index medium waveguides is investigated theoretically in this paper. A <b>coupled</b> <b>mode</b> theory is developed for such a waveguide system and its validity is verified. Interesting phenomena in the coupled waveguides are demonstrated, which occur in the case when the negative index medium waveguide in isolation guides its mode backward. A new type of <b>coupled</b> <b>mode</b> solution that varies exponentially with the coupling length {{is found in the}} special case when the propagation constants of two individual waveguides are nearly the same. A coupler operating in this case is insensitive to the coupling length, and its coupling efficiency can reach 100 % as long as the coupling length is long enough.

40|$|The {{problem of}} quantum state {{exchange}} between <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> {{of the electromagnetic}} field mod-elled by quantum oscillators are considered. Analyzing the structure of propagators of the Schrödinger equation with the most general weak bilinear resonance coupling, we found some conditions of state exchange for arbitrary initial states {{for two and a}} particular case of three coupled oscillators. At this moment we are giving attention to the case of three coupled oscillators in a linear chain of oscillators by considering the most general time independent bilinear coupling between them. The problem of so-called “quantum teleportation”, or a transfer of the state of some quantum system to another quantum system has attracted attention of many authors. There exist various schemes [1 – 5], some of which have been realized already [6, 7]. The aim of our study is to consider the possibilities of the quantum state exchange between three or more <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> of the electromagnetic field modelled by coupled quantum oscillators as an extension for the case of two <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> considered in [8]. It is well known from classical mechanics that two weakly coupled identical oscillators periodically exchange their energies. It is true that the oscillators exchange not only energies, but also their quantum states and such an exchange can be interpreted also as an ideal information transfer [9]. Thus a simple question arise in how we can control this information exchange between more than two modes. In some special cases (e. g., for particular initial states, such as squeezed states or coherent states and their “cat ” superpositions, or for some specific couplings between the modes) this problem was studied recently in [9 – 12] but only for two modes- bipartite systems. Our goal is to consider the more general cases of multipartite system starting our study with the more simple case of three <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> as our “multipartite ” system.

40|$|It {{was known}} for a long time that shear and anti-plane {{fracture}} modes are coupled. It means that shear or anti-plane loading of an elastic plate with a through-the-thickness crack also generates a coupled three-dimensional anti-plane or shear singular stress state, respectively. These singular stress states (or coupled fracture modes) are currently largely ignored in theoretical and experimental investigations as well as in standards and failure assessment codes of structural components, in which it is implicitly assumed that the intensities of these modes as well as other three-dimensional effects are negligible in comparison with the stress field generated by the primary modes (modes I, II and III). In this paper we provide an overview of recent theoretical studies carried out by the authors, which demonstrate that the account for these <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> can totally change the classical (two-dimensional) view on many fracture phenomena. In particular, this relates to a generation of the <b>coupled</b> <b>modes</b> by non-singular (in two-dimensional sense) shear and anti-plane stress fields.
