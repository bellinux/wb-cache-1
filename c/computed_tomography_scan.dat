2500|$|Some {{causes of}} bowel {{obstruction}} may resolve spontaneously; many require operative treatment. In adults, frequently the surgical intervention {{and the treatment}} of the causative lesion are required. In malignant large bowel obstruction, endoscopically placed self-expanding metal stents may be used to temporarily relieve the obstruction as a bridge to surgery, or as palliation. [...] Diagnosis of the type of bowel obstruction is normally conducted through initial plain radiograph of the abdomen, luminal contrast studies, <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan,</b> or ultrasonography prior to determining the best type of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is {{typically}} made based on patient history. The physical examination should be normal. The primary diagnosis for JME {{is a good}} knowledge of patient history [...] and the neurologist's familiarity with the myoclonic jerks, which are {{the hallmark of the}} syndrome. Additionally, an electroencephalogram (EEG), will indicate a pattern of waves and spikes associated with the syndrome. The EEG generally shows a very characteristic pattern with generalized 4–6Hz polyspike and slow wave discharges. [...] These discharges are often provoked by photic stimulation (blinking lights) and sometimes hyperventilation. Both a magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) and <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scan</b> (CT scan) should appear normal in JME patients.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 32 {{patients}} with posterior fossa epidural hematoma treated after {{the introduction of}} <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scanning</b> between 1975 and March 1988 is presented. Sixteen patients harbored "pure" epidural hematomas, whereas 16 had other infratentorial or supratentorial traumatic lesions. Glasgow Coma Scale on admission was 7 or less in 10 patients, 8 - 12 in 11, and 13 - 14 in 11. Only six patients had a lucid interval. Thirty patients were treated surgically; two patients with small hematomas were treated conservatively. Overall mortality was 15. 6 %, with 0 % for "pure" and 31. 2 % for "complicated" posterior fossa epidural hematomas. The value of routine <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scanning</b> is emphasized in cases with occipital skull fracture or when such fracture is found in patients undergoing emergency evacuation of supratentorial hematomas.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Complex {{fractures}} of {{the distal}} {{part of the}} humerus {{can be difficult to}} characterize on plain radiographs and two-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scans.</b> We tested the hypothesis that three-dimensional reconstructions of <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scans</b> improve the reliability and accuracy of fracture characterization, classification, and treatment decisions. METHODS: Five independent observers evaluated thirty consecutive intra-articular fractures of the distal part of the humerus for the presence of five fracture characteristics: a fracture line in the coronal plane; articular comminution; metaphyseal comminution; the presence of separate, entirely articular fragments; and impaction of the articular surface. Fractures were also classified according to the AO/ASIF Comprehensive Classification of Fractures and the classification system of Mehne and Matta. Two rounds of evaluation were performed and then compared. Initially, a combination of plain radiographs and two-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scans</b> (2 D) were evaluated, and then, two weeks later, a combination of radiographs, two-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scans,</b> and three-dimensional reconstructions of <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> <b>scans</b> (3 D) were assessed. RESULTS: Three-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> improved both the intraobserver and the interobserver reliability of the AO classification system and the Mehne and Matta classification system. Three-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> reconstructions also improved the intraobserver agreement for all fracture characteristics, from moderate (average kappa [kappa 2 D] = 0. 554) to substantial agreement (kappa 3 D = 0. 793). The addition of three-dimensional images had limited influence on the interobserver reliability and diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy) for the recognition of specific fracture characteristics. Three-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> images improved intraobserver agreement (kappa 2 D = 0. 62 compared with kappa 3 D = 0. 75) but not interobserver agreement (kappa 2 D = 0. 24 compared with kappa 3 D = 0. 28) for treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional reconstructions improve the reliability, but not the accuracy, of fracture classification and characterization. The influence of three-dimensional <b>computed</b> <b>tomography</b> was much more notable for intraobserver comparisons than for interobserver comparisons, suggesting that different observers see different things in the scans-most likely a reflection of the training, knowledge, and experience of the observer with regard to these relatively uncommon and complex injurie...|$|R

Interestingly, a potential role of hepatic steatosis on complications after extrahepatic surgery remains unknown.
