40|$|In this study, {{computational}} {{methods are}} presented that compute ice accretion on multiple-element airfoils in specified icing conditions. The ¿Droplerian¿ numerical simulation method used {{is based on}} an Eulerian method for predicting droplet trajectories and the resulting droplet <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{on the surface of the}} configuration. Flow field and droplet <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> form input for Messinger's model for ice accretion. The droplet trajectory method has been constructed such that the solution of any flow-field simulation (e. g., potential-flow, Euler equations) can be used as input for the finite-volume solution method. On an unstructured grid the spatial distribution of droplet loading and droplet velocity are obtained. From these quantities the droplet <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> is derived. Of special interest in this study are the Supercooled Large Droplets (SLD). The simulation of SLD requires a specific splashing model. For a single-element airfoil a good agreement is found with the Lagrangian method 2 DFOIL-ICE and with experimental results. The comparison of the <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> predicted by both simulation methods is good for the smaller droplets. For larger (SLD) droplets the splashing and rebound models are a significant improvement to the <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> results when compared with the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} {{was focused on}} the dust particles ranging from 10 ìm to 2 mm around mining area. This fraction of coarse mining dust is considered to be non-respirable, therefore catch less attention than respirable dust. The necessity of the research were analyzed by doing a literature study, and dust collectors that could be available for the future study on coarse mining dust were listed in the report. Laboratory work was carried out to analyze the dust samples collected from residential area close to LKAB mining site. At last, a future plan was figured out to give guidance for the continuous further study on current subject. The conclusion of the literature study showed that there is an urgent need to start the study on coarse dust around mining area, and the inverted frisbee and marble dust collector are two promising ones with improved <b>catching</b> <b>efficiencies</b> on dust collection therefore should be further tested both experimentally and practically. The tested results from laboratory work showed the dust contains metals indicating the dust origin from mining site, and the particles from mining site are coarser than natural soil. The two significant dust sources in this mining site are the dam and the huge open pit. Lots of actions could be done for dust control purposes. And to improve the dust monitoring, a wind anemometer and a horizontal gauge should be added to the station where dust collected, and a more efficient dust collector of inverted frisbee is suggested to replace NILU collector. The future plan was compiled in three aspects including dust measurement, dust origin as well as dust generation, spreading and settling.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to empirically {{investigate}} the impact of human capital on economic growth according to Nelson-Phelps (1966), Lucas (1988) and Romer (1986; 1990) approachs. The Lucas approach and shared by neo-classical growth theory, assumes that growth is driven by the accumulation of human capital. It treats human capital like an ordinary input in the production function generating increasing returns of scale. Nelson and Phelps approach relates growth to the stock of human capital which affects a country´s ability to innovate and catch up which more advanced countries. According to Romer, human capital may directly influence productivity by determining the capacity of nations to innovate new technologies suited to domestic production. The analysis is performed on a panel of the 68 countries with differents levels of economic development and it was made separately to groups of countries classified by the World Bank like rich, medium income and poor countries. We use the stochastic production frontier analysis and the Malmqüist Index to separate the effects caused by gains in technological progress (displacement of the frontier) from the effects produced by enhanced <b>efficiency</b> (<b>catching</b> up with the frontier). The results obtained show that human capital factor contribute to the economic growth in differents ways like these ones above- mentioned. ...|$|R
40|$|A winter dredge {{survey of}} blue crab (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun) is {{conducted}} annually in Chesapeake Bay {{as a key}} element of a longterm, bay-wide population dynamics study. Removal experiments are performed routinely as part of this stratified random survey of the blue crab population. We present a method for estimating the <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the standard Virginia crab dredge used in the winter survey. Data from 88 experiments conducted between November 1992 and March 1995 were analyzed; up to 10 removals were completed in each experiment. Two models were used to estimate <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> for each experiment: 1) the Leslie model, and 2) a log-linear model in which it is assumed that a fixed proportion of crabs is removed in each sweep of the experimental area, allowing for an error term ε. We estimated the catchability coefficient (q) as a weighted mean of the point estimates from each experiment; its standard error was estimated with the jackknife method. The average catchability coefficients across years were 0. 16 (SE= 0. 01) for model 1, and 0. 15 (SE= 0. 02) for model 2.

The relationship between mortality and <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{for each type of}} dredge was also assessed. Our results showed significant differences for total direct mortality between the ND and both the GD and TD dredges.

It was also found that the damage to uncaught individuals is directly related to gear efficiency. The lower <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the ND (64 %) led to a higher proportion of damaged individuals being left in the dredge path, when compared with the more efficient GD (98 %) and TD (90 %) dredges.

After six fishing trials 12510. 1 g squid were caught totally. 7890. 3 g (n: 63) of these value was belong to green type of jig and 4619. 8 g (n: 39) squid were caught by red jigging line. Average catch weight of squids per trial was 2085 g. One way ANOVA revealed that for both jig types no significant relationship (p> 0. 05) was found between the means of groups. Fishing with squid jigging line is proposed to small-scale fisheries due to high price of squid, low by-catch, no requirements of complex fishing gears and having low cost. And the green types of jigs are found more efficient...|$|E
40|$|For {{collecting}} mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) {{the outdoor}} <b>catching</b> <b>efficiency</b> of {{four types of}} trapping devices baited with carbon dioxide (CO 2, 300 ml/min) was evaluated and compared in two areas of Tanzania. The types of traps employed were: the CDC miniature trap with the incandescent light bulb switched on or off; electric nets (ENT) and a Counterflow Geometry (CFG) trap. In Njage, south-east Tanzania, Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto was the most abundant of the seven mosquito species obtained, comprising of 74. 3 f the total number caught (n = 2171). In Muheza, north-east Tanzania, Culex quinquefasciatus Say was the predominant species (90. 9 €among 1080 caught. At both localities the CFG trap was superior to the CDC trap with light-on or light-off for sampling both An. gambiae and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Efficiency of the CFG trap and ENT were similar for sampling these species of mosquitoes (P > 0. 05). However, ENT was superior to the CDC trap with light-off for collecting both species. Significantly more (P < 0. 05) Cx. quinquefasciatus were obtained by the CDC trap with light-off than with light-on, especially outdoors. It is concluded that both ENT and the CFG are effective tools for sampling populations of An. gambiae and Cx. quinquefasciatus outdoors...|$|E
