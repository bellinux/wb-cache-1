5000|$|CRE produce <b>carbapenemases,</b> {{a form of}} β-lactamase. These enzymes cleave the β-lactam ring, an {{essential}} component of β-lactam antibiotics that are recognized by and bound to PBPs. <b>Carbapenemases</b> are divided into different classes, depending on the structure of the enzyme and the mechanism by which they hydrolyze the β-lactam ring. The two broad categories of <b>carbapenemases</b> are serine-carbopenemases, which contain serine at the active site, and metallocarbapenemases, which contain zinc at the active site. Class A <b>carbapenemases</b> are serine <b>carbapenemases</b> and are encoded on either the chromosome of the bacteria or a plasmid. A serine at position 70 at the active site of this class of enzymes is required for hydrolysis of β-lactams to occur. Class D <b>carbapenemases,</b> also referred to as the OXA β-lactamases, are serine β-lactamases. They are encoded on plasmids and contain a large variability in amino acid sequence. The resistance mechanism for class D <b>carbapenemases</b> is caused by the formation of an acyl intermediate when breaking the β-lactam ring. Class B <b>carbapenemases</b> are metallolactamases and require a zinc at the active site for hydrolysis.|$|E

Klebsiella pneumoniae <b>carbapenemases</b> (KPCs) and <b>carbapenemases</b> of the oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) type have been reported worldwide. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) <b>carbapenemases</b> were originally identified in Sweden in 2008 and have spread worldwide rapidly. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbapenemases</b> are {{a family}} of β-lactamase enzymes {{distinguished}} by their broad spectrum of activity {{and their ability to}} degrade carbapenem antibiotics, which are frequently used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections. <b>Carbapenemases</b> can be broadly divided into two different categories based on the mechanism they use to hydrolyze the lactam ring in their substrates. Metallo-β-lactamases contain bound zinc ions in their active sites and are therefore inhibited by chelating agents like EDTA, while serine <b>carbapenemases</b> feature an active site serine that participates in the hydrolysis of the substrate. Serine carbapenemase-catalyzed hydrolysis employs a three-step mechanism featuring acylation and deacylation steps analogous to the mechanism of protease-catalyzed peptide hydrolysis, proceeding through a tetrahedral transition state.|$|E

The gene for NDM-1 is one member of a large gene family that encodes beta-lactamase enzymes called <b>carbapenemases.</b> Bacteria that produce <b>carbapenemases</b> are often referred to in the news media as [...] "superbugs" [...] because infections caused by them are difficult to treat.

50|$|Gram-negative {{bacteria}} can develop and transfer β-lactam resistance (including carbapenem resistance) in many ways.

They can acquire genes encoding ESBL from environmental bacteria. They can increase the expression of chromosome-encoded β-lactamase genes (bla genes) due to regulatory gene and promoter sequence modifications. They can mobilize bla genes through integrons or horizontal transfer of genomic islands into other Gram-negative species and strains. They can disseminate plasmid-mediated <b>carbapenemases.</b> Finally, they can lower or even inhibit the expression of porin genes.|$|E
50|$|Three major {{classes of}} enzymes are {{involved}} in carbapenem resistance: class A <b>carbapenemases,</b> class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBL), and class D β-lactamases (OXA). The four known groups of class A <b>carbapenemases</b> are: SME (three types associated with S. marcescens), IMI (present in E. cloacae), GES (16 variants thus far found in P. aeruginosa predominantly but also found in K. pneumoniae and E. coli), and KPC (10 types of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase). At the UVA Medical Center, a transfer mechanism of KPC-dependent carbapenem resistance was discovered in the transmission of a plasmid carrying the transposon (Tn4401), which contains the KPC gene (blaKPC), to several bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter freundii. The class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are found largely in Gram-negative bacteria and environmental bacteria. The subclasses of MBL enzymes are B1, B2, and B3. MBLs have diverse enzymatic functions and {{have the ability to}} hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics. The class D β-lactamases (OXA), which hydrolyze oxacillin, provide {{a good example of the}} variety of mechanisms that can be used to transfer resistance. The blaOXA genes which encode OXA β-lactamases are found on both chromosomes and plasmids, and they have their natural reservoir in environmental bacteria and deep-sea microflora. Insertions in the vicinity of these genes have been shown to increase the strength of their promoters and increase resistance. Because of these characteristics, a wide geographic dissemination of OXA carbapenemase resistance in particular has occurred.|$|E

Whilst avibactam inhibits class A, class C, and, some, class D serine β-lactamases (such as KPCs, AmpC), it has been reported to be a poor substrate/weak inhibitor of class B metallo-β-lactamases, such as VIM-2, VIM-4, SPM-1, BcII, NDM-1, Fez-1.|$|E
5000|$|Between 2007 and 2011, the {{percentage}} of Escherichia coli isolates from Canadian hospitals that produce extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBL) increased from 3.4% to 4.1%; among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates ESBL producers increased from 1.5% to 4.0%. These strains are resistant to third generation cephalosporins that were developed {{for the treatment of}} beta lactamase-producing ‘’Enterobacteriaceae’’ and carbapenems are generally regarded as the treatment of choice. [...] More recently, many countries have experienced a dramatic upswing in the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceace that produce both ESBLs and <b>carbapenemases</b> such as the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). As of 2013, 70% of Greek Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates are resistant to third generation and cyclosporins and 60% are resistant to carbapenems. [...] The growing prevalence and difficulty of treating such multi-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceace has led to a renaissance of the use of antibiotics such as colistin, which was discovered in the 1950s but rarely used until recently due to unattractive levels of toxicity.|$|E

Class A and D enzymes have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism, while class B enzymes are metallo-β-lactamases that contain zinc in the active site. The class A carbapenemase group includes members of the SME, IMI, NMC, GES, and KPC families. Of these, the KPC <b>carbapenemases</b> are the most prevalent, found mostly on plasmids in Klebsiella pneumoniae. The class D <b>carbapenemases</b> consist of OXA-type β-lactamases frequently detected in Acinetobacter baumannii. The metallo-β-lactamases belong to the IMP, VIM, SPM, GIM, and SIM families and have been detected primarily in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, there are increasing numbers of reports worldwide of this group of β-lactamases in the Enterobacteriaceae.

40|$|<b>Carbapenemases</b> may {{be defined}} as β-lactamases that {{significantly}} hydrolyze at least imipenem or/and meropenem. <b>Carbapenemases</b> involved in acquired resistance are of Ambler molecular classes A, B, and D. Class A, clavulanic acid-inhibited <b>carbapenemases</b> are rare. They are either chromosomally encoded (NMC-A, Sme- 1 to Sme- 3, IMI- 1) in Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, or plasmid encoded, such as KPC- 1 in Klebsiella pneumoniae and GES- 2 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a point-mutant of the clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum β-lactamase GES- 1. The class B enzymes are the most clinically significant <b>carbapenemases.</b> They are metalloenzymes of the IMP or VIM series.
